When the games come to LA, I\u2019ll win all three.\u201d\n\nThe USC freshman shared his ambition to win the \u201cTriple Crown\u201d which in Track and Field refers to an athlete winning three significant championships.\n\nFrech was born with congenital limb differences that left him without most of his left leg and fingers on his left hand. Frech took a gap year to dedicate himself to rigorous training. His daily routine revolved around achieving his goal of winning Paralympic gold.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t done homework in over a year, so it\u2019s getting back and relearning how to study and do work,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything I was doing in my day was directed towards the goal. It was sleep, recovery, immediately getting up, meditation, lots of visualization, bodywork, training, weightlifting. We had so much moving.\u201d\n\nThe 19-year-old athlete began attending USC in the fall as a business of cinematic arts major in the Marshall School of Business. He grew up in Los Angeles and previously competed in track at Brentwood High School.\n\nFrech jokingly recalled missing the first few weeks of his class and emailing his professors about his absence. For him, choosing USC was a strategic decision aligning his academic aspirations with his athletic goals.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other track program in the country that has the same legacy that USC track and field has, and that\u2019s part of the reason I chose USC in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nHe will compete in high jumps for USC Track and Field for the 2025 season. The most-represented sport for USC, Trojan Track and Field has had a storied history at the Olympics.\n\nOne of USC\u2019s fields is named after decorated athlete Allyson Felix who holds a record of 20 World Championship medals and 11 medals at the Olympic Games \u2014 including seven golds. As of 2024, USC track and field has now earned a gold medal in eight of the last nine Summer Olympics.\n\nFrech\u2019s goal for now: Make it to the NCAA Regionals for the West and the World Championship in India next year.\n\nIn regards to his recent victory, Frech sees this as a moving part in the grand scheme of things.\n\n\u201cThis whole Paralympic Games just felt like destiny,\u201d he said. \u201cIt felt like there was some otherworldly force pulling me to accomplish this task, because my bigger purpose goes beyond sports, and I needed this in order to accelerate this larger vision.\u201d\n\nIncreasing representation and accessibility\n\nNow that Frech is on a college campus, he has one thing in mind: improving advocacy for people with disabilities. He said USC already sets a strong example.\n\n\u201cUSC is an extremely accessible campus, even at a very foundational level, in regards to wheelchair accessibility around campus \u2014 USC is top-notch,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier this month USG passed a disability inclusion bill to further the development of programming and infrastructure on campus for students with disabilities.\n\nBut Frech knows accessibility goes beyond just physical infrastructure. His advocacy is about increasing visibility and ensuring that disability is recognized as an integral part of conversations about diversity and representation.\n\nWhile Frech uses a prosthetic leg, not a wheelchair, he recognizes the privilege that comes with his disability and how it enables him to advocate for those with more severe conditions.\n\n\u201cBecause of the nature of my disability, I was able to infiltrate into mainstream sports with my friends, so I played whatever sport was in season all growing up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case for a majority of the community who have more severe disabilities, and then even the ones that do integrate at a certain point space experience a lot of discrimination, and then end up falling out and not participating.\u201d\n\nFrech co-founded Angel City Sports over a decade ago, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that provides free adaptive sports for people with disabilities. Now that he\u2019s on campus, he hopes to expand the organization\u2019s efforts, leveraging his time and resources to further advocate for inclusivity in sports.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a wheelchair, you can\u2019t just roll up to the YMCA and jump in a pickup game,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need a specific chair, which is extremely expensive, and a specific game set up for you. So these barriers to entry make it really hard for 15% of our population with a physical disability. To participate in sports, and my philosophy is sports as a human right, and so we break those barriers down, we provide access to the community year-round.\u201d\n\nFrech\u2019s goal is to show individuals with disabilities that sports participation is not just a dream \u2014 it is possible. He aims to be a role model for the next generation, inspiring them to be active and live life to the fullest.\n\nFrech, the man behind the athlete\n\nFrech\u2019s journey goes far beyond his gold medals and record-breaking jumps. For him, sports have always been a gateway, but his larger purpose is about changing the narrative around disability representation.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have anyone in the mainstream media with a physical disability to look up to growing up,\u201d Frech said. \u201cI want to be that person for the next generation. I want the little kid in a wheelchair or the girl missing her arm to turn on the TV and see someone like them. That\u2019s unbelievably powerful.\u201d\n\nFrech sees his Paralympic triumphs as just one step in a broader journey.\n\n\u201cAthletics is definitely not all that I want to do,\u201d Frech said. \u201cI want to use the platform I\u2019ve built through track and field to create lasting change for the disabled community.\u201d\n\nFrech also posts explainer videos on his Instagram and TikTok to promote disability awareness and transparency surrounding his condition and ability to compete in track. He dubs himself the \u201cOne leg man\u201d and normalizes his disability through day-in-the-life style videos.\n\nHis philosophy? Dream big and believe in your potential. It\u2019s a mindset, he says, that propelled him to where he is now.\n\n\u201cSet high goals. Believe you\u2019re capable of achieving them. Greatness doesn\u2019t just happen \u2014 it\u2019s something you pursue relentlessly,\u201d he said.\n\nNavigating a new beginning at USC\n\nFollowing his record-breaking performance at the 2024 Paris Paralympics, Frech has now embarked on a new journey: navigating his freshman year at USC.\n\n\u201cMy academic goals were at first, just get caught up after, after missing the first few weeks,\u201d Frech said. \u201cMy first day of class was great. I brought the medals with me to show all my teachers, just to give them some real proof, proof, evidence that I actually was there.\u201d\n\nFrech has embraced the challenges of balancing academics with his rigorous athletic schedule. He said his favorite class so far is Global Narratives on Illness and Disability because it resonates deeply with his experiences competing abroad with a disability.\n\nFrech\u2019s transition to college life may be anything but typical, but his resilience and positive attitude are setting the stage for continued success \u2014 both on and off the track.\n\nHe acknowledges that his experience won\u2019t be the usual one, given his packed schedule filled with sponsor events, media appearances, and athletic commitments.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m developing a great group of friends. I\u2019ve got amazing people around me. I think that it\u2019s kind of cool to just be a normal college student,\u201d Frech said. \u201cI know that I\u2019m not going to have the quintessential or typical college experience so, when I\u2019m on campus and with my friends, I\u2019m trying to appreciate those moments.\u201d\n\nCalling his college experience \u201cnot typical\u201d might be an understatement. Frech has already become somewhat of a campus celebrity.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty crazy. I was getting recognized. If I was going from class to class, I was taking four to five photos, which is awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone sees me on campus, feel free to ask for a photo. Say, \u2018Hi.\u2019 I\u2019m not mean.\u201d\n```"}

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson)\n\nBy Terence Holton\nOctober 08, 2024 at 3:44 pm PDT\n\nWe are somehow already nearly halfway through the 2024 college football season. This has been an unprecedented year, with conference realignment turning the college football world upside down, throwing West Coast teams all across the country and moving southern teams to the even deeper south. Those changes, whether they be smart choices or not, have recorded the hierarchy of power conferences. Some have become stronger, while others have faltered, so I thought it would be fun to rank the current power conferences halfway through the year with an outlook on their future.\n\n\u201cIt just means means more\u201d: SEC\n\nEven after a crazy weekend that saw multiple top SEC teams go down \u2014 including a historic win for Vanderbilt when they took down then-No.1 Alabama \u2014 the SEC still has the deepest and best conference. Nothing is more infuriating when ESPN\u2019s Paul Finebaum runs his mouth on how the SEC is the greatest conference ever and that \u201cit just means more\u201d down south when it comes to college football. Unfortunately, it\u2019s just hard to disagree with him. The SEC is still the juggernaut it has been in the past, plus it added two of the greatest college football programs of all time in Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the Associated Press top 10 this week: No. 1 Texas, No. 5 Georgia, No. 7 Alabama, No. 8 Tennessee and No. 9 Ole Miss. One could argue that the Big Ten has Ohio State, Oregon and Penn State ranked No. 2 through No. 4, but Oregon and Penn State just have too many question marks at this point in the season.\n\nThe SEC gave us the game of the year when Alabama took down Georgia in a thriller where 17-year-old freshman wide receiver Ryan Williams won the game for the Crimson Tide on a 75-yard reception with under three minutes to play.\n\nLooking forward, the SEC still is a recruiting juggernaut and has some of the top NFL prospects in future years, such as Williams, Tennessee\u2019s redshirt freshman quarterback Nico Iamaleava, South Carolina\u2019s freshman edge rusher Dylan Stewart, and the golden child himself, Texas\u2019 redshirt freshman quarterback Arch Manning, the nephew of NFL legends Eli and Payton Manning. The SEC has the future figured out. College football runs through the South, and it is just a fact of life.\n\nThough I ball my fists in frustration when I see Finebaum on ESPN parading the SEC around like it was his child that just won a beauty pageant, he\u2019s right. It just means more.\n\nRough and Tumble Football: Big Ten\n\nThe Big Ten is a good conference. Not a great conference. It is a really solid conference with a few teams who can be great, with a bunch of consistently good teams. Currently, there are six ranked teams in the Big Ten, with Ohio State and Oregon at the top, heading for a top-three showdown later this week.\n\nThe rest of the Big Ten is really hard to rank internally, as there are a bunch of teams that are interchangeable. If only USC was considered a top team in the conference, but how can you stack the Trojans up against an undefeated Indiana who hasn\u2019t played as hard a schedule, but looks much stronger?\n\nIt\u2019s a good conference, with a bunch of solid, hard-nosed football teams, but the top is incomparable to the SEC. For example, if you stack up the third-best SEC team with the third-best Big Ten team, it would be Alabama against Penn State. One of those was just the top-ranked team in the nation and it wasn\u2019t the Nittany Lions.\n\nThe Big Ten will always be rumbling, bumbling, run through a guy\u2019s face football, and maybe it can evolve with the new West Coast teams, but unless it changes its style of football, it will always be a close second to the SEC.\n\nPlayoff Contenders but not much else: ACC\n\nThat opening title might be a little misleading. It makes it seem like the ACC has some real superpower teams, but in reality, it\u2019s just two teams who will contend for the conference while everyone else pulls up the rear.\n\nMiami and Clemson are both legitimate contenders to make the College Football Playoff not just as auto-bid conference champions but as one of the at-large teams. Clemson is a confusing team, as Georgia steamrolled the Tigers in Week One, but have looked fantastic ever since.\n\nMiami has consistently looked like the best team in this conference, but has shown its flaws at times. The Hurricanes are led by senior quarterback Cam Ward, who is looking like a mid-season Heisman contender, on top of the deadly running back combo of junior Damien Martinez and freshman Jordan Lyle. The offense is potent and can put up points on anybody.\n\nClemson is still led by head coach Dabo Swinney and junior quarterback Cade Klubnik, and both are underwhelming. Still, the defense is a strong point.\n\nSidebar: Clemson was the only school that does not require post-graduation military service to also not land a single player in the transfer portal.\n\nThe rest of the conference has been filled with utter disappointments. Virginia Tech, which many thought was a dark horse to win the conference, lost in Week One to Vanderbilt. NC State was poised to make a run at the title and then Tennessee hung 59 on them without breaking a sweat. Then comes North Carolina, which allowed James Madison to score 70 points on it at home.\n\nThe conference has a strong top, but a poor foundation. Any architect will tell you that\u2019s a poor recipe for success.\n\nWomp Womp Womp: Big 12\n\nThe title of this conference is that of a sad trombone noise. This conference REEKS. It stinks, there is no team that looks particularly strong. The conference is filled with a bunch of mid-tier teams fighting for a first-round playoff bye.\n\nUtah, Oklahoma State, Arizona and Kansas State were all supposed to be contenders, but they\u2019re all just plain mediocre. Utah has dealt with injuries and Arizona lost its coach after last season, but Kansas State and Oklahoma State are just flat-out disappointing.\n\nCurrently, the two teams fighting for the conference title are BYU and Iowa State. What??? They are fine teams, but they are nothing special and definitely not teams worthy of a playoff appearance let alone a first-round bye.\n\nHere is a list of teams who would win the Big 12 this year: The entire SEC(minus Mississippi State and Florida), the top half of the Big 10, the top of the ACC+Notre Dame, and last but not least, whoever wins the Mountain West this year.\n\nThe Big 12 is so bad that nearly any other Power Conference team would make them look like a bunch of eighth graders on the field.\n\nSo there you have it, not much has changed in the college football landscape. Though it was destined to make various cross-continental powerhouse conferences, it has just reinforced the big bad SEC as the top dog.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/10/08/review-linkin-park-marks-their-comeback-on-a-high-note-amid-tragedy-and-controversy/", "response": "```\nReview: Linkin Park marks their comeback on a high note amid tragedy and controversy\n\nA mainstay for angst-filled teenagers in the 21st century, Linkin Park\u2019s return after a seven-year hiatus makes it seem like they\u2019re back for good. But not without addressing some important issues first.\n\nLinkin Park has returned after a seven-year break. The band debuted their new vocalist, Emily Armstrong (third from the right), and some fans aren\u2019t happy about it. (Photo by James Minchin III)\n\nBy Juuso M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4nen October 08, 2024 at 12:55 pm PDT\n\nWhat band comes to mind when you think of \u201cnu metal?\u201d If you\u2019re anything like me, chances are high that your mind conjures up the name \u201cLinkin Park.\u201d Even though bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit and Slipknot had achieved mainstream success before Linkin Park had even struck their first record deal, the band\u2019s debut album \u201cHybrid Theory\u201d out performed all the records of commercial success that were also out at the time. Released in October 2000, \u201cHybrid Theory\u201d was the best-selling album of the next year. It has sold over 32 million copies worldwide over its lifetime.\n\nNu metal, the mixture of metal music and hip hop, has always had a controversial reputation, but there\u2019s no denying that \u201cHybrid Theory\u201d remains a legendary album. The success of \u201cHybrid Theory\u201d is due to many reasons, but one of the biggest is the unique voice of the lead singer, Chester Bennington. Bennington joined the band two years after its founding in 1999, however while he was a member he struggled with severe depression and substance addiction. He remained with the band for the next 18 years before tragically ending his life. For millions of fans all over the world, his death was an enormous tragedy. It was the end of Linkin Park, because Chester Bennington was Linkin Park. Or, at least that\u2019s how it felt to fan for years.\n\nOf course, Bennington was not the only reason for Linkin Park\u2019s success. Many people cite Mike Shinoda, one of the band\u2019s founding members, rapping abilities to be equally as important as Bennington\u2019s vocals. But, without Bennington\u2019s high-pitched vocals on heart-rending songs such as \u201cOne Step Closer,\u201d \u201cCrawling\u201d and \u201cPapercut\u201d the tracks just wouldn\u2019t have felt the same. With Bennington, the band released multiple other records \u2013 all gaining mainstream success, as well. The group has inspired many other bands over time, including the Grammy-nominated group Bring Me the Horizon, but still no equivalent to the Californian ensemble has emerged.\n\nSince the hiatus, rumors and questions have come and gone about the possible return of Linkin Park. Most of the time Shinoda\u2019s answer was the same. That now \u2018wasn\u2019t the time,\u2019 and that they \u2018hadn\u2019t worked out the emotional and creative math for that.\u2019 However, in the spring of 2024 this all seemed to change. Billboard reported in April that Linkin Park planned to return with a new female vocalist. By August, the band launched a 100-hour countdown until their return on their website. Still, after the first countdown was over, they launched another. And finally, on September 5th Linkin Park hosted a live-streamed concert where they not only announced their return but also confirmed a new lead singer, Emily Armstrong. They announced a tour starting in Inglewood, California on September 11th.\n\nBefore the concert, the band faced a lot of controversy because of their new lead singer. Part of that hate was misogynistic, which the internet is full of nowadays. Some people couldn\u2019t stand the fact that the band had chosen a woman to replace Bennington. However, there were other \u2013 much more serious \u2013 things to consider. Emily Armstrong was strongly criticized for her connections with the Church of Scientology and for her perceived support of convicted rapist, actor Danny Masterson. One of the most outspoken critics about Armstrong\u2019s debut was Bennington\u2019s son, Jaime Bennington. Bennington blasted the band online for \u201cerasing his father\u2019s legacy\u201d and \u201cbetraying the trust of the fans.\u201d Later, Armstrong posted a statement in response to Bennington\u2019s comments, saying that she made a mistake trusting Masterson, who she previously considered to be her friend. Although she didn\u2019t comment on her connections with the Church of Scientology or what she thinks about the strong opposition towards psychiatry by scientologists, Armstrong posted that she hadn\u2019t been in touch with Masterson after the conviction. \u201cTo say it as clearly as possible: I do not condone abuse or violence against women, and I empathize with the victims of these crimes,\u201d she wrote.\n\nFor me, a 90s baby, Linkin Park\u2019s comeback was something I never thought would happen. \u201cHybrid Theory\u201d was one of the first albums I ever bought with my own money, and I still believe that \u201cIn the End\u201d is one of the greatest rock songs ever recorded. It\u2019s a perfectly moody composition that tells the perfect, sad story. Or, so it felt to me when I was a tween living in Finland. The lyrics are a little bit banal, but that\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary for rock music. Actually, one of the strengths Linkin Park has shown is their ability to embrace the banality of their songs. They don\u2019t care about what the haters say, and I can proudly say that \u201cIn the End\u201d is perfect just as it is.\n\nThat\u2019s why I wanted to see Linkin Park\u2019s comeback concert. It was the first time I have ever had the chance to see the band perform live. I had mixed feelings walking into the Kia Forum on September 11. I wanted to see the new start of Linkin Park, and if the songs could give me the same feeling they did when I was a teenager. I also wanted to see if the band would address the controversies on stage.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve seen the show, I can honestly say that I have rarely experienced such a strong feeling of nostalgia as the concert offered to me. The opening song \u201cSomewhere I Belong,\u201d swept me away, and for the next two hours I couldn\u2019t do anything more than enjoy the feeling of watching my favorite childhood band perform in front of a live crowd for the first time in seven years. Armstrong\u2019s vocal performance was great. She didn\u2019t try to be \u201cnew Chester.\u201d She performed the songs in her own style, and made them sound like they were her own. The whole band, especially Shinoda, who did most of the talking during the show, seemed to be overwhelmed by the fact that there was a sold out arena chanting for Linkin Park once again.\n\nWhen the piano lead of \u201cIn The End\u201d began to play, I felt goosebumps. Based on the concert it has become clear to me that Linkin Park has found itself again. After all the ups and downs, the band has a clear future ahead of them \u2013 without Bennington. Still, there are obstacles ahead. Shinoda, Armstrong and others can\u2019t ignore the strong criticism they have gotten. At some point, it may be wise for them to address the situation, and even try to make peace with Bennington\u2019s family. That was a key element that was missed during their comeback concert. Maybe it wasn\u2019t the right place and the right time.\n\nLinkin Park will release their new album \u201cFrom Zero\u201d in November 2024. During the concert, Shinoda made it clear that this is the new start of the band. However, if they really care about their fans, the \u201cnew start\u201d should be accompanied by honesty about the situation with Armstrong. Their transparency could make Linkin Park as meaningful of a band to the next generations as it was to me \u2013 and not just a controversial nostalgia act.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Call Her Daddy)\n\nBy Isobel Smith October 07, 2024 at 10:12 pm PDT\n\nIn a rare long-form interview, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke to \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d host and \u2018founding father,\u2019 Alex Cooper, for a podcast episode released Sunday.\n\nOver the course of 40 minutes, the two covered topics ranging from abortion access and economic proposals to Harris\u2019 relationship with her mother. At the outset, Cooper reveals she was told \u201cno topic was off limits,\u201d allowing for a wide range discussion of important issues for her audience \u2014 the so-called \u2018Daddy Gang\u2019 \u2014 and more generally, young women in America.\n\nHarris has been criticized for her lack of media appearances, particularly long-form interviews. This appearance is the first of many this week, as she\u2019s slated for 60 Minutes, Howard Stern\u2019s radio show, \u201cThe View\u201d and \u201cThe Late Show\u201d with Stephen Colbert.\n\nAs Cooper herself states, she is \u201cnot CNN [or] FOX,\u201d and \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d is not a typical platform for a presidential candidate to appear on. Her podcast started in 2018, primarily discussing sex and relationships, but has since matured \u2014 known for hosting celebrities in a comfortable, casual setting, through which she has developed a friendly, conversational style.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be real, I\u2019m probably not the one to be having the fracking conversation,\u201d Cooper said in a disclaimer clip that preceded her complete interview with Harris. \u201cBut the conversation I know I am qualified to have is the one surrounding women\u2019s bodies and how we are treated and valued in this country.\u201d\n\nCooper noted that she reached out to Donald Trump about appearing on her podcast, as she is aware that this is not \u201ca one-sided conversation,\u201d and her audience is of mixed political partisanship. She even goes as far as to extend an additional invite to Trump: \u201cIf he also wants to have a meaningful, in-depth conversation about womens\u2019 rights in this country, then he is welcome on \u2018Call Her Daddy\u2019 anytime.\u201d\n\nOne of many striking moments during the conversation between Cooper and Harris was the discussion of abortion access. Harris revealed she was the first vice president or president to have ever visited a reproductive healthcare clinic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about IVF treatments and access... access to contraception, which is very much at risk,\u201d Harris said. \u201cYou know what those clinics also do? They do paps, they do breast cancer screenings, they do HIV testing and they\u2019re having to close in many places with these bans.\u201d\n\nThe vice president recounted a \u201cheartbreaking\u201d conversation with the mother and sisters of Amber Thurman, a woman who died after doctors delayed treatment out of fear they would be prosecuted under Georgia\u2019s abortion restrictions.\n\nThe two discussed exceptions to abortion bans, which often include to save the life of the mother. In Thurman\u2019s case, it wasn\u2019t enough. Harris said this life of the mother exception means \u201cpublic health policy that says a doctor, a medical professional, waits until you\u2019re at death\u2019s door before they give you care... where is the humanity?\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Former President Donald Trump\u2019s comments claiming democrats support late term or even after-birth abortions in their recent debate, Harris said, \u201cthis guy is full of lies.\u201d She says words matter, and that she\u2019s always been aware of this.\n\n\u201cAs a prosecutor, I understood that the words that I spoke and what I did with those words would be the difference between whether somebody was charged with a crime or went to prison,\u201d Harris said. And later, as Attorney General, \u201cthat the words I spoke could move markets.\u201d\n\nShe also criticized Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, for his comments about \u201cchildless cat ladies.\u201d Harris, herself a stepmother, said she felt it was a mean-spirited sentiment.\n\nShe pushed back against comments made by Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders last month about Harris\u2019 lack of biological children: \u201cThis is not the 1950s anymore. Families come in all kinds of shapes and forms and they\u2019re family nonetheless.\u201d\n\nHarris intends to support families through a number of policies she mentioned at the end of the interview, ranging from child tax credit, to $25,000 in downpayment assistance for first-time home buyers.\n\nHarris\u2019 appearance on \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d was a chance to speak directly to the young women of America, and she did so by leaning on personal experience.

Around 200 people attended the vigil, which took place at Hahn Plaza in front of Tommy Trojan.\n\n\u201cWe try to turn tears into joy. We try to turn darkness into light,\u201d Rabbi Dov Wagner, the director of USC Chabad, said in an interview with Annenberg Media before the event. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about those we\u2019ve lost and mourn for those we\u2019ve lost, but we\u2019ll also look with hope towards the future and pray for peace.\u201d\n\nOn October 7, 2023, Hamas launched an attack on Israel, killing approximately 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages. Over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza according to the Associated Press. Vigils and protests have taken place around the world to honor the memory of the victims.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Jewish community to remember, to mourn and to hope for peace in our world,\u201d USC Hillel wrote in an Instagram post promoting the vigil.\n\nAs the sun set by Tommy Trojan, Dave Cohn, the executive director of USC Hillel, took the stage, opening the ceremony and inviting student speakers to join him. Students, USC Chabad leaders and other community members crowded around the stage, many wearing Israeli flags and other symbols of cultural pride. Some attendees wore necklaces to commemorate the lives of those lost on October 7 and those held as hostages by Hamas.\n\nAs the event unfolded, students, many with direct ties to Israel and the attack, shared personal testimonies.

She said he survived the attack and was found seven hours later, hidden under the bodies of his peers. Though he survived, many friends of hers did not, she said.\n\n\u201cSome of my friends were burned alive at their army bases while their last seen footage was blasted as a Facebook post,\u201d Echo said. \u201cThis experience isn\u2019t just shared amongst the Israeli people, it\u2019s the experience of the international Jewish community as a whole. The interconnectedness of the global Jewish network has made this deeply personal for all Jews.\u201d\n\nPrior to the vigil, Dave Cohn explained that the losses from the October 7 attack are \u201cnot distant tragedies to most Jewish people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not getting any simpler, it\u2019s not getting any more peaceful. That\u2019s an incredibly difficult reality to cope with,\u201d Cohn said.\n\nAlongside the student speakers, attendees shared their experiences in interviews with Annenberg Media.\n\n\u201cToday is not about politics,\u201d Clarissa Rosen, a sophomore cinema and media studies student and a member of USC Chabad and Hillel said. \u201cIt is not about the Israeli government, it is not about Netanyahu or Palestine. It is about honoring lives lost and remembering the hostages that are still in captivity.\u201d\n\nSince the attacks last year, the Israel Defense Force has waged war with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in recent Israeli attacks on Lebanon, according to the country\u2019s health ministry.\n\nUSC Students for Justice in Palestine, Divest from Death USC, Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation at USC and Jewish Voice for Peace USC held a walkout earlier in the day. While there was no organized counter-protest to the vigil, two onlookers chanted \u201cFree, free Palestine\u201d repeatedly toward the beginning of the event.\n\n\u201cI think the Jewish people that come together here honor life, and we honor our community, and that has been consistent throughout this whole time,\u201d Mason Platt, a junior studying political science, said. \u201cYou\u2019ll never see us chanting anything negative against the other side.

Do some research on the events happening in the Middle East ... and hone in on that, because I think it\u2019ll make people come together.\u201d```"}

The walkout, while peaceful, disrupted campus entrances and left some students stuck outside of USC.\n\nThe event was organized by a coalition of student groups including USC Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), Divest from Death USC, the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation at USC and Jewish Voice for Peace at USC. A post circulated on Instagram asking participants to join and \u201cdemand USC to cut ties with genocide.\u201d\n\nA USC Marshall graduate and media liaison for SJP, who requested anonymity, told Annenberg Media that the goal of the event was to remind USC of the group\u2019s presence. \u201cWe\u2019re here today to mark that day, to honor our martyrs,\u201d the liaison said. \u201cThere\u2019s no business as usual during a genocide,\u201d she continued. \u201cOctober 7 did not happen in a vacuum. It was the result of decades of occupation.\u201d\n\nOn October 7, Hamas, a militant group designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., launched an attack on Israel, killing approximately 1200 and taking 250 more as hostages, according to the Associated Press. In the year since, over 41,000 have been killed in Gaza by Israel in response to the attacks, according to the United Nations Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza. Recently the conflict has escalated to neighboring countries, including Yemen and Lebanon.\n\nMembers of USC SJP shared opening remarks addressing the reasons behind the walkout. \u201cThe horrors are countless. One year of air strikes on schools, libraries, bakeries, refugee camps, ambulances, universities, neighborhoods, mosques and churches. One year of men, women and children torn to pieces [by bombs],\u201d a spokesperson, who didn\u2019t identify themself, said. \u201cWe will continue fighting for our demands of social liberation until all our people are free.\u201d\n\nA sign at the walkout organized by Pro-Palestinian student groups on October 7, 2024(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nUSC Department of Public Safety (DPS) officers were already waiting at Trousdale Parkway\u2019s entry before the group gathered for the walkout. Students attempting to enter campus through the gate were turned away by DPS and redirected to other entrances. At around 12:20 p.m., after roughly an hour of speeches from SJP members, the walkout began marching toward McClintock Avenue, aiming to complete a lap around the entire perimeter of campus.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s continue shutting things down... until we get to all the gates on campus,\u201d the unnamed march leader shouted through a megaphone. Each campus gate closed for entry as the march passed. Attendees chanted \u201cstudent intifada,\u201d an Arabic phrase for a rebellion or uprising, while drumming on buckets. One student waved the Palestinian flag. \u201cGlory to the martyrs,\u201d \u201cSteadfast until liberation\u201d read some signs.\n\nParticipants at the walkout organized by Pro-Palestinian student organizations on October 7, 2024. (Photo by Samantha Lee)\n\nWalkout members in yellow vests redirected traffic, forcing cars to turn away from intersections so the march could occupy the center of the road. Several passing cars and public buses cheered and honked at marchers, while Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and DPS vehicles patrolled Exposition Boulevard. DPS had planned to increase its presence on campus in preparation for today, Annenberg Media reported last week. DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said he expected officers stationed throughout places of worship and LAPD support on campus.\n\nPolice gated and guarded Tommy Trojan, and LAPD cars were stationed on Exposition Blvd to monitor the march as it passed. \u201cWe are not going to intervene in demonstrations or take sides in any way,\u201d Carlisle said.\n\nSecurity Ambassadors, who check students in using their IDs at each of the gates, said they were unaware of the walkout taking place. ID-based check-in has been required at all campus entries since May when encampment protests on campus led to heightened security. Armed and unarmed officers guarded campus from inside the USC gates.\n\n\u201cUSC doesn\u2019t have a great relationship with South Central and the local region anyways, and so they\u2019ve just further militarized campus and made it a very unsafe and unwelcome place,\u201d the SJP liaison said. \u201cSo we\u2019re trying to break down those barriers, not physically, but just [by] connecting with our community again.\u201d\n\nMembers of SJP said they feel that USC hasn\u2019t handled the protests or the call for divestment in a peaceful manner. During the opening remarks, an SJP member said that USC has \u201ca chance to stand on the side of justice, on the side of our people, but they refuse. In fact, our administration has only heightened their tactics of repression instead of hearing their students call for divestment.\u201d\n\nParticipants at the walkout organized by Pro-Palestinian student organizations on October 7, 2024.

Marchers were told by SJP members not to engage with any media or police.\n\nToday\u2019s walkout remained peaceful, and LAPD and DPS did not use physical force against the protest\u2019s participants. This year, SJP hosted a sit-in at New Student Convocation, a candle-lit vigil grieving Palestinian losses and a walkout to demand \u201cdivestment, liberation, and return,\u201d among various other events. SJP has two other events planned this week \u2013 an art workshop set for Tuesday and a study-in on Wednesday.\n```"}

USC and members of the Los Angeles community are hosting events to honor and remember those affected with walk outs and speeches.\n\nA consortium of five pro-Palestinian student-led organizations at USC, including Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), USC Graduate Students for Palestine, USC Divest from Death, USC Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation (S.C.A.L.E.) and Jewish Voice for Peace USC, are hosting a \u201cWeek of Rage\u201d over the course of three days this week to protest the ongoing war.\n\nOn October 7, Hamas, a militant group classified as a terrorist organization by the U.S., launched an assault on Israel, killing around 1,200 individuals and abducting 250 hostages, as reported by the Associated Press. Since that date, Israeli military responses have killed 41,000 Palestinians, according to the United Nations Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza.\n\nOn Monday, a walk out for \u201cone year of genocide, one year of resistance,\u201d according to the USC SJP Instagram page, took place at 11:30 a.m. Participants walked with signs for roughly two and a half hours on the streets surrounding USC, briefly blocking traffic and campus entry.\n\nOn Tuesday, October 8, the same coalition of organizations will hold an \u201cart workshop, political education, and art auction\u201d from 6 to 9 p.m. at the University Religious Center courtyard. The events will conclude on Wednesday, October 9, with a study-in for Palestine where students are encouraged to do their homework together.\n\nSome students feel that these events are not enough to bring awareness. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s a year late for those conversations. It\u2019s a year late for those things to be corrected,\u201d said a senior studying business administration who requested anonymity due to fear for their personal safety. \u201cI, in this past year, have just been focused on doing any type of action that I can to bring other people into awareness, and I feel an immense amount of shame and guilt being a part of this institution...\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s Hillel, a center and organization for Jewish students, also hosted a vigil on October 7 at Hahn Plaza near Tommy Trojan. Beginning at 5:15 pm, the event aimed to allow attendees a place to grieve and share stories. The event is hosted in partnership with Trojans for Israel, USC Chabad, USC Tikvah, USC Dornsife, USC Shoah Foundation and the Hebrew Union College Jewish Institute of Religion.\n\n\u201cI think the events like the vigil are really important because I think it\u2019s the time for us to all come together, be able to mourn together,\u201d said Naya Pollack, a junior majoring in economics and finance who is planning on attending the event. Pollack said her family friend was wounded at the Nova Festival.\n\n\u201cI think today is still a really hard day, because it just feels like we\u2019re stuck on October 7, 2023, and I think everyone today is still grieving from [the hostages],\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also think that today and the vigil, I think it\u2019s going to show everyone and remind how strong and resilient our community is.\u201d\n\nIn the greater Los Angeles area various events will take place to honor the anniversary. The Jewish Federation Los Angeles will be hosting L.A. Remembers at the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills. Doors will open at 6:30 pm and the event will officially begin at 7:30 pm. The event will feature speeches from family members of the hostages and a candle-lighting ceremony. Expected attendees include actress Mayim Bialik, Israeli performer Raviv Kaner, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Congressman Brad Sherman of California\u2019s 32nd District. The event will conclude at 9 pm.\n\nIfNotNow will also be hosting \u201cEvery Life a Universe\u201d at Gloria Molina Grand Park from 6 to 8 p.m. The event will honor both Israeli and Palestinian life, according to the website, as organizers \u201ccall for an end to the Israeli government\u2019s genocidal assault on Gaza, and to our own government\u2019s enabling of it.\u201d Organizers encourage attendees to wear white.\n\n\u201cI think stuff like the vigil and other stuff that was happening are really important and a good safe space for everyone to grief and be reminded of those who passed and who aren\u2019t here anymore,\u201d Pollack said.\n```"}

The walkout began at 11:30 a.m. with nearly a hundred people gathered at the Trousdale entrance to campus. For nearly two hours, students marched around the perimeter of campus, some holding signs, some wearing keffiyehs in honor of Palestinian lives lost.\n\nLast Oct. 7 is when some 1,200 Israelis were killed, and about 250 kidnapped, during a surprise attack on Israeli soil by Hamas militants. Dozens of people are still being held by Hamas as hostages.

We\u2019re fighting against so many different struggles at once, and most of all, we\u2019re fighting for Palestinian life and liberation.\u201d\n\nProtest organizers also said they want for USC to divest from financial interests that may benefit the Israeli military. The ongoing conflict has divided the USC community since last year, when student protesters set up encampments and dozens were arrested. Some students have since reported feeling unsafe co-existing with other people\u2019s beliefs and opinions.\n\nJackson Tavel, a junior studying aerospace engineering, watched Monday\u2019s walkout take place. He said last year\u2019s protests affected his studies and access to campus. \u201cAll this kind of went down in the middle of finals, and so I had to figure out a place to study,\u201d Tavel said. \u201cI think that if we had handled things differently ... there would have been a better solution.\u201d\n\nCesar Ticreno, a sophomore studying philosophy, politics and law, said he supported the students\u2019 right to protest. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really good thing that students and maybe even faculty are able to do this, especially at an institution like this,\u201d Ticreno said.\n\nOct. 7 memorial observances are being held around Los Angeles.

(Photo by Malcolm Caminero)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler\nOctober 07, 2024 at 5:07 pm PDT\n\nThe MPSF West is far above every other conference in collegiate water polo. The last time that one of these teams\u2014USC, UCLA, Cal and Stanford\u2014did not win the NCAA Trophy was in 1997 when the Pepperdine Wave came out victorious in double overtime against the Trojans. It has been much of the same this year, with UCLA, USC and Stanford leading the charge and Cal close behind.\n\nThis was the first week of MPSF conference play, and the Trojans had a game first against the California Golden Bears and then against the Stanford Cardinals. In the first game, USC played three-and-a-half great periods of water polo before they slowed, but the Bears could not capitalize early enough and fell 16-13. It was a great game from fifth-year 2-meter captain Max Miller, who netted five goals \u2013 three of which in the third frame of play.\n\n\u201cOne of our goals this season is to treat the second half of the game as a new game,\u201d said Miller. \u201cI think approaching it that way and kind of starting fresh like the score is 0-0... coming out with that energy, I think just really solidifies that win.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans had one statistic that was a major problem: they had 16 exclusions. \u201cI need to figure out how they earned double ejections,\u201d said Coach Marko Pintaric. \u201cWe need to fix that for tomorrow because Stanford plays [an] aggressive game, and we don\u2019t want to give up so many ejections.\u201d\n\nAndrej Grgurevic, who had a hat trick of his own, also agreed with Coach Pintartic. \u201cIt\u2019s just us being lazy in defense,\u201d said Grgurevic. \u201cWe get fired up after a goal and then get too aggressive over the top or just lazy coming back, causing our guards to get two ejections early. So that\u2019s something we really have to nail tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhen day two against the Cardinals rolled around, they did limit ejections (only giving up nine man-up opportunities to Stanford), however, found a new problem: the crossbar. In what could only be described as very unlucky, the Trojans\u2019 shots kept finding pipe in the first quarter and were kept off the scoreboard. Meanwhile, the Cardinals looked as if they could not miss and netted five goals before USC was able to find their first.\n\nIt was a great game from Stanford net-minder West Temkin, who finished with ten saves, numerous of which were point-blank. Despite a hat trick from Long Beach State transfer Robert L\u00f3pez Duart\u2014now the topscorer for the squad\u2014USC fell 8-6 against Stanford, who will undoubtedly be the newly ranked No. 1 team.\n\nThe Trojans will look to bounce back from their second loss of the season in an exhibition match against Cuesta on October 11th at 11:00 am.\n```"}

USC\u2019s redshirt sophomore outside hitter Adonia Faumuina then got things started for the Trojans with her first cross-court kill. A three-point run led by USC freshman outside hitter Jadyn Livings from the service line put USC ahead of Minnesota early.\n\nAn assertive kill down the line by Faumuina erupted the Galen Center fans and gave USC the momentum in the beginning of the set.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure we thank the fans,\u201d head coach Brad Keller said. \u201cThere were a lot of really young, energetic, enthusiastic fans in there that are really gravitating towards what we\u2019re doing here and I can\u2019t thank that enough.\u201d\n\nIt was a battle of the pins from both teams in set one. USC graduate outside Ally Batenhorst was hot from the pin with two kills, putting up a .250 hitting percentage. But Minnesota redshirt senior opposite Lydia Grote would keep the score even with a solo block against Batenhorst, while also getting two quick kills.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s redshirt senior setter Melani Shaffmaster \u2014 known for her tricky setter dumps \u2014 caught the USC defense off guard and tipped the ball with force to the back corner of the USC side. The Gophers forced a USC timeout as they took a 20-17 lead in set one.\n\nAn attacking error by Minnesota\u2019s junior outside Julia Hanson, however, then put USC on top 1-0, getting the 25-23 win in the first set. Attacking was outstanding for USC as they hit .286 to Minnesota\u2019s .108.\n\nFaumuina opened up set two by finding her spot in the cross court and continuing to make her presence known in a newly updated outside position. The dynamic duo for the Gophers, Grote and Shaffmaster, were connecting in set two to keep them even with the Trojans at 9-9.\n\nThe Minnesota duo were the only two hitting above .000 for the Gophers as the team struggled to get its offense going. An unexpected hit from the right side by Tuaniga excited the crowd at Galen Center and gave USC a 19-17 lead in the second set.\n\nHowever, Shaffmaster and redshirt junior middle blocker Kali Engeman were able to put set two away for the Gophers with a block against Faumuina, 25-22. The match tied 1-1.\n\nScrappy and defensive plays started the third set at the booming Galen Center and Trojan redshirt freshman middle blocker Leah Ford was able to shut down Shaffmaster\u2019s setter dump attempt, putting USC up 7-2 against Minnesota.\n\nAll the momentum stayed on the Trojan\u2019s side, with an aggressive kill from the middle by Ford followed by an beaming ace from junior libero Gala Trubint. The Gophers struggled on getting their offense going in the third set, hitting at -.200.\n\nBlocking by USC increased and added pressure on the hitters for the Gophers, shutting them down from every option. USC went up 14-5 as the Trojans hit an exceptional .667 as a team.\n\nUSC rolled past the Gophers in set three 25-11. It was an offensive shutout for the Trojans, as Batenhorst and Faumuina were up to double-digit kills at that point to put the match at 2-1.\n\nShaffmaster continued to fight for the Gophers and started set four with a setter dump to the middle court. The Gopher setter was a crucial player for Minnesota, leading her team in hitting percentage and assists with 28.\n\nThe USC outsiders put on a show for the fans in the Galen Center in the fourth set. Livings joined the double-digit kill club and allowed USC to spread its offense and put pressure on the Gopher defense.\n\nThe underdog USC Trojans secured the win with a dominant block by Batenhorst to finish the set 25-19. It was a big and meaningful win for the Trojans as a team.\n\n\u201c[Faumuina and I have] been on this team for three years,\u201d Tuaniga said, starting to tear up. \u201cThis is the first time we are really playing with each other. This is family right here.\u201d\n```"}

Over the last decade, there\u2019s been a surge in demand for products that cater to dietary restrictions such as gluten-free, grain-free, and paleo-friendly options.\n\nSiete, founded by the Garza family in 2014, has rapidly gained a loyal following for its range of grain-free tortillas, tortilla chips, and sauces, and is known for using nutrient-dense ingredients like almond flour and cassava. Veronica Garza, Siete\u2019s co-founder, was diagnosed with multiple autoimmune diseases, including lupus, and to combat her health struggles, she began to use food as medicine. She tested recipes alongside her mother to create their first product, an almond flour-based tortilla, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really trust PepsiCo with gluten-free products considering that they\u2019ve made so many bad food options that have caused severe health issues,\u201d said Seeran Ajemian, USC alumna who also has an autoimmune disease. Ajemian was 19 when she was diagnosed with Hashimoto\u2019s disease and has since adopted a gluten-free diet to reduce inflammation and ease her symptoms of fatigue and brain fog, along with medication that she will take for life. Siete products have been a staple in Ajemian\u2019s diet because of the difficulty in finding high-quality and reasonably priced gluten-free products.\n\nOwned and managed by seven family members, Siete has tried to build itself as a clean-label company but some loyal consumers raise concerns that the deal could dilute the grain-free tortilla chip maker\u2019s brand, with recipe changes or a move away from its founding mission. Claire Fogarty, a food blogger of @Clairecancook and who has been gluten-free and dairy-free for nine years, has been buying Siete products since 2015.\n\n\u201cWith the family business story on the back of the packaging, it always felt like a personal brand,\u201d Fogarty said. \u201cI\u2019m happy for the family that now they are able to achieve their dreams and have this payout, but I\u2019m sad to see this smaller business go to such a large giant in the market.\u201d Fogarty said she also has concerns about the brand\u2019s future and if product lines will change or if her favorite product \u2014 churro strips \u2014 will be dropped.\n\nFunctional medicine practitioner Julia Paul said she will be closely watching how the merger unfolds to make sure she is continuing to offer her clients products that are healing instead of harmful. \u201cSiete is a brand I love and recommend for its clean standards, so while it\u2019s great that it might become more accessible and affordable, we need to stay alert for any potential changes to their ingredients in the coming months,\u201d Paul said.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell if the Siete-PepsiCo deal is a new industry trend, but as weight loss drugs like Ozempic change consumer preferences for healthy offerings, mergers and acquisitions like this one might pick up, according to Gerard Hoberg, finance and business economics professor at USC Marshall. \u201cThe goal is lifestyle changes to sustain the weight loss which could feed a push toward healthier offerings more broadly,\u201d Hoberg said, who added he sees the acquisition as a positive opportunity for Siete especially because of the potential synergies between Siete Foods and PespiCo.\n\n\u201cDeals like this often make sense even without a higher-looking strategy like \u2018going healthy\u2019 as Siete\u2019s brand portfolio is very attractive and Pepsi surely can greatly ramp up distribution given their very strong distribution network,\u201d Hoberg said. Increased distribution can also be important to Siete\u2019s strategy. PepsiCo may aid Siete\u2019s expansion to places like Mexico, which would have remained untapped for the small business, Hoberg said.\n```"}

(Photo by Alice Chiang)\n\nBy Alice Chiang\nOctober 07, 2024 at 1:29 pm PDT\n\nEating kimchi is like encountering a lively friend that shakes you awake. The vibrant flavors of chili, garlic, and sourness parades into the mouth and leaves a lasting first impression. Each satisfying crunch further launches a ripple effect, sending the spice and warmth throughout the mouth. The chili heat slowly intensifies, its tanginess traveling gradually to the cheeks and across the body. The aftertaste is an umami delicacy \u2013 a dynamic, spicy acidity that leaves one wanting more.\n\nFor many years, Korean cultural delicacies have been making its appearances in multinational dining tables. I experienced this first hand when my 81-year-old Taiwanese grandmother began adding kimchi into her stir fry dishes, referencing her favorite K-drama stars, Rowoon and Lee Min-Ho, eating kimchi in their dramas.\n\nWith the purpose of enhancing cross-cultural understanding of kimchi, the yearly \u201cKorea Kimchi Festival\u201d was held in L.A.\u2019s Seoul International Park, from September 26th to September 27th. But the highlight of each day was the afternoon, when festival attendees gathered together in the central plaza to experience Kimjang, or the traditional practice of making kimchi together.\n\nWoo Kim, the CEO of W Korea, the PR advertising firm for the festival, said it was his personal highlight to see 80 local middle school students and their teacher make kimjang on the first day. \u201cIt was very amazing because they don\u2019t know much about the process of making kimchi, but they had a lot of fun and really enjoyed the taste of their kimchi,\u201d said Kim.\n\nHistorical Significance of Kimjang\n\nDeveloped out of necessity, kimchi was made to sustain communities during the cold winter months, when vegetation cannot be grown. It started as a way to preserve vegetables for the winter months. Batches were typically made during late autumn after the first snow, when cabbage and radishes are typically the sweetest.\n\nDuring the Joseon era, the practice of kimchi making was solidified. Neighbors and families, specifically women, gathered to help each other make kimchi and shared tips and tricks. It became a way for communities to bond and support one another. During this time, variations of kimchi also developed, with coastal towns adding fermented fish into their dishes.\n\nA key revolution in kimchi making occurred during the late 16th century, when Portuguese traders from Japan introduced chili peppers to the nation, and led to the development of now-popular spicy kimchi. With modern refrigeration, though the practice of kimjang is no longer as widespread, it is still integral to Korean culture and practiced at times during holidays or breaks.\n\n100+ vendors, all for the 2 day event\n\nAccompanying the kimchi-making festivities are more than one hundred vendors selling a wide assortment of Korean products, ranging from the Mixsoon bean essence that went viral on Tiktok in 2023, to Nakiji-Bokkeum, a marinated spicy Korean octopus side dish, and packs of frozen Yachaeyeon, the traditional vegetable based Korean pancakes.\n\nAll vendors had a special story about how they made their way to the festival. Frank Kim is a L.A. local selling raw fish products. He was wearing a red apron, standing in the middle of the row of shops, inviting visitors to his stand. \u201cI am actually here for my mother in law,\u201d Frank explained, \u201cI live in L.A., but I am here to support her... It is fantastic to provide an opportunity to the Korean community and the surrounding community an opportunity to try specialties from Korea.\u201d\n\nMany vendors traveled across the Pacific Ocean to table at the festival, bringing with them their brand specialties. Jason Kim happily introduced the jeotgal to me when I asked him what it was out of curiosity. The jeotgal is a marinated spicy octopus side dish that can be added to a dish to enhance its flavor. He explained that he was recruited through his university, Hanyang University. As a sponsor of the festival, the university opened applications for students to help out. When asked whether he would be back next year for the festival, he said, \u201cI love L.A. and I come to L.A. twice a year, so I will be back.\u201d\n\nEunju Kim, a manager for ECOJ Goods, was the last person I interviewed. She had a smile on her face when I approached her stand, filled with a variety of packaged baked goods from Jeju Island. Among them was a madeline-like pastry made from the island\u2019s mandarin oranges (or hallabong). She highlighted the importance of the Korea Kimchi Festival to their brand. \u201cThe Korea Kimchi Festival is the largest festival for Korean goods of the year in L.A., making it really important for [the company] to come,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Korea Kimchi festival is an opportunity for the Korean community in L.A. to get a taste of Korea that may not be otherwise available throughout the year. It is also an opportunity for people of all walks of life to experience first-hand the unique foods integral to Korean culture.\n```"}

The school walkout and protest were organized by March For Our Lives Iowa in reaction to a school shooting in Perry, Iowa, in which a 17-year-old killed a sixth-grade student and wounded seven other people before authorities say he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\n\nBy Aden Max Juarez and Liam Wady\nOctober 07, 2024 at 1:16 pm PDT\n\nWith the election less than 40 days away, young voters are upset about the decrease in conversation about gun control despite the continuous mass shootings across the country. According to a poll from the Pew Research Center, 56% of registered voters consider \u201cgun policy\u201d to be an important issue, a lower percentage than the economy, healthcare, and Supreme Court appointments. In another poll from the Southern Provost Law Center, younger generations aged 14-30, 74% believe that gun violence is a problem in America.\n\nAlthough the national political conversations surrounding gun control have diminished, it continues to be on some young voters\u2019 minds with 408 mass shootings happening just this year, including the recent mass shooting of a Georgia high school that left four individuals dead and nine injured.\n\n\u201cI feel like a lot of young people, especially in the media, have become really desensitized to these types of incidents,\u201d Ruby Belt, a freshman studying political science, said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to live in a world where this is normal.\u201d\n\nBelt was a member of Students Demand Action while in high school and said she\u2019s disheartened by politicians not recognizing the root of mass shootings being guns. She first got involved in politics when she was in sixth grade following the Parkland high school shooting.\n\nEver since Parkland, there have been many highly covered mass shootings, including the Robb Elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.\n\n\u201cI think the reaction to that was a lot bigger than [other] recent school shootings,\u201d she said. \u201c[Uvalde] was refreshing to hear people talk about it as much as they did given the fact that other incidents aren\u2019t really talked about as much.\u201d\n\nElijah Ikem, a sophomore studying psychology, said that the Uvalde shooting is still a pervasive topic in his home state of Texas.\n\n\u201cIt was like shots heard around the state,\u201d Ikem said. However, Ikem believes that the media cares more about getting clicks than spreading awareness about mass shootings, especially in light of the recent shooting in Birmingham, Alabama that left 4 people dead and 17 injured.\n\nIkem said that he believes the Birmingham shooting \u201cshould be covered\u201d in the same way as the Uvalde shooting as both were \u201ctragic situations.\u201d\n\nDakota Driemeyer, a junior studying law, history, and culture, emphasizes further on this point, saying \u201cthe ones with the higher casualties are the ones who are portrayed [more] in the media.\u201d\n\nEloise Dumas, a freshman studying film and TV production, lived in Germany for a few years and said that even when she was abroad, she was aware of gun problems in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI was always just kind of upset by how preventable it all was,\u201d Dumas said. \u201cI feel like it would be so easy for there to be legislation to prevent this. At what point can you not call it like a surprising tragedy anymore?\u201d\n\nGermany, like most other developed countries, doesn\u2019t give its citizens the right to bear arms, unlike in the United States which enshrined that right in the second amendment.\n\nOn September 26, the Biden administration announced two executive orders to combat gun violence. One of the orders addresses the threat of ghost guns while another is committed to improving active shooter drills in schools.\n\nDespite this, some students believe that other policy changes should also be taken to increase measures to prevent mass shootings.\n\n\u201cI feel like an assault weapons ban is the next logical step given that [they are] the weapon most commonly used in [mass shootings],\u201d Belt said. \u201cHowever, obviously, there\u2019s a gun lobby, and they\u2019re making sure that that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nDriemeyer said he thinks the media should focus more on America\u2019s mental health crisis than on firearms.\n\n\u201cI think we immediately start blaming the firearm and not the maniac behind it,\u201d Driemeyer said. He continues by saying that he wants there to be more availability for mental health services and for schools to have more resource officers to prevent violence from ensuing.\n\nDumas said that regardless of the number of casualties or injuries from a mass shooting, the incident is always tragic.\n\n\u201cI was just kind of saddened that this is the state of our country,\u201d Dumas said. \u201cYeah, I feel like I\u2019m giving up a little bit which is very upsetting.\u201d\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/10/07/usc-esports-merger-a-new-era-for-esports-at-usc/", "response": "```\nUSC Esports Merger: A New Era for Esports at USC\n\nTwo student organizations combine to form one at USC, to promote competition and community for esports.\n\nOn Friday, September 27th, USC Esports took to Instagram and Discord to announce their merger.\n\nBy Patrick Zhang October 07, 2024 at 12:12 pm PDT\n\nTrojan Esports and SC Esports announced on Friday, September 27, 2024, that they are merging to form USC Esports, revitalizing the discipline on campus. For years USC has had two esports clubs, with conflicting thoughts about how the discipline should operate at USC. With this merger, instead of two independent entities planning and hosting their own events, all esports and gaming events will be centralized, allowing for easier access.\n\nInitial Conflicts: Since the conception of esports at USC, there has never been a consensus on what the discipline should look like. For years now, the USC esports community has been split between two student-run clubs, SC Esports and Trojan Esports.\n\nOn one hand, Trojan Esports, believed that esports should be all about competition, fielding multiple Varsity and JV teams in titles like Overwatch 2, League of Legends, Valorant, and other competitive franchises. On the other hand, SC Esports was primarily focused on casual and community, as well as career, hosting speaker panels and casual meet-ups.\n\nWhile talks have \u00ab been in the works for many years, \u00bb according to Aubrie Cole, Vice President of the newly created USC Esports, \u00ab [all attempts] fell through repeatedly because of differences of e-boards and what people [wanted]. \u00bb Despite both clubs\u2019 best efforts at reaching an agreement, differences in vision and goals led to a disconnect that prevented a solution from being reached for many semesters.\n\n\u00ab Historically, our orgs had conflicts...they happened long before I got accepted into USC, \u00bb said Lawrance Lui, Co-President of USC Esports. Due to conflict that originated from the previous e-boards, the two student-run organizations stayed separate until recently.\n\nSolutions and Resolution: As reported by Annenberg Media USC\u2019s slow start to register clubs at the beginning of the semester led to many student-run organizations being unable to host official events early in the semester. However, this provided a golden opportunity for Trojan Esports and SC Esports.\n\n\u00ab [...]with the issues going on with RSO...this might be a good time for a merger, \u00bb Aubrie Cole stated. Due to the slow progress of registering student organizations, Aubrie Cole, Camryn Lee, the other Co-President of USC Esports, and Lawrance Lui, put their differences aside and came together as one on Friday, September 20th, merging Trojan Esports and SC Esports into a fresh new club with a united vision of the discipline: USC Esports. The merger was then announced on the 27th.\n\nCamryn Lee states that marketing efforts are focused on Conquest right now, which is a USC vs UCLA rivalry event taking place in late November. In addition to Conquest, monthly events such as watch parties and industry events are in the works.\n\nA Bright Future for Esports at USC: One concern that Joseph Jacko, Program Director of Esports at USC, had was that freshmen were unable to be involved in esports, as the two club system was confusing and often led to many potential community members being turned away and losing interest.\n\n\u00ab My personal goal and goal for the club,\u201d stated Jacko, \u201cis to have [the club] handle the activities themselves and allow them the space to do so. \u00bb \u00ab Esports has had a reputation of not being the most welcoming space for women, \u00bb said Camryn Lee. \u00ab I want to create an accepting space through USC Esports so that more students feel encouraged to get involved. \u00bb\n\n\u00ab I think it feels especially fulfilling to me that Aubrie and I get the privilege of being in positions of leadership this year for the merged org, so that other women students can see us and feel confident that the esports community here will welcome them, \u00bb the Co-President added.\n\nAubrie Cole expressed that USC Esports is \u00ab planning on doing a lot more non-esports events, maybe mixers and dinners \u00bb to promote the club as not just a place of competition, but a safe space to make new friends.\n\nNow that USC Esports is united under one banner, it would seem that getting involved with the discipline on campus has become much more accessible, ensuring that current alongside new members may pursue their competitive and/or casual esports interests in a safe and healthy environment.\n\nThe recent promotion of USC to the BIG10 alongside the merger adds new opportunities for everyone to pursue their esports passion at USC, at the highest level.\n\nLawrance Lui has some concluding remarks for everyone: \u00ab Watch our weekly streams, our teams play Monday to Thursday. \u00bb```"}
{"key": "/2024/10/07/with-season-three-industrys-stock-soared/", "response": "```\nWith season three, \u2018Industry\u2019s\u2019 stock soared\n\nThe London-set high finance drama reached new heights with its latest outing.\n\nBy Jack Hallinan\nOctober 07, 2024 at 11:03 am PDT\n\nThis review contains minor spoilers for \u201cIndustry\u201d season three.\n\nOnce you start watching \u201cIndustry,\u201d good luck avoiding all-out obsession. For season three, HBO moved the British-produced drama to its primo weekly Sunday night slot, once inhabited by the likes of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cSuccession,\u201d the kinds of shows that received both intense critical acclaim (minus season seven, in \u201cThrones\u201d case) and commercial success. But up until this season, \u201cIndustry\u201d occupied sleeper-hit territory. It had critics\u2019 approval, but as of a year ago, I was hard-pressed to find anyone else who had watched it. In fact, even I was a catch-up viewer, having binged seasons one and two in summer 2023 \u2014 a year after season two\u2019s airing.\n\nThe show\u2019s creators, Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, had never made a feature film or TV show before \u201cIndustry,\u201d and initially, their lack of professional experience showed \u2014 in the best way possible. Much in the same way a debut album includes every provocative idea the artist has had in the first part of their life, season one felt experimental. Its two creators had clearly spent hours discussing not the plot they would portray, but rather the cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 camera placements, the ambient electronic score and the generally drug-addled vibe.\n\nThe second outing had a bit more polish around the edges and narrative through-lines that lasted from episode one to episode eight, but it still focused on mid-20s characters trying, and often failing, to prove themselves in a cutthroat financial arena. It\u2019s a world that \u201cIndustry\u201d makes feel real with little difficulty, as Kay and Down worked in banking right out of university before jumping ship to try their luck as filmmakers. The show isn\u2019t autobiographical, but of course it\u2019s helplessly inspired by their experience of working in an old, affluent and culturally immobile institution as young people.\n\nThe series wrestles with questions of company culture and the degree to which Harper (Myha\u2019la), Yasmin (Marisa Abela) and Rob (Harry Lawtey) adapt to what their bank, Pierpoint, expects of them. One has to assume Kay and Down grappled with those ideas themselves.\n\nIn GQ\u2019s great profile of the duo, writer Daniel Riley pontificates that what makes the creators\u2019 journey fascinating is not how two former financiers became HBO showrunners, but rather how \u201ctwo budding television makers were somehow allowed to become bankers.\u201d And in season three, viewers are left wondering something similar: why do these people persist with working in this brutal world where even an upwardly mobile salesperson can be made to feel insignificant in the company of aristocracy and real social power? That sobering inquisition drives season three and pushes \u201cIndustry\u201d into new territory.\n\nKay and Down\u2019s debut creative showcase has always had plenty to recommend it, but the core concept of \u201cIndustry\u201d as a bildungsroman is where the show shines, even in season three when its characters\u2019 ostensibly have grown into their jobs. The show\u2019s third outing functions as a reset. Harper finds herself at a new firm fetching coffee and setting meetings for an uninspiring boss. Yasmin now sits next to Eric (Ken Leung) in Harper\u2019s old seat, and needs to print business for the first time in her career. Rob finds himself helping lead a green-energy IPO after experiencing two mentors\u2019 deaths. Even the ever-competent Eric has just made partner at Pierpoint, but exposed himself to a new level of corporate bureaucracy in the process, while also dealing with a divorce.\n\nAs each of the show\u2019s main crew have moved into new situations and roles, there\u2019s no longer time for waffling in the way season one occasionally sat in low-stakes situations (even though the show has always made each moment feel impossibly high-stakes). And waffle, Down and Kay do not. Season three tears through plot at a furious pace, taking the audience through an insidious web of finance, tabloid media and British politics that it becomes starkly clear exists to maintain power\u2019s status quo.\n\nSeason three slithers its way into the upper crust of British society, setting the tone in episode one when Henry Muck (Kit Harrington) \u2014 the CEO of the green-energy company Lumi \u2014 invites Yasmin into the basement of a men\u2019s member-only club where he and his lordly uncles are playing fives. In that moment, the viewer understands that we\u2019ve been introduced to a new level of wealth and influence.\n\nAfter years playing the deeply earnest Jon Snow, Harrington delights in his newest role as an aristocratic heir cosplaying as an entrepreneur trying to drive real change. The \u201cThrones\u201d vet displays real comedic and satirical chops and his presence helps unlock the show\u2019s journey into new spaces in a believable manner.\n\nSarah Goldberg, most recently of \u201cBarry\u201d fame, also joins Harrington as an addition to season three\u2019s main cast, playing Petra Koenig, a new mentor and foil to Harper. On another show, adding a high-profile duo to an already large ensemble might derail the balance of character work, but in the writers\u2019 and the editing rooms, Down and Kay led an impressive balancing act, using the Henry and Petra characters like black truffle on pasta, adding just enough complexity to the equation without overpowering the dish.\n\nLeung dominates the season with his performance as Eric, bringing the character to both the lowest and highest places we\u2019ve seen him in his life dedicated to Pierpoint, often within the same episode. And the elements that have always made the series great \u2014 its bang snap dialogue, delicious camera work, Nathan Micay\u2019s score and bold story choices \u2014 continue to provide \u201cIndustry\u201d with a high floor for success while still shooting for the stars.\n\nThankfully for its loyal viewers, \u201cIndustry\u201d will return for a fourth season after HBO announced its renewal before the season three finale had even aired. Plus, the network signed Down and Kay to a three-year exclusive overall deal, meaning they might get their mitts on other HBO shows. Now that they\u2019ve directed a couple \u201cIndustry\u201d episodes, could we see the pair direct for another series, \u00e0 la \u201cGirls\u201d creator Lena Dunham shepherding the \u201cIndustry\u201d pilot?

(AP/Ryan Sun)\n\nBy Daniel Palmore October 06, 2024 at 8:32 pm PDT\n\nINGLEWOOD, Calif. \u2014 Close losses have defined the season so far for the Los Angeles Rams. Outside of week two\u2019s loss against the Arizona Cardinals, the Rams can point to a few plays in each game that defined the outcome. The same can be said for Sunday\u2019s loss against the Green Bay Packers, a team also trying to get back on track following a week four defeat.\n\nThe game did not start well for the home team. After going three and out on their opening drive, the LA defense surrendered a two-yard rushing touchdown to Green Bay running back Josh Jacobs. Jacobs\u2019 first rushing touchdown of the year was set up by a 53-yard play in which quarterback Jordan Love connected with wide receiver Jayden Reed in triple coverage.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 offense turned the ball over on downs on its following drive, but eventually found a groove. With 9:47 left in the second quarter, a one-yard rush touchdown from running back Kyren Williams capped off a 13-play, 55-yard drive. With the score tied, the Rams\u2019 defense began to settle in. Safety Jaylen McCollough intercepted Love deep in Green Bay territory and scored to give the Rams a 13-7 lead with 2:02 remaining in the half.\n\nThe Rams ended the half with the lead after Green Bay\u2019s Grayden Narveson made a 46-yard field goal as time expired. On LA\u2019s opening drive of the third quarter, it looked like they were going to build on their small lead. However, the momentum shifted as Williams fumbled the ball and the Packers recovered at their 23-yard line.\n\nOn the ensuing drive, Love connected with tight end Tucker Kraft for a 66-yard touchdown. \u201cFor me it\u2019s an attention to detail kind of thing. I have to be better,\u201d Williams said postgame. \u201cThe most important thing is to wrap the ball up and I didn\u2019t do that. I think I just need to be better with my attention to details in those situations.\u201d\n\nGreen Bay extended its lead further after quarterback Matthew Stafford threw an interception to safety Xavier McKinney, his fifth in five games with Green Bay. The Packers cashed in the Rams\u2019 mistake once again and extended the lead to 24-13 after a seven-yard touchdown catch from Kraft, his second of the game.\n\n\u201cThat was kind of my main option on that play,\u201d Stafford said. \u201c29 just did a nice job overlapping and it looked like he just read it well. I obviously put a little too much on it.\u201d\n\nAfter both teams exchanged punts, the Rams got the ball back and cut the lead to five following a one-yard touchdown catch by Demarcus Robinson. The Rams attempted a two-point conversion and failed, keeping the score 24-19 with 3:30 left in the fourth.\n\nLos Angeles earned the stop it needed on defense and set its offense up with a chance to complete a game winning drive. But LA was unable to capitalize as the Rams turned the ball over on downs for the second time of the day and saw their losing streak extend to two going into their bye week.\n\n\u201cThis was a tough one because I thought we had a good week of preparation,\u201d head coach Sean McVay said. \u201cThere were some turnovers that really cost us. This doesn\u2019t feel good right now, but I like the fight in this group.\u201d\n\nThe loss was the fourth game of the year Los Angeles lost by one score. The Rams have struggled to find consistency on offense without star wide receivers Cooper Kupp and Puca Nacua. In the absence of a true number one receiving option, Stafford and the Rams have been held under 20 points in three out of their five games so far this season.\n\nLuckily for the Rams, they are targeting a week seven return for Kupp, but do not have a date set for Nacua. Defensively, Los Angeles stepped up against this Green Bay offense, holding them two points under their season average of 26 points per game. McCollough\u2019s touchdown was the first defensive touchdown of the season for Los Angeles and the first interception of the rookie\u2019s career.\n\n\u201cI was just in the right place at the right time,\u201d McCollough said. \u201cAll week we were scheming on their chipper protection, so it was just a great play by BY (Byron Young) and great pursuit by the d-Line.\u201d\n\nThe Rams can look forward to a much-needed bye week and give injured players more time to rest before resuming play at home against the Las Vegas Raiders on Oct. 20.\n```"}

(Photo by Desirae Ridley)\n\nBy Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier October 06, 2024 at 6:53 pm PDT\n\nWith Dedeaux Field still under construction for another year, the USC baseball team announced this past week that it will hold 24 of their 29 home games at Great Park in Irvine and the remaining five games at Page Stadium on the campus of Loyola Marymount. Last year, the Trojans split games between Great Park, Page Stadium and UC Irvine\u2019s Cicerone Field. Like the 2024 season, all USC home games will \u201cbe free and open to the public.\u201d\n\nUSC will also have 27 road games as part of its 2025 schedule as it transitions conferences from the Pac-12 to the Big Ten. This season, USC will face off against seven teams who made the 2024 NCAA Tournament. The Trojans will play 11 teams that they played in 2024 and among those repeat opponents, USC posted a 12-10 record against those teams last year.\n\nUSC opens the season at home with a three-game series against George Washington from February 14-16. Its first midweek games are against UCI \u2014 who made the NCAA Tournament despite losing to the Trojans twice last year \u2014 at Cicerone Field on February 18. The following night, USC hosts CSU Bakersfield at Page Stadium before flying out to Rice from February 21-23.\n\nUSC will then play the first of two visits to Cal State Fullerton on the 25th, then facing the Titans at Goodwin Field on March 11. Last season, USC swept the season series against the Titans, beating them twice on the road.\n\nIn partnership with UCLA, the Trojans will host UConn and Vanderbilt, who both made the NCAA Tournament last year, on February 28 and March 1 respectively at Great Park, before facing the Bruins in a non-conference game the following day at a location that has yet to be determined. Last year, UCLA won the final two games of the three-game Crosstown Showdown series in Westwood.\n\nTwo days later, the Trojans face UC Santa Barbara at Page Stadium. Last year, the Gauchos were the No. 14 Seed in the NCAA tournament before falling in the regional final to Oregon, which should make for a competitive matchup for the Trojans.\n\nUSC then heads back down to Irvine to take on Oregon, USC\u2019s first Big Ten conference slate, from March 7 to 9. Last year, USC dropped two games to the NCAA Tournament-bound Ducks in Eugene before winning the series finale and the team\u2019s round robin matchup of the Pac-12 Tournament in Scottsdale.\n\nThe Trojans then make their first trip into Big Ten territory to face Michigan in Ann Arbor from March 14-16. The Trojans hosted the Wolverines last season at Page Stadium and lost 8-5.\n\nNext, USC takes on a former Pac-12 foe in Arizona State \u2014 now in the Big 12 \u2014 in Tempe two days later. The Trojans faced the Sun Devils last year in Tempe as well, but only managed to win the series finale, with ASU winning the first two games that weekend.\n\nUSC then comes home to host Nebraska in Irvine \u2014 one of three Big Ten teams to make the NCAA Tournament in 2024 \u2014 from March 21 to 23 and will host UCI at Page Stadium two days later.\n\nUSC then heads to Bloomington for a three-game series with Indiana, who also made the NCAA Tournament last year, from March 28 to 30.\n\nThe Trojans open up April with a game on the first against San Diego State at Great Park before hosting Ohio State in Irvine for three games starting April 4. Last year, the Buckeyes beat USC 5-2 in Mesa, Arizona as part of the MLB Desert Invitational.\n\nThe Trojans will then play LMU at Page Stadium on April 8. Last year, LMU beat USC 5-3 at Page Stadium.\n\nUSC then travels to play at Penn State from April 11-13 before coming back to LMU to host Hawaii on the 15th and Gonzaga in Irvine for three games starting on the 17th. The Trojans walloped the Bulldogs last year 15-3 in Spokane in a non-conference matchup.\n\nUSC then pays a visit to Long Beach State on April 22. The Trojans and Dirtbags split their season series last year, with USC winning the first game and LBSU winning the rematch.\n\nThe Trojans stay on the road to face Minnesota from April 25-27 and CSUN on the 29th.\n\nUSC then will host rival UCLA for the Crosstown Showdown, which will take place at Great Park from May 2-4, with the Trojans thirsting for revenge after losing the series last year.\n\nAfter, the Trojans travel to UCSB for the rematch with the Gauchos two days later.\n\nUSC\u2019s final homestand will consist of hosting Michigan State from May 9-11 and CSUN at Page Stadium on May 13 before ending the regular season at Washington from May 15-17. Last season, the Trojans swept the Huskies at Great Park.\n\nShould USC be one of the eight highest ranked teams in conference play at the conclusion of the regular season, they will be invited to the Big Ten Tournament at Charles Schwab Field in Omaha, Nebraska. The tournament will take place from May 20-25 and the winner receives an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nLast season, USC went 31-28 overall and 17-12 in Pac-12 play, good for fourth place in the conference. After one of the worst starts in team history, the Trojans started to show improvement during conference play and clawed their way to the final of the Pac-12 Tournament, but fell to Arizona on a walk-off base hit to lose 4-3 and did not earn an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nAfter the season ended, head coach Andy Stankiewicz, who is entering his third season in charge, announced that Sean Allen would replace Seth Etherton as the team\u2019s pitching coach. Allen brings Big Ten experience to the USC coaching staff, as he spent the past two years with Ohio State.\n\nUSC\u2019s first pitch as a Big Ten member will be February 14, when the Trojans host Georgetown at Great Park to start their 2025 campaign.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/10/06/usc-womens-soccer-dominates-oregon-for-sixth-straight-win/", "response": "```\nUSC women\u2019s soccer dominated in its Senior Day matchup against Big Ten opponent Oregon on Saturday, earning a 2-0 win. The Ducks struggled through the game\u2019s entirety against a commanding Trojan performance on both sides of the ball. In the first half, USC was in complete control with the majority of possession and recorded 15 shots to Oregon\u2019s two. The Trojans opened the scoring in the 18th minute through senior forward Maile Hayes, who scored off her own rebound after the initial shot deflected off the post. The Trojans continued to dominate and put pressure on the Ducks during the second half. The game tilted even further in USC\u2019s favor when in the 60th minute, a USC counterattack led to a one-on-one between Hayes and Oregon\u2019s redshirt junior goalkeeper Maddy Goldberg. To prevent Hayes from scoring her second, Goldberg came out of the box and fouled Hayes, resulting in a red card. Three minutes later, Hayes doubled her tally when she finished off a cross received from senior forward Simone Jackson to put USC ahead 2-0. The USC attack never took its foot off the gas and finished the match with 31 shots compared to the Ducks\u2019 three. Despite Goldberg\u2019s six saves \u2014 putting her at eighth among Oregon\u2019s all-time save leaders \u2014 the Oregon defense struggled to cope with a relentless Trojan offense. On the defensive side of the ball, USC completely shut down an Oregon offense that\u2019s only real opportunities came on counterattacks from a rare error on the ball by USC defenders. Graduate goalkeeper Laurence Gladu was also a key to USC\u2019s success with her three saves on the day. Despite her saves, there was never really a moment throughout the game where USC\u2019s defense looked truly threatened. With the Trojans\u2019 last loss occurring almost a month ago, USC head coach Jane Alukonis talked about the keys to the team\u2019s current six-game unbeaten run. \u201cDepth of the team, selflessness of the team, hard work, bravery, trying to dominate possession and a group that wants to improve every day,\u201d Alukonis said postgame. \u201cSo I\u2019m always surprised, little things that we discussed during the week, they always apply over the weekend.\u201d \u201cJust a group of growth mindset, tough, gritty players, led by a senior group who has been very resilient through a lot of change,\u201d she continued. \u201c[The seniors] were freshmen when the staff change happened, and then with everything with the stadium, like playing off site\u201d at Dignity Health Sports Park, where most of USC\u2019s home games will be this season. As Alukonis mentioned, a massive part of the team\u2019s success has come from the contributions of USC\u2019s senior class, who again dominated the stat sheet against Oregon. Hayes had the two goals to go along with assists from Jackson and senior midfielder Helena Sampaio. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a really special [senior] class. When I first got here, when we saw how good the class was and how large the class was, we knew we were really lucky because we were gonna have them for three years,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cI told them today how much I\u2019m going to miss them. I hope they come back and visit. But the season is far from over, and we\u2019re going to maximize the length of season for them the most that we possibly can.\u201d The standout performer, Hayes, also took time to explain the seniors\u2019 role in the success the Trojans have had this season and what the seniors mean to the rest of the team. \u201cThere were 11 of us celebrated today, and then Simi (Awujo) \u2014 who is playing pro now \u2014 and then two grad students who celebrated last year,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cSo I would say we\u2019re about half the team... I think just all of us (are) trying to be role models for them and giving our all in practice off the field, even just trying to build connections with them.\u201d Hayes also discussed how her connection to the underclassmen contributed to the Senior Day festivities and how that aided her two-goal performance. \u201cThey got letters written from all our family, our friends,\u201d Hayes said. They put pictures on everything. They went above and beyond all our expectations. So honestly, just playing with emotion to my advantage, not letting the emotion take control of me, but using that to my advantage.\u201d Hayes leads the team in scoring and in points this season following her dominant performance over Oregon. After transferring from Texas A&M for her final collegiate season, she shared her secret to success this season. \u201cI really think persevering. I\u2019m a transfer, so coming in this year I had really high expectations for myself and others,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cI think our team is just so talented, and we all push each other every single day to be great and be better.\u201d Looking ahead, USC will travel to Illinois for a pair of away games against Illinois on October 10 and Northwestern on October 13. Alukonis expects more of the same out of her team if it hopes to win. \u201cNot to repeat myself, but dominating the possession, keeping the ball. When we have it, they can\u2019t be dangerous. It tires out opponents,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cIt\u2019s more fun to play when you have the ball. So making sure that we work together to create. We don\u2019t get too impulsive and we work together collaboratively in the final third and finish chances.\u201d After its road trip to Illinois, USC will return to Los Angeles to match up with a pair of ranked Big Ten opponents, No. 7 Ohio State and No. 19 Penn State. Afterwards, the Trojans hope to win the Battle of L.A. against crosstown rival UCLA to close the regular season.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/10/06/mitski-closes-out-her-final-show-of-the-land-is-inhospitable-and-so-are-we-tour/", "response": "```\nJapanese American indie singer-songwriter Mitski closed out her tour for her 7th studio album \u201cThe Land is Inhospitable and So Are We\u201d on September 28 at the Hollywood Bowl. Audiences came close to never seeing Mitski perform in person again. In 2019, Mitski announced in a Central Park performance that she would not be performing live anymore, and nearly quit music altogether which caused an uproar on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s time to be a human again,\u201d she wrote on Twitter/X before deleting all social media accounts. After touring for five years with no breaks, Mitski took a hiatus from music and performing, saying that her \u201cself-worth/identity will start depending too much on staying in the game.\u201d However, after facing a pandemic and taking the time to recuperate, Mitski returned to the music scene in 2022 with her record Laurel Hell. \u201cWhat it came down to was, \u2018I have to do this even though it hurts me, because I love it,\u2019\u201d she said to Rolling Stone. \u201cThis is who I am. I\u2019m going to keep getting hurt, and I\u2019m still going to do it, because this is the only thing I can do.\u201d\n\nMitski\u2019s silhouette takes center stage during her opening performance of \u201cEveryone.\u201d The closing show served as a healing space for both the audience and artist alike. Mitski self evaluates that \u201cThe Land is Inhospitable and So Are We\u201d is her \u201cmost American album\u201d thus far. Coming from a background of being a prominent figure in the Asian American community, especially as an artist, her latest album is a form of closure to her previous identity and the start of a new chapter in her personal life and career. Mitski now categorizes herself as mostly American, although she doesn\u2019t \u201cthink it\u2019s allowed.\u201d She explained to Vulture that she doesn\u2019t necessarily think of herself as Asian American, despite using the term \u201cfor the benefit of other people to explain who I am.\u201d She once elaborated how she felt \u201cuncomfortable with \u2018Japanese American,\u2019 although it\u2019s technically accurate,\u201d because in light of the community\u2019s history of incarceration. Her constant struggle to land with just one identity was reflected throughout her performance by never settling down in one area of the stage, always moving.\n\nDespite the album being released over a year ago, the energy of the crowd was high and felt almost like it came out yesterday. The audience was vibrant and diverse, with people of all ages and backgrounds filling the stadium with no seats to spare for the sold out show. Sharon Van Etten performs \u201cJupiter 4\u201d from her critically-acclaimed fifth studio album, \u201cRemind Me Tomorrow.\u201d Singer and actress Sharon Van Etten opened the performance with seven songs, beginning with \u201cJupiter 4\u201d and ending with \u201cSeventeen.\u201d The stage highlighted the singer with draped black tulle and vibrant hues of lilac through light. As Mitski took the stage after Van Etten, the lights shifted from these moodier colors to bright red as the energy of the crowd intensified across the venue.\n\nConcert attendee Max Mineer mentioned that he \u201cloved the dramatic entrance in which Mitski first starts as a shadowy silhouette, walking around center stage under the spotlight exciting us in anticipation. The use of props, backdrops, lighting throughout the show was visually stunning alongside the impact of the music and story unfolding in front of us.\u201d Mitski\u2019s performance reflected the anguish of a second generation immigrant caught in between two worlds. Her dance could best be described as elegantly chaotic. As she rolled around on the floor and panted on all fours like a dog, she gave the performance an almost childlike image of intimacy. \u201c[I] loved this concert and how she utilized expressive dance to further the emotions her songs evoke. Her dance paired with the amazing lighting and set design made a once in a lifetime concert,\u201d said concert attendee Ashley Likins.\n\nThe live rendition of \u201cWorking for the Knife\u201d oscillates between carefree detachment and vulnerability. Her bodily performance captured the inner conflict between her Asian and American identities, eventually landing on \u201cAmerican.\u201d Red tones further accentuated the image of agony and inner turmoil Mitski felt throughout her artistic and personal journeys. Josheline Nguyen, an undergraduate student at USC who also attended the concert, described the performance as \u201cethereal\u201d and \u201cmore of like an art piece than a typical concert.\u201d Tones of folklore and country come through more in this album compared to her previous work, which leaned more towards indie and pop. Her second song of the night, \u201cBuffalo Replaced,\u201d captured the essence of country life with mentions of mosquitos, fireflies, and freight trains to paint the image of a perfect mid-western night.\n\nWith a hushed tone, Mitski sings \u201cBuffalo Replaced\u201d from her newest album. Her lyrics were raw and emotional, tying into her dance performance to give the audience a personal performance overall. Themes of love and gratitude filled the air as the singer put on emotional performances of \u201cHeaven,\u201d \u201cStar,\u201d and \u201cMy Love Mine All Mine\u201d from her newest album. Mitski stood still in her tracks, watching in awe as audiences belted out the lyrics \u201cnothing in the world is mine for free but my love mine, all mine, all mine,\u201d without her performance as a guide for the words. The atmosphere was quiet, surreal, and inviting. It felt like a familiar gathering. Mitski repeatedly reminded the audience of \u201chow much she loves them,\u201d and how \u201cgrateful she is to be here tonight.\u201d She closed her setlist with classics \u201cNobody\u201d and \u201cWashing Machine Heart\u201d as her encore choices, leaving the crowd on their feet with an electric energy in the air. The audience continued to cheer and applaud loudly for minutes, even after Mitski had left the stage. She left them with the parting words, \u201cThank you so much for being here with me and sharing this moment with me. Thank you so much.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Utkarsh Mohan)\n\nBy Terence Holton October 05, 2024 at 10:24 pm PDT\n\nIn the Trojan\u2019s second Big Ten road game, the Minnesota Golden Gophers proved to be a worthy adversary for USC, beating the Trojans 24-17 as USC moves to 3-2 on the season and 1-2 in conference play.\n\n\u201cReality is, we did a lot of good things on all sides, we just didn\u2019t play good enough to win at the end of the day,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said. \u201cWe put ourselves in a great position there at the end of the game, didn\u2019t get it done. Give credit to Minnesota. Those guys played well, played hard.\u201d\n\nThe first drive for the Trojans looked promising, as USC marched down the field easily with redshirt senior running back Woody Marks leading the charge. But the Trojans were stood up close to the red zone, forcing the field goal try. The drive proved to be fruitless as redshirt senior kicker Michael Lantz shanked the kick right of the goal post, ending the nearly six-minute drive with zero points.\n\nThis was not the first time that USC got off to a slow start this season, facing 11-point halftime deficits in each of the two games prior to the Trojans\u2019 matchup with the Gophers.\n\n\u201cEvery time we\u2019ve gone out to a slow start, we\u2019ve come back and taken the lead late game every single time,\u201d Riley said. \u201cSo we talked about a lot with the guys. We\u2019ve emphasized it like crazy. That\u2019s one of the several things that we\u2019ve got to keep getting done.\u201d\n\nFans of classic Big Ten football were excited with the next three possessions by both teams as Minnesota and USC punted before the Golden Gophers knocked home a 32-yard field goal to put the first points on the board.\n\nMarks continued the impressive running as he ran the Trojans down the field, where redshirt junior quarterback Miller Moss found sophomore wide receiver Duce Robinson to get USC on the board and put the Trojans up 7-3 halfway through the second quarter.\n\nThe Golden Gophers\u2019 next drive was all about the run as sophomore running back Darius Taylor busted open a 40-yard run to get Minnesota rolling. A few penalties by the Trojans and more hard-nosed running by the Golden Gophers led to their first touchdown of the game, putting Minnesota up 10-7 with three minutes to play in the half.\n\nBut disaster struck for USC on the next drive. Just as it seemed the Trojan offense was rolling, a fumble by redshirt freshman running back Quinten Joyner set Minnesota up with the ball and two minutes to play in the half.\n\nThe ball must have been greased up at the three-minute mark, as with 26 seconds left, Minnesota fumbled to give the ball back to USC with under 30 seconds to play.\n\nAfter that, it was the Lantz show to end the half. The kicker initially knocked home a 49-yard field goal, then it was called back as Minnesota head coach P.J. Fleck called a timeout right before Lantz kicked off. With no timeouts left, Lantz was ready once again. Then a false start by the USC line moved the kick back another five yards. That didn\u2019t matter, as Lantz silenced the rambunctious Minnesota crowd by hitting a career-long 54-yard field goal, tying the game 10-10 as time expired in the first half.\n\nThe second-half adjustments have been key for the Trojans all year, and this game proved to be no different as USC forced a quick punt by Minnesota to get the ball back early in the second half.\n\nThe Trojans, once again commanded by Marks, moved with ease down the field, where Marks was able to punch in his first touchdown in two games, putting USC up 17-10.\n\nJust as things were looking good for the Trojans after forcing another punt in the fourth quarter, Moss was intercepted after the Minnesota defensive line got to him with ease, forcing the ball out of his arm and into the waiting hands of redshirt junior linebacker Devon Williams.\n\nTurnovers plagued the Trojans and spelled doom for any chance at a win.\n\n\u201cWhen especially we got a kicker like we do, those are points every single time you feel like when you get over there,\u201d Riley said. \u201cAnd then we typically expect to score a bunch of touchdowns there as well. So, I mean, three drives ended in plus territory with that in a game like this, where there weren\u2019t many possessions. I mean, it was massive.\u201d\n\nMinnesota\u2019s offense was clicking on this crucial drive as graduate quarterback Max Brosmer ran in the tying touchdown from the 5-yard line to make the game 17-17, just over halfway through the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cI just think to start our thing as a team, we played a pretty good game, like coach said to some players out there, that we could be better on all sides, but especially defensively, better mistakes and just even talking about that last drive be more locked in,\u201d redshirt senior defensive end Jamil Muhammad said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I\u2019m proud that we were able to find them when we fought.\u201d\n\nUSC had an uneventful three-and-out, resulting in a punt that started Minnesota off at its 25-yard line. The Golden Gophers proceeded to walk down the field, cool, calm, and calculated. On fourth down from the half line, Minnesota\u2019s \u201ctush push\u201d worked on its second attempt, and Brosmer punched in his third rushing touchdown of the night to put Minnesota up 24-17 with just under one minute to play in the fourth quarter.\n\nWith the game on the line, no timeouts and 56 seconds to play, Moss was given one more shot to send the game to overtime or win it. USC got down to the Minnesota 28, behind two 16-yard completions to Robinson and sophomore receiver Makai Lemon, as well as an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Minnesota.\n\nDisaster then struck again for the Trojans, as Moss\u2019 ball into the endzone with 15 seconds to play was intercepted by Minnesota in the end zone. Ball game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re two plays away from probably being 5-0, but those plays happened, and we\u2019ve had opportunities to win those games, and so we\u2019ve put ourselves in those positions, which is hard to do on the road against quality teams,\u201d Riley said. \u201cBut obviously, we\u2019re frustrated that we haven\u2019t finished them off.\u201d\n\nNext Saturday, USC will take on No. 7 Penn State in the Coliseum at 12:30 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo by Utkarsh Mohan)\n\nBy Caleb Carter\nOctober 05, 2024 at 3:22 pm PDT\n\nAfter a disappointing 0-3 loss to the No. 2 Nebraska Cornhuskers, No. 21 USC (10-3, 2-1 Big Ten) bounced back in a hard-fought five-set victory over the Michigan Wolverines (12-2, 2-1). The Trojans got off to a slow start in the match, losing the first set 25-15. Led by their talented sophomore opposite hitter Valentina Vaulet with six kills, the Wolverines dominated as there were no lead changes or tie scores. It was a complete team effort from the Wolverines as outside hitters Kendyl Reaugh and Allison Jacobs were each responsible for four kills allowing an impressive 87% attack percentage.\n\nIt looked to be more of the same in the second set as Michigan got off early with a six-point run giving them a 7-3 lead. After exchanging scores, the Trojans would go on a run of their own to give them a 15-13 lead, with redshirt junior middle blocker Tyrah Arial scoring two of their six points. The two teams would go on to exchange scores, and a kill by SC graduate outside hitter Ally Batenhorst would bring the Trojans to within one with the score 21-20. But it was a four-point run capped off by a Morgan Burke service ace that gave Michigan the set.\n\nNow down 2-0 in the match, the Trojans needed to rally if they wanted to avoid being swept for the second time in five days. Moving into the third set, the Wolverines once again jumped out to an early 9-6 lead. However, there was a clear sense of urgency from the Trojans as nice play from Arial and Batenhorst allowed USC to stay within arms reach down 18-20. Then it was Batenhorst, the star grad transfer from Nebraska, who completely took over scoring four of the Trojan\u2019s last seven to win the set 25-22.\n\nThe fourth set was much like the second and third, two great teams going back and forth, each looking to pull away from the other; and as the set came closer to its conclusion, it looked like Michigan would do just that. Up 23-19, the Wolverines appeared to have to match in the bag. But a Michigan service error eventually led to a four-point Trojan run capped off by an ace from senior setter Mia Tuaniga that brought the score even at 23. From then on it was all SC, with Batenhorst coming away with her second set-winning kill.\n\nNow even at 2-2, USC managed to claw its way out of a 0-2 hole and now looked to have the momentum to complete the comeback. But similar to the rest of the match up to this point, it was not done without drama. Michigan once again pulled away early in the fifth set, storming out to an 11-5 lead. But perhaps it was nerves that forced Michigan to commit back-to-back errors that gave SC the life that they needed. The Trojans found a way to score three in a row, tying the set at 11. After an attack error from SC gave Michigan a 12-11 lead, the Trojans never looked back. Arial was the late-game hero, as two outstanding blocks and a service ace sealed the game for the Trojans.\n\nAfter the come-from-behind win, head coach Brad Keller didn\u2019t hold back in heaping praise on his team. \u201cI think our leadership group did a fantastic job staying the course,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to win a match when you\u2019re down 11-5 in the fifth set.\u201d Coach Keller and the Trojans now look ahead to Saturday\u2019s match against No. 12 Minnesota at the Galen Center.\n```"}

(Photo by Massuda Kohgadai)  By   Andrew Giesler October 05, 2024 at  2:06 pm PDT\n\nThere\u2019s a reason that betting spreads give a three-point advantage to the home teams everywhere: collegiate athletes enter a hostile environment and play against a team that has the home support. As confident as head coach Lincoln Riley is in his guys and the program, he still considers away games a different kind of challenge. \u201cWinning against good football teams on the road is always difficult,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about being able to start fast and maintain our standard of play at a high level... I think that\u2019s going to be important for all these road games.\u201d\n\nDespite mentioning starting fast, so far in conference play the Trojans have come out unbelievably flat in the first half. Against reigning national champion Michigan, USC started the game with three straight three-and-outs before their fourth drive \u2014 resulting in just four plays before an inevitable punt. Ultimately, the Trojans came back with a second half surge, but could not pull out a win as the Wolverines scored with 37 seconds left to win 27-24. Last week\u2019s game against the Wisconsin Badgers was an almost identical story, albeit with a different ending. After an opening drive touchdown, which seemed to reassure the viewers that USC could in fact play in the first half, the Trojans\u2019 following drives resulted in a punt, interception, fumbled punt return, field goal and another fumble. The Trojans showed signs of life in the second half and finished the game out strong defensively, forcing three punts, two turnovers on downs and a pick-six to pull out a 38-21 victory.\n\nWhile he mainly discussed this week\u2019s game against Minnesota Riley also touched on the decision to schedule Missouri State as the home opener next year. \u201cThere\u2019s not just a million options. A lot of people\u2019s schedules are set up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you look forward to what our schedule is going to be and what we already play in the non-conference, I think we\u2019ll learn a lot in the future in terms of how this 12-team playoff plays out.\u201d\n\nWith Notre Dame always on the schedule, at least through 2026 when their current agreement ends, USC\u2019s complete schedule will never be a cakewalk. The Big Ten is significantly different from the Pac-12 in that all opponents are top-tier programs, meaning there\u2019s no real rest game in the season. For example, the Trojans will play Iowa, Michigan, Michigan State, Northwestern and UCLA next year at the Coliseum while traveling to Illinois, Nebraska, Purdue and a long-time foe in the Oregon Ducks.\n\nBriefly touching on the 12-team playoff, Riley alluded to how strength of schedule will determine which teams make it. Obviously, teams from last year, such as Liberty \u2014 who finished 13-0 before getting boat-raced by Oregon 45-6 in the Fiesta Bowl \u2014 will struggle to make the playoffs unless they get an auto-bid as the non-power four team to secure a spot. To finish the comment on adding a weaker opponent in the Missouri State Bears, Riley said: \u201cOur strength of schedule is not going to be an issue. We\u2019re going to try to balance it the best that we can... We\u2019re going to do what we feel like is the very best thing for USC football and our teams and our opportunities to win championships.\u201d\n\nRiley and the Trojan squad will have a challenge ahead of them at Minnesota Saturday before they welcome Penn State to the Coliseum on October 12 in a highly anticipated matchup.\n```"}

The Bears defeated the Rams 24-18. (AP/Kamil Krzaczynski)\n\nBy Matt Kim October 05, 2024 at 2:03 pm PDT\n\nThe Rams currently sit at the bottom of the NFC West with a 1-3 record\u2014this season just hasn\u2019t gone their way. Among the myriad issues, star wide receivers Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp are still a long ways from returning, so quarterback Matthew Stafford has had limited throwing options, as names like Demarcus Robinson, Jordan Whittington and Tyler Johnson head up the current receiving room.\n\nThe defense, which lost key pieces over the offseason such as defensive tackle Aaron Donald to retirement and linebacker Ernest Jones who the Rams traded to the Titans, has struggled mightily to begin the season. The Rams finally made a first-round pick for the first time since their Super Bowl run, selecting defensive end Jared Verse out of Florida State, but he hasn\u2019t done much yet to help out this struggling unit.\n\nHeading into week five, the Rams have allowed the most points per game at 28.8, and that figure has largely been attributed towards their inability to stop the run. In week four, when the Rams fell to the Bears 24-18, they got torched by D\u2019Andre Swift, who heading into that game was one of the NFL\u2019s most inefficient running backs. He averaged a measly 1.8 yards per carry before last Sunday\u2019s matchup, but managed to rush for 93 yards on only 16 attempts. He also added 72 receiving yards on 7 catches, pushing his all-purpose yardage on the day to 165.\n\nDefensive coordinator Chris Shula has to change something in defending the run, as Packers running back Josh Jacobs is primed for his 2024 breakout game if the Rams defense continues on this trajectory. Jacobs has only eclipsed the century mark in rushing yards once this year, against a subpar Colts defense, but he could have a field day against this struggling unit.\n\nThe Packers have had to play from behind in multiple contests, partially explaining why Jacobs hasn\u2019t received many touches. This includes last week\u2019s matchup against the Minnesota Vikings, when Green Bay ultimately fell just short of a victory after trailing by three touchdowns early in the game. Quarterback Jordan Love threw for 389 yards and four touchdowns, but also added in three interceptions, proving that he\u2019s still prone to mistakes.\n\nIn a matchup in which the Packers are favored at SoFi stadium, the Rams will have to be physical up front and force Love to make mistakes through the air. The Packers will also miss wide receiver Christian Watson due to an ankle injury\u2014a key contributor in that offense who can change the score of a game in an instant.\n\nOn the offensive side of the ball, the Rams team will continue to rely on running back Kyren Williams to produce the bulk of LA\u2019s offense. Stafford has been building chemistry with his new receiving core, but we\u2019ve yet to see him dominate a game through the air in 2024. Head coach Sean McVay has always been creative in ensuring that his receivers are open downfield, but this will be another game in which Williams will need to receive 20-plus touches to give the offense a chance.\n\nIf Stafford can continue to build rapport with his receivers, Rams fans can anticipate a potential breakout performance from one of Robinson, Whittington or Johnson. Whittington is an intriguing candidate in particular, as he\u2019s seen a majorly increased snap and target share. If the Rams are battling back and forth, it may be Whittington who sees the lionshare of the targets given his proven ability to separate and find open space.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 glaring issue concerning their defense won\u2019t be fixed overnight, but this can be a chance to show improvements against a good offense. If not, the front office might treat this as a rebuilding year for the team and tank for a good first-round talent in 2025 NFL draft.\n```"}

(AP/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Joel Robles October 05, 2024 at  1:57 pm PDT\n\nAfter a long 162-game season and the wild card round has finished, the stage has been set for a thrilling National League Divisional series. The National League West winner, the Los Angeles Dodgers will face the hottest team in baseball: the San Diego Padres. This is the third time in the past five seasons that the pair has faced off in the playoffs. This will be Shohei Ohtani\u2019s first postseason experience, as the Angels never managed to clinch a postseason berth. The World Baseball Classic gave Ohtani the closest thing to a playoff moment, when he led Japan to the title against the U.S. Ohtani has had a phenomenal season in 2024, putting up MLB\u2019s first-ever 50-50 season and a career-best .310 batting average, but can he do it where it matters most?\n\nThe Dodgers will look to bounce back after experiencing two heartbreaking postseasons in a row. Last year, the Arizona Diamondbacks swept them in embarrassing fashion in the NLDS. The big question for the Blue Crew will be if superstars Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman show up. Betts had a forgettable postseason last year as he didn\u2019t get a single hit. Freeman played disappointingly as well, batting .100 with only one hit in three playoff games. Luckily, at the trade deadline, the Dodgers made some key transactions. General Manager Andrew Friedman traded for heat thrower Michael Kopech, ace Jack Flaherty and Gold Glove utility player Tommy Edman. Those additions have certainly helped the team, but will all the chips fall into place for LA? We\u2019ll see, but Dodgers fans like myself know that especially when expectations are high, heartbreak lies just around the corner. Not to mention the many key pitching injuries the Dodgers will have to work around. The list includes Clayton Kershaw, Tyler Glasnow, Gavin Stone, Tony Gonsolin, Dustin May and pitching Shohei Ohtani\u2014whose two-way status was put on hold this year due to an offseason elbow surgery.\n\nEven with those concerns, I\u2019m confident the Dodgers could get the job done this postseason. The offense is too stacked to not make any noise once again. The team ranked top three in homers in the regular season, top two in runs batted in and top four in hits\u2014that\u2019s pedigree. Yes, the starting rotation is the major question, but Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Flaherty have had great seasons. Since joining the Dodgers, Flaherty has put up a 3.58 ERA, while Yamamoto posted a 3.00 ERA in his rookie season. Not to mention Walker Buehler, who looked like the Buehler of old in his latest outing. In his last start\u2014which clinched the NL West\u2014against the Padres, Buehler threw five innings and only allowed just one run. The bullpen has also been consistently strong, ranking in the top 13 even as it suffered many injuries. Yamamoto will take the ball for game one, then Flaherty will start for game two. Finally, big game pitcher Walker Buehler will come in for game three, with a potential sweep on the line should all go as LA hopes it will.\n\nThe last series in 2022 between these teams was one to forget for the Dodgers, as they completely crumbled and lost 3-1 in one of the more heartbreaking losses in recent Dodger memory. That season, the Dodgers had won a historic 111 games\u2014the most in team history\u2014and won the division by 22 games. My prediction is the Boys in Blue achieve their revenge in a tough grueling series that goes to five games. Although Manny Machado and his squad are sure to put up a fight, it won\u2019t be enough for the showtime. Now, let\u2019s enjoy the thrill of the MLB playoffs.\n```"}

(Photo by Utkarsh Mohan)\n\nBy Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier October 05, 2024 at 10:06 am PDT\n\nAfter a 38-21 thumping of Wisconsin for its first Big Ten victory despite a slow first half start, No. 11 USC football (3-1, 1-1) is back on the road for a clash against the Minnesota Golden Gophers in Minneapolis (2-3, 0-2) on Saturday. With the win over the Badgers, the Trojans moved up two spots in the AP poll this week from No. 13 last week. Minnesota, meanwhile, lost a 27-24 battle to Michigan at the Big House.\n\nThe Trojans and Gophers have faced each other eight times, with USC posting a 6-1-1 record against Minnesota and winning the last matchup between the two teams, a 19-17 bout at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in 2011. While Minnesota has lost its first two Big Ten games of the year to Iowa and Michigan, the Gophers will likely give the Trojans a tough fight, especially with the game being at Huntington Bank Stadium. The Gophers played the then-No.12 Wolverines very closely last week and almost staged a comeback by outscoring Michigan 21-3 in the fourth quarter, but failed to recover a controversial onside kick after closing the deficit to a field goal.\n\nWhile senior quarterback Max Brosmer helped lead the offensive comeback last week, Minnesota\u2019s strong suit this year has been its defense. First-year defensive coordinator Corey Hetherman has turned the Gophers into the best pass-defense in the FBS this season, allowing less than 100 yards per game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be another tough road atmosphere, tough football team,\u201d Riley said during his weekly Thursday press conference. \u201cYou know, winning against good football teams, good football programs on the road is always difficult. So we\u2019ve talked about being able to start fast and maintain our standard of play at a high level.\u201d\n\nWhile USC\u2019s redshirt junior quarterback Miller Moss has continued to impress offensively \u2014 throwing for 308 yards and three touchdowns on Saturday \u2014 he has continued to take hits on the field as a result of a struggling offensive line. Moss has already been sacked seven times this year, with five of them coming in Big Ten games. USC\u2019s offensive line will need to do a better job of protecting Moss and allow him to accurately throw the football, especially with the Trojans facing one of the best defenses in the country on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of playing the position,\u201d Riley said after Tuesday\u2019s practice. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d love to leave any game with a quarterback not taking any hits, but that\u2019s just not always reality. We\u2019ve played two good teams, two good defensive football teams, it\u2019s gonna happen. Obviously, it\u2019s something we want to continue to clean up but everybody\u2019s involved in that.\u201d\n\nIf Moss has better protection, he will be able to sling the ball well, especially when he finds a hot receiver like he did with sophomore wide receiver Ja\u2019Kobi Lane against the Badgers. Against Wisconsin, Lane set new career highs of 105 receiving yards and 10 receptions, and caught two of Moss\u2019s three touchdown passes. Because of the depth among USC\u2019s wide receivers and tight ends, a different Trojan has led the team each week in receiving yards, which will help Moss and the offense remain unpredictable against the Gopher\u2019s very strong defensive unit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some good skill sets and some guys that we want to play that we think can create good matchups and go make plays for us,\u201d Riley said on Thursday.\n\nThe Trojans kick off at 4:30 p.m. Saturday at Huntington Bank Stadium on Big Ten Network.\n```"}

(Photo by Utkarsh Mohan)\n\nBy Daniel Palmore\nOctober 04, 2024 at 5:39 pm PDT\n\nWhen USC hired former UCLA defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn last December, most people were not expecting the unit to become so formidable this quickly. The Trojans defense started the season with a surprise performance in Las Vegas, holding No. 13 LSU to 20 points. Since then, the defensive side of the ball has held its own against all of USC\u2019s opponents thus far.\n\nUSC has surrendered only 17 points per game through the first four games of the season and earlier this year, the Trojans earned their first shutout since 2011 against Utah State. Of all the improvements made defensively, Lynn thinks USC\u2019s pass rushers have taken the biggest leap so far.\n\n\u201cEdge guys have been getting better and better each week,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cThere\u2019s more than one way to affect the quarterback, it doesn\u2019t just have to be sacks.\u201d\n\nAlthough he is not an edge rusher, one player that has found ways to affect opposing offenses is senior linebacker Eric Gentry. Through four games, Gentry leads the Trojans in tackles and sacks and has one forced fumble as well.\n\nAlong with Gentry, senior linebacker Mason Cobb has also been one of the standout players for the Trojans\u2019 defense. Cobb has two interceptions on the season and got his first pick six of the year against Wisconsin.\n\nAccording to Cobb, digesting film differently this year has allowed the Trojans to see improved defensive play on the field.\n\n\u201cLynn is very detail-oriented when it comes to film study,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cHe likes to break stuff down in numbers, so for me it\u2019s about taking all that in and understanding what teams want to do given their tendencies.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s secondary also struggled in previous seasons, but with players such as redshirt sophomore Kamari Ramsey following Lynn to USC, the Trojans\u2019 back end has started to round into form.\n\nUSC\u2019s defensive backs group could grow even stronger as redshirt safety Zion Branch continues to recover from a lower-body injury he suffered last season. So far, Branch has played in two games this season and has recorded five tackles. Prior to his injury last season, Branch had 22 tackles and one forced fumble.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go out here and go to work everyday, it\u2019s what I do,\u201d Branch said. \u201cMy coaches always tell me to stay the course and everything will work out how it should.\u201d\n\nAs the Trojans work to get players such as Branch integrated into the lineup, many wonder how USC\u2019s defense will hold up in the Big Ten. The Trojans have played two opponents in their new conference so far and split those games.\n\nEmbracing a new defensive identity is what has helped USC thrive early in the season.\n\n\u201cCoach Riley calls us the fast ten rather than the Big Ten,\u201d redshirt senior cornerback Greedy Vance Jr. said. \u201cWe worked on our mindset and physicality throughout the offseason and I think we\u2019ve done a good job as a team playing up to that standard.\u201d\n\nOnly time will tell if the Trojans can sustain this level of defensive prowess for an entire season, but it looks like USC fans have a defense to be excited about through the first five weeks of the season.\n```"}

Shohei Ohtani, a renowned Japanese baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers, reached new levels of fame after becoming the first player in baseball history with 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in a single season. Regarded as one of the greatest moments in baseball history, the baseball has gained significance amongst fans.\n\nChris Belanski, the lucky individual to leave the game with possession of the 50/50 ball, posted the item to Goldin Auctions website, with its bidding currently listed at $1.5 million. However, the possession of the ball is being fought over by three different fans.\n\nOn September 25th, Max Matus, an 18-year old baseball fan in Florida, filed a lawsuit against Belanski, another fan, and Goldin Auctions, claiming to be rightful owner of the now prized baseball. The already complicated case grew as a second fan, Joseph Davidov, filed a lawsuit as well, claiming that he had initial possession of the ball while it was still on the ground, when a fan jumped over the railing and into him, causing the ball to roll loose into the hands of Belanski.\n\nAlthough the bidding is currently live, the ball cannot be sold until after the court rules on the lawsuits at hand. \u201cThis ball will probably eventually become the most expensive ball in baseball history to be sold there,\u201d said Varun Soni, member of the State Bar of California and faculty at USC. \u201cWe\u2019re talking this could be a $3 million bounty on this ball.\u201d\n\nThe 50/50 ball is one of the most coveted items of a unique tradition in sports culture. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the culture of a baseball game... to chase down balls that get hit into the park.

Soni describes how \u201cthe template moving forward in the world of baseball, the general rule of the legal system is possession is nine tenths of the law. So...whoever has possession basically owns it. In this particular case, there are three people who claim possession.\u201d\n\nWith three individuals claiming possession of the ball, the future of where 50/50 will end up is unknown. Soni says that the actions surrounding the 50/50 ball could set a negative precedent for stadium culture. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to incentivize bad conduct because of the potential reward,\u201d Soni said. \u201cAnd in fact, if you look online, some of the most heartwarming videos...you\u2019ll see on social media are videos of adults who catch a ball and then give it to the kid next door next to them.\u201d```"}

County was released by the Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority (LAHSA) on Wednesday. The release of the dashboards was part of LAHSA\u2019s efforts to increase transparency by providing the public with comprehensive and digestible data on homelessness. The data tracks street outreach, interim housing and time-limited subsidy programs which can be accessed on LAHSA\u2019s official website. The data estimates that as of January 2024, L.A.\u2019s unhoused population totals around 6,652 with 647 of these individuals residing around the USC district.\n\nFor long-time California resident Maria Bautista, a freshman majoring in film and television production, the statistics do not come as much of a surprise. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in California for the past eight years, so it\u2019s not surprising,\u201d Bautista said. \u201cI\u2019m used to seeing homeless people around my area. I see people in the streets or especially at night trying to sleep on the streets.\u201d\n\nA key aspect of the data dashboards was tracking participation in LAHSA\u2019s interim housing programs. The LAHSA funds over 16,000 shelter beds across Los Angeles City & County primarily through interim housing programs. The data dashboards show that 15,279 individuals were recorded participating in the program since 2020.\n\nSome USC students seemed to share sentiments that the interim programs were not enough in supporting the city\u2019s unhoused population. Upon hearing about the interim housing programs, Melina Osmondson, a graduate student studying social work, says that LAHSA should prioritize other efforts. \u201cI think that\u2019s a great initiative, but I think affordable housing needs to be more prioritized and that\u2019s gonna be the biggest thing to actually help long term,\u201d Osmodson said.\n\nIsaiah Sangkay, a freshman majoring in psychology, says interim housing is only a small step in providing support. \u201cInterim housing definitely won\u2019t be enough, but at least it\u2019s kind of a cushioning for individuals that are experiencing a lot of trouble with their financial situation,\u201d said Sangkay.\n\nFor some USC students, the primary concern regarding the unhoused population surrounding the area was safety. \u201cI feel like anytime I\u2019m with friends, and I\u2019m not alone and during the daytime, I feel safe.\u2029But at night, it\u2019s when we know not to go out because of the homeless people, and we know that the area surrounding the campus is not secure\u201d, Bautista said.\n\nOsmondson says that empathy is critical in approaching the unhoused population. \u201cThey\u2019re just people. They\u2019re just in a situation that a lot of us can also end up being in based on socioeconomic status,\u201d Osmondson said. \u201cI think kind of removing that stigma or trying to unlearn that, I think will also contribute.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Lillian Wang)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler October 04, 2024 at 4:01 pm PDT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s life.\u201d For fifth-year driver Carson Kranz, water polo is much more than just a sport he is good at. Kranz has helped lead USC to three of the past four NCAA finals and won numerous accolades in the process, including All-Mountain Pacific Sports Federation First Team, three-time All-MPSF Honorable Mention, two-time NCAA All-Tournament Second Team, one-time MPSF All-Tournament Team and, most recently, scoring his 100th goal as a Trojan.\n\nBefore all that though, Kranz was a little kid whose mother threw him into the water just because she thought he would float. Little did she know, that moment would create one of the top water polo players in the nation.\n\nKranz went to Loyola High School in downtown Los Angeles, where he played basketball, swam and, of course, played water polo. As a junior, he and his team won a CIF Division 1 championship in swimming, which translated tremendously into sprints in water polo. He has won 22 of 29 sprints in the past two years with the Trojans, which barely begins to explain how quick he is in the pool.\n\nHis speed, athleticism and goal-scoring abilities made him a top tier recruit out of high school. When the time came to decide where he wanted to play in college, Kranz found the choice easy. Before his time playing at Uytengsu Aquatics Center as a collegiate athlete, his high school team had the opportunity to play there for the big games. Kranz also played for the Trojan Water Polo Club as he was growing up, which meant all the signs were pointed toward USC.\n\n\u201cI kinda deep down knew I was going to end up at \u2018SC... \u2018SC has always been home,\u201d Kranz said in an interview with Annenberg Media.\n\nKranz succeeded wildly as a true freshman, tallying 21 goals, enough to place him third on the team. He continued that pace in his sophomore and junior years, adding 20 and 22 more goals, respectively. It was last year, however, which really saw him break out in a big way. He scored 32 goals \u2014 including four hat tricks over the course of 18 games \u2014 and matched his goal tally with 32 assists, finishing with 64 points on the year.\n\nIt was just a matter of time, then, that Kranz netted his 100th career goal. So when Kranz swam up to his five-meter attempt on September 14 against UC Irvine, he knew what was coming.\n\n\u201cI kind of reflected in that moment,\u201d Kranz said. \u201cI was like, damn, I\u2019m about to score my 100th goal here. I remember I kissed the ball and just shot it like any other five-meter.\u201d\n\nDespite approaching the shot like any other five-meter, he and all of his teammates knew what was about to happen. Kranz took a deep breath before putting the ball into the corner and gave a strong fist bump toward the crowd.\n\nHe mentioned that the goal was not the only thing that made the moment special.\n\n\u201cI think what made it even more special was that one of my best friends, [fifth-year 2-meter] Max [Miller], also scored 100 goals in the same game,\u201d Kranz said. \u201cSo I think that made it even more cool for me to share a moment with one of my good friends.\u201d\n\nThe powerful combination of Miller and Kranz has helped lead the Trojans to a record of 11-1 and the squad is looking to win the program\u2019s 11th national championship and first since 2018.\n\nAs Kranz\u2019s final season for the Trojans concludes, he reminisced briefly on the past, looking at all the good and bad that water polo has had to offer. While Kranz would like to play water polo again in the future, he thinks he is going to take a break from the sport for the first time since he started when he was nine years old.\n\nWhether he plays again or not, he said one thing is for certain: \u201cI\u2019m nothing but grateful that my mom threw me in the water when I was little.\u201d\n```"}

Hong). \n\nBy John Millsap October 04, 2024 at  3:40 pm PDT \n\nMayor Karen Bass held a press conference today, announcing former Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell as the new Los Angeles Police Department Chief. McDonnell will succeed Interim Chief Dominic Choi, who served in the role after Michel Moore\u2019s resignation at the end of February this year. He previously served as assistant chief under William J. \u201cBill\u201d Bratton and was credited with implementing a grassroots style of policing, emphasizing community relations as part of a department overhaul, according to the  LA Times . The city\u2019s new chief has served with the LAPD for 29 years and has since moved into academia to head the Safe Communities Institute at the USC Price School of Public Policy. \n\nDuring the press conference, Mayor Bass expressed her faith in McDonnell\u2019s capability and track record, noting his graduation from the LAPD academy at 21 and his long career in Southern California law enforcement. \u201cChief McDonnell is a nationally recognized thought leader on public safety... a leader, an innovator, and a change maker. That\u2019s what we need in L.A.,\u201d Bass said. \n\nMayor Bass also stated the importance of city preparation for the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Summer Olympic Games. \u201cThe magnitude of what L.A. needs to prepare for is crystal clear to me, and I trust that Jim McDonnell will make sure that we are prepared and vigilant for anything that comes our way,\u201d Bass said. \n\nThe department will face challenges not only in preparation but in recruitment as well. Chief McDonnell will take over an understaffed department struggling to maintain its numbers and respond to emergencies promptly. This year, the Los Angeles Police Department employed 8,800 sworn officers, its lowest staffing level in over two decades. McDonnell recognized the staffing issue in his speech, listing one of his goals of growing the department \u201cback to full strength through a solid recruitment and retention campaign.\u201d \n\nWith the World Cup and the Olympics coming to L.A., McDonnell assured the public of his readiness to deal with the upcoming pressures. \u201cOur department and our city will be showcased, and we will be prepared.\u201d \n```"}

(AP Photo/Rick Scuteri)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler\nOctober 04, 2024 at 3:06 pm PDT\n\nA close look at the first round\n\nIt\u2019s October, which means the MLB playoffs are in full swing, and barely one round in numerous storylines have developed. In the NL, the New York Mets toppled the Milwaukee Brewers in a three-game series. The first two games were high-scoring, but the electric third game had all the fans talking. In the top of the ninth inning, down 2-0, the Mets were at the top of their order with a solid chance of making it through the Wild Card round for the first time since their World Series run in 2015. In just one swing, two-time Home Run Derby champion Pete Alonso put the Mets up one with a 370-foot bomb, scoring both Brandon Nimmo and Francisco Lindor. Starling Marte then hit an RBI single, scoring Jesse Winker and securing the Mets win and series.\n\nIn the AL, the Detroit Tigers swept the Houston Astros\u2014something that shocked all baseball fans, including those in Detroit. According to Sports Illustrated, the team had a 0.2% chance to make the playoffs at nearly 10 games back from a wildcard spot back in early August but shocked the baseball world and is now in the second round. The far-and-away AL Cy Young favorite Tarik Skubal started game one for the Tigers and made it six innings on 88 pitches. The Tigers offense stepped up big, outscoring the Astros 8-3 in a two-game rollercoaster of a series.\n\nIn what is considered one of the bigger upsets this season, the Kansas City Royals won both games against the Baltimore Orioles. Those who bet the under were rather happy, as the Orioles and Royals combined for a whopping four runs in the series despite being two of the best-hitting teams. Hits weren\u2019t an issue since both teams had five in Game One and combined for 15 in Game Two. Instead, it was a case of neither team crossing the plate. The Orioles finished a disappointing season after losing the AL East divisional race to the New York Yankees by three games and then falling to the Royals in the Wild Card round.\n\nThe Dodgers are in deep trouble\n\nDodger fans need to close their ears for this section, as the red-hot Padres have made it to the next round and are not likely to slow down. The Padres are the hottest team in baseball, finishing the second half of the season with a league-leading record of 43-19. They finished the regular season leading the league in hits (1456), batting average (.263) and struck out the least by nearly 100 (1077 vs. Royals\u2019 1161). Their entire batting order is stacked, with Jake Cronenworth, who has 17 homers on the year and is batting .240 in the eighth slot, leading the charge. No matter where an opposing pitcher is in this team\u2019s lineup, getting out of innings will be a brutal task.\n\nPitching-wise, the team is around the league average in nearly every category and relies heavily on their star-studded offense to win them close games. The Dodgers, however, are a similarly explosive team. San Diego had LA\u2019s number throughout the season, finishing the season series 8-5, and of the 13 games played, only three had the teams combine for double-digit runs. This puts pressure on the mound for both teams, which is worrisome for LA due to their bullpen injuries. The Padres are in a great position to upset the Dodgers and advance in the postseason.\n\nA special double play\n\nThe first matchup will be between the Tigers and the Cleveland Guardians in the AL. If the Tigers can get Skubal on the mound for a noticeable amount of time and continue their \u201cplayoff team\u201d mentality as described by Manager A.J. Hinch, they should be able to get past the Guardians. Prediction: The Tigers overcome the Guardians and continue an unlikely playoff run.\n\nThe Yankees are far and away the favorite in the AL. Despite going against a formidable foe in the Royals, the Yankees shouldn\u2019t have an issue sweeping Kansas City unless Judge develops a hole in his bat and New York\u2019s pitching collapses. Prediction: The Yankees drop the Royals in a sweep.\n\nAll of Philadelphia has said it is their year in baseball\u2014and they aren\u2019t necessarily wrong. With Bryce Harper leading the team and an All-Star pitching rotation combined with solid hitting, the Phillies may have figured out their winning formula. Unfortunately for the blazing-hot Mets, the Phillies will be too much and should easily push on to the NLDS. Prediction: The Phillies advance and send the Mets home.\n\nAs described above, the Padres are the team to beat right now. Despite being the No. 4 seed, everybody knows how good they really are. The Dodgers-Padres series could easily be the best of this postseason, and there is a very high possibility of going to five games if the Dodgers can figure out their pitching situation. Prediction: Padres upset the expensive Dodgers and send them home earlier than expected.\n\nA look back at our double plays\n\nLast weekend, the Padres and Dodgers won their series, moving my prediction total to 14-13-3. For those of you who have followed my journey since the beginning, you may be shocked to see more wins than losses. It took me five editions of my column before I finally tallied my first win, and at one point it was 2-8-2. As always, the Law of Averages played itself out and by some miracle, I finished with one more win than a loss.\n```"}

The Ryder Cup should take its place.\n\nTeam World couldn\u2019t break Team USA\u2019s streak at The Royal Montreal Golf Club.\n\nScottie Scheffler and Collin Morikawa embrace in excitement at the Presidents Cup, which was played at The Royal Montreal Golf Club. (Photo courtesy of Scottie Scheffler/@scottie.scheffler on Instagram)\n\nBy Robert Westermann October 03, 2024 at 7:12 pm PDT\n\nThis year\u2019s Presidents Cup was a simple repeat of those from the last two decades: Team USA dominated Team World. The tournament began with the same energy and flair of the Ryder Cup\u2014the sport\u2019s biggest international contest\u2014and both teams made big moves throughout the first two days. Team USA closed out Thursday with a 5-0 lead but Team World\u2014which excludes European golfers\u2014stormed back on Friday to even out the score, leaving the air thick with tension on Saturday morning. But that tension would not last long. The Americans sealed their victory after outmatching Team World over the weekend, dropping just two matches during the foursomes and four-balls on Saturday and three singles on Sunday.\n\nSurprisingly, one of the American losses came from world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who lost by one hole to Hideki Matsuyama. The match between both teams\u2019 top-ranked players was one to watch going into Sunday, and Matsuyama ultimately came out on top after a back-and-forth back-nine.\n\nTeam USA was evidently the more talented team before the tournament began, as nine of the world\u2019s top 20 golfers were scheduled to play for the stars and stripes in Montreal. Team World had only two golfers in the top 20, which put them at a disadvantage from the get-go. The situation this year was no different from years past with its typical uneven matchups, and the tournament receives way less attention than the Ryder Cup between the Americans and the Europeans.\n\nWhy, then, does the Presidents Cup take the Ryder Cup\u2019s place in off years? The Ryder Cup is and has been the marquee international competition in golf since it was first played in 1927. Although for the past several years the victors have been the hosting team and the outcomes haven\u2019t been as exciting, the hype leading up to each tournament makes for much more intense and competitive golf than the Presidents Cup. Fans also have higher expectations for the Ryder Cup, as the best golfers from America and Europe comprise a field of evenly distributed top-ranked players.\n\nThe past two decades of Presidents Cups show that the competition is unfair before the first ball leaves the tee box and the build-up lacks the Ryder Cup\u2019s excitement. Although the tournament gives non-European golfers a chance to come together and play on an international level, it\u2019s likely the American players don\u2019t treat it the same as they do the Ryder Cup given the latter\u2019s history.\n\nThe contrast between the two competitions leads to one conclusion: the Ryder Cup should take the place of the Presidents Cup and be played every year. In addition to the differences in intensity and skill, a tournament with an almost guaranteed outcome isn\u2019t worth the time. Though there have been close calls in prior tournaments, namely in 2019 when the Americans capped off a huge comeback during Sunday\u2019s singles, Team USA is too much for Team World to handle.\n\nThe Ryder Cup is the event all golf fans want to see, and the two-year gap between each tournament leaves an unnecessary void in the sport that can easily be filled if it were to be hosted annually. An annual Ryder Cup would provide golf with a high-stakes international competition that other leagues like the NFL and NBA don\u2019t have and make up for the lack of an event like the All-Star or Pro Bowl game. At the very least, the powers that be could reformat the Presidents Cup to make for more fair competition. Whether Team World should include Europeans or the event should take place every few years instead of every two, the Ryder Cup needs to become a larger part of the sport due to its status as one of golf\u2019s most unique events. Giving the Ryder Cup a bigger platform will help the sport as a whole continue on its upward trajectory.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Drew de F Fawkes/Flickr)\n\nBy Cormac Cadden and Sophie Ignon\nOctober 03, 2024 at 6:31 pm PDT\n\nThis afternoon, tickets to one of the most highly anticipated musical reunions went live on Ticketmaster for Oasis\u2019 2025 reunion tour at the Rose Bowl Stadium. Following a 15-year hiatus and public feud between brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher, Oasis will return to the stage, playing two shows at the Rose Bowl Stadium. Hundreds of thousands are now chasing after the chance to see the iconic British rock band live in the coming year.\n\n\u201cAs I was getting older, I would listen to them more and more and more, and I just became obsessed,\u201d senior journalism major Jack Holmes said. \u201cAny chance to see them is amazing.\u201d Holmes was among many fans who joined the presale queue for both the Rose Bowl show and their European dates. Holmes said it was nerve-racking, but he eventually secured tickets to see the band at both Wembley Stadium and here in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI feel so lucky that right now is when they\u2019re getting back together because it all just sort of culminated in this crazy event that everyone\u2019s talking about,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cMy family\u2019s from the U.K. And obviously [Oasis], in the \u201890s, was the biggest band in the world, but also the biggest band in the U.K. And they\u2019re a huge part of U.K. culture still.\u201d\n\nSenior Hazel Sepenuk was equally enthused after the band announced its comeback tour. Much like Holmes, Sepenuk jumped at the chance to see them live in Manchester but was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cI was ecstatic because I tried to get the presale code for England, the Manchester dates and I didn\u2019t get it,\u201d Sepenuk said. \u201cSo I was like, well, guess I\u2019m either gonna have to sell my house and buy tickets, or hopefully they come to North America.\u201d And much to her delight, that\u2019s exactly what they did. Sepenuk knew seeing Oasis was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience, so when tickets went live for the Rose Bowl shows, she wasted no time joining the wait. Despite Ticketmaster\u2019s never-ending queue, and various internet issues, Sepenuk used her presale code to secure enough tickets for herself and her entire family.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m ecstatic, but it\u2019s just annoying because I have to wait a whole year,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that sucks, but it\u2019ll be worth the wait.

(Photo by Jason Goode) \n\nBy April Aguilera and Olivia Hau October 03, 2024 at 6:06 pm PDT\n\nThe 2024 general election is just over a month away. With the deadline rapidly approaching, first-time voters may feel slightly overwhelmed. According to a recent Harvard Youth Poll, 56% of young Americans are \u201cdefinitely\u201d planning to vote in the election. That number jumps to 72% among those already registered to vote. But for many first-time voters, questions still remain. To ease potential confusion, Annenberg Media has put together a guide to help prepare students to head to the polls.\n\nRegistering to vote\nIn order to vote, students first have to be registered. TurboVote makes it easy for students to check their registration, see what\u2019s on the ballot and request a ballot to vote by mail, regardless of their state of residence. When choosing between voting in their hometown versus where they\u2019re going to college, students should consider what particular issues or policies are important in either place, who is on the ballot and which location is more convenient for them.\n\nOut-of-state students\nIf you are an out-of-state student and want to vote in your hometown, use your college address when requesting your mail-in ballot. Note some states allow you to change your address once per year. Most states will allow voters who are away at college to request a mail-in ballot if they cannot vote in person. California mails ballots to all registered voters automatically. If you will be in your hometown during the election, you can use this online polling place locator to find a convenient location.\n\nStudents studying abroad\nStudents currently studying abroad can find out more information on absentee voting by visiting the Federal Voting Assistance Program website.\n\nVoting in California\nThe L.A. County Registrar of Voters (ROV) manages all elections and oversees voter registration, management and other election administration. The registration deadline for voting by mail is October 21, but if someone misses that deadline, they can vote on November 5 at any of the in-person L.A. County vote centers. Eligibility requirements \u2014 such as U.S. citizenship status and being over 18\u2014 may restrict a student\u2019s eligibility to vote. Mike Sanchez, the senior public information specialist at the ROV, said that as long as eligibility requirements are met, anyone can register to vote at any time.\n\n\u201cIf there is anyone who doesn\u2019t have internet access, there are physical forms available at most government offices, and those can be returned at any time,\u201d he said. Sanchez also encouraged voters to make a voting plan using an online tool from the ROVs office which walks voters through the process from start to finish, sending reminders along the way.\n\nVoting by mail\nMail-in ballots are automatically sent to every single registered voter in California by October 21. Those ballots can be mailed through the United States Postal Service or dropped at a drop box (there\u2019s one in the Village) or vote center. Each individual state has different tools for ballot tracking. In California, the state offers a tracking resource called \u201cWhere\u2019s my Ballot?\u201d Once subscribed, the site sends voters a text message or email notification when their ballot has been mailed. Additionally, when the ballot gets returned, the voter will receive a notification alerting them their vote has been counted.\n\n\u201cWe definitely encourage folks to subscribe to that,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cIt really is an amazing tool to have some visibility on where the tracking is of that particular ballot.\u201d\n\nFor those registered to vote outside of California, some states allow voters attending college out-of-state to request an absentee ballot.\n\nVoting in person\nVoting in person can be great for students who were not able to obtain a ballot or for those who missed the voter registration deadline. If a voter chooses to cast their vote in-person, there are 646 vote centers throughout the county that will open up starting October 26.\n\n\u201cThe in-person voting experience does take a few more steps to complete, so taking advantage of those early days where there isn\u2019t going to be any lines or wait time certainly helps the experience for the voters,\u201d Sanchez said. Sanchez said to anticipate long lines on Election Day.\n\n\u201cIf you know who you\u2019re going to vote for and what you\u2019re going to vote on, we encourage folks to just get that ballot back to us as soon as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter you vote\nCongratulations on voting!

It occurs most weekends from Thursday through Sunday, with a select few Wednesdays. Boney Island is open to all ages. And while USC students receive free admission to the museum with their USC ID, admission to Boney Island is not included. General admission for the attraction is $25 dollars.\n\nEngineer Rex Danyluk, the co-creator of Boney Island, described what the goal of the event is, \u201cSo many times, Halloween haunts are geared to one segment. Maybe it\u2019s for young adults who want to jump out in scares, in the hockey mask and chainsaws, or the little kids who want the pumpkin patches. We\u2019re trying to bridge it all together so the whole family can come to event and had some great memories and have something to laugh about and enjoy together.\u201d\n\nAccording to Danyluk, Boney Island started out in 2001 at the home of The Simpsons producer Rick Polizzi as a front-yard display. It was then moved to Griffith Park but was suspended during the COVID-19 shutdown. \u201cBefore COVID, I think that Boney Island was really, really growing and had this wonderful neighborhood cult following.

He described a few new additions. \u201cWe\u2019re always adding props here and there, but some of the bigger additions this year is a robot dog that walks around and can interact with people. That\u2019s been very popular,\u201d said Danyluk. \u201cBut the biggest addition is an area called Skeletown. And that\u2019s where you get to walk up a residential street, a business street, and you get to see skeletons and how they live and how they act in their in their day to day lives.

As of Thursday, the death toll has reached more than 200 people. Both Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Minnesota Gov.

Abdi said the future of the climate worries him, and he hopes for more government involvement and policies to limit the intensity of natural disasters like Hurricane Helene.\n\n\u201cOur main point is to enact policies that can limit emissions,\u201d Abdi said. \u201cI feel like the response of the floods was... more of a community effort.\u201d\n\nMorgan Richmeier, a graduate student in the building science and heritage conservation programs, said she felt like the responsibility to address climate change has fallen more on individuals.

Students living in McMorrow and other buildings in the Village, as well as the general student population, were not given any live updates or alerts by DPS as the event unfolded.\n\n\u201cI have some friends who also live in McMorrow who were scared, so they called DPS,\u201d said Adrien Van Doren, a sophomore business major living in McMorrow. \u201cThey called DPS asking what\u2019s going on, and they did not provide any info, and instead, they actually made the students more scared of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nIn the days that followed, rumors circulated about the incident, with many students still believing that a real gun was confiscated while others had no idea anything happened at all.

LAPD handled this incident.\n\n\u201cIf we were informed, we\u2019d have to determine if there was an outstanding suspect that posed a threat to the campus community,\u201d said Carlisle.\n\nOut of three students who spoke with Annenberg Media about these incidents, only one had heard about the McMorrow incident while two were familiar with the reports on Greek Row and none had heard of the fatal stabbing.\n\n\u201cI think they should be broadcasted, because if those people are still out there, people should be notified that they\u2019re still out there and they should keep an eye out for it,\u201d said Sunwoo Eom, a junior design major.\n\nMadison Price, a senior computer science major, said she feels like DPS \u201cpicks and chooses\u201d what it wants to alert students about.\n\n\u201cI feel like they report such minor incidents, as well,\u201d she said. \u201cSo then it\u2019s hard to read all the emails that they\u2019re sending out.\u201d\n\nMatthew Hrmich, a sophomore economics and mathematics major, said he found about the McMorrow and Greek Row incidents through Sidechat. This social media platform allows college students to share information and pictures anonymously to the rest of the student community.\n\n\u201cI feel like that concerns the safety of students since these are events near campus, on campus, involving USC students,\u201d he said.\n```"}

Here are some quick facts about Dr. Sheinbaum.\n\nPresident-elect Claudia Sheinbaum chooses a reporter at the early morning daily press briefing, at the National Palace in Mexico City, June 10, 2024. Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and former Mexico City mayor, will be sworn in as Mexico\u2019s first woman president on Oct. 1. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte, File)\n\nBy Valeria S Macias October 03, 2024 at 3:01 pm PDT\n\n1. She was the first female mayor of Mexico\u2019s capital, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico\n\nPrior to making history as the nation\u2019s first female president, Sheinbaum was the governor of Mexico City from 2018 to 2023. While taking on the role, she also made history as the first female mayor of Mexico City. She first entered the political sphere in 2000 when Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO), former Mexican president and Mexico City governor, appointed her as environment secretary for the country\u2019s capital. In 2015 she also made history as the first woman elected for the district of Tlalpan in Mexico City.\n\nDuring her governing role in Mexico City, Sheinbaum successfully reduced homicides and other violent crimes, with intentional homicides dropping by 51% during her tenure. She improved public transportation with projects like the Cableb\u00fas and expanded bike lanes, targeting underserved areas. However, these achievements were overshadowed by accidents in the city\u2019s metro, including a deadly collapse on Line 12. She launched initiatives like \u201cPilares,\u201d which provided community spaces for education and skills training in marginalized areas. While some programs were celebrated, others, like the controversial replacement of daycare services with cash handouts, were criticized.\n\n2. Claudia Sheinbaum studied at UC Berkeley\n\nThe politician also has ties to American universities, more specifically, the University of California, Berkeley. Sheinbaum spent her time at UC Berkeley as a researcher while studying for her PhD at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in the 1990s. She spent four years at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), where she worked in the Energy Technologies Area. During her tenure, Sheinbaum analyzed energy-use in buildings and the Mexican transportation sector, contributing to research in sustainable energy practices.\n\nThis academic and research experience at Berkeley, along with her Ph.D. in Energy Engineering, shaped her focus on environmental sustainability and energy policy throughout her political career, particularly during her tenure as Mexico City\u2019s governor.\n\n3. 2007 Nobel Prize winner\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum was part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) team that, along with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. The prize recognized their efforts to build and disseminate knowledge about man-made climate change and to lay the groundwork for the measures needed to counteract it.\n\nAs a researcher and environmental scientist, Sheinbaum contributed to the IPCC\u2019s work on energy efficiency and climate policy. Her work played a role in the international understanding of global warming and its solutions. The IPCC\u2019s reports were instrumental in bringing global attention to the dangers of human-induced climate change and the measures needed to address it. Sheinbaum\u2019s research focused on sustainable energy practices, including energy efficiency in buildings and transportation, as well as policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n4. Protests at Stanford\n\nIn the early 1990s, Claudia Sheinbaum lived in California with her family while conducting research at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. During her time there, Sheinbaum experienced what it meant to be an academic as an immigrant living in the United States. She got involved with campus protests including one against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that had been criticized by the left for their opposition to Mexican industries and agriculture.\n\nA viral photo from The Stanford Daily\u2019s front page in 1991 shows Sheinbaum holding a sign that reads \u201cFair trade and democracy now!\u201d as she protests against a speech given by the Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari at Stanford University. At the time, Sheinbaum and many left-leaning Mexicans believed that NAFTA would harm Mexican industries and agriculture.\n\n5. First president with a Jewish background\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum\u2019s election as Mexico\u2019s first female president also marks her as the country\u2019s first Jewish president. Sheinbaum comes from a Jewish family; her maternal grandparents immigrated from Bulgaria, and her paternal grandparents fled from Lithuania before the Holocaust. However, Sheinbaum does not practice the religion and identifies with her Jewish heritage primarily in cultural terms.\n\nHer presidency represents a noteworthy moment for the Jewish community in Mexico, given the country\u2019s predominantly Catholic population. Given her Jewish background, Sheinbaum\u2019s stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict is complex and has evolved over time. She supports the two-state solution and has previously criticized Israeli military actions, particularly during the 2014 Gaza conflict, condemning the killing of Palestinian civilians.\n\nHowever, since the recent violence beginning in October 2023, she has faced criticism for her silence regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, condemning only the initial attacks by Hamas without addressing the subsequent violence. However, Sheinbaum has expressed her stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict in the past. In a 2009 op-ed piece with \u2018La Jornada\u2019, a Mexican newspaper, Sheinbaum expressed her frustration regarding the three-week war that Israel conducted against the Palestinian enclave.\n\n\u201cBecause of my Jewish origin, because of my love for Mexico, and because I feel like a citizen of the world, I share with millions the desire for justice, equality, fraternity and peace, and therefore, I can only see with horror the images of the state bombings...No reason justifies the murder of Palestinian civilians. Nothing, nothing, nothing, can justify the murder of a child,\u201d writes Sheinbaum.\n\n6. Partido Morena (party coalitions in this election)\n\nThe Morena party, short for Movimiento Regeneraci\u00f3n Nacional (National Regeneration Movement), was founded in 2011 by Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO), who later became the President of Mexico in 2018. The Morena party is Mexico\u2019s largest left-wing political party, characterized by its anti-neoliberal and populist stance. It emphasizes human rights, ethnic and cultural diversity, and environmental issues.\n\nIn the recent elections, Morena formed a coalition with several other left-leaning parties to bolster their electoral chances and ensure a unified front against opposition candidates. This collaboration allowed them to effectively leverage their combined resources and voter bases, contributing to Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s significant victory and reinforcing the party\u2019s influence in Mexican politics.\n\nThe recent elections have not only reinforced Morena\u2019s dominance at the state level but also enabled the continuation of its presidential legacy with Claudia Sheinbaum, who won with over 59% of the votes.\n\n7. Long history of political activism\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum\u2019s activism has deep roots, beginning with her upbringing in a politically active family. Her parents were prominent figures in Mexico\u2019s 1968 student movement, which culminated in the tragic Tlatelolco massacre, where hundreds of student demonstrators were killed by the government just before the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.\n\nInspired by her parent\u2019s activism, Sheinbaum began her own efforts from a young age. At 15, she volunteered to assist mothers in search of their missing children, a cause linked to the country\u2019s long history of gang-related violence and disappearances.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Yana Savitsky\nOctober 03, 2024 at 2:21 pm PDT\n\nDETROIT \u2014 Jorge Palafox registered to vote three weeks ago at a bus station. He works construction four days a week with his dad. Every other day, he attends community college to take English classes and study auto mechanics. The 18-year-old said he remains undecided on who to choose for president in one of the most critical battlegrounds in the race for the White House. His dad keeps asking, but Palafox says he still needs more information.\n\n\u201cMore money for me, for the people,\u201d said the Mexican immigrant on what he wants for the future. While Palafox said former President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies seem \u201cradical\u201d at times, he just wants to \u201cvote for the person who [will] improve the economy.\u201d Palafox said he just doesn\u2019t know who that person is yet: Trump, or Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nConversations with dozens of other young voters in Michigan over the last week revealed a growing sense of disillusionment and uncertainty about the Nov. 5 presidential election, which is now less than five weeks away. At campaign stops, football games, college campuses and protests in the swing state, Generation Z voters, or those aged 18 to 29, said they had concerns about both nominees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re f-----d, basically,\u201d said Jo Blocton, 22, who voted \u201cuncommitted\u201d in the Democratic primary. Blocton is one of more than 100,000 Michigan voters from the \u201cuncommitted\u201d movement who protested President Joe Biden\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s bombing campaign in response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, a militant group designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since, according to the UN.\n\nThe February \u201cuncommitted\u201d effort has only strengthened in the months since Biden dropped out of the race, as evidenced by a protest last week in Dearborn. Michigan is home to the nation\u2019s largest concentration of Arab Americans, an important voting bloc that both Harris and Trump are attempting to win over in the swing state. But students like Blocton, who was an active member of a pro-Palestinian encampment at Wayne State University earlier this year, aren\u2019t convinced. Harris hasn\u2019t diverted much from Biden\u2019s policies in the Middle East, even as escalation rises.\n\nHundreds of green and red Lebanese flags waved in tandem to Palestinian flags at the rally. More than 1,000 people, many of them with family in Lebanon, came to protest an Israeli offensive against Hezbollah. Several attendees blamed Harris and Biden for U.S. arms shipments to Israel, whose airstrikes in Lebanon have already caused over 1,500 civilian casualties, according to the UN.\n\nHundreds wave Lebanese flags at a rally to protest recent Israeli airstrikes against Hezbollah, at the Henry Ford Centennial Library in Dearborn, Michigan on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024. (Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nThe question for many in this group isn\u2019t who to vote for; it\u2019s whether to vote at all. Some said Trump isn\u2019t equipped to mitigate the conflicts and restore peace, but Harris\u2019 actions are incomprehensible. Gen Z attendees were outspoken with reporters: neither of the nominees can expect their vote come November.\n\nNearly 1.3 million Gen Zers are registered to vote in Michigan, according to Michigan\u2019s Secretary of State. Biden won the state by a narrow margin \u2014 just over 150,000 votes \u2014 in the 2020 presidential election, where nearly 16% of the total votes were cast by youth.\n\nBlocton, a lifelong resident of Wayne County, is studying psychology, with a minor in music. The fifth year student opened up about the presidential race last week in between classes at Wayne State. They are scared of moving to Florida for graduate school next year. Blocton said they \u201cfeel very pressured\u201d to vote for Harris and protect reproductive rights. A Harris presidency is \u201cbetter than fascism,\u201d they said.\n\nOthers support Trump, and cite something he\u2019s been using on the campaign trail all year: there were no wars during his time in office. \u201cYou want to kill people in your countries? That\u2019s okay. But if you do, I\u2019m going to charge you [a] 200% tariff to do business with the United States,\u201d Trump said at a town hall Friday in Warren, Michigan. \u201cThey called me back two days later. Sir, we\u2019ve made peace.\u201d\n\nThe crowd packed into the community college in Macomb County nodded in approval. Hundreds of supporters wait outside for Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump to speak at a campaign event on Friday at Macomb Community College in Warren, Michigan. (Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nChristina Paciocco, 25, waited hours to see Trump speak. She came to the town hall alone, but bonded with another mother in line. Paciocco has two kids, aged four and five, and said she has struggled to support them after a recent car accident. She said her children\u2019s health benefits were just cut, while prices and energy bills are up. \u201cI\u2019m out working all the time,\u201d said Paciocco, who has never voted in a presidential election before. She is currently unemployed, but takes odd jobs in the service industry. \u201cThere needs to be a change.\u201d\n\nUnder Trump, who promises to crack down on immigration and secure the U.S.-Mexican border, Paciocco hopes her next four years in Macomb County will be easier. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d she said. \u201cThey take from us.\u201d\n\nTrump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have done several events in Michigan over the last week, and he plans to return again next week. Harris has been to the state several times and is returning on Thursday. On Saturday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, met with students from the University of Michigan.\n\nEric Veal Jr., 20, was among the group welcoming Walz at the airport. He also works for the Harris-Walz campaign as an operation and leadership intern. \u201cVoters are excited to see the fresh energy on the campaign trail,\u201d said Veal, who told a reporter that he had spoken with Walz about educational equity. Veal\u2019s mother is an elementary school teacher, so he values Walz\u2019s background as a former educator. \u201cWe have a lot at stake this year,\u201d said Veal. \u201cStudents are backing Kamala\u2019s message of \u2018We\u2019re not going back.\u2019\u201d\n\nA recent poll by the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Institute of Politics shows Harris had a 31-point lead over Trump among Gen Z voters. Young Democrats are more likely to vote than young Republicans, with Harris outperforming Trump on key issues of climate change, abortion and gun violence prevention.\n\nThe race is going to be decided in pockets of this state with its 15 electoral votes. It\u2019s up to Harris and Trump to motivate their people and convince undecided voters in fewer than 35 days. Palafox knows it. Like many other first-time voters, he\u2019s just excited to finally cast a ballot in November \u2014 once he figures out which person he wants to be president.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/10/03/hat-trick-matchday-6/", "response": "```\nHat Trick: Matchday 6\n\nBy Marco Haynes\nOctober 03, 2024 at 1:26 pm PDT\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d is a column by Marco Haynes about the 2024-25 English Premier League in which he breaks down the week\u2019s four most consequential talking points.\n\nSuperstar Cole Palmer fires four goals past Brighton\nIf we voted to anoint the current best player in the Premier League last season, the result might\u2019ve seemed obvious: Erling Haaland. His clinical goal-scoring form helped City capture the 2023-24 title and this season outscore most Premier League clubs. But the debate has a new candidate. Enter: Cole Palmer.\n\nThe Blues playmaker is already breaking records this season and even keeping pace with the Norwegian striker for the top goalscorer spot. This past weekend, he became the first player in Premier League history to score four goals before half-time in Chelsea\u2019s match against Brighton & Hove Albion. The English attacking midfielder has racked up six goals from six games. The Blues sensation is only four behind Haaland in the race for the Golden Boot. He also contributed four assists this season.\n\nPalmer tore apart the reliant Seagulls\u2019 defense, which had only conceded four goals in six games before Saturday. Centerbacks Lewis Dunk and Adam Webster struggled to match the speed of the Chelsea attack, and the quality playmaking and finishing Palmer brought to the game, which won him PFA Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year in the Premier League last season. Chelsea defeated Brighton 4-2, putting them in fourth place, only two points behind Liverpool in first.\n\nIn contrast to last year\u2019s chaos, the Blues seemed to have turned their form around early this season and have forced their way into the title race. Palmer is a pivotal contributor to that positive form. Chelsea return to action against Nottingham Forest at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.\n\nCaptain Bruno Fernandes wins case to overturn red card\nA day many Manchester United fans will want to forget went from bad to worse in 45 minutes. Down 2-0 against Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford, United\u2019s captain Fernandes was sent off for the first time in his Man United career after lunging in with a dangerous tackle on midfielder James Maddison minutes before half-time. However, on Tuesday, Man United won its appeal against Fernandes\u2019 sending-off.\n\nReferee Chris Kavanagh showed the player a straight red card and VAR supported the decision at the stadium. On replay, Fernandes appeared to slip after tackling Maddison with his foot, which Kavanagh deemed to be in a dangerous position. The decision to appeal seemed saved by the fact Fernandes slipped and caused less contact, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact it was still a wild challenge.\n\nThe Portuguese international will now be available for the upcoming three games against Aston Villa, Brentford and West Ham United. The home side ended up losing 3-0 against Tottenham and dropped to 12th in the league table, sending them closer to the relegation zone rather than a European qualification place.\n\nFernandes\u2019 season has been underwhelming so far, given the expectations on him to be the creative spark and captain of the squad. He\u2019s been unable to find the back of the net and only provided one assist in six matches. Fans will expect him to come back from his non-suspension with urgency and fight, which the whole squad had lacked against Tottenham.\n\nRed Devils manager Erik ten Hag is under pressure and Fernandes hasn\u2019t helped take the pressure off, with fans clamoring for ten Hag to get axed. The club has collected its joint-fewest points ever in the Premier League through six games \u2014 the same number they accumulated in the 2013-14 and 2020-21 seasons.\n\nManchester United will travel to Villa Park to play Aston Villa on Sunday.\n\nBryan Mbeumo is the new Ivan Toney\nStar striker and England international Ivan Toney secured a $53 million transfer to Saudi Arabian club Al Ahli over the summer, sparking questions about who could replace the pivotal Brentford forward. The answer? Bryan Mbeumo.\n\nThe Cameroon international scored his fifth goal this season with an acrobatic finish against West Ham United in a 1-1 draw at the Gtech Community Stadium on Saturday. He sits third for most goals scored in the Premier League so far this season.\n\nWith forward Yoane Wissa injured and newly recruited attacking midfielder Fabio Carvalho still adjusting to life at Brentford, Mbeumo has been responsible for trying to produce the same numbers as his ex-teammate Toney. Last season, Mbeumo scored a solid nine goals and set up six for his teammates. This year, he\u2019s already scored more than half last year\u2019s tally and seems like the spark Brentford needs to finish mid-table and avoid the drop.\n\nThe club currently sit in 12th position in the league table. If his season produces high goal scoring numbers, other clubs will surely ask about his price tag. He\u2019s already a consistent starter at the Bees and settled into the physicality and speed of the Premier League, so maybe a step up is in his future.\n\nBrentford returns to the Gtech against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday.\n\nDwight McNeil brace secures Everton\u2019s first victory in the league\nEverton manager Sean Dyche can now feel relief from the pressure thanks to Dwight McNeil\u2019s second-half performance in front of goal, which led the Toffees to their first win of the season on Saturday. McNeil always seems to come up when Everton needed him most, and against Crystal Palace this weekend he scored a sensational long-range shot that curled into the top left corner and then struck the back of the net again from close range to complete the comeback.\n\nIt was Dyche\u2019s first comeback victory in his stint coaching Everton. The club has dangerously neared relegation in recent seasons and Dyche will be hard-pressed to keep Everton up again this season. But spirits were surely lifted after a 2-1 win against Palace that moved the club out of the relegation zone and into 16th position.\n\nAnd off the pitch, this past week brought news that looks to have resurrected a club the fans felt was going nowhere. On Monday, a new era began for Everton, as new owners Blue Heaven Holdings and The Friedkin Group bought out the majority stake in the Merseyside club. Plus, versatile center-back Jarrad Branthwaithe returned to the squad after missing the start of the season due to a groin issue.\n\nA win in the first game for the new ownership group is a positive sign of things to come for the blue side of Liverpool. Everton return to Goodison Park to face Newcastle United on Saturday.\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Butch Dill)\n\nBy Matt Kim October 02, 2024 at 10:42 pm PDT\n\nIn your fantasy football leagues, it should be clear at this point whether your team is contending for the championship or having to do your league\u2019s last-place punishment. For me, the latter has become an unfortunate reality and that tells you that no matter how much dedication you put into fantasy, sometimes it\u2019s just not meant to be. Managers who are struggling to begin the season, including myself, shouldn\u2019t just give up, as there are plenty of moves you can still make to give yourself a chance.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to sell players that you drafted high or have a personal connection with. However, when push comes to shove, you need to make the right decision to set yourself up for future success.\n\nSell High Candidate No. 1: Breece Hall\n\nThe Jets\u2019 offense has been painfully average to begin the season. Some of that can be attributed to quarterback Aaron Rodgers, as he\u2019s still finding his groove coming off a torn Achilles. Running back Breece Hall was able to thrive in a dreadful offense last year, finishing as the overall RB2 in full PPR leagues. Much of that success, however, was through the air as the lackluster quarterback play directed plenty of short targets and check-downs his way.\n\nWith lofty expectations coming into this year, Hall was a clear first-round pick in all redraft leagues. While he\u2019s still performing at an RB1 level, some underlying factors may hinder his production. The main concern will be the Jets\u2019 tough schedule, as for the next three weeks, they\u2019ll play the Vikings, Bills and Patriots. All are top-10 in the NFL in points against, so that\u2019ll limit Hall\u2019s touchdown upside, along with the emergence of fellow running back Braelon Allen.\n\nAllen, The fourth-round pick in last year\u2019s draft, has slowly crept his way into competing with Hall for snaps, as he\u2019s tallied 30 or more rushing yards in three straight contests. In Sunday\u2019s matchup against the Broncos, Hall only received ten carries and was stuffed on the one-yard line multiple times. With playoff aspirations, the Jets are going to do everything in their power to generate points, even if that means turning to the rookie to get the job done.\n\nHead coach Robert Saleh has already suggested that Allen might get a more prominent role in the offense, and with Hall\u2019s early ineffectiveness on the ground, managers should be looking for good deals based on his name value. With Hal, managers shouldn\u2019t be panicking, but if you can get a haul in return, it may be time to explore some other options.\n\nSell High Candidate No. 2: Chuba Hubbard\n\nThis Panthers\u2019 offense has made strides in turning their season around after head coach Dave Canales benched second-year quarterback Bryce Young in favor of veteran Andy Dalton. In the two games since the replacement, the Panthers have scored a combined 60 points and Hubbard has had consecutive contests with at least 100 rushing yards against suspect Bengals and Raiders teams.\n\nAlong with the hefty rushing-yard totals, he\u2019s found the paydirt twice and looks to be involved in the passing game. We\u2019ve seen Hubbard emerge as a starting running back multiple times throughout his tenure in Carolina, but he\u2019s never had a firm grasp on the job.\n\nThis opportunity to sell high on Hubbard isn\u2019t a knock on his skill, but rather his overall situation. Canales has already gone on record to say that Young will start again this season and rookie running back Jonathan Brooks is slated to come off injury reserve after next week. Brooks was the first running back taken in the 2024 NFL Draft, and that was with concerns due to an ACL tear he suffered in college.\n\nThe former Texas Longhorn is an explosive playmaker and as the season goes on, the team will look to give him plenty of opportunities in what will be another lost season for the Panthers. All of these factors will limit his season-long workload, as well as his overall upside once Young returns.\n\nThe Panthers will almost always be playing from behind, so this will provide a negative gamescript for him on the ground. Hubbard is playing like an RB1 right now, so if you can sell him for anywhere near that price, you\u2019ll be satisfied once the Panthers regress.\n\nSell High Candidate No. 3: Dallas Goedert\n\nThrough four weeks, Goedert is a TE1 thanks in part to a 27-point performance in Week 3. The tight end position has been abysmal in fantasy, as we\u2019ve seen notable stars like Travis Kelce, Mark Andrews and Sam LaPorta put up subpar numbers.\n\nWith managers desperately looking for an answer at tight end, it\u2019s the perfect time to deal away Goedert for a hefty price. In his seven-year career, Goedert has never finished inside the top 10 for tight ends as he\u2019s had to compete for targets with names like DeVonta Smith and A.J. Brown.\n\nIn Week 3, however, Brown was ruled out with a hamstring injury and Smith exited the game early with a concussion. Due to the lack of receiving depth, Goedert received 11 targets and grabbed 10 of them for 87 yards.\n\nHowever, the Eagles are on a bye week, giving Smith and Brown plenty of time to prepare for their Week 6 matchup against the Browns. With both receivers healthy, Goedert will fall down the pecking order for head coach Nick Siriani\u2019s offense and won\u2019t be able to sustain his position as TE1.\n\nGoedert\u2019s role in the red zone is also limited, as he\u2019s never finished with more than five touchdowns in a season before. With the tush push and Saquon\u2019s usage on the goal line, Goedert\u2019s overall production is capped.\n\nManagers should look to trade him away for a mid- to high-end RB2/WR2s as streaming tight ends through the waiver wire may be the play throughout the rest of the season. If you were to trade away Goedert, look to target names like Cole Kmet and Zach Ertz as both have had proven success as receivers, as well as a prominent role in the red zone.\n\nThe difference between Goedert and the aforementioned tight ends will be negligible once the Eagles are fully healthy and getting another starting-caliber player in return will only strengthen your roster.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/10/02/key-takeaways-from-the-walz-vance-debate/", "response": "```\nKey takeaways from the Walz-Vance debate\n\nTensions and mics were heated Tuesday night as vice presidential candidates Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota went head-to-head during the only vice presidential debate of this election. The night was spent exchanging attacks on the other\u2019s running mates, presenting contrasting proposed policies and offering their opponent civility and respect. The 90-minute debate hosted by CBS and moderated by Norah O\u2019Donnell and Margaret Brennan comes as there\u2019s less than five weeks until the election and will possibly be the last event between the two campaigns. While Vice President Kamala Harris has a slight advantage over former President Donald Trump in national polls, the margins are slim and reveal a very tight race.\n\nThe debate between the Ohio senator and Minnesota governor was a distinctly different environment from the Harris-Trump debate earlier in September. Here are five takeaways from the debate.\n\nVance and Walz keep civility between each other\nBoth candidates have campaigned on very different policies and messages, however throughout the night, both were mostly polite with few interruptions while the other was speaking even with the mics being unmuted. This was a drastically different dynamic compared to both the Biden-Trump debate and the Harris-Trump debate, where both candidates spoke over each other and were visibly frustrated throughout the night. There was even a tender moment from Vance after Walz shared that his son witnessed a shooting at a community center. \u201cTim, first of all, I didn\u2019t know that your 17-year-old witnessed the shooting,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d\n\nBoth attack and defend their running mates\nDespite their absence, both Harris and Trump were referenced extensively throughout the night with both debaters playing offense and defense. Vance attacked Harris on her handling of the Southern border and referred to her as the \u201cborder czar,\u201d a label given to Harris by Trump. Vance said Harris\u2019 handling of the border has led to a record number of fentanyl entering the U.S. Walz responded by claiming that Trump was the one standing in the way of solving the border crisis. \u201cI believe Senator Vance wants to solve this,\u201d Walz said. \u201cBut by standing with Donald Trump and not working together to find a solution, it becomes a talking point. And when it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanize and villainize other human beings.\u201d\n\nVance interjects after a fact check by moderator\nContinuing the heated debate about immigration, Vance brought up Springfield, Ohio, and blamed undocumented immigrants for high housing prices and overwhelmed schools and hospitals. Moderator Brennan fact checked Vance\u2019s claim. \u201cTo clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status. Temporary protected status.\u201d What was supposed to be the end of the discussion about immigration caused Vance to interrupt the moderators and was frustrated that he was fact checked. \u201cThe rules were that you guys weren\u2019t going to fact check, and since you\u2019re fact checking me, I think it\u2019s important to say what\u2019s actually going on,\u201d Vance said, talking over the moderators. As Vance continued to interrupt the moderators to explain himself and Walz also attempted to intervene, both candidates\u2019 mics were cut.\n\nWalz capitalizes on abortion issue\nIn the days leading up to the debate, Walz told people close to him that he was nervous and told Harris that he was a bad debater. Walz appeared nervous at the beginning of the debate, but as the debate continued, he became more confident and made his strongest arguments when the issue of abortion came up. Walz shared detailed stories of three different women who he used to argue the harmful and deadly impacts brought by the overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court. \u201cThis is basic human right,\u201d Walz said. \u201cWe have seen maternal mortality skyrocket in Texas, outpacing many other countries in the world. This is about health care. In Minnesota, we are ranked first in health care for a reason. We trust women. We trust doctors.\u201d Vance, on the other hand, called on the Republican party to work towards regaining the trust of voters on the issue, saying he and Trump are striving to achieve that. \u201cI want us, as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies.\u201d During the debate, Trump said he would veto a federal abortion ban via an all-caps post across social media platforms. Though this is the first time Trump has taken a definitive stance on vetoing a federal ban, both he and Vance have highlighted their views of reproductive rights being left up to the states.\n\nVance and his \u201cdamning non-answer\u201d about the 2020 election\nNear the end of the debate, on the topic of protecting democracy, Vance was asked whether or not he would challenge this year\u2019s election results even if every Governor certifies the results. He failed to answer the question directly and said censorship was the larger threat to democracy. Walz criticized Trump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge his loss of the 2020 election, and called for a peaceful transfer of power regardless of who wins. Walz later directly asked Vance if Trump lost the election to which Vance responded \u201cTim, I\u2019m focused on the future.\u201d \u201cThat is a damning non answer,\u201d said Walz. \u201cAmerica, I think you\u2019ve got a really clear choice on this election of who\u2019s going to honor that democracy and who\u2019s going to honor Donald Trump.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Awo Jama)\n\nBy David Sosa and Lalou Ratsimihah\nOctober 02, 2024 at 6:42 pm PDT\n\nSenior Tali Duckworth is going all in on her dreams as a musician. Duckworth, studying classical trumpet performance, said she was pursuing a minor in music industry to have multiple career opportunities in the music industry. Duckworth decided to drop the minor this year to be a pit musician in a Broadway show. Having one major ended up working out for Duckworth, but for other artists, including students pursuing multiple fields through double majoring or minoring, the uncertainty of the entertainment industry has made breaking into two areas almost necessary to succeed.\n\nIn the fallout of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, film and TV production is down 7%, according to a report by the Los Angeles Times. As for the music industry, less prominent artists and bands often have a hard time making a living out of music, with setbacks such as the high costs of touring increasing and music streaming services paying a fraction of a cent per stream.\n\nA career in the arts can be riddled with uncertainty, pushing students to learn other skills they can fall back on, like Ryan DeMotte, whose dream job has changed. \u201cTouring musician,\u201d DeMotte said at first. \u201cNow, economic consultant.\u201d DeMotte finished his undergraduate major in economics and is currently pursuing a minor in jazz studies. DeMotte is also pursuing a master\u2019s in applied economics and econometrics.\n\nSome students choose to double major or minor in order to take advantage of the resources available to them at USC. \u201cEven though I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever play music professionally or anything more than a hobby on the side [or] full-time going forward, I still want to take advantage of my opportunity while at USC to take Thornton classes and meet Thornton students,\u201d DeMotte said.\n\nDeMotte, like many students, says he views minoring and double majoring as an outlet to explore his creativity, rather than a means to a career. It is common for students to pick up minors and double majors out of passion, rather than fear of failure.\n\nBen Glickman is a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies and double minoring in Italian and the entertainment industry. \u201cI wanted something business-related on my resume, which is why I added entertainment industry, and I happened to really enjoy studying Italian, which is why I added that minor,\u201d Glickman said.\n\nFor some students, minoring can help their chances outside of the U.S. entertainment industry or traditional career paths. Torianna Jones, a senior studying in popular music performance and minoring in East Asian language and literature, said she wants to be an international musician, and the language classes at USC are helping her realize that dream.\n\nThe extra coursework is not always easy, though. \u201cIt gets a little hard, especially with all the language classes because they are usually four days out of the five days of the week,\u201d Jones said.\n\nSophomore Kalena Lenz is studying the business of cinematic arts, a major offered at few universities, in order to be involved in the entertainment industry. \u201cI feel like [the major] was very open to me being able to pursue what I like and find that within the entertainment industry,\u201d Lenz said.\n\nChasing dreams in a volatile industry comes with financial risk, leading many students to say a backup plan is necessary. Duckworth said, \u201cThere isn\u2019t always super consecutive work [in this industry], so having a second option was very interesting for me.\u201d\n```"}

The National Weather Service has issued an excessive heat warning for L.A. County and surrounding regions through Friday, with temperatures expected to soar to 115 degrees in some areas.\n\nPasadena Fire Chief Chad Augustin has advice on how to stay cool during the heat wave. \u201cWe want to encourage you to drink water regularly, especially as it\u2019s hot and if you\u2019re working outdoors,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t wait until you\u2019re thirsty, because by that time, you\u2019re already behind the eight ball when it comes to dehydration. Also remember that certain medications can increase your risk for dehydration or heat illness.\u201d\n\nAugustin also urges people to think about their furry friends. \u201cThe asphalt today and the peak of the heat will probably be around 150 degrees, and that can burn their feet in a matter of seconds,\u201d Augustin said. \u201cSo a good way to do it is use the back of your hand to touch the asphalt. If it\u2019s too hot for your hand, then it\u2019s too hot for your furry friends.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Los Angeles county has opened cooling centers for anyone to access. These cooling centers are important for people who don\u2019t have access to air conditioning. They are located in senior or recreation centers. People are encouraged to bring their pets, games or lunch.\n\n\u201cOur cooling centers provide a safe place,\u201d said Rose Watson, a member of the L.A. City Department of Recreation and Parks. \u201cIt provides air condition and space for individuals you know, who may not have access to adequate cooling at home. And this, you know, help prevent illnesses, heat exhaustion. It keeps help people stay hydrated.\u201d\n\nAt USC, sophomore Joseph Kuo listed a few ways he\u2019s planning to beat the record-breaking heat. \u201cI plan to go to the beach this weekend, Manhattan Beach, to be exact, to just cool down, hang out on the beach, get some water on me,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting some ice cream, that helps, too ... some boba as well. So tons, tons of option [to] cool down during the heat.\u201d\n\nAnother way to beat the heat is to go to a pool at a local recreational center.

{"key": "/2024/10/02/hunting-the-heisman-travis-hunter-holds-on-to-the-top-spot-after-win-against-ucf/", "response": "```\nColumn Hunting the Heisman: Travis Hunter holds on to the top spot after win against UCF\n\nThe SEC starts to take over the list as Jalen Milroe finds himself in the second position.\n\nColorado wide receiver Travis Hunter (12) sets up for a play against Central Florida during the second half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Sept. 28, 2024, in Orlando, Fla. (Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler\nOctober 02, 2024 at 6:19 pm PDT\n\nIt was only a matter of time before two top-tier teams went head-to-head and a star would break out. The Alabama-Georgia football game was marked on everybody\u2019s calendars as a clash between two of the greatest collegiate programs in sports history. Under new head coach Kalen DeBoer, the Tide scored another win against Georgia head coach Kirby Smart, a former Nick Saban prot\u00e9g\u00e9, which propelled redshirt junior quarterback Jalen Milroe up the Heisman rankings this week.\n\nThis week\u2019s top three\n\nTravis Hunter, Colorado, WR/CB\nWith a great win against the University of Central Florida, the Colorado Buffaloes improved their record to 4-1. Although Hunter did not reach 100 receiving yards in the game, his 89 yards on nine receptions with a touchdown still keep him at the top of our list. Defensively, Hunter continues to impress and tallied two solo tackles in the game plus an interception \u2014 his second so far this year. Playing on both sides of the ball is brutal, especially at the volume at which Hunter does it. He was on the field for 128 snaps against the Knights, moving his total to 660 across five games. That\u2019s an eyebrow-raising number and gives Hunter a chance to be the rare cornerback with a chance to win the Heisman Trophy. Hunter\u2019s priority \u2014 other than keeping up his impressive play \u2014 should be to avoid an injury at all costs. Even though the award is known to some as the most valuable quarterback trophy because of how often that position wins it, Hunter is forcing the committee\u2019s hand with the stats he\u2019s accumulating on both sides of the ball. The only way he would not win at this point is if he suffers an injury that sidelines him for more than a game.\n\nJalen Milroe, Alabama, QB\nWatch out, Hunter, here comes the SEC train. In a roller coaster 41-34 win against the Georgia Bulldogs, Milroe became the first quarterback this season to play a high-level team and put up numbers that cement him as an option for the trophy. He threw for 374 yards, his most so far this season, and completed 27 of 33 passes against a legitimate Bulldog defense. Milroe\u2019s performance was enough for two touchdowns in the air. What stood out for Milroe is he also led the team in rushing yards. After last year\u2019s final play against Michigan \u2014 where Milroe was stuffed in overtime of the College Football Playoff semifinals \u2014 he\u2019s clearly worked on his scrambling game. He tucked and ran 16 times for 117 yards and scored two touchdowns on his feet. His impressive 98.5 QBR was slightly dragged down due to the interception. Still, Milroe consistently stayed calm under pressure, especially in the final minutes of the game, which always helps skyrocket a player up the list. It\u2019s been a while, but Alabama is the No. 1 team in football, and I can\u2019t say I miss saying that. But that also may work to Milroe\u2019s detriment. From here on out, he\u2019ll be watched carefully, voters ready to pick through his game with a fine comb. Any faults in the remainder of Alabama\u2019s season will fall on his back. The Crimson Tide have a bit of a break with Vanderbilt and South Carolina, but Milroe will have to make a statement in a matchup against redshirt freshman quarterback Nico Iamaleava and Tennessee on October 19.\n\nAshton Jeanty, Boise State, RB\nAfter pummeling Washington State 45-24, the Boise State Broncos have jumped to 3-1 on the season, largely thanks to junior running back Ashton Jeanty. Jeanty has put up some crazy statistics so far, rushing for 845 yards and 13 touchdowns on 82 carries. He has had two 200-plus yard games, one coming in their home opener against Georgia Southern, where he put up 267 yards and a staggering six touchdowns, and again against the Cougars, where he accounted for 259 yards and four touchdowns. It\u2019s not just against weaker foes that he has shined, however. When Boise State went to Eugene to play the Ducks, he had 192 yards and three touchdowns and was a massive part of forcing Oregon\u2019s junior kicker Atticus Sappington to make a game-winning kick as time expired. The Ducks have since climbed to No. 6 in the AP poll and show no stops of slowing down after barreling through UCLA this past weekend. Jeanty has a lot to prove before voters will consider him a top candidate, but there are many factors that are out of his hands. The first issue: the Broncos\u2019 strength of schedule. They really have nobody notable left on their calendar \u2014 the only ranked team is UNLV who squeaked in at No. 25 after the Runnin\u2019 Rebels\u2019 59-14 win against Fresno State. The other issue is that the Broncos are a non-Power Five school and, hence, are looked down upon. Despite accepting an invitation to join the new-look Pac-12 in 2026 \u2014 I could spend forever talking about why that is a bad thing \u2014 Jeanty will not be considered the best of the best solely because of his team\u2019s conference.\n\nCam Ward, Miami, QB\nAt this point, Cam Ward is actively shooting himself in the foot. In a controversial fashion, the Hurricanes beat Virginia Tech as Ward put up great stats on paper. He had 343 yards on 38 attempts, with four touchdowns in the air and one on his feet. However, if you watched the game, you would realize exactly why he has fallen out of the top three. Despite looking calm in the pocket against an average ACC team, Ward was still sacked three times and had two picks, making me double-take which jersey he was wearing. His four interceptions this season have all been abysmally bad, but this was the first time that fans and critics saw the U struggle because of it. If he plays this weekend like he did against Virginia Tech, I would have Miami on upset watch on Saturday when they head to UC Berkeley.\n```"}

USC will host various competitions at the Galen Center and the Coliseum, which will even host a portion of the opening ceremony. On Wednesday, the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy brought in a panel of security experts to talk about what it will take to make the 2028 games safe for everyone.\n\nSpeakers from the U.S. Secret Service, the FBI, and the LA28 games joined USC\u2019s public safety chief to discuss the security strategy for the games. Lauretta Hill, Assistant Vice President and Chief of Public Safety for USC, said careful coordination and cooperation between agencies will be key.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a heavy lift for the region, but we have the right people in place and planning profess to make this be the best games ever,\u201d Hill said.\n\nPanelists stressed the importance of networking across different areas of expertise, including logistics, personnel, tactical intelligence, and cyber intelligence. They said they\u2019ll use emerging technologies to communicate more quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe University Park campus itself will be involved in the 2028 games, hosting the Olympic Media Village. As the games approach, Hill encourages students and others to think about volunteering for the historic event.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a lot of opportunities for USC, not just our public safety, not just our transportation, but our students, our faculty and staff to be involved,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of volunteer opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe last time the U.S. hosted the Olympics was in 2002, when the Winter Olympics were held in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n```"}

Wagner, the co-director of Chabad, will host students and the community for prayer services and dinner on Wednesday and Thursday in celebration of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. The sound of the shofar, the ram\u2019s horn, marks the celebration of the Jewish New Year, but this year the festivities have taken on a more somber tone.\n\nFive days from Wednesday marks the first anniversary of October 7, when Hamas killed more than 1,200 people in a terrorist attack on Israeli soil. In response, USC campus organizations and security have had to make changes to their traditional Rosh Hashanah programming.\n\nWagner said this year is bittersweet with the closeness between celebration and tragic anniversary. \u201cThe way these come so close together, really, I think drives home what kind of year it\u2019s been,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cAs we mark a new year, we\u2019re also marking the first observance, the first anniversary of those terrible attacks. But not just the first anniversary of something that happened, but of something that\u2019s still very much ongoing. There are still hostages that are missing. There\u2019s still a war going on. There\u2019s still people in danger.\u201d\n\nNearly 100 Israelis, and seven Americans, remain as hostages almost one year later. On Tuesday, Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel, broadening the ongoing war in Israel, Gaza and Lebanon. Israel\u2019s response to Hamas\u2019s attack has killed over 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Associated Press.\n\nSenior music industry student Shiloh Gonsky said with the High Holy Days and the devastating anniversary happening at the same time, this is a solemn moment for the campus Jewish community. \u201cI think every Jewish holiday this year has felt like there\u2019s an added weight to how important it is to connect with our history, and the story the Torah,\u201d Gonsky said, \u201clike where we\u2019ve come from, and what we\u2019re trying to do as Jewish people, and how we exist in this world today.\n\nGonsky is a board member of the pluralistic Jewish student group Chavurah. The group will host a Rosh Hashanah picnic Friday to celebrate the holiday and will attend a memorial on October 7 in Grand Park hosted by the progressive group IfNotNow Los Angeles.\n\nHillel at USC will also hold Rosh Hashanah celebrations throughout the week. Hillel Campus Rabbi Jocee Hudson said the organization will hold prayer services and dinner on Wednesday. On Thursday, Hillel will host student leaders in prayer to honor religious pluralism on campus.\n\nHudson said she hopes Trojans take the opportunity to look back at the past year, but also to the future as part of the holiday. \u201cThe year that we have come out of, 5784, was a year that brought complexity and anguish, it brought more outrage and fissures in the community,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cWe have the opportunity in 5785 to remain aware and connected to the chaos in the world and also to choose hope.\u201d\n\nBoth Chabad and Hillel will hold ceremonial blowing of the shofar throughout the week, on and off campus. DPS Police Chief David Carlisle said he is working with leaders of the faith community, including the rabbis, to ensure a safe and open observance of the holiday. DPS will also have additional resources for the holiday and on October 7, he said.\n\n\u201cAs we approach the Jewish high holidays, we are being extra vigilant and increasing patrols, particularly around Hillel and Chabad. Next Monday, on the anniversary of the events in the Middle East, DPS will be fully staffed to address any issues that may arise,\u201d Carlisle said.\n\nOn Monday, Hillel and Chabad will jointly host an event titled \u201cUSC Remembers: October 7\u2032\u2032 in Hahn Plaza.\n\nBut for now, Wagner said, he looks toward scripture for a Rosh Hashanah message to the community. \u201cThere\u2019s a beautiful line in the Rosh Hashanah liturgy ... \u2018Let there be an end to the year and its curses. Let there begin a new year and its blessings,\u2019\u201d Wagner said.\n```"}

(Photo by Maribel Flores)\n\nOn Tuesday night, vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz squared off in a 90-minute debate, voicing their opinions on everything from the economy to reproductive rights. USC students who watched the debate said while they weren\u2019t terribly swayed by either candidate, one thing stood out: the debate between Republican Sen. Vance of Ohio and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota was decidedly civil.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it was refreshing to see two candidates who can speak clearly and concisely. I think both brought up some good points,\u201d said Michael Tashman, a junior and business administration major. Alex Buettgen, a junior double-majoring in real estate and communications, said he found the debate informative. \u201cI thought both candidates made extremely compelling points that really have me kind of torn on which way I\u2019m going to go,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that both candidates were extremely well-spoken last night.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s debate did seem like a far cry between the fiery clash last month between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump, during which the latter brought up conspiracy theories and false claims about immigrants eating pets. In the vice presidential debate, both parties came away with positives, said Gordon Stables, director of USC\u2019s Annenberg School of Journalism and former director of the Trojan Debate Squad.\n\n\u201cI do think that if you\u2019re in each party, you felt good that there were moments where your candidate came out and really made your key point,\u201d Stables said. \u201cLike I think that Governor Walz really made the impression on both the election denial, about 2020, [which] was really important, as well as humanizing the abortion issue. And I think if you\u2019re in the Vice President\u2019s camp, you\u2019re excited about that.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, \u201cthis is probably Senator Vance\u2019s best moment since he\u2019s been nominated as the vice president,\u201d Stables said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re in the Trump group, you like that you have a positive news cycle and some positive content about your vice presidential nominee.\u201d\n\nThere was no clear winner, said Lucas Simon, a junior and a communications major \u201cIt was a very, very close one,\u201d Simon said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens in the future.\u201d The general election is Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n```"}

Weemes Elementary School. The elementary school also served as an in-person voting location. (Photo by Kendall Arjoon)\n\nBy Madhri Yehiya October 02, 2024 at 5:34 pm PDT\n\nSeveral California-based activist organizations discussed how the upcoming state ballot measure, Proposition 36, may harm public safety at a virtual meeting on Tuesday morning. Also known as the Homelessness, Drug Addiction and Theft Reduction Act, Prop. 36 is one of 10 total state-wide initiatives on the California ballot this November. The measure would allow felony charges to be brought against anyone twice convicted of theft under $950 or drug-related crimes on their third offense. Both offenses have been classified as misdemeanors since the passing of Prop. 47 in 2014, following a Supreme Court ruling that required the state to reduce its incarcerated population from 180% to 137.5% of prison capacity.\n\nLex Steppling, an organizing director at the Los Angeles Community Action Network, opened the meeting with a discussion of how Prop. 47 should have been \u201cthe floor, not the ceiling\u201d for state-wide prison reform. \u201cProp. 36 is not about making anyone safer. Prop. 36 is about a reinvestment in the prison industrial complex,\u201d he said. \u201cProp. 47 was supposed to be the first step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nSteppling called it \u201cunderstandable\u201d to be feeling unsafe due to the current housing crisis across California, but noted that increasing the budget of the carceral system would only take funding away from low-income communities and exacerbate existing issues. \u201cNothing causes mental health issues more than a sense of financial and economic stress, and...nothing drives [homelessness] more than jail,\u201d he said. \u201cProp. 36 is here to try to manipulate people to be mad at the wrong people for the wrong reasons.\u201d\n\nA poll conducted by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies found that 56% of likely California voters were in favor of Prop. 36 as of August. From 2018 to 2023, the state\u2019s violent crime rate increased 15.1%. In the same timeframe, the property crime rate decreased by 3.8%.\n\nMatyos Kidane, a community organizer with Stop LAPD Spying, said Prop. 36 has partially gained traction due to the lobbying efforts of major retailers that have publicized incidents of theft within their stores. \u201cIn L.A. and in other parts of the country, [Prop. 36] has really relied on the fabrication of narratives around organized retail theft that have been largely debunked,\u201d Kidane said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for context to name the fact that large corporations like Target have always supported policing both ideologically, but also materially, through donations.\u201d\n\nThe National Retail Federation retracted its claim that close to 50% of missing merchandise in 2021 was the result of organized retail crime last December. The New York Times reported that experts estimated the value to be closer to 5%.\n\nGenevi\u00e9ve Jones-Wright, founding executive director of Community Advocates for Just and Moral Government based in San Diego, said while Prop. 36 proponents claim the law will improve public safety, the opposite is true once incarcerated individuals are released. \u201cHistory has shown us that piling on felonies does not help,\u201d she said. \u201cThey tear apart families and communities without addressing the root causes of the issues. Felony convictions saddle individuals with lifelong barriers to housing, employment and education, and nearly make reintegration impossible because of the stigma.\u201d\n\nSalil Dudani of the Civil Rights Corps \u2014 a national legal nonprofit organization that deals with incarceration issues nationwide \u2014 raised a similar point. \u201cLocking people up like this increases crime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so destabilizing to a person\u2019s life, to pluck them out of their community, to separate them from their family, to separate them from their job, and put them in a jail cell, that they become more likely to commit crime.\u201d\n\nIf Prop. 36 passes this November, the California Secretary of State\u2019s office estimates the law\u2019s implementation will cost an additional several tens of millions of dollars annually, mostly in order to incarcerate a greater number of people.\n\nCarmen Elena Girasol, a program coordinator at the Jefferson Community Center and Park in Humboldt County, noted that a budget increase for the state\u2019s carceral system would only take away funding for programs such as her own that are having a positive impact on low-income and minority populations. \u201cPeer mentor programs, drug counseling, job placement and job counseling, these are all of the things that will be impacted,\u201d she said. \u201cAs everybody here has already said, we know that these services work and that we need more of this, not less of this ... To lose that would be devastating.\u201d```"}

Their Saturday night concert took place at Harvard and Stone, a venue on Hollywood Boulevard. Funk not only sings for Trapdoor Social, but plays the saxophone and guitar. In addition to music, he\u2019s also a part of the USC student sustainability committee.\n\n\u201cI have really been loving the [sustainability] community here...there\u2019s a lot of structure for students to get enabled and empowered to carry out sustainability projects,\u201d he shared.\n\nOne of Funk\u2019s major sustainability projects before attending USC combined music and renewable energy. After starting Trapdoor Social in 2011, Funk and his bandmates performed solar-powered shows across the U.S. before creating their very own 100% solar-powered music and arts festival in 2016 called Sunstock Solar Festival.\n\n\u201cWe put a ton of work and energy and effort into creating this space that we thought was necessary for the world to right itself out,\u201d Funk said. \u201cWhere we could celebrate sustainability and use clean energy and gather with community, and celebrate music and life and good times, and do it in a zero-waste, solar-powered music festival format.\u201d\n\nFunk has always had an interest in environmentalism. He and a friend, Merritt Graves, started the band while Funk was studying environmental analysis at Pomona College.\n\n\u201cWe were excited to try to save the world, and interested in songs and writing songs, and so we eventually started this band together,\u201d he added.\n\nFunk said Trapdoor Social\u2019s solar generator was stolen this past summer, along with $20,000 worth of equipment. Although Saturday\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t solar-powered, the band\u2019s history of environmental activism still had an impact on fans.\n\nAttendee Adam Long shared, \u201cI think what I really appreciate about this band, and what resonates so much with me, is that they\u2019re doing it for the music, but there\u2019s also the kind of social commentary around environmentalism that is just really ingrained in what they do.\u201d\n\nSome fans, like Heather Royalty-Sofka, have watched the band\u2019s journey with environmentalism throughout the years.\n\n\u201cThey are really fighting the good fight, I think, to save our planet in the choices that they\u2019re making and the message that they\u2019re spreading,\u201d she said.\n\nOpening the show, Top Shelf Brass Band energized the crowd with brass covers of \u201cCrazy in Love\u201d by Beyonc\u00e9 and present-day hits like Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s \u201cEspresso.\u201d Soon after, Princess Afrodyete Love graced the stage with a shimmering purple outfit and tantalizing vocals to iconic songs like Frankie Valli\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Take My Eyes Off You.\u201d\n\nThe Trapdoor Social songs \u201cControl\u201d and \u201cLoneliness\u201d also feature brass instrumentals. Rocky Fox, another USC Thornton alum, plays the trombone for Trapdoor Social.\n\n\u201c[Being] able to play with all these other people and getting out of my comfort zone has been super, super fun,\u201d Fox said.\n\nAt the end of the show, Funk sang a cover of Michael Bubl\u00e9's \u201cFeeling Good\u201d with Top Shelf Brass Band back on stage. With trombone, saxophone and trumpets playing all at once, the entire building crescendoed into a brass celebration.\n\nRoyalty-Sofka said she appreciated the combination of instruments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a brass band, and it\u2019s not just rock or pop or alt-rock or whatever. It\u2019s this whole hybrid of something new and exciting,\u201d she said.\n\nSkylar Funk performing at Harvard and Stone on Saturday. (Photo by Daniella Lake)\n\n\u201cFunk\u2019s a man of many talents,\u201d said an audience member. In addition to music and environmental activism, Funk also plays on USC\u2019s frisbee team.\n\nSimilar to bringing solar power to music, Funk carries his environmentalism into other aspects of his life. When the team planned to get custom practice jerseys, Funk said he had a different idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cute, it\u2019s fun, but those shirts never get worn again, and they just are becoming waste,\u201d Funk said. \u201cWe could also just wear [our own clothing], and then in the spring season, get our real jerseys that we\u2019re going to get anyway.\u201d\n\nFunk shouted out the USC Frisbee team during the band\u2019s performance, earning raised fists and cheers from the crowd in response.\n\nJohn Conant, who plays pick-up frisbee games with Funk outside of USC, said he was excited to see the band bring Echobloom to life on stage.\n\n\u201cThe production on the new album was bigger and grander in a way that I wasn\u2019t expecting...I love Echobloom. I love the direction it\u2019s going.\u201d\n\nEchobloom is Trapdoor Social\u2019s first album part of a record deal with Pasadena Records. Although it may take a while for Trapdoor Social to bring their solar-powered concerts back, there was no shortage of energy during their West Coast tour.\n```"}

The festivities took place at MacArthur Park in Westlake, a neighborhood known for its historically Central American population, whose presence has been significant for decades. Pulling from data via the U.S. Census Bureau, the Migration Policy Institute placed Los Angeles County as \u201cThe top five counties for Central Americans\u201d between 2017 and 2021.\n\nThe event featured live music, cultural food stands and various vendors selling traditional items from their home countries. Among the vendors was Marina Gutierrez Pineda, a longtime attendee and owner of the festival\u2019s largest food stand. \u201cAqu\u00ed (Los Angeles) el centroamericano reina, y por eso estamos aqu\u00ed, porque no nos olvidamos de nuestras ra\u00edces, de nuestra patria, de nuestro lugar de origen que nos vio nacer y nos vio partir a este gran pa\u00eds,\u201d Pineda said. [Here (Los Angeles), Central Americans reign, and that is why we are here, because we do not forget our roots, our homeland, our place of origin that saw us be born and saw us leave for this great country.]\n\nDespite Pineda being born in Guerrero, Mexico, she identifies strongly with the Salvadoran people; a self-proclaimed \u201cSalvadore\u00f1a.\u201d Upon immigrating to Los Angeles, Pineda received love and acceptance from the Salvadoran community, prompting her to advocate for Central Americans and participate in their cultural events.\n\n\u201cEs importante sostener el cari\u00f1o y las ra\u00edces de cada uno de nosotros para no olvidarnos, ya que llegamos a este pa\u00eds a ser pilares de este pa\u00eds...

Unfortunately, many of us cannot return...Having this event here is magnificent because it brings our roots from our places of origin to celebrate them.]\n\nPineda\u2019s story shows how cultural identity is often formed by bonds and not necessarily national origin. Nicaraguan vendor Rene Harquin, a longtime contributor to the Festival Centroamericano, elaborated on the value of cultural solidarity and connection throughout Hispanic Heritage Month. \u201c[El mes de la herencia hispana] es un momento muy oportuno, porque es cuando, los Latinos, los Hispanos podemos sentirnos cerca, unirnos y conocer las situaciones, las circunstancias y los problemas que el latino pasa,\u201d said Harquin. [[Hispanic Heritage Month] is a very opportune moment, because it\u2019s when Latinos, Hispanics can feel close, unite, and learn about the situations, circumstances and problems that Latinos face.]\n\nSolidarity is deeply rooted in Latino history, and through diaspora, a vital part of the Latino experience in the United States. Founded in 1987 in Los Angeles, COFECA was established during a time when several Central American countries faced civil wars and U.S. military intervention. The organization was formed in response to growing anti-war protests in the local community. The month of September, Hispanic Heritage Month, was chosen as a historical reference to rally support from the American public. In recent years, COFECA has grown to become a cultural organization, integral to the Central American community in Los Angeles, instilling a sense of cultural pride.\n\n\u201cLa importancia es que tenemos presencia en la ciudad para todo el mundo y sembramos una semilla en los ni\u00f1os...que nosotros tenemos una ra\u00edces importantes y que tenemos que seguir adelante, ense\u00f1ando nuestra rica cultura Centroamericana,\u201d said Benjamin Posada, the current president of COFECA. [The importance is that we have a presence in the city for the whole world and we plant a seed in the children... that we have important roots and that we have to move forward, teaching our rich Central American culture.]\n\nPosada spoke about the organization\u2019s future plans, including the legacy and impact he hopes to leave behind. \u201cMi esperanza es que m\u00e1s adelante ustedes, los j\u00f3venes los que est\u00e1n en mi puesto y esos m\u00e1s grandes, y los m\u00e1s orgullosos que los pol\u00edticos vean que nosotros somos muy importantes dentro de la comunidad,\u201d [\u201dMy hope is that down the road you young people who are in my position and those older and prouder that the politicians will see that we are very important within the community,]\n\nMany of the festival\u2019s acts are curated and performed by young people, a dream come true for Posada and COFECA. Their efforts to encourage youth participation and cultural expression came to life through the artistic mediums of Central America. Genesis Abigail Madrid, a member of a folkloric Honduran dance group performed at the event, and elaborated on the importance of youth participation in these events. \u201cEs importante que estemos aqu\u00ed porque somos el futuro de nuestro pa\u00eds, para tener un un mejor futuro...para las nueva generaci\u00f3n de nuestro pa\u00eds,\u201d  [It is important that we are here because we are the future of our country, to have a better future...for the new generation of our country.]\n\nAs Hispanic Heritage month continues, COFECA will organize events catered to the Central American diaspora of L.A., staying true to their mission of instilling culture, advocacy and representation for future generations.

(Photo by Fido Fan)\n\nBy Zittlali Arellano October 02, 2024 at 11:16 am PDT\n\nComing off a 3-2 opening Big Ten win against the Ohio State Buckeyes, No. 20 USC (9-3, 1-1 Big Ten) faced a tough test against the No. 2 Nebraska Cornhuskers (12-1, 2-0) in front of an electric crowd at the Devaney Sports Center. With 8,869 fans in attendance, the stakes were high, especially for USC\u2019s graduate outside hitter Ally Batenhorst, who returned to face her former team in Lincoln, adding an additional emotional layer to the night.\n\nUSC could not outmatch its new Big Ten foe, falling to the Cornhuskers in three sets (25-18, 25-22, 25-16). The Trojans started their first set shakily, their nerves evident as they committed several errors that gave Nebraska an early advantage. The Huskers capitalized on the Trojans\u2019 mistakes, and jumped out to a quick lead with six kills on the first eight swings, taking a 13-8 advantage.\n\nA dominant 7-0 run showcased Nebraska\u2019s offensive firepower and defensive tenacity, pushing their lead to 24-12. Batenhorst powered the USC offense with six kills in the opening frame, but the Trojans hit just .192 as a team and surrendered seven points on serves with four service errors and three reception errors.\n\nAlthough USC mounted a late rally with a 6-0 run fueled by freshman outside hitter Jadyn Livings\u2019 serving, it wasn\u2019t enough to overcome Nebraska\u2019s initial surge, and the Huskers secured the first set 25-18, with 12 kills and a .364 hitting percentage, led by four kills from sophomore middle blocker Andi Jackson and other strong performances from standout players like senior outside hitter Merrit Beason, senior libero Lexi Rodriguez and senior outside hitter Lindsay Krause.\n\nThe second set was a rough start for both the Trojans and the Huskers; continuous, aggressive back-and-forth action ensued. USC gained momentum, going ahead 10-8 after a 4-1 run. Nebraska fought back after two kills from sophomore outside hitter Harper Murray kept them within striking distance at 14-13. Batenhorst and her teammates fought hard to extend their advantage to 17-14, but a kill by Krause and a USC hitting error brought the Huskers back within one.\n\nA kill by Beason, along with back-to-back kills by Murray, put Nebraska in front at 19-18. The Trojans hit .205 with 15 kills in the set, getting five from Batenhorst, but the Huskers responded with 16 kills, led by nine from Murray, hitting .262. Despite Nebraska\u2019s pushback, the Trojans\u2019 front row, led by offensive plays from freshman middle blocker Favor Anyanwu, kept the Huskers on their toes. But Nebraska\u2019s relentless blocking, spearheaded by Krause, proved to be too much.\n\nUSC fought back in the set, with Batenhorst leading the charge. Yet, ultimately the Huskers proved too much for the Trojans and won the set 25-22.\n\nIn the third set, USC put up a determined fight, managing to slow down Nebraska\u2019s middle hitters and forcing them to adjust. The Trojans took an early two-point lead, 5-3. The Huskers adjusted quickly. Throughout the entirety of the third set, Nebraska anticipated unusual hits from the Trojans and continued to respond effectively.\n\nNebraska rallied to establish a lead, bolstered by a block from Krause and another by Allick and Beason, leveling the score to 8-7. Midway through the set, USC challenged a potential touch on a Nebraska attack, hoping to shift momentum, but the challenge was unsuccessful, leaving USC without any further challenges unless the match went to a fifth set.\n\nNebraska pressed on, taking a commanding lead at 24-13. Nebraska utilized its momentum \u2014 with sophomore setter Bergen Reilly and Murray adding crucial kills \u2014 and an ace from Murray sealed the match. Murray (a collective 12 kills and 2 aces) alongside Beason (a collective 11 kills and 9 digs) helped the Huskers anticipate and counter USC\u2019s attacks, securing the final set 25-16 and completing the sweep.\n\nWhile USC showed potential, they were ultimately outmatched by Nebraska\u2019s play. This match not only marked Nebraska head coach John Cook\u2019s 701st career victory, but also emphasized the challenges USC will need to address as it navigates a competitive Big Ten schedule.\n\n\u201cUltimately we\u2019re trying to just focus on ourselves and play our game,\u201d Batenhorst said. \u201cI think that is just something that\u2019s most important when you\u2019re playing other teams.\u201d\n\nThat focus will be critical as the Trojans aim to regroup and sharpen their consistency. While Batenhorst\u2019s leadership and the team\u2019s ability to rally showed potential, the match underscored the importance of minimizing errors and capitalizing on key moments.\n\nThe Trojans will look to bounce back in their next match against Michigan on October 4 at 7 p.m. at Galen Center.\n```"}

On the first day of Disability Awareness Month, Sens. Brandon Tavakoli and Jackalyn Karamanougian were joined by USG Accessibility Committee Chair Izzy Del Gaudio to present a bill to promote the inclusion of Trojans affected by disabilities.\n\nThe bill highlights two calls to action: an official statement by USC President Carol Folt acknowledging Disability Awareness Month and reaffirming the university\u2019s commitment to the inclusion of its students with disabilities, and the use of the electronic banner at Allyson Felix Field to display a student-designed graphic commemorating Disability Awareness Month this month and every October going forward.\n\n\u201cI hope our Trojans feel seen,\u201d Del Gaudio said. \u201cWe want every student to know that they are valued and that their presence matters.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of the Senate Diana Carpio offered her support for the resolution. \u201cDisabilities are not limited to anyone, at any point in your life you could face a disability, so just the awareness you guys are bringing to this and from personal experience, I really appreciate it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Senate also announced that former longtime U.S. Rep. Tony Coelho, author and primary sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, will visit campus October 15 to discuss disability awareness and field questions.\n\nUSC said in a statement to Annenberg Media that they are committed to upholding the values of diversity, equity and inclusion. \u201cDisability Employment Awareness Month serves as an important reminder that at the university, we all belong and contribute to a community where we can all thrive. USC\u2019s community of individuals with disabilities is vibrant and contributes in all areas of campus life,\u201d said the statement.\n\nIn addition to this resolution, Sen. Seva Raman outlined a few new ideas for the future. First, she suggested shifting the Center for Excellence in Teaching (CET) programming towards open forum-style meetings. A resolution was previously approved to create a board to meet monthly, but Raman is now heading a redirection towards a round-table discussion style to encourage students to attend and give their feedback. The meetings will be held three to four times per semester. The proposal is set to be created on October 3 and submitted for approval.\n\nRaman said in the meeting that she is also working with USG Chair of Academic Affairs, Emma Fallon, on the Academic Inclusion Council (AIC), which will consist of a board of representatives from each academic school within USC aimed to discuss issues and concerns to create a more collaborative environment. The project has been approved and will likely begin activity next semester.\n\nFinally, she outlined a $500 textbook stipend to be given to a select group of 15 members of the student body, with priority for those with financial need. The proposal has been submitted and is pending approval.\n```"}

(Photo by Maribel Flores)\n\nBy Maribel Flores\nOctober 01, 2024 at 9:43 pm PDT\n\nAs the 2024 presidential election approaches rapidly, the vice presidential debate between Democratic candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Republican candidate Ohio Sen. JD Vance sparked conversations among students who gathered Tuesday night for a watch party at Lewis Hall Auditorium, hosted by the USC Political Student Assembly and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The debate was the third of the 2024 presidential election cycle and the second since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the nominee of the Democratic Party. Harris and the Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump, debated last month.\n\nFor many, the debate touched on critical issues, but reactions were mixed. While some students were deeply invested in particular topics like reproductive rights, gun violence and immigration, others were left disappointed by what they saw as a lack of content.\n\nFor Ellen Davis, a public policy major from Alabama, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. As she watched the debate, her mind was firmly on one issue: reproductive rights. Growing up in Alabama, which has one of the most restrictive abortion policies in the country, Davis\u2019 personal connection to the topic runs deep.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with groups that provide abortions, and it\u2019s just not accessible anywhere in the Deep South. We have the highest maternal mortality rate in the country, and as a woman, that scares me.\u201d\n\nDavis\u2019s focus was not on the candidates\u2019 performance, but on the impact their policies could have on women like her.\n\n\u201cI know if I ever need to seek healthcare, I have the resources to do it, but so many women can\u2019t leave their state, and that instills genuine fear in me,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, not every student was as deeply moved by the debate. Jien Chen, a public policy major, expressed frustration with the lack of meaningful dialogue.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s difficult for me to even say anything because nothing really stood out,\u201d Chen said. \u201cA lot of the rhetoric was just repeated campaign talking points. The mediators would ask a question, and then the candidates would sidetrack it.\u201d\n\nWhile Chen acknowledged that debates often contain a certain level of drama, they were disappointed that neither candidate seemed to offer anything new or substantial.\n\n\u201cPart of me is here for the drama, but I also wanted real answers\u2014and I didn\u2019t get them,\u201d they said.\n\nJonathan Chao, a student majoring in intelligence and cyber operations, shared Chen\u2019s sentiment that the debate lacked depth but took a different approach to analyzing its impact.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, \u201cA lot of nothing.\u201d\n\nFor him, the lack of a standout moment was less of a failure and more a reflection of how close the race is.\n\n\u201cThis election is going to be decided by a small group of voters in swing states. No matter how this debate goes, neither candidate is performing terribly, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to move the needle much.\u201d\n\nChao viewed the debate through the lens of polling data and election strategy, believing that the outcome is more about who can sway the undecided voters than about any single moment in a debate.\n\nFor freshman Ruby Belt, a double major in political science and mathematics/economics, the debate reinforced her support for Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris. Her priorities in this election are reproductive rights, gun violence and voting rights.\n\n\u201cI really agree with a lot of what Tim Walz has to say about reproductive rights and gun violence, especially the policies he\u2019s implemented in Minnesota,\u201d Belt said. \u201cMinnesota is ranked highly for women\u2019s health, and I think it\u2019s a huge priority for him to protect women\u2019s reproductive rights.\u201d\n\nBelt also highlighted Walz\u2019s stance on gun safety, noting his support for an assault weapons ban \u2014 a policy she agrees with.\n\nIn contrast, she expressed disagreement with JD Vance on many of his policies, particularly regarding women\u2019s health and democracy.\n\nImmigration was a crucial issue for Florianne Jourde, a sophomore majoring in health and human sciences. Coming from a different country herself, Jourde was very interested in the VP candidates\u2019 positions on immigration policy.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. economy works a lot with immigration, and immigrants help the country by doing jobs that are classified as lower-class but are actually essential,\u201d she said.\n\nJourde was concerned about Vance\u2019s stance on immigration, which she felt could harm the economy by limiting the contributions of immigrants.\n\n\u201cWe need to acknowledge that these people have a place in the country. They bring so much to the economy here.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the vice presidential debate, both candidates delivered their closing statements, emphasizing their visions for the country\u2019s future. Despite sharp disagreements on key issues like the economy, healthcare and foreign policy, they assured the audience of their mutual respect and shook hands, symbolizing their commitment to maintaining civility.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Christell Paris/Flickr)\n\nBy Yvonne Abedi October 01, 2024 at 8:49 pm PDT\n\nMakeup is supposed to be a form of self-expression. It\u2019s a way to reinvent yourself. To try something new. It\u2019s no secret that the beauty industry has prioritized the white beauty standard, while including splashes of \u201cdiversity\u201d to avoid scrutiny. So what happens when that form of expression doesn\u2019t include you?\n\nA week ago, TikTok beauty creator Golloria, posted a video swatching, and applying the product, YSL\u2019s Make Me Blush liquid blushes, on her darker skin. This is a style of content continuously seen on her page. She examines beauty products gifted to her to see if they work on darker complexions like her own. However, this video in particular struck a nerve.\n\n@golloria 6 shades of DEY PLAY! \u266c original sound - golloria\n\nIn the video, the blushes appear almost chalk-like on her skin from the white base used in the formula. She continuously states \u201cA blush,\u201d while swatching the products in a shocked-like manner, inferring \u201cThis is a blush for who?\u201d On YSL Beauty\u2019s website, the blushes are marketed towards everyone, with swatches showcased on three skin tones. But the complexions of the two Black models used for the arm swatch versus the face swatch are different. Within the marketing itself, there\u2019s a lack of transparency around how people of a deeper complexion would look with it on their faces.\n\nThe video has 20 million views with 1.4 million likes and 15,000+ comments, which were disabled by the creator. Scrolling through the comments, there are blatant forms of gaslighting and racism spewed at the creator. One user @fresandy said, \u201cInclusive goes both ways!!!!\u201d while another user @hi47680 said, \u201cyes a blush, but not for you, buy the colours [that] suits you.\u201d\n\nThe notion of inclusion going both ways is correct, but this means that products need to work for both sides of the spectrum. Many under Golloria\u2019s video became advocates for individuals with albinism. They brought up conversations surrounding the skin condition, which have otherwise been little to nonexistent within the beauty community. The inclusion of individuals with albinism is important, but that wasn\u2019t the sentiment Golloria was addressing. The fact that the YSL blushes were falsely advertised to everyone was where the brand went wrong. It should have been exclusive to lighter tones (which they knew they could get canceled for) or YSL should\u2019ve made additional shades that would\u2019ve worked for darker skin tones.\n\nThe internet jumped to hateful rhetoric because, from a white-centered viewpoint, they already felt included. So what\u2019s the big deal? This is where colorism comes into play. Within the beauty community, there has been clear favoritism towards creators with lighter complexions. This is reinforced through who becomes popular and how quickly they gain popularity. Darker skin creators have to work 10 times harder to get half of the attention and pay as lighter creators.\n\nTarte Cosmetics hosts brand trips every year where they invite beauty creators to different destinations. While on these trips, creators post content promoting the brand\u2019s products and documenting their luxury experience. In 2023, Tarte planned a trip to Miami and invited Bria Jones, a popular Black creator. She came on to TikTok to express how she was treated as \u201ca second-tier person,\u201d and then chose not to attend the trip. She felt that she wasn\u2019t getting the same treatment as her white counterparts.\n\nMany brands will prioritize white and lighter-skinned creators and then throw in one token Black or darker-skinned creators to avoid backlash. After all this backlash about the lack of diversity regarding their brand trips, Tarte hosted another trip to Bora Bora. This time the brand hosted a large range of Black creators including dark-skinned women. Would this have happened if they weren\u2019t called out? No.\n\nBlack women are continuously overlooked and ignored. It\u2019s a universal sentiment within society. But now the fear of being canceled now trumps the disregard for Black audiences. So now we see brands develop forms of \u201cinclusion\u201d that always miss the mark because they aren\u2019t genuine. This is what Golloria tried to express. Instead, she was bullied off the internet.\n\nThree days after the post, she took to her TikTok to announce her break from the app and internet overall. She stated \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking and harmful to constantly confront the overwhelming colorist, anti-Black, and racist rhetoric that\u2019s directed at us by the masses. No one should be forced to endure that level of emotional trauma.\u201d\n\nThe world of beauty preaches diversity but then attacks a person asking for it. If we silence Black women, how can we ever be inclusive?\n```"}

(AP/Morry Gash)\n\nBy Ethan Inman October 01, 2024 at 6:54 pm PDT\n\nIn the long and storied history of Major League Baseball, 10 sets of twins have seen both brothers play in the big leagues. Four of those 10 were teammates at some point in their careers. But there has only been one pair of twins that pitched for the same team. Taylor and Tyler Rogers happen to be the only active set of twins, and they both currently pitch in the San Francisco Giants bullpen. Best of all, they\u2019re maybe the most bizarre duo in baseball history.\n\nThe brothers are mirror twins, which, to be scientific, occurs when a fertilized egg splits later in the embryonic stage than usual and can result in characteristics with reversed asymmetry, such as the twin\u2019s having opposite dominant handedness. Taylor is a left-handed pitcher, while Tyler is a righty\u2014pretty cool! It makes them easy to tell apart on a baseball field, for one. But the differences in their pitching style go far beyond opposite handedness and demonstrate a much deeper difference at the core of the brothers\u2019 pitching philosophy.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Taylor is a relatively normal relief pitcher. He throws at a three-quarter release arm slot and he has two pitches: a sinking fastball and a sweeper (a new variation of the slider). His fastball hovers around 93-95 mph while his sweeper varies from the high 70s to low 80s. He relies on the same things many dominant relievers have for as long as baseball has been around: a simple but effective arsenal with a lot of movement.\n\nHis brother Tyler, on the other hand, is a total weirdo pitching-wise. He\u2019s the only true active submarine pitcher in the MLB, which means he throws effectively underhand. So while Tyler also throws a fastball and slider, his pitches move entirely differently than his brother\u2019s. While basically every other pitcher in baseball throws fastballs that stay up and breaking balls that dive downward, Tyler Rogers throws a slider that rises and a fastball that starts low and sinks lower. Tyler is also drastically different from basically every other pitcher in baseball in terms of his velocity. His fastball only reaches 82-85 mph and his slider sits in the mid 70s.\n\nWhen opponents face Tyler, they\u2019re not only facing a significantly different arm slot than the pitcher who appeared before him, but a literal change of pace as well. They ironically make a great compliment to one another, given their similar pitching philosophy but mirror-opposite deliveries and results. That\u2019s likely why, ultimately, they ended up in the same bullpen.\n\nTaylor signed with the Giants ahead of the 2023 season, joining Tyler, who\u2019d been with the orange and black since his debut in 2019. A 2021 All-Star who had been a closer for the Padres and Brewers in 2022, there was some thought at the time of Taylor\u2019s signing that the Giants may utilize an all-Rogers back of the bullpen, with Tyler getting the eighth and Taylor the ninth. Ultimately, Camilo Doval has been San Francisco\u2019s primary closer for the past two seasons with Ryan Walker also seeing some action, but the Rogers bros have still been core pieces for the Giants\u2018 pen in the two years they\u2019ve been teammates.\n\nThey even put up nearly identical numbers for most of the season in 2023. Their stats went viral in August of that year, when through 115 games, Taylor had a 2.52 ERA, 46 strikeouts and a 1.09 WHIP and Tyler had a 2.54 ERA, 45 strikeouts and a 1.09 WHIP. Their stats diverged from there but they\u2019ve still remained near-equals in effectiveness over their two seasons as teammates. Both sported a sub-three ERA in over 60 appearances each this season, giving up fewer hits than innings they pitched.\n\nIf identical twin brothers who are both pitchers with the same arsenal, but different arm slots and opposite pitches, both overcame a late MLB Draft choice to find similar success and end up on the same team despite the odds doesn\u2019t show that the art of pitching favors those who dare to be unique...then I don\u2019t know what does.\n\nWith the Giants\u2019 recent hiring of franchise legend Buster Posey as their new President of Baseball Operations and the organization\u2019s apparent emphasis on competing for championships in the near future, watch for the Rogers\u2014both under contract with the orange and black next season\u2014to be key pieces for a Giants team that could make a run at the Dodgers for National League West supremacy next season.\n```"}

For most of Jason Reitman\u2019s energetic new film \u201cSaturday Night,\u201d it\u2019s hard to believe the series ever got a second episode. \u201cSaturday Night,\u201d directed by Reitman, depicts the 90-minute stretch leading up to \u201cSNL\u2019s\u201d October 11 premiere in 1975. The film follows Lorne Michaels (Gabriel LaBelle) as he navigates rogue performers, snide executives and a cacophony of disasters against a clock ticking down to 11:30 p.m.\n\nOriginal cast members such as Dan Aykroyd (Dylan O\u2019Brien), Gilda Radner (Ella Hunt) and Chevy Chase (Cory Michael Smith) are all represented in addition to comedy legends George Carlin (Matthew Rhys), Andy Kaufman and Jim Henson (both portrayed by Nicholas Braun). Lorne spends the majority of the runtime scrambling to make magic happen. The show needs to be trimmed, performers need to be wrangled and higher-ups need to be soothed.\n\nTime and time again, Reitman presents Lorne (and the audience) with a seemingly simple question: What is \u201cSNL?\u201d Lorne may toss around words like \u201cavant-garde\u201d and \u201cpostmodern,\u201d but these merely deflect from the fact that he doesn\u2019t quite know what the show is \u2014 only what it can be.\n\nIn \u201cSaturday Night,\u201d Reitman takes audiences on a wild, funny ride filled with sharp dialogue and a slew of engaging performances. The USC alum co-wrote the film with Gil Kenan, the pair having recently collaborated on \u201cGhostbusters: Afterlife\u201d (directed by Reitman) and \u201cGhostbusters: Frozen Empire\u201d (directed by Kenan). \u201cSaturday Night\u201d is Reitman\u2019s first time in the director\u2019s chair since \u201cAfterlife\u201d released in 2021.\n\nLike his work in the Ghostbusters franchise, \u201cSaturday Night\u201d feels somewhat fueled by Reitman\u2019s lineage. The filmmaker\u2019s father, Ivan Reitman, directed the original \u201cGhostbusters\u201d film with \u201cSNL\u201d cast member Dan Aykroyd as a writer. Ivan had a history of casting \u201cSNL\u201d alumni such as Aykroyd and John Belushi in his films, both of whom are represented in the younger Reitman\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night.\u201d\n\nYet the newer Ghostbusters films struggle in part because they are hampered by the past, choosing to pay homage above all else. The films lack the humor \u201cGhostbusters\u201d is known for, and they lack Jason Reitman\u2019s strong authorial voice. \u201cSaturday Night\u201d certainly has its own serving of nostalgia: performers exclusively act as impressionists, and scenes simply show old sketches in full. This sometimes works to the movie\u2019s detriment.\n\nBut, despite also being a film heavily influenced by the past, \u201cSaturday Night\u201d is a welcome return to form for Reitman. Here, he channels the energy of some of his best films and, at the same time, operating in a new mode entirely. Reitman and Kenan\u2019s real-time, backstage conceit makes the perfect frame for an \u201cSNL\u201d movie. It is far more compelling to watch a single-setting film like this than a traditional biopic detailing Lorne Michaels\u2019 entire life and legacy.\n\nThere\u2019s narrative streamlining and a good bit of overstuffing, but \u201cSaturday Night\u201d still feels like a movie rather than a retelling \u2014 a trap many biographical films fall into. By allowing events to play out over the course of roughly 90 minutes, the film adopts the scrappiness that makes a show like \u201cSNL\u201d so fun to watch. It may be simulated, but it truly feels like things can go wrong at any moment.\n\n\u201cSaturday Night\u201d carries this manic energy throughout its 110-minute runtime. Scarcely does a moment go by where the audience isn\u2019t reminded of the ticking clock, counting down to either legacy or demise. The camera sometimes feels averse to remaining static, while moments of quiet rarely seem to last. Crowded rooms and overlapping dialogue only add to the sense of business that characterizes the entire film.\n\nThis hectic nature nearly makes you forget that this film is historical \u2014 it feels as if the show truly might not make it to air. To carry this pacing, Reitman makes excellent use of LaBelle\u2019s Lorne as an increasingly harrowed anchor. LaBelle brings the charm, ego and frantic energy necessary to propel the film from beginning to end.\n\nAt the same time, LaBelle knows how to pull it back and either lend the movie heart or allow other actors (many of whom are doing more direct impressions) to take the spotlight. He\u2019s a utility player who knows how to let others shine \u2014 a trait shared with some of the best cast members from \u201cSNL\u201d history.\n\nIt would be easy for a film about the inception of \u201cSNL\u201d to mythologize Lorne Michaels as the patron saint of comedy, and \u201cSaturday Night\u201d isn\u2019t without that. At one point, LaBelle\u2019s Lorne speaks about the statue of Prometheus in front of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, recounting that the god gave the arts to man.\n\nBut Reitman fills his creative catalog with wounded birds. \u201cUp in the Air\u201d revolves around a man who fires people for a living, flying around the country without a home to call his own. \u201cYoung Adult\u201d features a wannabe homewrecker looking to reunite with her ex. Here, the writer/director turns that energy toward Lorne as a real-life muse, examining the man behind one of comedy\u2019s most notable landmarks.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time LaBelle has played the role of tortured creator. The young actor portrayed Sammy Fabelman \u2014 a fictionalized version of Steven Spielberg \u2014 in the famous filmmaker\u2019s autobiographical opus \u201cThe Fabelmans.\u201d Throughout the film, Sammy reckons with the curse of seeing life through a camera, progressing as a filmmaker while his family fractures around him.\n\nIt\u2019s a crushing self-portrayal of Spielberg that LaBelle executes perfectly. LaBelle brings a similar vulnerability to this performance (although to a lesser degree), allowing the mask of unbridled confidence to drop in powerful moments. At times, there\u2019s a real emptiness to the character that overpowers his persona.\n\nDramatically, Lorne as a protagonist may not share the same depth as \u201cUp in the Air\u2019s\u201d Ryan Bingham or \u201cThe Fabelman\u2019s\u201d Sammy, but those films have different aspirations. LaBelle, Reitman and Kenan have created a character performance rather than a Lorne Michaels impression, and the movie is better for it.\n\n\u201cSaturday Night\u201d would always live and die by the strength of its comedy, and in this respect, Reitman and Kenan largely deliver. The script brings a number of laugh-out-loud moments brilliantly delivered by a host of talented actors. The highly constructed back-and-forths land more often than they miss, and the film feels driven by a true love for comedy writing.\n\nThis love is present in the acting as well. While it would be easy for \u201cSNL\u2019s\u201d original cast of seven to overwhelm the other characters, two of \u201cSaturday Night\u2019s\u201d strongest performances come from the show\u2019s scribes. Tommy Dewey masters the script\u2019s whip-smart dialogue in his performance as Michael O\u2019Donoghue, a controlled balance to Lorne\u2019s often-exasperated expression.\n\nThe film introduces Rachel Sennott\u2019s Rosie Shuster to audiences with a grand entrance, as if to say a modern-day comedy great has arrived. \u201cSaturday Night\u201d continues a titanic run for the young actress, here playing an assured creator rather than her usual human trainwrecks.\n\nAn early scene between Sennott and LaBelle provides a much-needed pause and a breath of fresh air; their dynamic is a highlight throughout. As if there was any doubt, \u201cSaturday Night\u201d further proves that Sennott is one to watch in whatever project she takes next.\n\nBy the end of the film, Lorne answers the question he\u2019s been pelted by again and again: \u201cWhat is the show?\u201d His answer is good enough. Yet, no matter how chaotic that first night may have been, \u201cSNL\u201d has grown over the course of five decades into a monolithic staple of comedy television. We have, at this point, all developed our own answers.\n\nWhat\u2019s arguably more interesting is a question that\u2019s only asked once in the text of the film. It\u2019s a slight line, thrown out in the middle of one of this film\u2019s many fast exchanges. It\u2019s a question that Lorne doesn\u2019t answer with a speech, one he doesn\u2019t really answer at all. It\u2019s a question that one final scene between LaBelle and Sennott seems to get to the heart of. Who is Lorne? In \u201cSaturday Night,\u201d there\u2019s only one answer: Lorne is \u201cSNL.\u201d\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/10/01/welcome-to-the-w-championship-chase-vol-3/", "response": "```\nThe WNBA just started the semifinal round of their playoffs. There are four impressive teams remaining, each of which could feasibly win it all. That being said, I\u2019ve ranked each of the semifinalists in order of who\u2019s most likely to reign as champions in three weeks\u2019 time:\n\n1. Minnesota Lynx\nFor the Lynx, consistency is key. Each game, they prove time and time again how steady they are on both ends of the floor. In the first round superstar forward Napheesa Collier posted an 80-point performance across just two games. Collier has had a monster season and helped the Lynx lead in team assists per game (23) and third in assists-to-turnover ratio (1.62). These assists and creating buckets as a team will be instrumental in their potential success this round.\n\nCurrently, the Lynx are playing the Connecticut Sun in the semis, who are known for their defense and their ability to not allow second chance shots. When you have a shot-maker like Collier inside a team that constantly moves the ball to create the best shot, suddenly the Sun\u2019s defense seems much less intimidating. The Lynx have the ball movement to create plenty of shots, but we shouldn\u2019t overlook their defense either. Collier is the Defensive Player of the Year, which has also contributed to her team\u2019s dominance. They are simply superior offensively and defensively.\n\n2. Las Vegas Aces\nThe Aces will reliably put out a great offense. While they didn\u2019t have as dominant a season as the past two years, Vegas still gets it done. However, a relative lack of consistency prevented them from achieving a higher ranking than the Lynx, particularly on defense. They rank 10th in opponent turnovers and dead last on second-chance points. If the Aces can\u2019t lock in on defense, then it\u2019s going to be difficult for them to slow down the Liberty.\n\nLuckily, in their first game against the Seattle Storm, the Aces proved that they\u2019re back on track defensively, holding Seattle to two points in the fourth quarter. In Vegas\u2019 most recent game against the Storm, the Aces kept Seattle to under 21 points in every quarter. Las Vegas had an injury-riddled start to the season, which contributed to their lack of defensive presence. With a healthy squad, they can apply defensive pressure to opponents and bring home another championship.\n\n3. New York Liberty\nThe Liberty have a flexible lineup and that\u2019s going to help them the most right now. Specifically, forward Leonie Fiebich came in clutch in the first round. Fiebich went 6-7 from the three in the first round, picking up some of the slack for guard Sabrina Ionescu, who hasn\u2019t shot the three well as of late. Fiebech gives the Liberty a shooter with size and that fits perfectly in the lineup.\n\nThe reason why I\u2019ve ranked New York at No. 3 lies mainly in Ionescu\u2019s decline in form this season. Also, forward Jonquel Jones can get out to slow starts that hurt the Liberty. In five of the Liberty\u2019s eight losses, Jones has scored fewer than 10 points \u2014 the Liberty\u2019s performance is so dependent on Jones. They were 11-0 when she scored more than 17 points in a game. If Ionescu and Jones don\u2019t get hot, they\u2019re not going to win against the always offensively-ready Aces.\n\n4. Connecticut Sun\nThe Sun\u2019s most impressive facet is the team\u2019s defense. Connecticut causes the second-fewest rebounds and forces the most opponent turnovers per game. The Sun place last in my rankings simply because each of the other teams are a little better than Connecticut. For example, in this matchup against the Lynx, the Sun don\u2019t have a transcendent player like Collier to put them over the edge. Collier averages 27.1 points per game against Connecticut and that could only increase with her fierce start to the playoffs. Since the Sun don\u2019t have a great track record of stopping her, they\u2019re at the bottom. Additionally, the Sun rank 10th in three-pointers made, the lowest among the four remaining squads. A lack of threes puts Connecticut at a disadvantage.\n\nThis is the most exciting playoffs since the Aces aren\u2019t the clear favorites. The Lynx and Aces will make it to the finals, but it\u2019ll be a hard fought battle to get there.\n```"}

Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 1780 this week. It bans legacy and donor admissions at private universities in California, including USC.\n\nBy Sheridan Hunter, Gricelda Gallardo and Jadon Frank\nOctober 01, 2024 at 6:43 pm PDT\n\nThe college admissions process has undergone big changes in recent years, including the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of affirmative action last year and test-blind colleges. Now in California, there\u2019s one more change: an end to legacy and donor admissions to private universities.\n\nThe bill was authored by Assemblymember Phil Ting, a Democrat representing District 19 in San Francisco. Ting said the idea behind the law is equity. \u201cWith the Supreme Court outlawing affirmative action and not allowing any university in the United States to look at race as a factor in admissions, this completely kept open the door that wealth could be a factor in admissions,\u201d Ting said.\n\nTing said the new law promotes equal educational opportunities for everyone, not just a lucky few. \u201cWealth is a major factor in admissions,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially for the wealthiest one percent of families in the country, where you have students coming from families from the top one percent being twice as likely to be admitted into an elite university than everybody else from the bottom 99 percent.\u201d\n\nWealth already factors into preparing students for college in other ways, Ting said. \u201cAlready, the wealthiest one percent have a large advantage in terms of schools, extracurriculars, opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\nTing hopes the new law will help level the playing field. So does Lyndsey Hobelmann, a law student at USC. \u201cIt allows for more students who are qualified in terms of test scores or GPAs to get in when, maybe in the past, those spots were taken by legacy admissions,\u201d Hobelmann said.\n\nQuincy Washington, a freshman majoring in business administration, shared similar sentiments. \u201cHonestly, just coming from a student that doesn\u2019t come from a household of wealth, I kind of agree,\u201d Washington said. \u201cI feel like you shouldn\u2019t be able to just pay your way into the school. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right way.\u201d\n\nFor Washington, the right way went like this: \u201cI [worked] my butt off in high school, and [did] a lot of extracurricular activities just to get here, and not just get here because your parents went here, or how much money you have that you paid to the school,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new law takes effect September 1, 2025.\n```"}

The store prioritizes a selection of books for Spanish speakers up to the age of 15.\n\nOwner Celene Navarrete sees literary representation as the bookstore\u2019s focus. She hopes to expand Spanish literacy among local youth. \u201cWe see a need for for this type of resource, and not only for families who speak Spanish, but also for the communities who value bilingual education \u2014  that see the benefits of raising their kids bilingual,\u201d Navarrete said.\n\nNavarrete co-founded La Librer\u00eda in 2012. It started off as an online bookstore and developed into a small warehouse space in West Adams, where the owners hosted story time readings and events. The events were loved by so many that more people began to show up than they could fit, she said. They made it their goal to find a space that could serve the large community of Spanish speakers in L.A. The opening marks the start of this journey.\n\n\u201cWe consider that this is very important because this gives (us) the opportunity to build a community,\u201d Navarrete said. \u201cRight when you come to the bookstore, you talk to other families that are also interested in this type of literature, this type of collections, and that help you, you know, to connect with other people in Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nNavarrete is looking to expand the bookstore\u2019s workshop programming now that the new space has opened, one of these being a program for teacher development. \u201cWe want teachers to come to the store to see our collections, to browse the books, to, you know, even to have their meetings to make decisions on what collections they they want to get for for their classroom,\u201d said Navarrete.\n\nFamilies at nearby schools were intrigued by the idea of a Spanish-only children\u2019s bookstore in the neighborhood.

To celebrate his significant contributions to art and cultural diplomacy, USC awarded Mei with an honorary doctorate.\n\nOn September 13, the USC East Asian Library welcomed key guests from the Chinese National Academy of Arts and Mei\u2019s descendants for the launching ceremony of a semester-long exhibition showcasing artifacts relevant to Mei\u2019s legacy.\n\nEssential to understanding the significance of Mei\u2019s career is his impact on the way feminine beauty was conceived by Chinese and later, American audiences. Li Shufeng, vice president of the CNAA said, \u201cMei represents the pinnacle of Chinese opera art \u2013 through his refined performances and creative works, he portrayed feminine beauty in multidimensional ways to the American audience.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrior to the 20th century, there were fairly strict divisions between female characters called the huadan (\u82b1\u65e6)  that were more flirtatious and the qingy (\u9752\u8863) that were very proper and well mannered,\u201d said Joshua Goldstein, director of the East Asian Studies Center at USC. \u201cMei Lanfang created a new character type called the huashan (\u82b1\u886b).\u201d\n\nThe huashan, considered a blend between the lively huadan and the proper qinqui, created space for more fully developed female characters. An example of Mei\u2019s rule-defying work was showcased at the opening ceremony by Ivy Gao, a 12-year-old Chinese Peking opera performer.\n\nIn her four-minute performance, Ivy played Yang Guifei, who was Emperor Tang Minhuang\u2019s concubine. Emperor Tang ruled the Chinese Tang Dynasty from A.D. 618  to A.D. 907, during a time of cultural flourishing, and had multiple concubines. In the scene, Yang indulges in anguished drinking after the emperor abandoned his plans with her to meet with another concubine.\n\nMei depicts her complex emotions through an unconventionally elegant dance that blends longing, heaviness, and sorrow. During his speech, Li also recognized Mr. Mei\u2019s significant role in igniting dialogue between USC and CNAA and expressed a wish to continue the partnership.\n\n\u201cWe hope to transcend the time and space of 94 years since Mr. Mei\u2019s previous artistic visit and exchange, and through the celebration of his 130th anniversary, to promote and expand this legacy...We hope to pursue in-depth cultural collaborations with USC.\u201d\n\nGoldstein added that Mei\u2019s story can speak to generations today, crossing cultural barriers. \u201cIf you look at American reviews of Mei Lanfang\u2019s visit to the U.S. in 1930...they were deeply moved by his visit...and respected him,\u201d said Goldstein. \u201cI think we can take from his lesson also today that even in times when perhaps diplomatically there are tensions between peoples and countries, cultural exchange can have an enormous way of opening up our hearts and our connections to one another.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition, featuring artifacts related to Mei\u2019s life, including illustrations of the characters he depicted, are on display in Doheney East Asian Library until December.\n```"}

(Illustration/Courtesy of the SmithGroup)\n\nBy Samantha Lee October 01, 2024 at 5:58 pm PDT\n\nThe Los Angeles City Council approved construction for USC Keck School of Medicine\u2019s newest research facility, \u201cThe Discovery and Translations Hub.\u201d The decision, finalized on September 19, had been protested by several activist organizations who appealed earlier this year. The go-ahead was won in a 13-1 vote.\n\nThe mammoth construction project will erect a 200,000-square-foot, seven-storey research facility equipped with a lecture hall, caf\u00e9, biorepository, medicinal chemistry lab and an array of collaboration and meeting spaces, according to the university.\n\nPrior to the vote, the council rejected the appeal which outlined concerns from local community members who worried that the structure, that is set to be built along the west side of Keck\u2019s existing hospital adjacent to the Lincoln Heights and Boyle Heights neighborhoods, would contribute to the continued gentrification of East and South L.A.\n\nAccording to the UCLA Urban Displacement Project, Los Angeles County exhibited the highest rates of gentrification with the number of gentrified neighborhoods increasing by 16% between 1990 and 2015. The data further illustrates that East and South neighborhoods are experiencing a rapid increase in housing costs.\n\nThough not directly displacing any local residents, activists\u2019 primary concern with the 7.9 acre expansion was that the new facility would increase enrollment capacity at the Health Sciences Campus, impacting traffic congestion, parking availability and housing prices for the surrounding community, as stated in the appeal.\n\nAdding to a decades-long battle against USC\u2019s growing footprint, locals are angered that the University is bringing about an influx of affluence into their neighborhoods and pricing them out.\n\nLast November, about 50 protestors took to the streets of East L.A. to oppose this same building during its early stages of proposition. Anti-gentrification coalition members emphasized they felt USC was not prioritizing local residents, Annenberg Media reported.\n\nIn 2017, community members resisted the construction of the USC Village. The new development, which today houses various multinational corporations such as Target and Sephora, ceased what was historically a public resource to the surrounding community by displacing local businesses and tightening restrictions on public access, the L.A. Times reported.\n\nAccording to Annenberg Media, nearby residents expressed that USC\u2019s efforts fell short, citing that the $20 million donation made to L.A.\u2019s affordable housing fund did little to bandage the $650 million wound the Village made to South L.A.\n\nPamela Agustin, the coalition director of Eastside Leads, one of the organizations involved in the appeal, says there is more to USC\u2019s impact on its neighbors. \u201cEverybody has a story of how they\u2019ve been negatively impacted, whether it be their neighbors have been priced out, real estate listings for new apartments being marketed only to students, how job opportunities that were sought at the Health Science campus were not given to local residents, workers who are part of the National Union of Healthcare Workers who say that USC has been a bad employer or our labor partners who organize the shuttle drivers,\u201d Agustin said.\n\nWhen asked whether the university could repair its relationship with the surrounding community, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s just so many negative impressions that community residents have towards USC. If the university really wanted to be a good neighbor, and really wanted to understand how it could move beyond that soured experience, they should meet with us. Of course they should sit down. But instead, they don\u2019t. They haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBalancing the operations of one of the country\u2019s wealthiest universities with the needs of one of Los Angeles\u2019 lowest income neighborhoods is difficult. According to USC Lusk Center for Real Estate data, the median household income in Boyle Heights is $32,463, significantly less than the median L.A. County household income of $56,196.\n\nFor this disparity to become equitable, Augustin expressed, \u201cwhat [locals] are asking, and have been asking the university, is to provide community benefits, provide services that really meet the needs of existing residents.\u201d\n\nThe university responded to the grievances of the community regarding the building in a statement. \u201cUSC appreciates the Los Angeles City Council\u2019s approval of the Discovery & Translational Hub (DTH) and rejection of the appeal of the project. This milestone is another important step toward community health equity aimed at reducing unacceptable health disparities in Los Angeles. The DTH\u2019s approval is the result of over three years of collaboration with community partners, health advocates, and labor. With this approval, we can now accelerate the planning and philanthropic efforts to bring the DTH to life.\u201d\n\nDr. Thomas Buchanan, the dean of research at Keck, said the university is dedicated to providing programs that discuss public health and the school\u2019s research findings for the local residents. \u201cThose interactions, in my personal experience, have been met with a lot of really positive excitement about the possibilities of doing things that are going to improve people\u2019s health... We get a lot of federal funding, and that federal funding should benefit everybody,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cOur hopes and our plans are that [the DTH] will lead to advances in medical discoveries that will lead to advances in medical care and practice that can promote prevention and treatment of a lot of conditions that affect our surrounding communities.\u201d\n\nTo Agustin, that is not enough. \u201cEastside Leads is not disputing that the university has existing programs, but are they actual programs that come from conversations with residents of the needs, priorities, fears that they have? Our answer is no.\u201d\n\nAgustin said the solution is accountability, conversation and a reparation of damaged trust between the community and the university. Despite Buchanan\u2019s proposed community benefits, Augustin said that, in the past, these goals have not been met and there have been no penalties for the university.\n\n\u201c[DTH] is designed to make patients\u2019 lives better, to improve life through better health, and research is the way the university does that,\u201d Buchanan said in response to the pushback against the construction. \u201cThat\u2019s what we all come to work for. Some of us do it through patient care, some of us do it through education, some of us do it through research.\u201d\n```"}

Here\u2019s some advice from USC students.\n\nTacos from 28th Street Tacos. (Photo courtesy of Zach Burg).\n\nBy Jayden Higman, Mysha Amir and Sophia Zhang\nOctober 01, 2024 at 4:58 pm PDT\n\nUSC sophomore Caroline Vandermeer says a taco may not have changed her life, \u201cbut it\u2019s made my life exponentially better.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of sentiment a lot of Trojans might share, and it\u2019s something to explore on National Taco Day \u2014 today, October 1. But first, what is a taco? Long before tacos became a staple of many USC students\u2019 diets, they were enjoyed in Indigenous regions of Mexico. The word \u201ctaco\u201d comes from the Aztec word tlahco, meaning \u201chalf.\u201d The evolution of this dish has led us to what taco connoisseurs know now: a folded tortilla, usually corn, that might be filled with meat or vegetables and most any other ingredients.\n\nIn typical L.A. fashion, chefs and food creators have pushed the limits of this Mexican dish. From fusion to surprising desserts, the taco scene is filled with creativity. Mariyah Jamali, a sophomore studying artificial intelligence for business, dreams of trying a Korean fried chicken taco: \u201cI think that would be kind of fire.\u201d Thanks to chef Roy Choi, Jamali can try those tacos if she can make it to the front of the line at the Korean Mexican taco truck, Kogi. Korean barbeque tacos have become one of Los Angeles\u2019 newest obsessions. Creations such as Argentinian taco-empanadas, Vietnamese banh xao tacos, and Hainan chicken tacos are redefining what a taco is. These flavorful combinations have grown out of the culinary diversity of Los Angeles.\n\nMany USC students, however, are more comfortable with traditional tacos. In celebration of this day of taco celebrations, we asked students to recommend their favorite local taco spots.\n\nBrothers Cousins Tacos (Instagram: @brotherscousinstacos) Famous for their authenticity, Brothers Cousins Tacos serves \u201cLa Mulita,\u201d a double-tortilla meat and cheese taco, recommended by USC student Suin Lee. The cash-only establishment is located at both 2914 Sawtelle Blvd and 3118 S. Sepulveda Blvd.\n\nTacos Tamix (Instagram: @tacostamix) Popular among USC students, Tacos Tamix is a go-to spot for late-night cravings. \u201cI get like four Al Pastor tacos,\u201d said Tingyo Chang, a USC student majoring in narrative studies and law, history and culture. Locations near USC include 1940 S. Hoover St. and 4817 W. Pico St.\n\nTasty Tacos Located near the Domino\u2019s on Figueroa Street a few blocks from campus, the Tasty Tacos stand is popular among USC students. \u201cI\u2019ll always get the carne asada tacos. That\u2019s my favorite thing there. But their burritos are really good too,\u201d said Ryan Lin, a junior studying computational neuroscience.\n\nAngel\u2019s Tijuana Tacos (Instagram: @angelstijuanatacos) Located in Downtown L.A., Glassell Park and Santa Monica, these taco trucks serve a variety of handmade Tijuana-style tacos. USC student Caleb Kim, a sophomore studying journalism, says his favorite menu item is the trompo al pastor taco. For National Taco Day, Angels is offering $2 tacos. Locations: Downtown: 1185 W. Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90012 Glassell Park: 4211 Eagle Rock Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90065 Santa Monica: 11221 W. Pico Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90064\n\nTaco Day Deals In honor of National Taco Day, Taco Bell has officially moved their National Taco Day to the first Tuesday in October. Taco Bell is offering a different type of taco every hour for $1. \u201cI will be getting the $1 tacos from Taco Bell today, a hundred percent,\u201d Vandermeer said. Chipotle is offering a buy-one-get-one free deal for their entire menu through their mobile app and website. City Tacos, located in the USC Village, do not have any deals for National Taco Day, but they offer 10% off tacos every Tuesday. Happy Taco Tuesday!\n```"}

No one has been taken into custody. Police have yet to determine a motive or a description of the suspect.\n\nIn an email to Annenberg Media, LAPD Officer Rosario Cervantes confirmed that the death was a homicide.\n\nIn light of the attack and its proximity to campus, DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said to avoid staying out late alone and to utilize DPS safety resources. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to be in areas off campus, even if it\u2019s a public park with lighting, by yourself early in the morning. That is not unique to USC, that\u2019s in any large urban environment, because you just never know who\u2019s going to be out there,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cAnd sometimes criminals are looking for an opportunity.\u201d\n\nCarlisle recommended students use the free shared Lyft program if they need to travel throughout the University Park area between 6 p.m. and 2 a.m. The LiveSafe application also turns students\u2019 phones into a \u201cmobile blue light\u201d that activates GPS trackers so DPS can travel quickly to users if they are in danger.\n\nThough attacks like these are likely uncommon, Carlisle advised students of a few simple tips: \u201cStay in the DPS patrol response area, download that application on your phone, and most importantly, make smart choices.\u201d \n```"}

Gavin Newsom signed a bill Thursday issuing an official apology for California\u2019s history of racism, including its involvement in slavery and discriminatory policies. \u201cThe State of California accepts responsibility for the role we played in promoting, facilitating, and permitting the institution of slavery, as well as its enduring legacy of persistent racial disparities,\u201d Newsom said in a statement featured on the governor\u2019s official website.\n\nThe bill is part of a reparations package promoting educational-career programs for K-12 students of color, that sought to address the consequences of racist policies and practices historically adopted by California. Despite entering the union in 1850 as a \u201cfree state,\u201d fugitive slave laws were still upheld as more than 2,000 enslaved people were brought in, according to The New York Times. California is leading the country on the subject of reparations.\n\nIn 2020, Secretary of State and then-Democratic Assemblymember Shirley Weber authored a bill that created the California Reparations Task Force, a team dedicated to analyzing potential solutions regarding California\u2019s part in slavery and other historical harms against Black Americans through reparations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s a start, and coming from the governor [an apology] isn\u2019t nothing. But he needs to address all of the systemic problems,\u201d USC Black Student Assembly member and Dornsife senior Evan Steele said. \u201cKeep investing in our community and our programs,\u201d he added.\n\nDespite the formal apology and other elements of the bill, some lawmakers and Black Californians remain frustrated with the lack of direct cash payments as reparations to the descendants of slaves, a solution suggested by the reparations task force nearly two years ago.\n\n\u201cAn apology is cute or whatever, but I\u2019m still affected by aspects of slavery. If I don\u2019t see [a] monetary apology, I don\u2019t care,\u201d USC Black Student Assembly member and senior studying theater Alexandria Gee said. \u201cBut I already knew California wouldn\u2019t give Black people money when they don\u2019t give any to white people who are homeless on Skid Row. I\u2019m surprised, actually, that we\u2019re the first state to apologize,\u201d she continued.\n\nA U.C. Berkeley study showed that 60% of California voters believe that the effects of slavery are still felt by Black residents, but 59% disagreed that slave descendents should receive cash reparations.\n\n\u201cThe best way you can help Black people is by defending us against those who say we don\u2019t need reparations,\u201d Steele said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be people who oppose [cash reparations], how do you help change those minds?\u201d\n\nNewsom came under fire recently for vetoing a bill looking to restore property taken through eminent domain to Black families. He halted the bill, as a reparations agency who would examine these cases was blocked from forming by California lawmakers. The vetoed bill came in the wake of successful local efforts to return Bruce\u2019s Beach, a piece of land unjustly seized from a Black family during the 1920s, back to them in 2021.\n\nBlack citizens and legislators are still looking for state-wide implementation of these kinds of land reparations.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying all these platitudes, but then when we propose legislation, we make it easy for you, and you veto it,\u201d Steele said. \u201cYou show inconsistencies with your policies.\u201d\n\nThe consequences of California\u2019s legacy of slavery and racism exist even at USC. Last year, the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work renamed their Office of Field Education to the Office of Practicum Education. The school cited concerns over the racial history of the phrase \u201cfield work.\u201d```"}

Their goals are simple: gain swaths of land for victory come November. Saturday featured both as the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, visited the \u201cBig House\u201d at the University of Michigan to court voters. He also had the opportunity to root for his home state\u2019s University of Minnesota, in a rivalry contest that drew more than 100,000 football fans.\n\nWhile traditional tailgates still reigned supreme, Walz stopped at some organized by College Democrats and the Michigan Democratic Party. As his motorcade pulled into the stadium, supporters chanted, \u201cCoach,\u201d while behind them laid the remains of a pancake breakfast organizing effort and games of beer pong with campaign signs promoting Vice President Kamala Harris posted to the tables.\n\nThe visit coincided with the launch of the \u201cAthletes for Harris\u201d initiative, which included endorsements from 15 NFL Hall of Fame members and an ad buy for football games like Saturday\u2019s between Michigan and Minnesota. Walz was also in Michigan to prepare for Tuesday\u2019s vice presidential debate against Republican nominee Ohio Senator JD Vance.\n\nThe governor arrived at a small airport outside Ann Arbor early in the morning. The University of Michigan\u2019s College Democrats chapter and a delegation of local leaders, including Representative Debbie Dingell, greeted Walz as members of a marching band played to mark his arrival \u2014 even as rain began to pour down.\n\nWhile Walz did not make any formal remarks, Dingell spoke with Annenberg Media to emphasize the importance of the youth vote ahead of his visit to the university. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to turn them out,\u201d Dingell said. \u201c[Students] want to make sure they have a job when they graduate. They\u2019re worried about housing. They\u2019re worried about the environment.\u201d\n\nGen Z (voters between the ages of 18 and 29) cast more than 860,000 votes in Michigan in the 2020 presidential election, according to data from the Michigan Department of State. The final margin between Joe Biden and Donald Trump was just over 150,000 votes.\n\nUniversity of Michigan students greet Democratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Governor Tim Walz on Saturday at a small airport outside Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nEric Veal, 20, a student studying political science, appeared with Walz at the airport and later attended the football game. Veal said at the game that he had spoken with the governor about issues important to students, including education, which is particularly important to him since his mother, an elementary school teacher, is an educator like Walz. He added that Walz\u2019s visit to Ann Arbor was an important step for the campaign to begin its student outreach.\n\n\u201cVoters are excited to see the fresh energy on the campaign trail,\u201d Veal said. \u201cStudents are backing Kamala\u2019s message of \u2018We\u2019re not going back.\u2019\u201d\n\nGabe Shaw, 18, a first-time voter and business student, echoed Veal\u2019s message and said that he felt students needed more attention from campaigns heading into the election\u2019s final weeks. \u201cI think it\u2019s definitely a big demographic that needs to be reached,\u201d said Shaw, who grew up in Ohio. \u201cA lot of students don\u2019t know, so getting that information to them and getting that out there is going to make this election.\u201d\n\nWalz spent most of the game in a suite watching with his family but spent the hours before kickoff interacting with supporters at tailgates, some themed for campus organizing and voter registration. Before kickoff, Walz met with Minnesota head coach P.J. Fleck and University of Michigan officials, and posed with Minnesota cheerleaders and their mascot, \u201cGoldy Gopher.\u201d\n\nOver 1,000 miles south, Trump enjoyed a raucous reception at the University of Alabama\u2019s rivalry game against the University of Georgia. The former president had been in Michigan the day before for a rally in Grand Rapids and a town hall in Warren.\n\nVictoria LaCivita, a Michigan spokesperson for the Trump campaign, said Saturday that the Minnesota football team and the Minnesota governor will not be victorious in the \u201cGreat Lakes State.\u201d \u201cThe Wolverines are going to send Minnesota\u2019s Golden Gophers packing \u2014 the same way Michiganders are going to send Tim Walz back to Minnesota this November,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Wolverines defeated the Golden Gophers 27-24 in a close contest that saw Minnesota score 21 points in a fourth-quarter comeback attempt. Michigan students were not the only football fans who made the trip to the game Saturday afternoon. Minnesotans also trekked through the rain to watch the Golden Gophers take on the Wolverines, and their governor\u2019s appearance drew a mixed reaction.\n\nJill Fischer, 58, a project manager from Minneapolis and a Trump supporter, said she did not believe that the governor had handled the COVID-19 pandemic properly in the state. Walz oversaw pandemic assistance programs that were later found to have more than $250 million in fraud, one of the most prominent cases in the country, according to ABC News.\n\n\u201cWhen hard times hit, he hid,\u201d Fischer said, referring to her perception that the governor made few public appearances during the pandemic. Public polling for Walz\u2019s leadership in the aftermath of the pandemic remains mixed. According to a September poll from the APM Research Lab, 52% of Minnesotans approved of Walz\u2019s handling of the pandemic \u2014 the same margin of his reelection win in 2022.\n\nFischer said she also grew upset with Walz\u2019s leadership, citing his choice to spend the state\u2019s $18 billion budget surplus last year on paid family and sick leave, free school meals for all and gun control measures instead of providing tax cuts for Minnesotans.\n\nDan Smith, 52, a banker from St. Paul, Minnesota, said he was the only person in his traveling party to support Harris and Walz, adding that football fans tend to lean conservative. A Harris Poll/Sportico poll from last year found that around 56% of NFL fans and 58% of college football fans identified as conservatives, the latter being the most of any professional or college sports league.\n\nHe said his support for Walz came down to him being a \u201cnice guy\u201d and stopping a potential second Trump presidency. However, he said he was weary of the strategy of attending football games to gain support. \u201cI think that was part of his appeal on the ticket,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut how much is that actually going to work?\u201d\n\nWalz\u2019s trip to Ann Arbor was not his first time to a college campus since becoming the vice presidential nominee \u2014 he has held events with students from Arizona State University, Michigan State University and Georgia Tech. The Harris campaign has been buying ads in student newspapers as well.\n\nWhile more than 100,000 fans attended the game, one former coach from Michigan said it appeared students\u2019 in-person support for the Wolverines was low. He told Annenberg Media it seemed the rain led thousands of students to stay home instead of supporting their school against their rivals to the west \u2014 a result he said he hopes they won\u2019t repeat in November.\n\n\u201cOn a day like this, you can\u2019t fill up the student section,\u201d said the coach, who didn\u2019t want to be identified by name or sport. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s bad weather on Election Day?\u201d\n```"}

Aedes aegypti mosquitos can transmit the Zika virus. (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health)\n\nBy Katherine Contreras Hernandez, Wesley Chen and Anna Fregene October 01, 2024 at 9:47 am PDT\n\nDengue, a mosquito-borne virus, is on the rise after entering Los Angeles County. While locally acquired dengue is uncommon and rare, there have been four total cases of local transmission, three cases reported in the City of Baldwin Park on September 18 and one case reported in Panorama City on September 25, according to the LA County Department of Public Health. Four cases may seem low; however, those infected \u201chad no history of travel to places where dengue is common,\u201d according to the LA County Department of Public Health. Locally acquired cases in the continental United States total to 37 in 2024 so far. Florida has reported 33 cases and California has reported four. Cases associated with travel total to 1,904 in the continental United States with 79 of those in Los Angeles County.\n\nStill, USC\u2019s Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said students shouldn\u2019t be overly concerned as the four cases were not near University Park. \u201cThe good news is right now we\u2019re looking at these places that are not within the area around campus, nor is it in the areas that students frequent,\u201d Van Orman said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good reminder for everyone to avoid mosquito bites.\u201d\n\nDengue virus, like many mosquito-borne viruses, is easily transmissible. When an infected mosquito bites a human, the human hosts the virus, and any future mosquito that bites the infected human begins to carry the virus, too, making it a highly contagious cycle, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Adding to its transmissibility, once a mosquito carries the dengue virus, it has the ability to transmit the virus for the rest of its lifespan, according to the World Health Organization.\n\n\u201cWhat we know is that one in four people who are infected are symptomatic. So they\u2019ll be ill and they\u2019ll show symptoms, and then the other three don\u2019t show symptoms at all,\u201d Van Ngo, a Supervising Epidemiologist for Los Angeles County, said. \u201cA lot of the illness that manifests is mild and can be confused with other things. People just won\u2019t go to the doctor and get tested. So, there is, there\u2019s a lot of unknown disease out there.\u201d\n\nSymptoms include eye pain, headaches, muscle, bone or joint pain, nausea or vomiting and a rash according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. When caught early, the virus can be easily treated with proper medical care. Rare cases of severe symptoms do occur and may lead to death.\n\nThe City of Baldwin Park belongs to the San Gabriel Valley. In response to the recent cases the San Gabriel Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District has ramped up its routine. \u201cDistrict staff has expanded surveillance by deploying additional traps and increased the frequency of testing to identify the presence of mosquito-transmitted diseases in local mosquito populations,\u201d according to the San Gabriel Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District.\n\nDengue has commonly been found in humid and tropical areas, but rises in temperature may lead to an increase in cases. Van Orman agreed, noting that aedes mosquitoes \u2014 the species that carry dengue \u2014 are an invasive, non-native species to California that are likely here because of increasing temperatures worldwide. \u201cAs we see climate change, we\u2019re going to see changes in the range of these types of mosquitoes,\u201d Van Orman said. \u201cThat then can raise this risk for local transmission of diseases that we\u2019ve never had before, primarily because we\u2019ve never had these mosquitoes.\u201d\n\nNgo added that this can also change the habits of insects. \u201cWeather does impact the way that mosquitoes breed and also how the virus develops inside the mosquito,\u201d Ngo said.\n\nThe virus travels after a mosquito has bitten a person. When caught early, the virus can be easily treated with proper medical care however there are some rare cases of severe symptoms, and at times, death. The four individuals who contracted the dengue virus have recovered according to Ngo.\n\nAs of now there is no vaccine for the dengue virus but there are still means of prevention. The San Gabriel Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District is urging residents to implement Tip, Toss, and Protect as means of prevention. Mosquitoes breed in standing water, so tip out any standing water, toss unused containers that may collect water and protect yourself with repellents. The best repellents to use are ones that include active ingredients approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency such as DEET or Picaridin.\n\nVan Orman generally advised avoiding mosquito bites as the best prevention method. Students should wear long pants and sleeves if traveling to areas where mosquitoes are common, and make sure their window screens are tight-fitting and closed if in areas of high mosquito activity. The best course of action is to be aware. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that we have an increase. It is more of an emergence because we haven\u2019t had before. I think it\u2019s just something that, it\u2019s an additional thing that people you know should be aware of but the mosquito borne disease concerns have always been the same,\u201d said Ngo.\n```"}

Professional players, often called esports athletes, are gaining fame and recognition comparable to traditional sports figures and entertainment stars. Thanks to the viral nature of social networks, esports athletes often achieve rapid fame through standout performances or extraordinary gameplay moments, which are quickly shared and celebrated across digital platforms,  especially in China . As they become household names, these players bring previously untouched potential and opportunities to the industry.\n\nIncreased Viewership\n\nEsports athletes act as magnets, attracting audiences not only for their gameplay but for their charismatic personalities. Fans flock to watch their favorite esports athletes in action, much like traditional sports fans do with superstars. In 2019, during the Valve Major Championships in Berlin, the Grand Final between Astralis and AVANGAR attracted over 1 million concurrent viewers. A large number of audiences were there to see Nicolai \u201cdev1ce\u201d Reedtz, widely regarded as one of the best  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive  players in the world.

This year, the  League of Legends  (LoL) Mid-Season Invitational set a new viewership record: Korean broadcasts attracted 20.09 million viewers, surpassing the 19.21 million viewers of the English broadcasts for the first time. The surge in interest was largely driven by the Korean team Gen.G advancing to the Grand Final, featuring standout players like Jeong \u201cChovy\u201d Ji-hoon and Kim \u201cCanyon\u201d Geon-bu, who have risen to stardom through their exceptional talent and are now considered to be some of the best Korean players of all time.\n\nStreaming as a Means to Connect with Fans\n\nAlongside tournaments, online streaming platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and Huya have revolutionized how fans engage with esports. Celebrity athletes attract thousands of viewers who tune in not only to watch tournaments but also to follow their favorite athletes\u2019 personal streams and gaming sessions.

The popularity of limited-edition jerseys, hats, apparel, and tie-in products linked to star players frequently results in quick sellouts, demonstrating the strong loyalty fans have toward their esports idols.\n\nThese merchandise drops have become pivotal in driving the financial success of players and sponsors.\n\nG2's jersey, which features an oriental dragon motif, was a limited edition design for the League of Legends 2020 World Championship in China.

By fulfilling fans\u2019 desire to establish offline connections with their favorite athletes, these initiatives further broaden revenue streams.\n\nLegitimization of Esports\n\nAs esports athletes gain fame, their influence draws significant attention from mainstream media.

Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins appearances on talk shows like  The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon  introduced esports to a wider and more casual audience, impacting the perception of esports and bridging existing gaps.\n\nNowadays, renowned esports athletes are becoming more and more connected to traditional sports athletes, legitimizing esports in popular culture. In December 2023, Noah Lyles, known as the \u201cworld\u2019s fastest man\u201d after winning the men\u2019s 100 meters at the 2024 Paris Olympics, named Faker as his favorite athlete in  World Athletics\u2019 fun Q&A session . He also later stated that his favorite team was the LA-based 100 Thieves.\n\nThe underlying message \u2013 the nature of esports is not unlike that of traditional sports \u2013 was delivered to hundreds of people immediately.\n\nFurthermore, famous esports athletes also participate in charitable initiatives to demonstrate how games can contribute to society. When more and more star athletes organized fundraising streams during the COVID-19 pandemic, their commitment to the community, along with the social responsibility of the industry, are presented in a heartwarming way.\n\nMichael \u201cShroud\u201d Grzesiek, the former  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive  professional turned popular streamer, participated in the  Twitch Stream Aid 2020  as a major contributor.

In an increasingly digital world, they offer a model of engagement that is more interactive, tech-driven, and directly connected to fans. Famous athletes are becoming increasingly visible in major international events. With  the upcoming Olympic Esports Games  and  FIFA\u2019s plans for a Rocket League World Cup , their presence on the global stage is poised to grow significantly.\n\nFIFA is shifting its upcoming FIFAe World Cup to Rocket League.

As new platforms like the metaverse emerge, esports athletes are primed to lead in these virtual environments, thriving in both online and real-world spaces.\n\nThe future of esports athletes is not just about gaming; it\u2019s about their growing role in shaping mainstream entertainment and culture worldwide. As they continue to break barriers, their influence will reach far beyond the arenas where they first made their names.\n```"}

Expand Bear Alexander recently redshirted because of a lack of playing time. (Photo by Ethan Thai)  By   Terence Holton September 30, 2024 at  9:17 pm PDT \n \n A travesty, a debacle, a mockery of what I know, a complete and utter s**t show: that is how I would categorize the current state of college football, whether it be the transfer portal, NIL, or conference realignment. It\u2019s been a couple of years now since NCAA athletes began profiting from their name, image, and likeness, and since then, the only way to describe today\u2019s landscape is a wasteland with no rules, where anything goes. Since the NCAA does not operate as a league with centralized power, the major conferences (and particularly the Big Ten and SEC) run everything. In the past week, multiple football players have already declared that they will be redshirting \u2014 ending their season short so they can maintain a year of eligibility \u2014 including USC\u2019s junior defensive lineman Bear Alexander, and even more notably, UNLV\u2019s star senior quarterback, Matthew Sluka. The two opted to redshirt for different reasons, Alexanders is a bit more straightforward, as it seems he felt he was not receiving enough playing time, cryptically tweeting things such as \u201cFREE 9-OWE ...................\u201d Alexander is an interesting case as he will likely transfer and attend his seventh different school in eight years (three in college, four in high school) in search of more playing time. Sluka\u2019s case, however, is a lot more complicated. To simplify the story, he was the starting quarterback for the undefeated UNLV Runnin\u2019 Rebels, a team that clearly had the talent and coaching to make a run for the Group of Five auto-bid College Football Playoff spot. But last Wednesday night (and I\u2019m talking around midnight, not the middle of the day), Sluka posted on  his social media  that he was choosing to redshirt because he did not receive the NIL compensation that he was promised. \u201cI committed to UNLV based on certain representations that were made to me which were not upheld after I enrolled,\u201d Sluka wrote. \u201cDespite discussions, it became clear that these commitments would not be fulfilled in the future.\u201d There are two sides you can take here. He should have continued to play for the rest of the season regardless of his compensation, and he quit on his teammates in what could have been a historic year for UNLV. But would you work your regular job if you weren\u2019t getting paid? Now, Sluka evidently didn\u2019t have a strict contract, but it shows how crazy the NIL landscape has become because it seems we\u2019ve just witnessed our first NCAA athlete strike for not receiving fair compensation. So, two players in very different positions will be entering the portal for different, but not entirely unrelated reasons. What can the NCAA do? Let\u2019s start with the obvious... take back control of your league(s). The NCAA has been pushed around like the small kid on the playground for far too long. The major conferences do it and the U.S. Congress does it. Not to fret, because as per usual, I have a solution. To retake control of the transfer portal and NIL situation that has plagued the NCAA the past few years, I propose a simple idea: Athletes are allowed to earn $250,000 maximum, which will be paid through collectives as well as through athletic departments. The NCAA institutes a one-time transfer rule unless a coach is fired or leaves their position. While athletes definitely have legitimate reasons to transfer, if a player ends up transferring to four schools in four years, then there is clearly a problem, and it probably isn\u2019t the school\u2019s fault. By adding the rule where another transfer is allowed if the coach leaves the program, players would be stuck in a case of program upheaval. There are plenty of things you could nitpick about that proposal. I mean, if we are being completely honest, I saw this idea in a TikTok comment section (apologies to a random user who I cannot properly credit), but this plan is straightforward and makes a lot of sense to me. It is not healthy for players to spend more time in the portal than in school or on the practice field. This could limit the issues caused by a rampant transfer portal. As of right now, there are zero regulations on how you recruit players (for example,  it was reported  that a former Colorado staffer went to try and get money from the Saudi Public Fund for the Buffaloes NIL collective). One could of course argue that schools will pay players more than the $250,000 maximum, it will just be under the table once again, and that is highly likely. But at least this would make it more difficult for those schools to do that without raising red flags about where funds are being distributed. While this likely won\u2019t happen as the NCAA is a pushover of an organization and they never listen to smart people (me), I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea to solve what is truly a crisis. Something  I have been saying for months now  is that we are headed towards a contract system where players will sign a contract (like Sluka apparently did not), so that if they transfer, then they forfeit the money. If this becomes true then college athletes no longer become student-athletes, but employees, so is it really amateur sports? It\u2019s a sad reality that will probably be the future of college sports. On that cheery note, next week I will explore how some of the top transfers are doing this season and the impacts they are making around college football.\n```"}

(Photo by Heli Ruiz)\n\nBy Annabelle Le Roux, Cecilia Mendez Comas and Isa Greiff\nSeptember 30, 2024 at 6:14 pm PDT\n\nAs Trojan Family Weekend draws to a close, some students are reflecting on the time they spent with their families \u2014 or lack thereof. Due to long travel distances, complications caused by Hurricane Helene or financial difficulties, some students\u2019 mental health was impacted by being unable to see their families this past weekend.\n\nTrojan Family Weekend gives families the opportunity to immerse themselves in USC life. From action-packed tailgates and a football game to engaging in on-campus lectures, families see first-hand what being a USC student is all about.\n\nOne Hire A Helper study shows that four in 10 (43%) of students beginning college moved away from home in 2021. Although the study cites Californians as being among some of the least likely to go to college out-of-state, USC is among the top three universities in the United States for international student enrollment, with a fall 2023 international student population of 27.1%.\n\nWith many students coming from homes thousands of miles away, not everyone\u2019s families could be in attendance this past weekend. Le\u00f3n Oberto, a sophomore studying economics, is originally from Venezuela, with family members from Mexico and Spain. He said he wishes there was more that could be done to include international students in the family weekend festivities.\n\n\u201cThis year was better because my brother was able to come, but last year, I felt a bit sh***y,\u201d he said.\n\nNot all students are upset that their parents couldn\u2019t come to Trojan Family Weekend, though. Rahul Padam Mehta, a sophomore economics major, is an international student from London. He said that his brother came to visit this weekend, but his parents couldn\u2019t make it because of distance and work.\n\n\u201cI can see why other people would get left out, but I didn\u2019t find that,\u201d Mehta said.\n\nSome USC parents also found comfort in being able to visit their children for the weekend after they moved away from home.\n\n\u201cI have learned quite a lot of what\u2019s going on here with my daughter and her studies,\u201d said Mara Moreno, a parent who attended family weekend.\n\nDr. Kelly Greco, a licensed psychologist and USC Annenberg\u2019s embedded counselor, noted that this weekend doesn\u2019t affect all students in the same way.\n\n\u201cWe have many students that [family weekend] doesn\u2019t mean anything to them, and it\u2019s just like they just want to go to the football game, or they just want to go to the library and study or they want to go see a movie,\u201d she explained.\n\nMany students who don\u2019t have their families here are able to find comfort and celebration elsewhere, Greco added.\n\nAlthough many students were unable to reconnect with their families over the weekend, Sophia Cerchione, a freshman from London, said she was grateful for her friends and their families taking her in.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel a lot better because I was adopted by my friend\u2019s parents for the weekend,\u201d Cerchione said.\n\nDr. Greco also recognizes the negative emotions that arise on campus during Trojan Family Weekend. She explained that moving away from home and not feeling like you have support on a weekend like this is challenging for many.\n\n\u201cSo when we have a loss, we have to acknowledge it and not ignore it and push it aside,\u201d said Greco. \u201cIt can sometimes then get more stressful, but to acknowledge it, validate it, normalize it, support ourselves, and then think, \u2018What else can we do to move forward?\u2019\u201d\n```"}

Gavin Newsom speaks during a Clean California event in San Francisco, Nov. 9, 2023. (Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)\n\nBy Ana Susman and Caitlin Roehmholdt\nSeptember 30, 2024 at 6:08 pm PDT\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law on Monday that will ban private universities and colleges in California from accepting students based on legacy and donor status. This will impact admission across the state\u2019s private institutions including USC, Stanford and Santa Clara University, among others. While earlier drafts of the bills suggested a financial penalty, this was not included in the final legislation, according to a USA Today article.\n\nThe law will require these independent, non-profit schools to send an annual report including which newly admitted students have legacy and donor status, and the Department of Justice will decide whether these schools have complied with the law. Consequently, if schools refuse to discontinue legacy admission they will be publicly called out for breaking the law.\n\nAn excerpt from the university\u2019s statement to Annenberg Media read \u201cWe are fortunate that USC remains a top destination for so many accomplished students across the country and world, and we are always looking to evolve our admissions processes and recruitment efforts to bring as many of these students to USC as we can. We will do so in compliance with the law.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the students admitted based on legacy and donor status to the incoming fall class, there is a program called the Trojan Transfer Plan which defers students to an alternate institution offering class credit transferable to USC. Eventually, students are admitted through the transfer application assuming they meet university qualifications. An article by Annenberg Media quotes a statement from the USC Office of Admissions which states that 20-30% of TTP students comprise each year\u2019s transfer class.\n\nUSC has historically admitted many students with alumni and donor connections. 14% of students admitted during the 2022-2023 admission cycle and 30% of transfer students in the Fall 2024 transfer class are legacy students, according to a status report by USC. USC prioritizes the idea of the \u201cTrojan Family,\u201d creating generations of parents, children and their siblings all accepting an anticipated admission to the school.\n\nSome legislators argue that this admissions process puts applicants connected through alumni and donors at an unfair advantage over applicants who don\u2019t have those same opportunities. \u201cIn California, everyone should be able to get ahead through merit, skill, and work.\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a press release. \u201cThe California dream shouldn\u2019t be accessible to just a lucky few, which is why we\u2019re opening the door to higher education wide enough for everyone, fairly.\u201d\n\nAfter the Varsity Blues scandal, a 2019 national investigation that exposed admissions bribes at USC, legislators attempted to crack down on the university\u2019s admissions process. A 2019 bill proposed by Assemblymember Phil Ting was created after the scandal with the intent to prevent California taxpayer money from funding California schools that are prioritizing well-connected or wealthy families. Now Ting proposed the new law, AB 1780, signed by Newsom banning the consideration of legacy admissions.\n\nIn an interview with Annenberg Media, Ting commented on the importance of the implementation of this bill following the Supreme Court ruling back in 2023 which effectively prohibited the use of race-based affirmative action in admissions. By prohibiting any university in the United States from looking at race as a factor in admissions \u201cthis completely kept open the door that wealth could be a factor in admissions,\u201d he said. Effectively, Ting said this new legacy ban is important to limiting these unfair discrepancies in the admissions process. He noted a report from Opportunity Insights authored last year, showing wealth as a major factor in admissions. \u201cStudents coming from families from the top 1% being twice as likely to be admitted into an elite university than everybody else from the bottom 99% \u2013 and that\u2019s when all things are equal,\u201d he said.\n\nSchools who have retained legacy preferences claim that standards of admission are not compromised and that these students must be \u201chighly qualified\u201d to be accepted, according to a New York Times article. Despite these universities\u2019 insistence that these practices are fair, Grace Kirch, a fine arts major, said using legacy preference inherently \u201cfavors people whose families were privileged enough to already get into USC.\u201d\n\n\u201cI support the ban. I don\u2019t really see the point of continuing legacy students. I think it\u2019s better if we have people from different backgrounds and experiences,\u201d Kirch said. Nevertheless, Kirch is \u201chopeful\u201d about the change. \u201cI think USC is going to comply. USC should comply,\u201d she said.\n```"}

Charli D'Amelio has over 155 million followers on Tiktok, but the 20-year-old social media star is now making the jump to Broadway. D'Amelio initially went viral in early 2019 for her dance videos. Now she'll be part of the ensemble in the musical, \"& Juliet.\" She will be featured in a dance-heavy role this fall.\n\nThe TikToker doesn't just perform for the cell-phone camera. D'Amelio also has more than a decade of experience as a competitive dancer, and made an effort in 2022 to segue into a music career. D'Amelio went on to win season 31 of Dancing With The Stars. She also starred in a reality show called \"The D'Amelio Show\" with her family, which was canceled in 2023 after three seasons.\n\nBut there are mixed opinions about a social media star entering the competitive world of Broadway, and landing a role that many professional dancers would kill for. USC junior Gabby Garcia is one who doesn't mind. \"I definitely think of her more as a TikTok dancer,\" Garcia said, \"but I have seen she does professional work, so I definitely acknowledge that part. Even though she's popular for TikTok and does TikTok dances, I'm sure she's also a good dancer other than that.\"\n\nBut the idea of influencers landing coveted Broadway roles doesn't sit well with USC sophomore Isabel Castillo. She cited the casting of North West -- daughter of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West -- as Young Simba in the Broadway musical, \"The Lion King.\" \"She just came in and swooped in, took that role,\" Castillo said. \"Other parents and mothers were waiting for the audition...and a lot of the cast members that were in Broadway were really upset with the performance and the quality of the musical.\"\n\nErika Driscoll, an Annenberg Radio News alumna and professional dancer who has performed with multiple ballet companies across the country, said she was frustrated by news of D'Amelio making her Broadway debut. \"To have somebody who just gets a role on Broadway because of their fame, or because of their number of followers or their attention on social media,\" she said, \"I just think is unfortunate for a lot of dancers who are attending auditions on the daily.\"\n\nBacklash aside, D'Amelio is slated to make her Broadway debut at the end of October.

The report provides a detailed overview of the measures the university has taken to keep students, faculty, staff and visitors safe, detailing DPS activities, campus police partnerships, community education programs, emergency response plans and crime prevention strategies. As mandated by the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, the information in this report includes crime statistics from the past three years and information about safety resources available to members of the USC community.\n\nMotor vehicle thefts are marginally down, with 268 reported in 2022 compared to 246 in 2023. The seemingly significant number of motor vehicle thefts in 2023 is somewhat misleading, DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said. The large number is because the California Vehicle Code defines an electric scooter as a \u201clittle motor,\u201d and these scooters \u2014 which have grown increasingly popular in recent years \u2014 easily become a target of thefts, Carlisle said. Still, motor vehicle thefts are a significant problem for students. To help keep numbers down, DPS supervisors and several officers patrol where students park the scooters, and will provide students with locks to secure their scooters properly, Carlisle said. If DPS officers find a scooter or bicycle unlocked and vulnerable, they will lock it and leave a note telling the student to visit DPS, where they will be asked to register their vehicle.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave them unlocked, park them in a proper rack,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cLock them with a good quality lock, and register them with DPS, and that\u2019ll help.\u201d\n\nAnother noteworthy number in the report is the 16 rapes reported on the UPC campus in 2023, 10 less than in 2022. Most of the incidents reported to DPS involved acquaintances, and in nearly every reported incident, alcohol was a factor, Carlisle said. Carlisle emphasized the importance of safety measures such as going to social events in a group and designating a trusted chaperone for extra safety when leaving campus.\n\n\u201cWe have a saying, \u2018Trojans care for Trojans,\u2019\u201d Carlisle said.\n\nThe report is available online.

Claudine came with her mom, feeling inspired after taking a class in her homeschool curriculum on elections and government. She\u2019s a staunch Trump supporter, citing abortion and inflation as two of her major concerns. When asked why she arrived so early for a 6 p.m. event, she said she was planning on a shopping spree before getting in line. She was wearing a pink bedazzled Trump hat when she walked into the venue several hours later.\n\n\u201cNobody here likes abortion, and I want to save the babies,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I feel like ever since Biden took over office, that all of those prices have been going up for us lately.\u201d\n\nClaudine is just one of the thousands of Michiganders who traveled to Macomb Community College on September 27, Trump\u2019s second stop in the state that day. This county voted twice for Barack Obama and then twice for Trump, and indications are that, like the state, it remains bitterly divided with less than six weeks until the election. Polls show Vice President Kamala Harris with a slight lead but within the margin of error. Trump is making sure he covers his bases \u2014 he\u2019s just getting to them a little late.\n\nDespite lines forming early in the day, with hundreds already lined up at 1 p.m., the nominee wouldn\u2019t take the stage until 7:30 p.m. While Claudine was browsing, people were buzzing and winding their way through long lines to get through a security checkpoint. A drumline marched back and forth, and vendors sold countless Trump-themed hats, bandanas, scarves, and stuffed animals.\n\nCathie Coon, a 64-year-old Michigan native sporting a matching \u201cTrump 2024\u201d shirt, skirt, and leggings set, got in line around 3 p.m. to see the former president for the first time.\n\n\u201c[People in Michigan] care about the housing market, employment, the economy, the border,\u201d Coon said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to go Trump because they\u2019ve always been Trump, and I think we\u2019ve always been doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nTrump won Michigan in his 2016 presidential bid, but lost it to Joe Biden in 2020. The state, which promises 15 electoral votes, is the heart of American auto manufacturing, but the industry has steadily declined for decades. John Lamping, a third-generation auto industry worker from Fraser, said he\u2019s voting for Trump because he\u2019s worried about the state of the manufacturing industry.\n\n\u201cThis is Macomb County, Michigan. This is what\u2019s called the Reagan Democrats, people with traditional auto backgrounds,\u201d said Lamping, who described himself as an independent. \u201cSo on social issues like the Second Amendment, or the right to life, or a secure border, things like that, I\u2019m of course on the Republican side of things.\u201d\n\nFurther ahead in line, Stephen Schumacher prepared to film a live shot for former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani\u2019s podcast, America\u2019s Mayor Live. Schumacher, a Michigan native and Michigan State University alum, sported a star-spangled suit, reflective shades, and a \u201cLog Cabin Republicans\u201d pin. He\u2019s the Michigan Field Director for the group, which describes itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s oldest and largest organization for LGBT conservatives\u201d on its website.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the platform that just came out of the [Republican National Convention], it is the most inclusive platform that we\u2019ve ever had, and a lot of that\u2019s due to the great work of our committee men and women,\u201d Schumacher said. \u201cThis is the most inclusive party ever, and President Trump has built the broadest Republican coalition in history.\u201d\n\nThe Republican party platform was updated in July for the first time in roughly eight years, and no longer defined marriage as between \u201cone man and one woman,\u201d a phrase which appeared in the 2016 platform multiple times. Chapter nine of the new platform states that the party will \u201ckeep men out of women\u2019s sports, ban Taxpayer funding for sex change surgeries, and stop Taxpayer-funded Schools from promoting gender transition, reverse Biden\u2019s radical rewrite of Title IX Education Regulations, and restore protections for women and girls.\u201d\n\nSchumacher came to the town hall with a group of fellow Log Cabin Republicans. He said he believes Michigan voters and the LGBTQ+ community are inspired by Trump\u2019s background as a New York businessman.\n\n\u201cOur manufacturing base has been a big problem at home right now, where we\u2019ve been especially hard hit by Dem. policies,\u201d Schumacher said, referring to Democratic. \u201cThe ultra-woke agenda, the ultra-liberal agenda, has not worked and people have had enough of it.\u201d\n\nAs supporters piled into the college\u2019s sports center, Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d blasted over the speakers, and the jumbotron flashed slogans including \u201cKamala Harris is weak, failed, and dangerously liberal.\u201d With limited seats on the bleachers, a substantial crowd filed into the empty space on the floor, some sitting against the wall and closing their eyes.\n\nBrian and Audrey, a married couple who declined to share their last names or professions, were among those on the floor. They said they each voted for the progressive Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016, but switched to Trump in 2020 because they felt his policies were better for the middle class. That\u2019s one reason Trump increased his margin of victory here in Michigan from just over 11,000 votes in 2016 against Hillary Clinton to more than 100,000.\n\n\u201cI changed a lot over 2020. The day before the election I was like, \u2018Am I really voting for Trump?\u2019 And then I did,\u201d Brian said. \u201cI almost felt a little guilty.\u201d\n\nBy 6:30 p.m., 30 minutes after the scheduled start time, the crowd was getting antsy. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, took the stage before the man of the hour, and several times the audience interrupted her by shouting, \u201cWhere\u2019s Trump?\u201d She gave the United Auto Workers Union a shoutout, emphasizing the GOP\u2019s plans for manufacturing and workers\u2019 rights in Michigan. Blackburn didn\u2019t let on, but her several-minute speech wasn\u2019t met with much enthusiasm \u2014 some attendees had spent their entire Friday waiting to see the former president in the flesh, and this surprise appearance may have seemed like another obstacle.\n\nThe format of the event was a town hall \u2014 something Trump will intersperse with the more freewheeling rallies that can last two hours and feature multiple warm-up speakers. When Trump finally arrived, with Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the U.S.A\u201d as a walk-up song, the room erupted. During the roughly 35-minute town hall, he answered five questions from the audience, mostly focused on the auto industry, immigration, and inflation. One community member, identified only as Todd, closed out the roughly 30-minute conversation on a less policy-focused note: \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite American-made car?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father was a great guy. I learned so much from him, and he loved Cadillac,\u201d Trump answered. \u201cI mean, his biggest luxury in life was to get a brand new dark blue Cadillac every two years.\u201d\n\nDespite having waited for hours to hear Trump speak, some attendees left the venue within moments of him finally taking the stage. It\u2019s a pattern that Harris used to criticize Trump during their September 10 debate. At his rally earlier on Friday in, Trump had refuted the claim, telling the West Michigan crowd, \u201cNobody ever leaves, and when they do, I finish up quick, believe me.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Justin Ha and Lindsay Augustine September 30, 2024 at 4:21 pm PDT\n\nA new poll conducted by USC, CSU Long Beach and Cal Poly Pomona last week shows that as the November election approaches, California voters, who have historically voted Democrat, support Kamala Harris more than they did Joe Biden earlier this year. Elections in the House remain close.\n\nAccording to the statewide poll of 1,685 likely voters, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are polling nearly five percentage points higher than the Biden-Harris ticket was before the Biden-Trump debate \u2013 and Biden\u2019s large drop in approval. \u201cIf she\u2019s polling better than Biden, that means Democrats are enthusiastic about her in California... Democratic voters in the congressional districts that are competitive in the state are way more enthusiastic than Republican voters \u2013 about 10 percentage points more enthusiastic \u2013 which means you\u2019re more likely to vote,\u201d said Christian Grose, a political science, international relations and public policy professor at USC and lead pollster.\n\nWhen California voters were asked to describe Trump, the most frequent descriptions were \u201cnarcissist,\u201d \u201cliar,\u201d \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d These same voters most frequently described Harris as \u201cstrong,\u201d \u201ccompetent,\u201d but also \u201cincompetent\u201d and \u201cliar.\u201d\n\nDakota Driemeyer, a junior majoring in law, history and culture and a member of the USC Republicans, said the poll\u2019s findings were a reflection of the Harris campaign\u2019s focus on shifting public opinion on Trump. \u201cAll (Democrats) ran on is that \u2018we aren\u2019t Trump,\u2019\u201d Driemeyer said. \u201cThese people in this survey are responding and they call them a liar or a narcissist because that\u2019s what the entire campaign has been.\u201d\n\nVoters\u2019 support for Democrat candidates was also corroborated by Grose\u2019s polling from last week, where Democrats are leading four of the six competitive United States House races in California. However, the poll notes that the margin of error signifies that all six races will be \u201cstatistical dead heats.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S. Senate race, the polls found Democrat Adam Schiff maintaining a large lead over Republican Steve Garvey, with 52.7% of California likely voters supporting Schiff and 33.8% supporting Garvey.\n\nThe polling concluded five days before the vice presidential debate, set to air on CBS on October 1, which could influence voters\u2019 decisions in November. Kamy Akhavan, the executive director of the Dornsife Center for the Political Future, said the abnormal election cycle combined with the assassination attempts against Trump could encourage voters to focus more on the vice president in their voting decision.\n\n\u201cNormally, vice presidential debates don\u2019t sway opinions and they don\u2019t move the campaign needles up or down ... But this election cycle is anything but normal,\u201d Akhavan said. \u201cAnd in this election cycle, given how close it is, even something like a vice presidential debate may sway voters.\u201d\n\nCalifornia voters currently have a positive view of Walz, with the poll showing that the words used most to describe him were \u201ccoach/teacher,\u201d \u201ckind\u201d and \u201chonest.\u201d Vance, in contrast, was described as a \u201cliar,\u201d \u201copportunist\u201d and \u201cmisogynist.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I think for the debate, Vance really needs to get past some of those negative perceptions he\u2019s got,\u201d Professor Grose said. \u201cAnd I think Walz needs to continue to push the narrative that is more positive, that he\u2019s a coach and a teacher.\u201d\n\nHowever, Grose ultimately believes that the vice-presidential debate, while affecting some voters particularly in the Midwest, won\u2019t significantly influence the outcome of the presidential election.\n\nIn addition to the presidential election, the poll looked ahead to the 2026 gubernatorial election and the early frontrunners in the race. Since Gov. Gavin Newsom has reached his term limit, the new poll measured enthusiasm for potential gubernatorial candidates. U.S. Representative Katie Porter is taking an early lead, with 14% of the vote. She hasn\u2019t declared her intention to run yet and didn\u2019t participate in the governor candidate\u2019s forum Sunday, but there are rumors circling that she might be interested, according to Grose.\n\nGrose said that this level of support was \u201cfairly high,\u201d particularly considering that 13 candidates were included in the poll and about half the electorate is undecided. Most other Democratic candidates were splitting the vote, placing them in fifth place or lower. However, he also suggested that this could be a ceiling for Porter.\n\n\u201cShe ran for Senate and she didn\u2019t win the primary. She came in third with Adam Schiff and Steve Garvey advancing this year for U.S. Senate,\u201d Grose said. \u201cAnd so this may be that there\u2019s a base of support of around 14% for Katie Porter, but she can\u2019t go beyond it, and some of these other candidates have more room to grow.\u201d\n```"}

(AP/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Victor Kevorkian September 30, 2024 at 4:01 pm PDT\n\nThe reigning back-to-back Super Bowl Champions are never an easy task, as the Chargers have now dropped six straight games against the Chiefs. It was evident Los Angeles would need a near-perfect game to hang with its high-powered divisional foe, especially considering the numerous key Chargers who missed Sunday\u2019s game. Both offensive tackles, Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt, were sidelined with injuries, while defensive anchors Joey Bosa and Derwin James missed the contest with an injury and a one-game suspension, respectively.\n\nWhile LA was missing stars on both sides of the ball, they remained competitive throughout. In fact, the Chargers led for the first two and a half quarters, but were shutout in the second half. The Chargers jumped on top midway through the first quarter on their first drive, when Justin Herbert found rookie receiver Ladd McConkey for a seven-yard touchdown. The No. 34 overall pick out of Georgia had his best day yet as a pro, leading the team with five catches for 67 yards, including his first quarter touchdown.\n\nWhile Herbert did not shine statistically, his pass catchers and protection frequently let him down. Herbert completed 16 of his 27 pass attempts for 179 and one touchdown, often impressively navigating collapsing pockets. While the banged-up line held up decently well through three quarters, the team ultimately felt Alt and Slater\u2019s absence in the fourth quarter, right when the Chargers were looking to tie the game. Herbert seemingly had a defender in his face every drop back, completing just one of five passes in the fourth.\n\nAfter mightily impressing through two weeks, LA\u2019s rushing attack was held in check for the second straight week. The unit finished with just 55 yards rushing, as J.K. Dobbins led the team with 32 yards. Dobbins\u2019 hot start to 2024 has cooled off significantly, as the run-first Harbaugh philosophy has stuttered.\n\nIn a similar fashion to last week\u2019s loss versus the Steelers, LA\u2019s offense struggled and failed to score in the second half. The Chargers converted just 12 first downs and went 4-13 on third down attempts. Offensive coordinator Greg Roman\u2019s unit was forced to punt six times and accounted for seven of LA\u2019s nine penalties.\n\nAnother parallel to week three\u2019s contest: defensive coordinator Jesse Minter\u2019s unit kept Los Angeles in the game. The Chargers defense forced two turnovers on Kansas City\u2019s first five offensive snaps. Linebacker Tuli Tuipulotu stripped Chiefs rookie running back Carson Steele on the team\u2019s opening drive in Chargers territory. After LA\u2019s offense capitalized with a touchdown, cornerback Kristian Fulton would intercept Patrick Mahomes on Kansas City\u2019s first play of its second drive. That meant the Chargers set up shop on the Chiefs\u2019 20-yard-line and LA came away with the team\u2019s final three points of the game.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, the Chargers defense saw solid production from two of its 2024 free agency acquisitions. Veteran defensive end Bud Dupree made an impact, sacking Mahomes twice in this contest. The 10th-year pass rusher inked a two-year deal with Los Angeles in May, providing depth behind Bosa and Khalil Mack. Just behind Dupree and company, linebacker Denzel Perryman led the team with 6 tackles, as his return to Los Angeles is off to a good start. Perryman signed a one-year deal with the Chargers in March, returning to the team who drafted him in 2015 after stints in Las Vegas and Houston.\n\nDupree and Perryman highlighted an impressive performance for Los Angeles\u2019 defense, as they held Mahomes and company in check and kept the Chargers within striking distance until the end. Mahomes completed 19 of his 29 pass attempts for 245 yards, with one touchdown and one interception\u2014an adequate performance for the two-time MVP. Travis Kelce had his best game of 2024 after a slow start, leading the team with 89 yards on seven receptions. Rookie Xavier Worthy also shined in Rashee Rice\u2019s injury-enforced absence, totaling 73 yards, including a 54-yard touchdown in the second to open the score for Kansas City. Newly re-acquired running back Kareem Hunt had a solid homecoming, accounting for 85 yards on 16 total touches.\n\nIt\u2019s not often one sees the reigning champions give up two early turnovers and only score 17 points, but it was enough for them to leave SoFi Stadium with a perfect 4-0 record. The Chargers will head into a needed bye week, which should help Alt, Bosa, Slater and even Herbert fully recover from their injuries. Los Angeles will travel to Denver to take on the Broncos in week six.\n```"}

USC established dominance early in Friday\u2019s game, pinning the Lancers nearly scoreless the entire quarter. The Trojans brought the heat, scoring four goals in the first five minutes and finishing the frame 8-1. This was the Trojan\u2019s largest first-quarter lead and the most first-half points of the season so far.\n\nThe comfortable lead throughout the half allowed for less-experienced freshmen to get their feet wet. \u201cCBU\u2019s a very good team,\u201d assistant coach Ivan Buich said. \u201cThey\u2019re hard-nosed with the way they play it blue collar, so for us to get our freshmen in, to get that experience against a team they don\u2019t see all the time, it was of the utmost importance.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s momentum slowed, as the Lancers clawed within one goal of the Trojans for the next three quarters, but CBU\u2019s slow start in the first quarter ultimately cost them the game. \u201cEveryone showed up to play,\u201d Buich said. \u201cAll three of our goalies played, which was very big, and it helped us out a lot.\u201d\n\nUSC revealed its depth on both sides of the ball. In addition to circulating goalies, ten Trojans scored in Friday\u2019s game, including hat-tricks from both sophomore utility Stefan Brankovic and redshirt freshman driver Chase Landa.

(James Tyner / USC Annenberg Media)\n\nBy Makena Arteaga and Wesley Chen September 30, 2024 at 1:19 pm PDT\n\nMalibu, California, known for its stretches of beaches and multimillion-dollar mansions, has recently become a seismic hot spot. The latest tremors \u2014 a 2.8 magnitude quake on September 28 and a 3.1 magnitude quake the following day \u2014 come on the heels of a significant 4.7 magnitude earthquake that rattled the area just weeks earlier, according to the USGS. Malibu sits alongside the Malibu Coast Fault, a north-dipping reverse fault that runs parallel to Malibu and Pacific Palisades.\n\nMark L. Benthien, the director for communication, education and outreach for the Southern California Earthquake Center, said that while there has been an uptick in Malibu earthquakes, the city does not sit on a major fault and will not experience mass devastation. \u201cYou have to have a longer or greater surface area on a fault to have a larger earthquake. You can\u2019t have a magnitude eight on a small, little local fault,\u201d Benthien explained. \u201cAnd the faults that these Malibu earthquakes were near, probably the largest earthquake that it could have would be a 7.0 or so.\u201d\n\nJohn Vidale, a USC professor of earth sciences and the former director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, noted that the recent uptick in earthquakes around Malibu can largely be classified as aftershocks of the larger 4.7 quake. \u201cThere\u2019s sort of a swarm of earthquakes happening there under Malibu,\u201d the expert on seismic hazards explained. While this increase in aftershocks is noteworthy, Vidale reassured that the overall risk level remains low and doesn\u2019t imply an imminent \u201cbig one\u201d is coming.\n\nBenthien echoed these sentiments, highlighting that while there are many faults capable of producing large earthquakes, the recent activity does not statistically indicate an increased risk. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect that these earthquakes are increasing the chance of anything or decreasing the chance of anything,\u201d he said. Instead, Benithen said these earthquakes mark a return to normal seismic behavior after periods of relative calm.\n\nStudents at USC are feeling the effects of the recent earthquakes, despite the 30-mile distance. Ricca Yip, a sophomore from Toronto studying public policy, was sleeping when the 4.7 magnitude earthquake hit Malibu. \u201cI thought I fell off the bed, but I actually thought I dreamed it. We were all like, \u2018did you feel that last night? Or was I crazy?,\u2019\u201d Yip said. Meanwhile, Jose Shaji, a graduate student studying aerospace engineering, reported feeling the ground shake in his Torrance home. \u201cIt was pretty significant,\u201d Shaji said. \u201cI felt the floor move, and my windows rattled.\u201d\n\nDespite the university\u2019s efforts to educate students on earthquake response, students\u2019 awareness of safety protocols varies. Benthien emphasized the importance of participating in drills and other trainings. \u201cWe encourage students to participate in drills to practice drop, cover and hold on. It\u2019s crucial for everyone to be informed and prepared.\u201d\n\nThe university is proactive in preparing for seismic events. Benthien praised USC\u2019s earthquake safety measures, including building retrofits and the university\u2019s involvement in the annual Great ShakeOut earthquake drill, which will take place on October 17th this year. \u201cUSC takes earthquake safety very seriously. They have high standards for the buildings being built and continuously assess their safety protocols,\u201d Benthien said. Despite these measures, five USC buildings still need retrofits, according to the LA Times.\n\nVidale, who has been working at USC since 2017, said old brick buildings pose the greatest danger. \u201cPeople in doubtful buildings maybe should be checking into their homes or where they work if there\u2019s not modern construction,\u201d he added.\n\nUniversity preparedness is just one aspect of ensuring students\u2019 safety during seismic events. The state\u2019s first-in-the-nation Earthquake Early Warning System is a new tool that alerts residents to these tremors through the MyShake app. Gov. Gavin Newsom emphasized its importance, saying \u201cThanks to our Earthquake Early Warning System, millions of people in Southern California received alerts on their mobile phones when shaking began, giving them vital seconds to drop, cover and hold on.\u201d\n\nTo help residents prepare for seismic activity, experts recommend several steps, including securing heavy items in homes and establishing communication plans in case of emergencies. The Earthquake Country Alliance recommends its comprehensive guide to earthquake safety which outlines key actions during an earthquake. Vidale stressed the importance of planning and staying informed, especially about the fault system and earthquake patterns. \u201cAnother thing is to have some supplies, to have some drinking water and to have communication arrangements in case the phone system goes out... So just be prepared \u2014 transit arrangements and supplies,\u201d Vidale said.\n\nThe recent uptick in earthquakes serves as a reminder that preparedness is not just a protocol, but a vital practice for safety in this seismically active state. \u201cStay down and remain vigilant. You never know when the next tremor might hit,\u201d Benthien said.\n```"}

Gascon told Annenberg Media that his office has prosecuted over 100,000 felonies and violent crimes during his time in office and said that was on par with prosecutions over the last 10 years.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at crime numbers and you look per capita crime is lower than most of our neighboring communities,\u201d Gascon claimed. \u201cThe city of LA now two years in a row, crime down, homicides, historic lows.\u201d\n\nBut Gascon said that while holding people accountable, he simultaneously wants to \u201cprevent over-criminalizing communities.\u201d \u201cUnderstanding that if there is no trust in the system, people are going to be less likely to cooperate with us, with the police or the prosecutors, holding ourselves, holding police, holding prosecutors accountable to the truth.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the over 200 assistant district attorneys who are publicly endorsing his opponent, Gascon said that it was only a fraction of the office. \u201cThe reality is that for many people who have been doing business the way we have for many years with mass incarceration and overly punitive process, coming in and actually moving in a different direction is very shocking to their system,\u201d said Gascon. \u201cBut I will also say that clearly the majority of the men and women of the office have not endorsed him. We\u2019ve hired 115 lawyers just in the last three years and those people are coming to the office to work the way that we want to.\u201d\n\nGascon said in a second term he would continue to focus on public safety in a way that is \u201cthoughtful\u201d and \u201cequitable.\u201d \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about organized retail theft, not only are we dealing with the people that are stealing, robbing, but we\u2019re also dealing with the people that are providing a process to be able to sell the stolen merchandise.\u201d\n\nGascon won the primary with 25.2% while Hochman received 15.9% support in a field of 12 candidates. Election day is November 5.\n```"}

During this Latine Heritage Month, North East Trees aims to increase tree canopy and green spaces in underinvested communities in Southern California.\n\nThe event empowers the Latine community through the resilience and beauty of native plants, including Black sage, Purple sage, and Southern Californian Black Walnut. With help from the Hispanic Access Foundation, these events are put on to support the Latine community\u2019s participation in outdoor activities. These activities include being in nature, protecting natural resources, transplanting small Southern California Black Walnut trees, and planting Black and Purple sage plants to stay fight back against climate change.\n\nTheir motto is to introduce environmental equity, environmental justice, and rehab restoration to the community. \u201cWe were awarded a $5,000 grant to host this event with the Hispanic Access Foundation,\u201d said Joe Laskin, Director of Development at North East Trees. Laskin leads fundraising, grants, and has established a relationship with the Hispanic Access Foundation.\n\nLuis Sierra Campos is the Community Engagement Manager for North East Trees and has worked as an environmentalist rooted in justice and equity for over 20 years. Through community organizing, he brings the Latine community together to strengthen the connection between people and the earth. Campos is the main organizer of \u201cSalvia Mi Tierra\u201d and was born to a lineage of farmers in Guanajuato, Mexico, where he always had a strong relationship with the earth.\n\n\u201cThe idea is just to inspire our community to think of these issues and the fact that being knowledgeable can come in through personal or variety of experience...they come to collective experience, they come to cultural experience, they come to oral history,\u201d said Campos, \u201cIt could come through you touching the earth. Still, you\u2019re going to build your own relationship with the environment, and that\u2019s what we want.\u201d\n\nCampos says his last name tells it all, \u201cMy last name is \u2018Sierra Campos,\u2019 so I am very much of the earth\u2014Sierra, which means mountains, and Campos, which means field. Soy de la tierra del campo.\u201d\n\nCarlos Moran, the Executive Director of North East Trees, is an immigrant from Sonora, Mexico, and a Part Time Lecturer of Social Work at USC. One of his tasks at North East Trees is to plant trees, create parks, urban forests, and green streets for the community.\n\n\u201cOver our lifetime, we\u2019ve planted hundreds and thousands of trees all over LA. We are currently working in the Northeast Los Angeles area, East Los Angeles and South Los Angeles,\u201d said Moran. \u201cWe\u2019re working in areas that need green spaces the most. If there are communities that are impacted by bad air quality, by no shade, we\u2019re there.\u201d\n\nIn events like these they hire youth and young staff to be the ones who are contributing back to their community and making them green. Campos says people from Mexico have a distinct relationship to the earth, and their relationship with society is different than other cultures.\n\n\u201cWhat I like to do is just bring people together and share the fact that we as a Latinx community have a relationship to the earth... It\u2019s in a different language than a different geography, but it\u2019s still the same earth,\u201d said Campos. \u201cIt\u2019s still the same air, it\u2019s still the same land, it\u2019s still the same water, and that\u2019s the diversity that connects different cultures.\u201d\n\nWilliam Anthony Guerrero is the urban forestry manager for \u201cSalvia Mi Tierra\u201d, which has an emphasis on a special species. The Southern California Black Walnut is a tree species that\u2019s endemic to this community, especially in the hillsides of Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI take volunteers up to a specific area where we planted this species to create a juggling woodland, which is a Black walnut woodland,\u201d said Guerrero, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna just take them in and go more in-depth into the species itself, and then they\u2019re gonna help us maintain the seedlings that we planted, whether that be watering, mulching, and also weeding around the season.\u201d\n\nKatie Vega is a fifth-generation Chicana of Indigenous descent and a Project Specialist for the Urban Trees Initiative at USC. The initiative is one of the many projects in the center that works with public and private entities to better connect with academic experts at USC. Vega\u2019s team partners with North East Trees for events like \u201cSalvia Mi Tierra\u201d to engage with the community.\n\n\u201cI work with lots of different partners and work on projects that lead to some sort of social impact. So, with the Urban Trees Initiative, we\u2019re trying to develop the research and the tools needed to help nonprofits like North East Trees and the city of L.A. to plant trees in the places where they need it the most. So our team has developed equity criteria and mapping to help those teams know where to plant trees,\u201d said Vega.\n\n\u201cSalvia Mi Tierra\u201d aims to share knowledge about green spaces in Latine communities while attempting to inform members of the community about climate change and nature in general. If you\u2019re interested in the next \u201cSalvia Mi Tierra\u201d event, it will be taking place on October 5th at Ascot Hills Park Nursery, Los Angeles, CA., at 9:00 a.m.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Erin Hooley)\n\nBy Daniel Palmore September 30, 2024 at 12:55 pm PDT\n\nAfter a win against the San Francisco 49ers last week that potentially saved their season, the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 backs are now once again against the wall. Los Angeles is now 1-3, their worst four-game start to a season since 2014. After scoring a season-high 27 points against San Francisco, Los Angeles\u2019 offense struggled in the 24-18 loss to Chicago.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, the Rams led 6-0 after two field-goal drives. Defensively, Los Angeles put up a strong fight in the first half until the Bears finally found the endzone with 5:42 remaining in the second half. The Bears entered the break ahead 10-6 after a 40-yard kick from Cairo Santos made it through the uprights with nine seconds left.\n\nLos Angeles opened the third quarter on offense but struggled without wide receivers Cooper Kupp and Puca Nacua. The Rams managed a 12-play 63-yard drive that ended with another field goal to trim Chicago\u2019s lead to one. LA\u2019s defense could not stop the Bears\u2019 next drive as rookie quarterback Caleb Williams found wide receiver D.J. Moore for a nine-yard touchdown.\n\nNow down by eight, the Rams\u2019 offense started to get into a groove. Running back Kyren Williams, who had a season-high 94 rushing yards, finished a six-play 70-yard drive with a three-yard touchdown run. Down by two, the Rams failed a two-point conversion after quarterback Matthew Stafford couldn\u2019t connect with wide receiver Demarcus Robinson in the endzone.\n\nEntering Sunday\u2019s game, running back DeAndre Swift was considered one of the most disappointing players in the league this year. The Rams\u2019 defense, which ranks last in the league, allowed Swift to regain the form he had last year after he scored a 36-yard rushing touchdown on the Bears\u2019 next drive. Los Angeles was able to cut the lead to six after settling for its fourth field goal of the day.\n\nAfter several exchanged punts, the Rams got the ball back down six points with a potentially game-winning touchdown drive ahead. Instead, Stafford threw an interception on the first play of the drive and Chicago was able to kneel the clock out.\n\nThe Rams have struggled on both sides of the ball this season, particularly on offense. Nacua is expected to miss at least another month and Kupp is expected to be out for at least the next two weeks. Without their two go-to wideouts, TuTu Atwell has been Stafford\u2019s favorite target. Atwell had another strong outing Sunday with 82 receiving yards, but through the first four weeks of the season, the Rams have only managed to put up 18 points per game and Stafford has a mere two touchdown passes.\n\nOn a more positive note, the Los Angeles rushing attack is trending in the right direction. After rushing for 75 yards through the first two games, Williams has rushed for 183 yards over the last two games. The Rams are still struggling to get consistent production from other running backs as Ronnie Rivers was LA\u2019s second leading rusher on Sunday with 26 yards.\n\nDefensively, Chicago\u2019s 24 points tied for the fewest the Rams have allowed in a loss this season. Williams\u2019 157 passing yards were also the fewest Los Angeles allowed in a game this year along with Chicago\u2019s 131 team rushing yards. The Rams\u2019 win column isn\u2019t filling up, but certain aspects are trending in the right direction. Los Angeles needs to get healthy to start winning more consistently.\n\nThe Rams have an opportunity to bounce back next week at home against another NFC North opponent, the 2-2 Green Bay Packers.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/09/30/pit-lane-politics-daniel-ricciardos-last-dance/", "response": "```\nColumn Pit Lane Politics: Daniel Ricciardo\u2019s last dance What the driver\u2019s departure means for the sport.\n\nF1 driver Daniel Ricciardo is known for his beaming smile, but something was different after qualifying in Singapore. He told the BBC\u2019s Rosanna Tennant it was a \u201cfake smile\u201d and a week later it\u2019s clear why, as news broke on Thursday that he would be leaving Visa Cash App RB Formula One Team (VCARB) for the remainder of the 2024 season. Liam Lawson, a 22-year-old from New Zealand who drove for VCARB in five races last year when Ricciardo suffered a wrist injury, will return to the team for the last six races of the season. The team has not announced its second driver for 2025, and many speculate that as long as Lawson performs at a similar level to teammate Yuki Tsunoda, the seat will be his.\n\nThe team chose to hold the announcement until after the Singapore GP, meaning Ricciardo did not get the send-off many believe he deserved. Former F1 driver and Sky Sports Commentator Martin Brundle is in that camp. \u201cIt was Daniel\u2019s last race in F1 for a while and perhaps forever. It was a rather half-hearted and confusing exit from the team perspective,\u201d he wrote in his column for Sky F1.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say his departure was unexpected. Knowing it may be his last race, Ricciardo was received back into the paddock with a guard of honor from supporters who lined his walk into the VCARB building. During interviews, he was asked about speculation of his dismissal but also wished well. \u201cHope to see you in Austin,\u201d F1TV Commentator Lawrence Barretto told a teary-eyed Ricciardo as he finished his media duties via an interview that the official Formula 1 account posted on X. An emotional Ricciardo also acknowledged \u201cthis could be my last one\u201d while thanking fans for voting him Driver of the Day; a typically insignificant accolade that held special meaning for the driver this time around. He also clinched the fastest lap, setting the track\u2019s race record and robbing McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris, his former teammate, of a coveted point towards the Drivers Championship.\n\nMid-season driver swaps aren\u2019t new. This will be the second of the season after Williams Racing\u2019s Logan Sargeant was sacked in favor of rookie Franco Colapinto last month. But this is hardly \u201cmid-season\u201d. With only six races to go in a 24-race season, it\u2019s a final chance for Lawson to prove he deserves the seat next year, and a poorly timed, badly executed sacking of one of the F1 fandom\u2019s favorite drivers.\n\nUSC Marshall student and Formula 1 fan Andrew Aarons believes Ricciardo has truly changed the business of the sport and, as a fellow Aussie, has always been a fan. \u201cAnybody with a sense of nationalism is going to support their own country,\u201d Aarons said. But Ricciardo\u2019s appeal is wider than that. \u201cHe carried the Drive to Survive show,\u201d Aarons said. \u201cI think he\u2019s one of the main reasons why F1 has had such a hype around it, such an increase in its valuation, because of his personality.\u201d\n\nDTS Executive Producer Paul Martin has said similar. \u201cWithout Daniel I think there probably wouldn\u2019t have been a Drive to Survive,\u201d Martin said in an interview with the New York Post.\n\nAs for driver swaps, Aarons believes it does come down to business. \u201cF1 is a very expensive sport, and driver\u2019s talent can only get you so far,\u201d he said. Logan Sargeant may have been near the top of the table in the so-called destructor\u2019s championship \u2014 which ranks how much each team has had to spend replacing aspects of the car following crashes \u2014 but he was not winning points. His swap made sense, and was made promptly, with clear communication from the team. But Ricciardo wasn\u2019t crashing as often, and brought incredible value to the team through sponsorship and his beloved media personality.\n\nThe choice to switch him out before the upcoming United States Grand Prix is also interesting. He has a large U.S. following and brings out a crowd to U.S. races. He\u2019s worn cowboy hats, ridden a horse into the paddock and generally adorned himself in all things America. Aarons said the timing is \u201cprobably a poor decision, although ultimately, people will only really care about what\u2019s happening on track, and Ricciardo will still be around the paddock.\u201d\n\nThe choice of this moment to announce the swap also may have less to do with Ricciardo, and more to do with his replacement. Liam Lawson\u2019s contract with RedBull is said to guarantee him an F1 seat for 2025 by the end of September \u2013 or the young driver is free to look to other teams for a seat. Scott Mitchell-Malm, writing for The Race, a digital motorsport channel, reported \u201cMaybe handing him these final few races satisfies that \u2013 or maybe he\u2019s now been guaranteed a seat for 2025, and it\u2019s a question of which team he races for.\u201d He calls it \u201csurely a 2025 Red Bull seat audition\u201d for Lawson, as many theorize that Sergio Perez\u2019s days at the top RB team are numbered following poor performance.\n\nEven out of a seat, Aarons believes Ricciardo is \u201ca professional\u201d and we\u2019ll likely see him performing media duties for RedBull in an ambassador role. \u201cHe\u2019ll still be able to be doing all of the interviews and things that he\u2019s known for,\u201d Aarons said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Red Bull brought him in in the first place.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he would have made the same decision to sack Ricciardo, Aarons took a different approach. \u201cI\u2019d keep him in the seat. I\u2019m biased, though, because I\u2019m Australian,\u201d he said. \u201cI would keep him in. I\u2019d bring Liam [Lawson] in next season in terms of business.\u201d\n\nWith Lawson likely to be signed for the 2025 season, the grid is getting younger and younger. In addition, F2 rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli has signed to Mercedes, Oliver Bearman to Haas and Jack Doohan to Alpine. This new talent is incredibly exciting for the future of the sport, and is reminiscent of the 2019 rookie class that brought in Lando Norris, George Russell and Alex Albon, who have provided some incredible racing since they joined the grid five years ago.\n\nBut as new drivers join the exclusive club of F1, existing ones must step \u2014 or be pushed \u2014 aside to make space. Ricciardo joined in 2011, and saw his best finishes \u2014 third in the championship \u2014 in 2014 and 2016. Almost 10 years later he is not performing anywhere near that same level so it comes as no surprise that he didn\u2019t land a 2025 seat. Still, his ousting becoming F1\u2032s worst-kept secret was the team\u2019s failure. Forcing Ricciardo to face the cameras with no statement regarding his future from VCARB was hard to watch.\n\nAs exciting as it is to have new talent on the grid, the handling of Ricciardo has left a bad taste in the mouths of many. F1 is a grueling, competitive and dangerous sport, but one of its most popular drivers, who competed for longer than most, deserved a better send-off than he received. His departure may have come under unfortunate circumstances, but Daniel Ricciardo\u2019s value extends well beyond the track. We\u2019ll see him again soon, whether as a Red Bull ambassador, commentator or simply a spectator staying involved in the sport he\u2019s devoted his life to.\n```"}

Another week, another slow start for USC football. Alas, the Trojans are shaping up to be comeback kings, mounting an impressive second-half resurgence that saw USC put up 28 unanswered points en route to  a 38-21 win over Wisconsin . In USC\u2019s last two games, the Trojans have been behind the eight ball on offense and sometimes defense. However, something clicks at halftime and USC comes back with a vengeance just like it did Saturday. Even though USC is 3-1 so far and are now ranked No. 11 after Kentucky upset then-No. 6 Ole Miss and Arizona defeated then-No. 10 Utah, should fans be troubled about the repeating, slow starts? According to quarterback Miller Moss, it shouldn\u2019t be cause for concern. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable going forward,\u201d Moss said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play teams where that\u2019s really going to hurt us and it did the week before, so we have to get that addressed.\u2019 Moss is right, the Trojans\u2019 schedule is an uphill climb. Next week, USC heads out to Minnesota to play the Golden Gophers. Yes, it\u2019s supposed to be 81 degrees and sunny in Minneapolis, but the Trojans could be playing in 16-mph wind gusts. USC also has to be aware of Minnesota\u2019s late-game surges too. The Golden Gophers almost pulled off a near-impossible comeback yesterday, scoring 21 points in the fourth quarter just to end up falling 27-24 to No. 10 Michigan. Then the week after, No. 7 Penn State comes to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum when the student section might be depleted because the game falls on the weekend of fall break. Some USC fans, including myself at times, have bipolar confidence in this team. On one hand, this Trojans team looks much improved from last year, especially on the defensive side of the ball. On the other hand, the allowance of big plays resembles what life was like under then-defensive coordinator Alex Grinch last year, who just happened to make his return to the Coliseum on Saturday as the safeties coach for Wisconsin. The offense shouldn\u2019t be left out either. Moss has looked great to start out this year but has started off sluggish at times, partly because he has not had enough time to stand in the pocket and deliver an accurate pass. The offensive line needs to do a much better job at protecting Moss considering the fact he\u2019s not Caleb Williams won\u2019t be as elusive with his feet. Enough of this negative talk though, some fans (me included) need to take a lesson from the late great George Michael: you gotta have faith. On offense, the presumption for Moss\u2019 offensive weapons this season would be receiver by committee. After Saturday, the Trojans may have a new No. 1 wide receiver in Ja\u2019Kobi Lane. The sophomore was scorching the Wisconsin defense all day, setting a new career high in receptions, with 10, and yards, with 105, to go along with two touchdowns. The 6-foot-4 wideout has improved rapidly in just a span of weeks, matching his touchdown total from the previous three weeks in just yesterday\u2019s game. He\u2019s become a reliable target for Moss, especially with Lane catching passes through traffic and not being fazed by the big hit. On the defensive side, it seemed like USC missed the presence of one of its leaders, redshirt senior safety Akili Arnold. During that first half, USC gave up two huge passing plays. One of them was a 63-yard touchdown pass from redshirt sophomore quarterback Braedyn Locke to junior wide receiver Vinny Anthony II and the other being a 35-yard sideline catch by senior wideout Bryson Green. In the second half, several players stepped up. Redshirt sophomore safety Kamari Ramsey laid down a massive hit to force a fourth-and-long. A collection of redshirt seniors, defensive tackle Nate Clifton and cornerbacks Greedy Vance Jr. and Jacobe Covington all deflected passes that disturbed Locke\u2019s rhythm. Then, redshirt senior linebacker Mason Cobb was able to catch a deflected pass off Covington and return it for a 55-yard pick six. It must\u2019ve felt good for Cobb who was one of the most scrutinized players last year in the Grinch era, but he\u2019s improved a great amount so far this year. The moral of the story: please keep all unnecessary hate comments until the fourth quarter.This USC team is unpredictable in the best way possible. It\u2019s amazing to see how different this Trojan team is from its predecessor so early in the season. No matter what, USC seems like it\u2019ll put up a fight to the last down, even if that means the Trojans hobble out of the gates to a slow start. Patience is a virtue. Just sit back and enjoy what this team can do as they continue to work out the kinks and become stronger as one whole unit.\n```"}

After a first-half performance where USC looked dangerous going forward and was defensively sound, neither USC or Wisconsin capitalized on their marginal chances. Following the halftime break, USC broke the game open. The Trojans opened the scoring from a beautifully delivered free kick from senior midfielder Maria Alagoa which was headed home by senior forward Simone Jackson for her first goal of the season in the 54th minute. Then, in the 70th minute, senior midfielder Helena Sampaio played a line-breaking through ball into the box which Alagoa put into the back of the net for her second goal contribution of the day. Finally, as the clock was winding down, freshman forward Jaiden Anderson won a penalty, which she finished herself by slotting the ball into the bottom left corner. Going forward, USC consistently broke down the Badger defense, with a total of 16 shots on the day compared to Wisconsin\u2019s eight, while also controlling possession for the majority of the game. Despite their three-goal performance and dominant second half showing, The Trojans could have scored more easily had it not been for an impressive five saves from Wisconsin\u2019s junior goalkeeper Drew Stover. On the defensive side of the game, USC completely shut down Wisconsin\u2019s attacking momentum. Wisconsin\u2019s biggest opportunities were through counter attacks and its six corner kick attempts. However, both proved to be a non-issue as graduate goalkeeper Laurence Gladu earned a clean sheet without having to make a save thanks to the lockdown defense in front of her. The game was a tale of two halves as USC stepped up its performance by scoring a trio of goals and dominating the game following the halftime break. \u201cI thought we had a really good second half, and I was honest with the team, I didn\u2019t love our first half,\u201d head coach Jane Alukonis said. \u201cJust overall work rate, effort, grind, ball speed, all of that. But you know, we were honest and forward with them at half time about that and I thought that they took it very very well and executed.\u201d Despite their start not going to plan, Alukonis explained the difference between their performances in each half and also gave her team praise for the turnaround. \u201cThere was a big difference of effort,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cWe always tell our team you want to make the other team feel like they have no control and no chance of winning the game. And today, throughout this whole season, [that] was the best we did it in terms of [the] second half.\u201d A large part of the dominant second half was the performance of the Portuguese midfielder Alagoa, who assisted the first goal and scored the second. Following the game, she explained what was going through her head for the assist that opened up the game for her team. \u201cI think it was time for us to score. We were being dangerous, and I just looked for [Jackson],\u201d Alagoa said. \u201cI know she\u2019s a really good header, so just try to place it as good as I could, so that she could just head the ball in and score the goal. But I think it was a really good team effort until the first goal, and we deserved it.\u201d Following Alagoa\u2019s goal \u2014 USC\u2019s second of the game \u2014 she explained her emotions about scoring on top of a moment she shared before the game with fellow midfielder and roommate Sampaio. \u201cScoring is always the best feeling, because scoring a goal in football is the best. It\u2019s the objective,\u201d Alagoa said. \u201cThe first interaction of the day was me showing (Sampaio) a pass that she made to me in the Stanford game. And it was like the exact same pass. And so now we were just joking, because it was just a really good, funny coincidence. But it\u2019s so fun to get more and more chemistry with the teammates.\u201d Looking ahead, the Trojans will play their final home game of a three-game stretch at Dignity Health Sports Park against a 5-7 squad Oregon on Saturday, October 5 at 12 p.m. In regards to the team mentality for the game next week as well as other games ahead, Alukonis said, \u201cAs much as soccer is a tactical technical battle, it\u2019s also mentality and just being able to leave everything that you have on the field and make the opponent feel under immense pressure, suffocated, all of that. So I think we need to kind of bring that fight, that Trojan spirit more every night.\u201d After the game next week, USC will travel to Illinois for a pair of games against Big Ten opponents Northwestern and Illinois. After this trip, USC will return back to Los Angeles where it hopes to defeat ranked opponents Penn State and Ohio State as well as crosstown rival UCLA.\n```"}

(Photo by Utkarsh Mohan)\n\nBy Sydnie McClain\nSeptember 29, 2024 at 1:12 pm PDT\n\nAfter a dominant showing in the Trojans/Lions Invitational last week, USC women\u2019s volleyball continued its momentum in its Big Ten premiere on Friday, taking a five-set victory against the Ohio State Buckeyes to extend its winning streak to six matches.\n\nThe first set was a tight battle, featuring six tie scores as both teams struggled to gain an edge. However, the Buckeyes managed to pull ahead with four separate four-point streaks, fueled by 14 kills \u2014 six of which came from graduate outside hitter Emily Londot \u2014 and an attack percentage of .154, outpacing the Trojans\u2019 .059. This momentum carried the Buckeyes to a 25-19 set win.\n\nThe Trojans came out strong in the second set, applying pressure from the start and maintaining the lead throughout, beginning with a 4-0 run. Graduate outside hitter Ally Batenhorst, who had no kills in the first set, matched Ohio State\u2019s total number of kills in the set, with five of her own. As the Trojans began to establish a significant lead, the Buckeyes had their own four-point streak, but redshirt junior middle blocker Tyrah Ariail stopped their momentum with two crucial kills, making the score 24-20. Freshman outside hitter Jadyn Livings then sealed the deal with an explosive kill, securing the Trojans a 25-21 victory to even the match at 1-1.\n\nDespite a seven-point run that tied the score at 16-16 in the third frame, the Buckeyes were unable to take the lead. The Trojans claimed the set, propelled by graduate outside hitter Grae Gosnell\u2019s six digs and a series of kills from Ariail, Batenhorst and Livings, which overwhelmed the Buckeyes. The Trojans won the set 25-20, putting them ahead in the match 2-1.\n\nIn the fourth set, the Buckeyes mirrored the Trojans\u2019 previous set victory, winning 25-20 and setting up a crucial fifth and final set. Redshirt freshman outside hitter Grace Egan delivered six kills for the Buckeyes, helping them tie the match at 2-2.\n\nIn the final set, the Trojans appeared to be on their way to victory with a commanding 12-6 lead. The Buckeyes put the heat on USC, outscoring the Trojans 7-2 over the next nine points to close the gap to 14-13. But in the end, redshirt sophomore opposite hitter Adonia Faumuina \u2014 after missing the 2023 season due to injury \u2014 clinched the match for the Trojans with a game-winning kill.\n\nKeller said that the win \u201cgives you an idea of what this entire conference is going to be like.\u201d Looking ahead to the upcoming showdown with Nebraska on Sunday, Keller remains unfazed by their ranking. He emphasized the importance of staying true to their game, believing that whether they win or lose, the experience will lead to growth.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, when the whistle blows, you play ball,\u201d Keller said.\n\nWith seven ranked teams in the Big Ten, the competition is fierce. The Trojans now turn their attention to No. 2 Nebraska, who they face on Sunday in Lincoln, Nebraska.\n```"}

(AP/Erin Hooley)\n\nBy Matt Kim September 29, 2024 at 9:45 am PDT\n\nIn an exciting week three matchup where the Rams (1-2) hosted the 49ers (1-2), a ragtag roster marred by injury erased a 10-point fourth quarter deficit, capped off by Jake Karty kicking a game-winning field goal. With star receivers Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp out for the foreseeable future, head coach Sean McVay turned to wide receivers Tutu Atwell, Jordan Whittington and Tyler Johnson to fill. While their production didn\u2019t match the stellar performances fans are used to with Nacua and Kupp, they performed when it mattered most, including a 50-yard catch by Atwell that led to a game-tying touchdown from running back Kyren Williams. That was one of three total touchdowns Williams recorded on Sunday, and as the Rams attempt to resolve their depleted roster, they\u2019ll continue to turn to him against the struggling Bears.\n\nThe Bears (1-2) are coming off a close loss to the Colts and much like the Rams, have struggled to find key contributors on offense outside of star wideout D.J. Moore. Rookie quarterback Caleb Williams has had mixed reviews on his play so far, but outside factors such as the offensive line, playcalling, and non-existent run game have contributed to his struggles. The USC product threw for 363 yards, but turned the ball over three times via two interceptions and a fumble. Niners wide receiver Jauan Jennings torched the Rams to the tune of 11 receptions for 175 yards and three touchdowns, so it\u2019ll be key for LA\u2019s secondary to limit Williams through the air. They\u2019re currently Sharp Football analysis\u2019 22nd-ranked secondary in the NFL, so this will be a chance for first-year defensive coordinator Chris Shula to make a statement.\n\nThe run game has been a glaring hole in the Bears\u2019 offense, as running back D\u2019Andre Swift has been disappointing to say the least. After signing a three-year, $24 million contract in the offseason, Swift has been the main culprit behind the second-worst run game in the NFL. The former Georgia bulldog has averaged an abysmal 1.8 yards per carry, and the Bears collective unit has only mustered 1.8 yards per carry and 72.7 yards per game. The Rams held running back Jordan Mason to 4.1 yards per carry, so if the front seven can maintain momentum against a struggling unit, they\u2019ll force the Bears quarterback to make mistakes through the air.\n\nOn the flipside, the aforementioned Kyren Williams will be the core of this offense alongside quarterback Matthew Stafford. The Bears have blown both hot and cold against opposing running backs, as in week three against the Colts, Jonathan Taylor rushed for 110 yards and two touchdowns, but the week prior against the Texans, Chicago held Cam Akers to 32 yards. Since his breakout in 2023, Kyren has been one of the most talented backs in the game and with the injuries mounting, he\u2019ll be depended on as much as ever. The offense will ultimately flow through Stafford, as even with his primary weapons out, he\u2019s been serviceable, throwing for over 220 yards in each game and a 2:1 touchdown to interception ratio. He won\u2019t single-handedly change the outcome of this game, especially against a stingy Bears secondary, but if he can move the ball downfield alongside the efforts of Kyren Williams and company, this game will come down to the wire.\n```"}

(Photo by Utkarsh Mohan)\n\nBy nikki thomas September 28, 2024 at 6:08 pm PDT\n\nNo. 13 USC football (3-1, 1-1 Big Ten) triumphed against the Wisconsin Badgers (2-2, 0-1) in its first Big Ten game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday. The Trojans entered the matchup looking to recover from a tight 27-24 loss at No. 12 Michigan last week, whereas the Badgers came off of a 42-10 loss to Alabama on September 14. With the win Saturday, USC moved to 7-1 against Wisconsin in program history.\n\nUSC received the first half kickoff and quickly got to work, marching down the field behind stout running from redshirt senior back Woody Marks. Redshirt junior quarterback Miller Moss looked comfortable early, launching a 32-yard completion to sophomore wide receiver Ja\u2019Kobi Lane to finish off a six-play touchdown drive within the first 2:37 of play.\n\nWisconsin came into the game relying on a run-heavy offensive scheme after losing its starting QB Tyler Van Dyke to an ACL injury in the Badgers\u2019 matchup against the Crimson Tide. Redshirt sophomore signal caller Braedyn Locke stood in for Van Dyke against the Trojans and appeared to be settling in well in the first.\n\nAfter USC\u2019s first touchdown, the Badgers bit back immediately, putting together a four-play scoring drive capped by Locke\u2019s 63-yard touchdown pass to junior receiver Vinny Anthony II. After exchanging punts with the Badgers, the Trojans started their next drive on the 1-yard line thanks to a stellar punt from Wisconsin sophomore Atticus Bertrams, and initially struggled to make it out of the endzone.\n\nThey got out of trouble thanks to some nifty running from Marks and redshirt freshman Quinten Joyner, and again moved the chains on a first down connection from Moss to redshirt junior receiver Kyron Hudson. In a third-and-1 situation, Moss kept the ball himself, rushing right for nine yards and another first.\n\nHowever, USC started looking shakier as the half continued on. In the same drive, Moss threw an interception to redshirt senior safety Preston Zachman with 0:37 left in the first. Though Wisconsin went three-and-out to end the quarter, sophomore receiver Zachariah Branch fumbled the resulting punt, and the Badgers recovered on the Trojans\u2019 18-yard line.\n\nSenior running back Tawee Walker carried the ball in, giving Wisconsin a 14-7 lead. The next USC drive was stopped short by a false start call, and redshirt senior kicker Michael Lantz booted a 41-yard field goal to bring it to 14-10 in favor of Wisconsin.\n\nThe Badgers stormed back downfield in their next set, ignited by a 35-yard sideline pass from Locke to senior receiver Bryson Green. Locke hit redshirt junior receiver Will Pauling up the middle for 13 yards and a first before slinging the ball to redshirt senior tight end Riley Nowakowski for another nine yards. From there, it was easy money for Walker, who carried the ball four yards for his second touchdown on the day.\n\nDown 21-10, the Trojans needed an electric drive to get back in the game. Moss came out hot, relying on his trusted receiving core of Hudson, Lane and freshman tight end Walker Lyons. For a moment, it seemed as if USC could cut the deficit before the half. But Moss had been feeling the pressure all afternoon.\n\nWisconsin junior safety Austin Brown got loose and forced a Moss fumble, which the Badgers recovered at their own 24-yard line. And though Wisconsin was forced to punt with 1:11 left in half, USC was unable to get the ball into Badger territory and ended the half down 21-10.\n\nA muffed punt early on in the third quarter from Wisconsin gave the Trojans a chance to tighten the gap. USC entered the redzone on yet another Moss-Lane connection, but was frustrated by a third down illegal formation call. That could not stop Lane, the proverbial man of the hour, though.\n\nHe caught a 15-yard sideline bullet from Moss before the two connected once again for a 6-yard touchdown, bringing the Trojans back within four. Asked what he was thinking during that pass sequence, Lane simply said, \u201cI saw the ball in the air. Caught it. Touchdown.\u201d\n\nFrom then on, the tide began to turn in the Coliseum. Trojan fans, who had been relatively quiet since the second quarter, started to get loud again. They screamed and booed when Green moved the chains for Wisconsin. They roared with indignation on what they thought was a missed offensive pass interference call on Pauling.\n\nEven when the Badgers marched into Trojan territory without much trouble, the atmosphere was taut, electric, teeming with energy. \u201cThe excitement in there in the Coliseum in the second half was really cool,\u201d Riley said. \u201cGreat day, awesome to get our first Big Ten win.\u201d\n\nThe Badgers got downfield fairly easily at first. Then, when a Wisconsin first down was reviewed and overturned, USC\u2019s gassed defense gave the fans what they deserved: a fourth-down stand on their own 33-yard line to take over on downs.\n\n\u201cThey play a really tough brand of football,\u201d Moss said of the defense. \u201cI think they really embody what we want to be about. It\u2019s a luxury as an offense to have a good group on the other side.\u201d\n\nGalvanized by the defense, Moss led the Trojans downfield, hitting sophomore receiver Duce Robinson for a 32-yard gain that put USC in the redzone. Three plays later, it was Robinson that caught Moss\u2019 8-yard touchdown pass after the QB beat the blitz to put the Trojans up 24-21.\n\nUSC\u2019s defense, in turn, looked better-rested during the next Wisconsin drive, forcing another Badger three-and-out to end the third quarter. When the Trojan offense retook the field, everything looked automatic. Moss threw three straight quick first down receptions to Marks, Joyner and Hudson.\n\nMoving into Wisconsin territory and facing a fourth-and-1, Moss got tricky on the keeper, spinning past defenders for his first rushing touchdown of the day. The Trojan lead was 31-21.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never seen that. That little jump in the endzone was crazy,\u201d redshirt senior linebacker Mason Cobb said postgame, stifling a laugh. \u201cHey, the spin was nice though. He must\u2019ve gotten that from somebody.\u201d\n\nAfter a three-and-out from both teams, the Badgers got the ball and the cracks in their passing game began to show. Locke lobbed an interception to Cobb, who took it back 55 yards to the house to make it a 38-21 game.\n\nDown 17 deep in the fourth quarter, the Badgers still had some fight left in them. Anthony II attempted to spark the Wisconsin offense with a 74-yard punt return all the way to USC\u2019s 18-yard line. But despite their electric start to the drive, the Badgers turned the ball over on downs at the USC 12-yard line.\n\nThe Trojans ran the clock down and took a knee to win the game 38-21. It was certainly a well-rounded effort from the Trojan team. Moss finished the game 30-for-45 for 308 yards and two turnovers. Lane led USC in receiving yards with 105 \u2014 a game record for the young Trojan \u2014 on 10 catches with two touchdowns.\n\nMarks once again led USC\u2019s rush offense with 63 yards on 19 carries. Plus, the Trojan defense allowed only 105 rushing yards after giving up 290 on the ground to Michigan last weekend.\n\nUSC came into the game ranked No. 1 in the Big Ten in passing offense, and Riley seems confident about his team\u2019s ability to keep that momentum going. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna battle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere. We don\u2019t panic.\u201d\n\nUSC travels to Minnesota for its next Big Ten matchup October 5 at 4:30 p.m.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Jackson Shubb\nSeptember 27, 2024 at 10:41 pm PDT\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers took a crucial series win against the rival San Diego Padres, losing game one 4-2, followed by 4-3 and 7-2 victories. After a disappointing loss in game one of the series, the Dodgers bounced back and secured regular-season reign in Los Angeles with yet another division title.\n\nDown 4-1 in the 9th inning of game one, the Dodgers began their rally, which was eventually halted. With designated hitter Shohei Ohtani on deck as the winning run, shortstop Miguel Rojas grounded into an unexpected triple play to end the game in a devastating fashion for LA. The Padres clinched a Wild Card spot in this year\u2019s postseason with the victory.\n\nThe Dodgers\u2019 bullpen kept the team alive in the series. With no LA starter throwing more than five innings, Alex Vesia, Evan Phillips, Blake Treinen and new closer Michael Kopech shut down the Padres. Kopech\u2019s recent performances, especially in this series, have further proved him to be an outstanding trade-deadline pickup. Originally seeming to be acquired as a long-term reliever, Kopech has begun to cement himself as the team\u2019s closer. With October ahead, Kopech could certainly close out important playoff games.\n\nNobody was surprised to see Shohei Ohtani put up MVP numbers once again in the series win. The Japanese superstar tallied a double in each of the three games, now with a total of 37 on the season. His double in the 6th inning of game two effectively won the Dodgers the game, driving in what was the eventual winning run.

(Photo by Massuda Kohgadai)\n\nBy Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier September 27, 2024 at 9:24 pm PDT\n\nAfter a brutal 27-24 loss last weekend at then-No. 18 Michigan, No. 13 USC football (2-1, 0-1) will play its first game in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as a member of the Big Ten when the Wisconsin Badgers (2-1, 0-0) come to town Saturday. Following the loss to the Wolverines, USC dropped two spots in this week\u2019s AP poll, while the Badgers were off last week after losing to Alabama 42-10 two weeks ago.\n\nThe Badgers, who have been unranked all season, have faced the Trojans seven times, with USC claiming six of those wins. Wisconsin won the last matchup, a 23-21 victory over the Trojans in the 2015 Holiday Bowl.\n\nWhile the Badgers will be more rested than the Trojans because of their bye week, the Trojans have a few advantages working in their favor when the Badgers take the field. Wisconsin\u2019s opening day starter, senior quarterback Tyler Van Dyke, was injured during the opening drive in the game against the Crimson Tide. After Van Dyke left the game, the Badgers turned to sophomore Braedyn Locke to lead the offense. Locke went 13 for 26 and threw a touchdown after he replaced Van Dyke against Alabama.\n\nIn addition to the change at quarterback, the Trojans will also see a familiar face on Wisconsin\u2019s coaching staff: Alex Grinch. After following USC head coach Lincoln Riley to Los Angeles from Oklahoma, Grinch served as USC defensive coordinator for the 2022 and 2023 seasons. His defenses, however, were among the worst in the FBS during his tenure, and he was ultimately fired by Riley the day after a 52-42 loss to Washington last season.\n\nOver the offseason, Wisconsin head coach Luke Fickell added Grinch to his staff, naming the former Trojans\u2019 coordinator as the co-defensive coordinator and safeties coach. \u201cI think personally, it\u2019ll be good to see him. It\u2019ll certainly be unique being on opposite sidelines,\u201d Riley said of Grinch during his weekly Thursday press conference. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see how the game unfolds. I mean, obviously, you know Coach Grinch has a good familiarity with what we\u2019ve done, but I still think the game comes down to players and who executes best on Saturday afternoon.\u201d\n\nWhile the Trojans will have some idea of what to expect from the Badgers\u2019 defense, junior defensive tackle Bear Alexander has told USC that he will be redshirting the remainder of the season in order to preserve his remaining two years of college eligibility. Alexander\u2019s announcement follows months of back and forth speculation of a falling out with USC coaching staff. It now appears to be related to the lack of playing time Alexander has been receiving relative to other tackles on the depth chart, most notably Vanderbilt transfer Nate Clifton and Wyoming transfer Gavin Meyer, both of whom are redshirt seniors.\n\nAlexander has not started a game this year, and has only played 69 defensive snaps this season. Riley declined to comment on Alexander during his weekly press conference, but did offer his thoughts into how Alexander\u2019s announcement will affect competition among the rest of the defensive line. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed really. It\u2019s been high from the start of the season,\u201d Riley said on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of guys in that room that are contributing, that are playing at a high level. You don\u2019t have some of the plays and results that we\u2019ve had defensively without that, and so it\u2019s going to be about the group and their effort, and I mean, just business as usual.\u201d\n\nWith Alexander redshirting the remainder of the season, USC will need to rely on Clifton and Meyer, as well as the other defensive tackles, now more than ever. In addition, the offensive line struggled to protect redshirt junior quarterback Miller Moss against a relentless Michigan defense. Despite the offensive line, Moss still threw for three touchdowns, but did throw a crucial pick-six that put the Wolverines up for good at the Big House.\n\nIn order for the Trojans\u2019 offense to thrive in the Big Ten, the line needs to be more solid and to give Moss more time to make plays, especially since the style of play is much more physical than what the Trojans were used to seeing in the Pac-12. \u201cWe all have to be better there. I got to put them in better positions,\u201d Riley said of the offensive line\u2019s performance after practice on Tuesday. \u201cWe certainly have to play better there. There\u2019s plenty of opportunities in that game, we\u2019re blocking just fine and we missed several opportunities that way too. So the reality is we all gotta be a little bit better, there\u2019s not any group that needs to be massively better.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans and Badgers kick off at 12:30 p.m. Saturday in the Coliseum for USC\u2019s first Big Ten home game.\n```"}

Between September 26 and December 6, students, alumni and fans will be able to link their donation towards a particular university. The school with the most donations in their name at the end of the donation period will earn one million dollars to advance student or community health however they see fit.\n\nTo link their donations, individuals will submit a photo from their donation of a screenshot of a confirmation email they received. At the time of publication, 108 donors had associated their donation with a particular school according to the Big Ten\u2019s online tracker and USC had one donor.\n\nIn a post on the USC Athletics Twitter account, head coach Lincoln Riley said the drive was especially important given a blood shortage in the United States. \u201cGive blood this season and you can help save up to three lives each time,\u201d Riley said. \u201cLet\u2019s make Trojan nation the number one blood donor in the Big Ten.\u201d\n\nIn January 2024, the American Red Cross declared an emergency blood shortage. According to the organization\u2019s press release, donations through the Red Cross have fallen by about 40% over the last 20 years. According to the Red Cross, almost 13.6 million units of blood components are collected annually in the U.S. and are used in treatments ranging from trauma to childbirth and chronic diseases.\n\nPromotional material will continue to appear on USC social media in the coming weeks. Abbott and the Big Ten have partnered with NFL star Tom Brady to promote the initiative. Individuals who donate through \u201cThe We Give Blood Drive\u201d will receive a free one-month subscription to the B1G+, the Big Ten\u2019s streaming service, and will be entered into a drive to win a trip to the championship game, December 10.\n\nAt a press conference launching the event, Abbott CEO Robert Ford said the collaboration with the Big Ten specifically was influenced by the size of the conference and the proximity of Abbott\u2019s corporate headquarters in Illinois. Ford said the program was important to raise awareness of blood donation among young people.\n\n\u201cAs the older generations become less likely to be eligible to donate, we want to engage and inspire young people to be part of the solution by becoming regular donors,\u201d Ford said. \u201cThe younger generation is known for its altruism and desire to give back to the community so we approached the Big Ten with a concept: what if we mobilized the Big Ten\u2019s large and impassioned community to put its famous energy into this work.\u201d\n\nRyan Kober, director of philanthropy for American Red Cross at USC and a junior studying human development and aging, said incentives like gift cards for donating blood can also be motivators in promoting donation among young people, pointing to the image of the broke college student.\n\n\u201cJust telling them the benefits, and that you\u2019re actually saving lives and doing this and it\u2019s one of the easiest ways to save lives. I think that that really can pull people in,\u201d said Kober. \u201cSometimes the Red Cross will give you an incentive for giving blood \u2014 so there\u2019s like a $20 gift card for Amazon \u2014 so once the students hear that, their eyes light up, and that always pulls them in.\u201d\n\nThe collaboration will include bringing mobile blood drives to Big Ten campuses throughout the football season. The USC date will be finalized within the next couple of weeks, according to an Abbott spokesperson. LifeStream Blood Bank, the primary blood supplier for Keck Medicine of USC, has scheduled a blood drive on October 2 at USC Village and participants can count their donation toward USC\u2019s total.\n\nAmerican Red Cross at USC, which normally promotes the campus blood drives, has had difficulty with promoting the upcoming blood drive given the delay in processing RSO applications. However, Kober said the new program will motivate them to promote blood donation in the week leading up to October 2.\n\nIn order to be eligible to donate, individuals must be at least 17 years old, weigh at least 110 pounds, have normal blood pressure and temperature, and may be ineligible given medication, travel or sexual history.\n```"}

The Public Employee Relations Board will review the charge and either dismiss the case or move forward with settlement negotiations.\n\n\u201cUC\u2019s actions to suppress speech about Palestine on our campuses, which represents an illegal content-based restriction of faculty rights, sets an alarming precedent,\u201d said CUCFA President Constance Penley in a press release. \u201cOur unfair labor practice filing demands they change course and follow the law, and make whole the faculty who have been harmed.\u201d\n\nCUCFA details university faculty being threatened with disciplinary action for voicing pro-Palestinian rhetoric or including information on the conflict in their course curriculums. \u201cThose positions result from pressure from politicians, donors, alumni, outside organizations and the regents, who have failed mightily in their mandate to protect the University from undue political interference,\u201d Penley said.\n\nIn one instance cited, a UC Irvine professor amended their syllabus to include two documentaries on \u201cthe Palestinian struggle,\u201d and was subsequently sent a letter of warning from the University\u2019s administration. The letter noted a violation of the faculty code of conduct, which limits the use of the classroom for \u201cpurposes of political advocacy.\u201d\n\nCUCFA also alleges inconsistent administration policy on free speech protections for pro-Palestinian protestors on the UCLA campus, including a public statement from UCLA Chancellor Gene Block condemning activism that makes the community \u201cfeel bullied, threatened, and afraid.\u201d\n\nThe faculty group compares this to the UCLA Police Department\u2019s lack of action to protect protestors when anti-Palestinian counter-protesters attacked the UCLA Encampment between April 25 and April 30. Counter-protestors assaulted protestors with metal pipes and set off fireworks in encampments, which resulted in one protester being carried away in an ambulance.\n\nThe media liaison for UCLA\u2019s Palestine Solidarity Collective, Kenza K., who requested only the initial of her last name be included for security reasons, said the organization has worked closely with faculty as they \u201care fighting for the same cause that the genocide is only expanding,\u201d K. said. \u201c[The lawsuit] really shows the extent to which the strength of the movement and the strength of the repression as well on the other side has been propagating and escalating.\u201d\n\nUSC has been publicly criticized for having double standard policies regarding faculty and the Israel-Palestine conflict. Last spring, the University faced controversy for not disciplining John Strauss, a professor of economics who was filmed confronting pro-Palestinian protestors with comments wishing death to Hamas members. By contrast, students involved in pro-Palestinian protests were disciplined with official warnings on their records and mandated to write \u201cremorseful\u201d essays.\n```"}

{"key": "/2024/09/27/governor-newsom-signs-bill-regulating-social-media-for-minors/", "response": "```\nGovernor Gavin Newsom signed a new bill into law that aims to combat social media addiction for minors last Friday. Senate Bill 976, or the Protecting Our Kids from Social Media Addiction Act is the newest California law to address unhealthy screen addiction. It comes among a new wave of bills responding to concerns that social media is too addictive for young people.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2027, the new law will force social media companies to create mechanisms to restrict minors from receiving notifications, limit access to them algorithmic feeds, target age-friendly pieces of media and set profiles to private. Parents and guardians of minors also have full access to these mechanisms to adjust settings for their children.\n\nIn a published study from N. R. Ramesh Masthi in the National Library of Medicine, \u201cAdolescents have greater exposure to electronic gadgets like smartphones at a much younger age, and hence, are more prone to social media overuse or addiction. Social media addiction was found in over one-third of [the study\u2019s] subjects and the majority had mild addiction.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Assembly Committee On Privacy and Consumer Protection, this law will prohibit operators from providing minors with addictive feeds and notifications within a time frame unless consented to by parents or guardians. Many see this law as a saving grace for adolescents\u2019 dependency to social media and electronics in general, and an effective way to limit dangerous or inappropriate content.\n\nJames P. Steyer, the CEO of Common Sense Media, told CNN that kids will see what they want to see rather than what the big companies want them to see which keeps them hooked. According to Steyer, \u201cthis bill is good for kids\u2019 mental and physical health.\u201d\n\nWhile many proponents are excited about curbing the addictive nature of social media, there are various organizations that oppose the law. Jack Murphy, co-president of USC Reach and a Snapchat and TikTok content creator, said about the bill, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s centered towards the right issues, I think fake news and false information is the number one threat from social media. It\u2019s not about the addictiveness.\u201d\n\nThe bill also aims to promote a chronological feed, rather than an algorithmically curated one, attacking the issue of addiction. The assumption is that showing content chronologically is less addictive than an algorithm curated on the latest trends, however, according to CNN, many fear this is a violation of the First Amendment\u2019s prioritization of editorial discretion.\n\n\u201cAs someone who identifies with the LGBTQ+ community, I see [this bill] as a threat against children realizing their own identities,\u201d said Murphy. Freddy Nager, USC professor and professional in marketing and digital media, agrees that the problem is not about blocking specific content, but rather the way the information is presented.\n\n\u201cWhen the government starts dictating what is good content and what is bad content, that\u2019s controversial, particularly depending on which side of the political aisle you sit on,\u201d Nager said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to politicize content, but rather, let\u2019s look at the delivery mechanism.\u201d\n\nProfessor Nager proposes that a Senate bill may not be the most effective way to limit these addictions, but rather changes to media literacy pedagogy. \u201cBeyond the tech solution, there needs to be a cultural solution. Something that I would like to see done is having media literacy taught for young people from as soon as they enter junior high school, they need to understand who produces media, what are the motivations? What is fact checking?\u201d Nager said. \u201cWe do this at Annenberg, but I think today\u2019s kids are creators and they\u2019re consumers, and nobody has taught them this yet.\u201d\n\nTackling this complicated issue is unfortunately unclear, as mentioned by Jenna Gestetner, USC Reach member majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation,\u201dI don\u2019t think you can keep all of the positive things that social media provides without sometimes being harmful or addictive.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP/Adam Beam)\n\nBy Ana Susman, Caitlin Roehmholdt and Annabelle Le Roux\nSeptember 27, 2024 at 12:03 pm PDT\n\nOn January 1, 2026, California shoppers will have a singular bag option \u2013 paper. After failed initial efforts to limit single-use bags, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a new bill into law on Sunday that will ban all plastic bags from grocery store checkout lines in California.\n\nSen. Catherine Blakespear and Assembly Member Rebecca Bauer-Kahan introduced a new bill to amend the 2016 Proposition 67, which banned grocery stores from handing out single-use plastic bags. According to the New York Times, previously, many companies bypassed the 2016 ban by introducing \u201creusable plastic bags,\u201d which consisted of thicker plastic that was considered recyclable. Yet, according to a 2024 survey by The California Public Interest Research Group, CALPIRG, a student-directed advocacy group, these bags aren\u2019t usually reused or recycled.\n\nThe survey determined that only 2% of people carried plastic bags into the grocery store to reuse them. Additionally, their data revealed that people discarded 231,072 plastic bags in 2021, compared to 157,395 discarded in 2014. The new legislation closes a loophole by banning all plastic bags in grocery store lines.\n\nThe amended bill aims to motivate consumers to bring reusable bags for store purchases rather than relying on plastic bags, so that California can reduce its plastic consumption. L.A. County Chief of Sustainability Rita Kampalath explained how an effort to eliminate the use of plastic bags has been in the works for years.\n\nThe \u201clightweight\u201d nature of plastic bags allows \u201cso much opportunity for [them] to escape from waste management and make it out into the environment,\u201d making it a \u201chigh priority and high target for legislators and policymakers\u201d in recent years, Kampalath said.\n\nSince 2007, California has worked to ban plastic bags, with San Francisco being the first to enact the ban. Other California cities such as Los Angeles, San Jose and Berkeley followed; however, the effectiveness was short-lasting as stores quickly shifted to offer thicker plastic bags that they deemed \u201creusable,\u201d according to the New York Times.\n\nThough larger corporations have resisted legislative efforts, Kampalath believes that Californians will be receptive to the new changes. \u201cThis is something that people want,\u201d Kampalath said. \u201cSustainability and waste, it really is about just making it easier for people to make the right choice. So to me, this law is really about supporting people and making the choices that they want to make for a more sustainable County in California.\u201d\n\nThe USC Village Target gives thick plastic bags to customers in the checkout lines, which are significantly sturdier than the typical flimsy ones \u2013 a prime example of the workaround companies have also used.\n\nBillie Oleyar, a junior theatrical design major, said they are \u201cpart of the problem.\u201d They said they try remembering their reusable bags but \u201calways forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe slow progression that we\u2019re making towards stopping the use [plastic bags] is really helpful. I just wish it could be sped along,\u201d Oleyar said.\n\nWhile the law will not take effect until 2026, Mick Dalrymple, chief sustainability officer and leadership in energy and environmental design, encourages students to be proactive in their sustainability efforts and \u201cbring [their] own reusable bags anytime [they] shop.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs with working out, creating a regular study schedule, or establishing any other habits, it takes a certain amount of repetition to create the habit and you\u2019re going to forget them occasionally until it becomes your new normal. Don\u2019t get frustrated. Just keep doing it,\u201d Dalrymple said.\n\nOpportunities like student sustainability training are available for USC students where they can learn sustainable practices \u2013 such as utilizing reusable bags \u2013 and build their understanding of how they can better the environment.\n\nUSC is \u201cleading, ahead of any potential future expansion to this law,\u201d he said. The school has already eliminated plastic bags in a majority of their retail operations, he said, but there is still work to be done to eliminate plastic bags on campus entirely.\n\nThough the ban has been a long time coming and has faced many setbacks, \u201call progress towards sustainability is good news, the faster the better,\u201d Dalrymple said.\n```"}

Gavin Newsom interviews on air after the debate in 2023. (Photo by jen byers)\n\nBy David Rendon and Cormac Cadden\nSeptember 27, 2024 at 11:44 am PDT\n\nOn Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed Assembly Bill 2586, a bill that would have allowed undocumented students to work campus jobs at public universities. The bill had a long list of supporters that included the University of California system, but the University of Southern California did not publicly support the bill.\n\nDiana Cervantes, co-executive director of the Undocumented Trojans Student Assembly (UTSA) and a senior majoring in business of cinematic arts, said that she often feels unsupported by the university with this being just the latest example.\n\n\u201cSince USC is a private institution, they\u2019re not required to follow state laws, I think that\u2019s their little loophole of going around and saying like, \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t have to abide by those laws,\u2019\u201d Cervantes said. \u201cIt\u2019s still very disappointing as an undocumented student knowing that the institution has the means to create a center for us or just providing more resources, and their lack of support is just disheartening.\u201d\n\nShe called Newsom\u2019s decision to veto the bill, \u201cvery frustrating\u201d and said undocumented students often hit a wall once they get to college after realizing just how much their status will affect them and stop them on the road to their dreams.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of higher education is you study and then practice what you\u2019re studying and hitting that reality that whatever you\u2019re studying is not truly attainable, and having to shift gears based on your status,\u201d Cervantes said. \u201c[It\u2019s] very eye-opening to the realities that we face.\u201d\n\nCalifornia owes a lot to its immigrants, Cervantes said. One of the reasons California has one of the largest economies is because of its immigrant population and workforce, a fact Newsom highlighted earlier this year in his proclamation for Immigrant Heritage Month.\n\n\u201cI would just like more support for the undocumented community and having people understand the implications of what it means to be undocumented,\u201d Cervantes said. \u201cOnce immigrants thrive, the rest of California also thrives, and it\u2019s just very frustrating knowing that we had a sense of hope and that was taken away from us.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t surprising that Newsom vetoed the bill, Niels Frenzen, the co-director of the Immigration Clinic at the Gould School of Law and a clinical law professor, said in an interview with Annenberg Media earlier this week.\n\n\u201cNewsom is being cautious for a variety of reasons,\u201d Frenzen said. \u201cHe\u2019s thinking about his political future. And this is a controversial topic.\u201d\n\nEven if Newsom had signed the bill into law, it wouldn\u2019t have established a way for undocumented students to work at USC. The bill relied upon a legal argument that federal immigration law does not apply to state and local governments, including the UCs, but because USC is a private entity, students would still be unable to work, he said.\n\nIn his veto message, Newsom cited the \u201cpotential criminal and civil liability\u201d for state employees as a reason for his decision.\n\nFrenzen said Newsom\u2019s rationale was a way for the governor to avoid the political consequences of signing the bill into law.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a facade,\u201d Frenzen said. \u201cHis veto message is a bit of a cop-out, but again, bottom line, it\u2019s not shocking what happened, which is unfortunate.\u201d\n\nIn response to Newsom\u2019s veto, the California Undocumented Higher Education Coalition (CUHEC) said in a statement that it was disappointed by the result, noting that it would have helped undocumented students form connections and supported the state\u2019s growing need for a workforce.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, the state must keep the promise of a college degree as a door to economic opportunity and prosperity,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe remain committed to ensuring California leads the way in providing equal opportunity for all students across the state.\u201d\n\nAt USC, Cervantes said UTSA was going to continue to question the administration about why undocumented students don\u2019t have resources dedicated to them and their continued success.\n\n\u201cUTSA will continue to fight for immigrant rights and just bringing more advocacy on campus, and hopefully having more allies on campus and having people understand what it means to be undocumented,\u201d Cervantes said.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Matt Freed)\n\nBy Daniel Zhevel September 27, 2024 at 11:08 am PDT\n\nAfter suffering their first loss in Week 3, the 2-1 Los Angeles Chargers are back home this week for a matchup with their undefeated division rivals, the 3-0 Kansas City Chiefs. This will be Jim Harbaugh\u2019s toughest challenge so far in his first year at the Chargers\u2019 helm, especially because five starters are expected to be sidelined this week due to a bundle of injuries and a poorly timed suspension.\n\nJustin Herbert, Rashawn Slater, Joe Alt and Joey Bosa all left Sunday\u2019s game against the Steelers due to injuries, ranging from hamstring to neck. Then, to make matters worse, the day after the game safety Derwin James Jr. was given a one-game suspension for \u201crepeated violations of the league\u2019s safety protocols.\u201d James\u2019 violation came during the third quarter of the Chargers\u2019 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday when the safety lowered his helmet and made what the NFL deemed \u201cforcible contact\u201d to Steelers tight end Pat Freiermuth.\n\nJames is always a valuable asset on defense, especially during games against the Chiefs, where he can normally keep up with star tight end Travis Kelce. Alohi Gilman will have to step up and produce some of that receiver coverage he is known for.\n\nChargers quarterback Justin Herbert suffered a right high-ankle sprain on Sept. 15 versus the Carolina Panthers before aggravating that injury and getting sidelined during the third quarter on Sunday. However, there have been reports that the injury wasn\u2019t serious and he\u2019s recovering quickly, so there is a small chance Herbert will play on Sunday.\n\nIn Herbert\u2019s first three games, he displayed passing dominance by completing 67.2% of his passes for 399 yards, four touchdowns and just one interception, good enough for 13th in QBR. Taylor Heinicke was acquired from the Atlanta Falcons during the offseason and will likely be the starter if Herbert is out. The Chargers have a Week 5 bye, so sitting Herbert seems more reasonable.\n\nIn more positive news, new defensive coordinator Jesse Minter has completely turned the defense around. The Chargers\u2019 defense is ranked sixth in the league, giving up just three touchdowns in as many games. Khalil Mack has been on a tear this season and leads the team with 2.5 sacks.\n\nThe Chiefs are also struggling with some injuries of their own. Go-to wide receiver Marquise \u201cHollywood\u201d Brown is already out for the entire regular season with a shoulder injury, and running back Isiah Pachecho is out of action for at least six weeks with a fibula fracture. Even though there are crucial injuries on both teams, Kansas City enters the game week much healthier than Los Angeles.\n\nThe Chiefs also activated Kareem Hunt after a week on the practice squad, and coach Andy Reid said Hunt will play in Sunday\u2019s game. Hunt was released from Kansas City in the middle of the 2018 season, a year after he led the NFL in rushing as a rookie in 2017.\n\nIt\u2019s also been a disappointing start for reigning Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes. Although the Chiefs are 3-0, Mahomes has thrown for 659 yards with five touchdowns and four interceptions, stats that are below his standards.\n\nA win over the Chiefs would give the Chargers the division lead, but Los Angeles has lost the past five matchups and eight of the past ten to the back-to-back Super Bowl champions. A home win would be the Bolts\u2019 first since 2013.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler\nSeptember 27, 2024 at 11:04 am PDT\n\nThe last game in Oakland\nThe Oakland A\u2019s called the Oakland Coliseum home for 57 years, but will no longer do so after the team\u2019s last game in the city. The city has officially said goodbye to its last franchise, which once was blooming with professional sports teams including the then-Las Vegas Raiders, Golden State Warriors and the Golden Seals. The team went out on a positive note, beating the Texas Rangers, but it was always more than wins and losses for most fans. A line formed outside the stadium starting at 8 am, four hours before game time. The seats were filled during batting practice, and the fans were pumped up the entire game. After A\u2019s closer Mason Miller secured the team a 3-2 win, manager Mark Kotsay was overwhelmed with emotion and gave a heartfelt speech before starting a \u201cLet\u2019s Go Oakland\u201d chant. It was a bittersweet moment for the league, watching a city\u2019s team fall before it rebuilds in Sacramento and becomes Las Vegas\u2019 first MLB team.\n\nOhtani has the greatest individual performance of all time\nShohei Ohtani is already one of the greatest baseball players ever and is only in his seventh season. Last week, he created a brand new club, hitting 50 home runs and stealing 50 bases. Recording a 50-home run season is a rare event on its own, and stealing 50 bases is no easy feat especially since most long-ball hitters are typically not in running shape. The Los Angeles Dodgers DH made history by becoming the founding member of the 50-50 club last Thursday, but he also had single-handedly one of the greatest baseball games in history. In a 20-4 victory, Ohtani went a perfect 6-6 with three home runs, two stolen bases and ten RBIs. He had two blasts go over 430 feet, the last of which went 450 feet into right field because of a meatball thrown by Miami Marlins second baseman Vidal Brujan. Ohtani isn\u2019t done yet, either. After the final game in the series against the San Diego Padres, Ohtani is just two bases away from reaching 400 bases this season. He would join a list of only 18 other players and be the first to do so since 2001. New York Yankees\u2019 outfielder Aaron Judge also has a slight chance of joining the list, but with three games to play and eight bases to go, he is much further away than the Dodgers MVP.\n\nA triple play to secure a playoff berth\nUnlike the double play, a triple play is rare and typically happens three to four times a year. The most recent team to turn a triple play was the Padres, and they did so to clinch a spot in October. With Dodgers hitters Tommy Edman on second and Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez on first with no batters out, the Padres were looking to hold their 4-2 lead in any way they could. On an 0-1 count, red-hot Miguel Rojas hit a hard ground ball to third baseman Manny Machado, who stepped on third, threw it to second baseman Jake Cronenworth, who tossed it to Donovan Solano at first to secure the victory and the Padres\u2019 eighth playoff appearance. The Padres are a team that you do not want to play in the first round of the playoffs. They were firing on all cylinders in the second half of the season, amounting a 41-16 record. They won\u2019t be easy for any team to get through, especially with one of the top-hitting squads and a solid pitching rotation.\n\nThe double play going into the weekend\nOn the verge of achieving more history, Ohtani and the Dodgers\u2019 last series will be against the Colorado Rockies. This should be an excellent warm-up series for them heading into the playoffs and is crucial for the team to secure the NL West and a first-round bye. Prediction: The Dodgers sweep the Rockies. The final regular season series to watch is between the Padres and the Arizona Diamondbacks. The two teams caught fire in the second half of the season and will battle it out in a series that still has postseason implications. The Diamondbacks are only one game up from the Atlanta Braves and have a chance to catch the New York Mets. If the Diamondbacks overtake the Mets, Arizona and San Diego will go head-to-head in a ferocious first-round matchup in October. Prediction: The Padres take two of three games. Last weekend, the Mets and Braves won their series, moving my prediction total to 12-13-3.\n```"}

Starting an independent film festival might be even harder.\n\nThe cover of LA\u2019s Rich & Successful Film Festival program. (Courtesy of RSFF, photo by Divya Subbiah)\n\nBy Divya Subbiah\nSeptember 27, 2024 at 9:53 am PDT\n\nApril, 2021: the team behind Sogbots, an independent film production company based in Echo Park, had a conundrum on their hands. They wanted to submit their latest short film \u201cBye Bye Buddy\u201d to film festivals, but had no community outside of themselves to talk to about the process. As a group of young filmmakers with no formal training, the Sogbots team wanted to meet other people in similar positions as their own, but didn\u2019t know how. So as they considered the festival submission process that awaited them, the team decided to make a community where they couldn\u2019t find one: by starting a film festival themselves.\n\n\u201cEverything from there was us sitting in our living room, just frantically researching,\u201d said Noah Morse, the festival\u2019s Creative Director and Director of Development, and a founding member of Sogbots. The team walked around their neighborhood posting flyers everywhere, and reached out to anyone they could think of who could help them pull the festival together. Despite the uphill journey, the Sogbots team powered through, using their experience working together on film sets to approach the organizational and collaborative aspects of the festival set-up process.\n\nBut when times got especially tough, the team had a phrase they would jokingly tell each other: \u201cWe\u2019re too big to fail.\u201d Morse and Nir Liebenthal \u2014 the festival\u2019s Director of Strategy and Operations, and a founding member of Sogbots \u2014 emphasized that this idea was an ongoing bit within their group; it\u2019s less that they took themselves that seriously, and more that they were acknowledging how much effort they put in, and how they needed to see the project through.\n\nA little over a year later, the inaugural LA\u2019s Rich & Successful Film Festival (RSFF) was born, and premiered at Beverly Hills\u2019 Lumiere Music Hall to a sold-out crowd. Although Sogbots hadn\u2019t envisioned starting a festival when they formed as a production company, it quickly became apparent that \u201cthis might be a good avenue for us to get to know people,\u201d said Morse. \u201cWe found that there was great value in it for us and for everyone else. And so here we are a couple of years later.\u201d\n\nRSFF\u2019s third festival was its biggest yet, with three days of events ranging from a mixer for filmmakers selected this year, to a pre-festival game show party \u2014 hosted by comedians David Brown and Wyatt Fair \u2014 to the festival itself. And for the first time, RSFF was co-sponsored by American Cinematheque, a powerhouse theater group in the LA independent film world.\n\nDespite the festival\u2019s expansion, all of the events maintained a singular focus. \u201cWe want to create an awesome experience for other filmmakers in this city that brings them together,\u201d said Liebenthal. The community-building through filmmaking translated into community-building through the festival. \u201cThe hope is we can create a more open and accessible screening program and include more filmmakers and create a bigger community, while maintaining the energy that we strive so hard to achieve every single year,\u201d said Morse.\n\nThat \u201cNorth Star\u201d goal \u2014 as Liebenthal later described it \u2014 was evident throughout the weekend\u2019s events. Both the game show party and the festival had a convivial energy; regardless of how someone ended up in each of those rooms, it was clear through their conversation and enthusiasm that they had a passion for independent film and independent filmmaking.\n\nThe events culminated on Saturday with the festival itself, which took place at the historic Egyptian Theatre Hollywood. Every part of this event was meticulously put together, from a photo backdrop, to trading cards of the featured directors, to a beautifully designed newspaper-style event program. Imani Davis, a film programmer for American Cinematheque, opened the night. Liebenthal followed with the rest of the festival director team (Morse, Jeremy Roth-Rose, Page Brady and Dylan Trupiano). Thirteen films screened over about three hours with intermission. The full lineup is below:\n\n\u201cBaggage,\u201d 2024, Dir. Tim Hendrix\n\u201cVOC\u00ca MEANS YOU,\u201d 2023, Dir.

Bryan Simpson & Taylor Simpson\n\u201cTennis, Oranges,\u201d 2024, Dir. Sean Pecknold\n\nAs it stands, RSFF is not an award-granting festival, instead opting for a curatorial approach. The films they chose highlighted a wide range of subjects, voices, styles and mediums; the program itself took its audience on an emotional journey, each film distinct, but all programmed in a specific order to complement one another. As a curatorial festival, this journey is important to Morse, who said his personal philosophy is that \u201cthe thing that\u2019s gonna keep people coming back is the movies. Everything else is gravy.\u201d\n\nPutting together a grassroots film festival seems like an impossible task, and the RSFF team has not only done it three times now, they\u2019ve done it with increasing popularity. When asked about the future of RSFF, Morse and Liebenthal explained that due to their team\u2019s philosophy and how new the festival is, the secret to their success thus far has been focusing on the task at hand rather than getting caught up in too much future-planning. But, as Liebenthal emphasized, the team wants to continue \u201ccollaborating with other people to make movies and doing the things that we love.\u201d And as he said in his speech to the packed house at the Egyptian, \u201cIf you all keep coming back, we\u2019re gonna keep doing this.\u201d\n```"}

Even the great Jim Murray \u2014 who this column is inspired by \u2014 wrote his first column for the Los Angeles Times spewing hot takes because he felt the need to introduce himself. While I may agree with his apathy for the \u201ceight-point touchdown,\u201d what we now just call a two-point conversion, it was a lot simpler for me. I just looked backwards, literally.\n\nHere at USC, it is not uncommon to see people so famous it feels like you are living in a myth. Like you are a mere mortal walking among gods, or a freshman journalism major hoping Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s one on-campus appearance a year happens to be in your WRIT-150 section. I know I\u2019m not the only one...\n\nIf Ezra Frech was a god, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me. When he enters the room of my 10 a.m. class on the science behind performance-enhancing drugs and sits behind me, it is like when a little kid tries to walk past the window he just broke with his bat and baseball in hand.\n\n\u201cI feel definitely proud of what I have accomplished, but I don\u2019t feel massively different from every other 19 year old,\u201d Frech told me in an interview. Humble and dominant? You can\u2019t fool me, buster. The jig is up. When you learn how to fly, I\u2019ll tell them \u201cI told you so.\u201d\n\nOn Frech\u2019s first day back from his trip to Paris, we were learning about how athletes can avoid PED testing through urination, cycling and more. When our professor called on him, he spoke like someone who had been there, at the Olympics, watching it all play out. That\u2019s because he was.\n\nInstead of missing class for being lazy or going out with friends or having \u201cone of those rough mornings\u201d after a late Thursday night, he was winning two Paralympic gold medals. I guess next time I\u2019ll only hit the snooze button three times and wake up at least 15 minutes before class. Thanks for the wake up call, jerk.\n\nAs much as Ancient-Greek Olympians were epicly barbaric as they slashed their foes, Frech was calm, cool and dominant as he stared down the 1.94-meter high bar in Paris on September 3. Already owning the high jump world record in the T63 division \u2014 where athletes with a single leg, above the knee amputation run with a prosthesis \u2014 at 1.97 meters, the hawk got the poor, frail mouse. The bar didn\u2019t have a chance of taking Frech down, and neither did his competitors. The next closest jumper, Sharad Kumar of India, jumped a personal-record 1.88 meters. And, unlike the heroes of the Roman Colosseum, he only needed one leg to reach greatness.\n\nBorn with his lower left leg curved upwards, Frech might not have looked like Steve Rogers, but he could sure run faster than good old Cap \u2014 even after the super-soldier serum. Unlike many of his competitors in the T63 division, Frech was born with another disability, only having one finger on his left side \u2014 later two after a transplant surgery, allowing him to pick things up.

In fact, those with even a mild aversion to body horror should consider steering away entirely. A handful of people walked out of USC\u2019s advanced screening, some undoubtedly unable to stomach the film\u2019s bloodier moments. Those brave enough to stick around, however, heavily vocalized both joy and disgust, often hand-in-hand. A packed theater sounded akin to a haunted house, reflecting the chaotic energy carried throughout \u201cThe Substance.\u201d\n\nCoralie Fargeat\u2019s focused vision only compounds in humor and horror as the movie progresses, building to a third act that lovers of the genre must see in a crowded theater this Halloween season.\n\n\u201cThe Substance\u201d finds Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore) at a particularly vulnerable time. The Oscar-winning actress has just discovered she\u2019s going to lose her job as a televised aerobics instructor \u2014 on her birthday, of all days. The decision comes from Harvey (Dennis Quaid), a not-so-subtly-named executive who could make a Muppet villain seem mild-mannered. Harvey, portrayed through disgusting close-ups and frequent leers, decides Elisabeth has lost her look, calling for her to be replaced. Moore\u2019s character is simply too old to be marketable, she\u2019s told, in an industry that places a premium on youth as beauty. Tragically, the opinions of men like Harvey do matter to her, beyond the bearing on her career. Now, they\u2019ve made her hate herself.\n\nElisabeth only has her fame: no family surrounds her, no friends check in on her. Some innate part of her longs to be with her own Hollywood Walk of Fame star. A portrait of herself looms over her living room, while an Elisabeth Sparkle billboard stares through the window. She frequently wears a bright yellow trench coat throughout the film, a simultaneous bid for concealment and attention. Money seemingly isn\u2019t an issue; happiness surely is.\n\nBefore long, Elisabeth receives a flash drive that is simply labeled \u201cThe Substance.\u201d As she loads it onto her TV, an emotionless, bass-filled voice taunts the aging star with a series of questions: \u201cHave you ever dreamt of a better version of yourself: younger, more beautiful, more perfect?\u201d How couldn\u2019t she? Elisabeth lives in a heightened world. She resides in a giant apartment with large windows and an all-white bathroom. Teaching aerobics on TV appears to be the pinnacle of fame, occupying multiple billboards throughout Hollywood. Every man is an idiot, a creep or, more often, both at once. Many of the film\u2019s settings look brightly colored and overly manufactured, including a surreal hallway evocative of \u201cThe Shining\u2019s\u201d Overlook Hotel at Elisabeth\u2019s studio.\n\nFargeat\u2019s heightened vision greatly succeeds through the film\u2019s use of sound. Every element seems dialed up to an often uncomfortable degree \u2014 blood sounds wetter, gasps sound breathier, outfits sound more leathery. Each time a character falls to the ground, a horrifically hollow \u201cBonk!\u201d gives the implication of more damage than is there. Listening to \u201cThe Substance,\u201d at times, is just as gross as watching it.\n\nAt first, Elisabeth tries to resist The Substance\u2019s offer. Yet decades of objectification and a quest for fame\u2019s validation make the offer too compelling to refuse. Soon, she reaches out to the company and is provided a drug, one which creates a younger body into which she can transfer her mind: \u201cSue\u201d (Margaret Qualley). The first transformation unveils the body horror that will define \u201cThe Substance\u2019s\u201d reputation The sequence shows the visceral reality of Sue\u2019s \u201cbirth\u201d in a way other films might eschew, evoking the transformative horror of films like \u201cThe Fly\u201d and \u201cAn American Werewolf in London.\u201d\n\nThe reveal of Sue, in contrast, is not framed as horrific. For her first scene, Fargeat and cinematographer Benjamin Kracun frame Sue as an object of desire \u2014 for Elisabeth and for everyone around her. She spends the majority of her early scenes fully nude, with the camera leaving little to the imagination. Even when she does don clothes (often skin-tight exercise uniforms), she is framed more like she\u2019s in a beer commercial than a horror movie for much of the film\u2019s second act.\n\nWhen Elisabeth becomes Sue, the Oscar-winning actress would seemingly have unlimited options. Yet she immediately chooses to return to her old job as an aerobics instructor, now on a younger, even more sexualized program. Sue shares none of her predecessor\u2019s shame, and she seems fine with simply taking Elisabeth\u2019s place. The framing of Qualley throughout the film is gratuitous by design, and approached with a sense of humor. Sue represents youth, sex and desire, and the character is shot as such. In doing so, \u201cThe Substance\u201d toes the line of undermining its own commentary, spending a significant amount of runtime objectifying Qualley to make a point about the tragedy of objectification.\n\nLast year, Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 \u201cPoor Things\u201d found itself at the center of a similar debate about using nudity and sexualization for cinematic commentary; the film went on to win multiple Academy Awards, including Best Actress for Emma Stone. Fargeat largely makes effective use of this framing, however, in a way that feels integral to the world she\u2019s created. \u201cThe Substance\u201d is a film of excess in every conceivable way, down to a 140-minute runtime that nearly feels overloaded. Sue\u2019s explicit depiction may not \u201cadvance the plot,\u201d as has become a popular social media discussion around sex in film, but it certainly heightens Fargeat\u2019s world and creative vision.\n\nThe Substance comes with a list of rules. Every seven days, the user must switch from one body to the other without exception. Using more time in one body forces the other to pay a price. Above all, Elisabeth and Sue are encouraged to remember that they \u201care one,\u201d each halves of a singular being. Despite this unity, Moore and Qualley do not play their roles in the same way. While some mannerisms are carried over, they often feel like independent entities, pointedly curated by each actress. Though their minds are theoretically the same, the duo strives to portray a riff on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde more than they aim for a Shazam!-like transformation. Rarely do Elisabeth and Sue feel like the same person. Instead, they play two sides of an objectified coin: Elisabeth drowns in self-loathing, while Sue dives head-first into infantilization. Each resents the other, heedless of the fact that they are one.\n\nThis choice heightens the fabulistic elements of the story rather than staying beholden to a gimmick of imitations. While Qualley could portray a convincing Moore (and vice versa), both performers tread more interesting ground by playing by their own rules. Throughout the film, Moore makes a feast of her performance, alternatively reveling in vulnerability, anger and madness. As the film progresses, we see a gradual degradation of Elisabeth\u2019s looks. To Elisabeth, this is a degradation of self (or, at the very least, self-worth). The film takes pointed inspiration from \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray,\u201d with Elisabeth herself being the rotting portrait. Often, this allows Moore to play up the more humorous elements of this transformation, shifting her performance from a Hollywood star to something more resembling \u201cSnow White\u2019s\u201d Old Hag. It\u2019s a joyously unhinged turn from the often composed star.\n\nThrough this extravagance, however, Moore manages to dig actual pathos out of her archetypal protagonist. Moore lends the role a tangible sense of vulnerability, one that propels the story from beginning to end. One key scene, which sees the actress struggle with her makeup in the mirror before leaving her home, cuts through the humor and gore of \u201cThe Substance\u201d to leave audiences with a much realer, sadder sense of horror, and a palpable sense of anger. Moore spends a solid amount of the film\u2019s runtime in the nude, but this scene is the most naked she ever feels.\n\nQualley, likewise, continues to prove she\u2019s one of the most interesting young actors working today. In \u201cThe Substance,\u201d she turns in a fearless performance that only becomes more manic as the film progresses. As Qualley takes more on her shoulders, she slips perfectly into the body horror mayhem that characterizes the movie.\n\nThroughout \u201cThe Substance,\u201d Fargeat continually ups the ante, layering on horrific twists and wrinkles that arise from Elisabeth and Sue\u2019s game of Jekyll and Hyde. This builds to a place of pure, over-the-top, Cronenbergian horror that will surely make audiences both laugh and retch. The truly delightful third act that demands to be seen with a crowd.\n\nWhat\u2019s most striking about \u201cThe Substance\u201d is how fully Fargeat has realized this world and its tone. The satire, while far from subtle, never acts in disservice to the film or its horror story; in fact, its mean sense of humor often provides a perfect release valve to some of the tenser, grosser elements of the story. This film never tries to be anything less than itself, and Fargeat fully succeeds in executing her ambitious vision. In \u201cThe Substance,\u201d Fargeat remembers that, just like Sue and Elizabeth, humor and gore are one.\n```"}

They are baby animals from all over the world, and their cuteness has taken social media by storm. Moo Deng, who is from Thailand, has even shown up on USC\u2019s Sustainability Hub and Alumni Association Instagram pages as a baby hippo meme. The Trojan community is embracing the cute animal craze.\n\nSo what is it about baby animals that makes them so irresistible? And why are they so relatable? \u201cThere is a term called \u2018baby schema\u2019 that actually started human to human, the idea that baby faces, you know, big eyes, cute, little round...preferably chubby face, like a little button nose, like that kind of baby face makes adults interact differently and attracts adults in a different way than an adult face might,\u201d Ashley Uyeshiro Simon, Associate Professor of Clinical Occupational Therapy at USC. And this phenomenon is not much different with baby animals, she said.\n\n\u201cThe idea of baby animals is interesting, because there are theories out there that say, hey, baby schema can actually apply to animals,\u201d Uyeshiro Simon said. \u201cThey have the big eyes, they have the little noses, they have the little round faces, right? And you get the same reaction from humans, which is, \u2018Oh my gosh!\u2019 Right?\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the pure cuteness that draws in viewers all over social media. Uyeshiro Simon explained an idea called the biophilia hypothesis: \u201cThere are a lot of studies that show or argue that bonds with animals can fulfill the human need for attachment and relationships. Even in the absence of other humans, you can still feel very attached to and feel a very deep emotional relationship to your animals.\u201d\n\nInteracting with baby animals reminds us of our natural roots, she said, giving us a breather from the rush of urban life. Moo Deng the hippo, Pesto the very chubby and fluffy penguin, and Beardsley the anteater all drive our psychological and biological desires to find connection in nature.\n\n\u201cListen, I don\u2019t get to see, you know, king penguins be born all the time, especially ones that are as fluffy and amazing as Pesto the penguin\u201d Uyeshiro Simon said. \u201cI don\u2019t get to see baby hippos all the time. I feel like the wild side is really tapping into that sense of awe and wonder that you might get if you visit the Grand Canyon ... you think, my gosh, how powerful, right?\u201d\n\nSo when we watch cute clips of Moo Deng the hippo, Pesto the penguin and Beardsley the anteater, we aren\u2019t just participating in a viral trend: we are tapping into our natural selves.\n```"}

This is the Hug-a-pug program, which offers students relief from their busy schedules. Event organizer Robin Mitchell Stroud works for the office of religious and spiritual life said the canines are all within the Trojan Family. And that\u2019s what actually inspired the program.\n\n\u201cSo two of the pugs are mine, so and I work here, and then the other two pugs are, our Senior Associate Deans, pugs.

So this has been a great help, because I love animals and dogs,\u201d she said.\n\nDhruv Jain, a Finance Graduate Student, says the pugs bring a much-needed dose of energy into his life: \u201cI love the pugs.

(Photo by Chieh-Yu, Lee)\n\nBy Chieh-Yu Lee\nSeptember 26, 2024 at 6:09 pm PDT\n\nThe classic 1990s Taiwan song, \u201cFree\u201d was played for the second time at the party. But the whole crowd was still moving their bodies, shaking their heads off, singing and shouting out loud with the music. Taiwanese Pop Night took place at Peking Tavern, a small Chinese restaurant in downtown Los Angeles, on September 15. One by one, Taiwanese individuals from different parts of Los Angeles joined the party. As they entered the venue, guests were greeted by the warm, familiar rhythms of 1990s Taiwan, accompanied by laughter and the distant murmur of Mandarin conversations. For the attendees of Taiwanese Pop Night, it sounds just like home.\n\nOther than \u201cFree,\u201d over 40 classic Taiwanese songs filled the room for four consecutive hours. Jolin Tsai, Jay Chou and F.I.R\u2019s upbeat music took the audience back to the golden era of 1980 -1990s Taiwan. \u201cEvery song brings my childhood memories back,\u201d Stanley Zhao, a student at Santa Monica College, said.\n\nThe event was packed to the brim with guests spilling out onto the balcony and outside areas. DJ Mish, also known as Michelle Tsai, the host of the very first Taiwanese Pop Night, said, \u201cI thought that there may be roughly 80 people who showed up at the party...In the end, over 200 Taiwanese people signed up.\u201d\n\nDistinct Paths, United by Nostalgia\n\nLos Angeles is one of the largest centers for Taiwanese people in the United States. There are 200,000 Taiwanese Americans in Los Angeles, over a third of the Taiwanese American population in the U.S., according to the Taiwanese American Conference. For many Taiwanese individuals, Los Angeles is where their American dreams come true.\n\nAfter finishing her studies in New York, Ann Blue got a job as a pharmaceutical engineer in Los Angeles. Although Blue secured a promising job, she still found herself failing to get rid of homesickness. She missed handshakes and braised Hundred Paged Tofu in her hometown. She started to miss boba pearls, even though when she was in Taiwan she wasn\u2019t a fan of pearls at all. \u201cEvery day I think about home...I check the price of flight tickets every day,\u201d Blue said.\n\nJenn Tseng, a marketing manager working for a food brand, described Los Angeles as \u201ccreative.\u201d \u201c[In L.A.] you are free to be as creative as you want, and to be who you want to be \u2013 nobody will stop you,\u201d Tseng said. Tseng moved to the United States in 2015. She initially relocated to Santa Barbara to attend the University of California, Santa Barbara, and moved to L.A. after graduation. After all these years, Tseng said that whenever Chinese New Year arrives, she still misses home badly. \u201cI missed the time when I could get red envelopes and a reunion dinner...Festivals like the Mid-Autumn Festival and Chinese New Year are the times when I feel the most homesick.\u201d Tseng said.\n\nBe Proud of Being Taiwanese: A Feature, Not a Foreigner\n\nDJ Mish held the first Taiwanese Song Pop Night in Los Angeles. (Photo by Chieh-Yu, Lee)\n\nAfter the event finished, numerous audience members stayed to thank DJ Mish for hosting the party. One of the guests even waited 15 minutes after the party ended, saying, \u201cThank you so much for holding the pop night...I just feel that it\u2019s very difficult to find Taiwanese friends, thank you for providing such a unique opportunity.\u201d\n\nHosting a party catered to the Taiwanese community is not a new concept for DJ Mish. As a Taiwanese DJ in Los Angeles, she has experience in playing traditional music to Taiwanese crowds in the U.S. However, there was little to no reaction, since the audiences were not familiar with any of the Taiwanese songs she played. DJ Mish was initially frustrated. \u201cWith so many Taiwanese people moving to California after growing up in Taiwan, how come there was never a gathering for us to sing Taiwanese songs and connect with each other?\u201d she said.\n\nGrowing up in Taiwan, DJ Mish sought greater opportunities for her career and relocated to Los Angeles six years ago. She noted that the career path for DJs in Taiwan is more narrow and most DJs are not treated professionally or with respect. \u201cPeople in Los Angeles treat DJs more seriously,\u201d Tsai said. However, leaving home was not easy. \u201cI will be treated as a princess in my family in Taiwan...I never thought I\u2019d have to worry so much about finding a house, buying a car, and learning to cook after moving here. I was all alone,\u201d Tsai said.\n\nExperiencing loneliness, DJ Mish soon made up her mind and started to socialize. She never refused a single opportunity to play music. Her effort quickly paid off. In her first year in Los Angeles, she played music on 52 different occasions. That was only a starting point. With her astute music selection, she had DJed at the Coachella Music Festival and Electric Daisy Carnival. She was also invited to play music for clients such as Disney, Vogue, Universal Studios Hollywood and Fitbit.\n\nBeing a Taiwanese DJ in Los Angeles was tough, especially when DJ Mish compared herself to other local DJs who grew up in Los Angeles. \u201cThey had many friends, and they knew what the crowd\u2019s taste was,\u201d Tsai said. Initially, she struggled with feelings of being a foreigner. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just about not knowing the crowd. Even getting basic things, like applying for jobs, felt difficult,\u201d Tsai said.\n\nFor years, she tried to assimilate, constantly observing and mimicking local DJs, trying to blend in. Her perspective shifted in recent years. \u201cI realized the more I tried to fit in, the more I lost what made me unique. I became just another DJ, no different from everyone else. And then it hit me\u2014what makes me unique is my Taiwanese identity,\u201d DJ Mish said. \u201cI realized that I wanted to be known as a Taiwanese DJ.\u201d\n\nThe party was a part of her plan to rebuild her brand as a DJ for the Taiwanese community. DJ Mish laughed and said, \u201cEveryone who came to the event today now knows me. If they\u2019re planning a wedding, or they need someone to play music for Taiwanese people, I will be the one they reach out to.\u201d\n\nNow, DJ Mish is planning to hold more Taiwanese Pop Nights in Las Vegas, New York, Houston and Seattle. The next Taiwanese Pop Night will take place in Baba\u2019s House, a restaurant in the Bay area, on October 18. Wherever Taiwanese people are, she would like to be there. She said, \u201cI\u2019m Taiwanese, and I\u2019m just going to own that.\u201d\n```"}

The introduction ceremony took place in front of the Guinness World Records Museum on Hollywood Boulevard, replete with fans dressed as the caped crusader, cheering crowds, and even a replica Batmobile.\n\nJim Lee, President and Chief Creative Officer of DC Comics, talked about the Batman character\u2019s history. \u201cBatman is one of the world\u2019s most iconic characters, standing for justice, strength and fearlessness,\u201d Lee said. \u201cFor more than eighty-five years, Batman has shown up for fans from comic books, cartoons, TV, movies, toys and video games. Batman has been everywhere, and now we\u2019re so proud that he is the first superhero right here to receive a permanent star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\u201d\n\nBatman\u2019s star is the 2,790th addition to the landmark since its original completion in 1961. Actor Robert Pattinson is the most recent lead to take on the character in the 2022 American superhero film titled \u201cThe Batman.\u201d\n\nAnne DePies, general manager and senior vice president of DC comics, talked about the legacy and impact of the Batman character. She said Batman has become \u201can American myth\u201d whose adventures capture a range of emotions. \u201cI\u2019ll end with what I think it\u2019s Batman\u2019s greatest strength,\u201d DePies said. \u201cWhile he is one of the few DC heroes without actual superpowers, Batman possesses the unbelievable ability to bring fans of all kinds together around something they truly love.\u201d\n\nAnd there was a reason the ceremony was held outside the Guinness World Records Museum: museum officials said Batman\u2019s becoming the first superhero to receive a star on the Walk of Fame is a record in itself.\n```"}

(NOAA via AP)\n\nBy Talia Wexler and April Aguilera September 26, 2024 at 5:48 pm PDT\n\nAs Trojan parents make their way to campus, they may have other worries affecting their weekend plans as a Category 4 hurricane barrels toward Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to be here and happy that the storm is not affecting our neighborhood, but we are very concerned for our other neighbors in Florida who will probably get impacted very significantly in the panhandle,\u201d said Alex Martins, who arrived in Los Angeles today from Winter Park, Florida. Martins and his wife, Juliet, are parents to sophomore Sophia. Juliet said she was concerned that she and her husband would not be able to fly out of the state this morning due to the storm. \u201cThe warnings all said this was going to be a huge storm, and my flight was leaving at 10 a.m. this morning from Orlando,\u201d she said. \u201cI was on one of the last flights that got out of Orlando. It started raining while we were on the runway.\u201d\n\nThe Martins family said they were concerned about being away during the storm, but were thankful that their community is not in the direct path of the storm. AccuWeather experts predict the storm will cause damage hundreds of miles inland with winds expected to reach between 131 to 155 miles per hour.\n\nJulian Daller, a junior majoring in real estate development from Fort Myers, Florida, said he remembers Hurricane Ian in fall 2022 as being a \u201ctraumatizing\u201d experience during his freshman year. The storm was a Category 4 hurricane like Helene. \u201cIt was definitely weird being across the country and seeing all this stuff on social media and hearing everyone talk about it because it was in my hometown,\u201d Daller said. \u201cAnd kind of seeing the places I grew up in being flooded while not actually being there, it was definitely a weird feeling.\u201d He also said he was impacted when he returned home for the holidays and saw all of the destruction. He said the experience really impacted his ability to do school work.\n\nDaller\u2019s mom is already in Los Angeles for a long weekend of fun, but Daller\u2019s dad and brother are planning to fly in on Friday. He said they had to move their flight from Southwest International Airport to Miami International Airport due to storm-related cancellations.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just those from Florida who are feeling the impacts of the storm. Stacy Sager, who flew in from Atlanta to spend the weekend with her daughter, said her flight out of Atlanta was delayed by an hour. \u201cIt was chaos,\u201d she said about the conditions in the airport. Once she was able to board her flight, she said the plane ended up sitting on the runway with zero visibility before taking off. But after some initial bumpiness, she said the flight \u201cwasn\u2019t bad.\u201d\n\nBack at her home in Atlanta, Sager said she was expecting to lose power from the storm, though she has a generator to keep the lights on. However, at her home in Panama City Beach, Florida, where City Manager Drew Whitman has issued an emergency declaration in response to the storm, it\u2019s a different story with frequent weather updates hitting her phone. \u201cThat\u2019s the house I\u2019m worried about,\u201d she said.\n```"}

By Julius Johnston September 26, 2024 at 3:47 pm PDT\n\nThe two-year anniversary of the Trojans signing star sophomore guard Juju Watkins is nearly upon us, but there has been no sign of head coach Lindsay Gottlieb and her staff slowing down on the recruiting trail. Jazzy Davidson, the No. 2-ranked player in the 2025 recruiting cycle, announced Tuesday that she will be furthering her athletic and academic career at USC.\n\nDavidson, a 6-foot-2 combo guard out of Clackamas, Oregon is the Trojans\u2019 first commitment in the 2025 class, and a big one. After narrowing down her choices over the summer, she chose the Trojans over UCLA, Texas, TCU, UConn and Duke. Possessing a similar player profile to one of the best players in the nation, Juju Watkins, Davidson is a lefty with height to elegantly finish around the rim and the shooting range to stretch defenses out, making her difficult to guard at all times.\n\nNot only does she have the offensive capabilities to score at will, but her size makes her effective on the defensive end as well. A true unicorn, Davidson averaged 26.4 points per game, 7.7 rebounds per game, 3.8 steals per game and 2.6 assists per game through 25 high school games last season. Her accolades back up her stats. Davidson is a three-time Oregon Gatorade Player of the Year and a three-time first team all-state selection.\n\nNot only does Davidson have the state recognition to back up her ranking, but she has the national recognition as well, as she earned a spot on the U18 USA 3x3 Women\u2019s U18 National Team in 2024 and won gold at the 2024 FIBA U18 AmeriCup. Off the court, Davidson has maintained a 3.87 GPA throughout high school, signifying her commitment to being a student-athlete.\n\nThis commitment is much more than it appears at face value as the Trojans continue to push for a national championship following their 2024 Elite Eight run. Gottlieb has made major strides every season, both in recruiting and on the court performance, since her hiring in 2021 and has brought the Trojans back to national relevance.\n\nFollowing the signing of Watkins, the No. 1 recruit in 2023, Gottlieb signed the top recruiting class in 2024, making it four times since Gottileb\u2019s hiring that the Trojans have signed a top 10 player in their respective class. Now, with Davidson, that makes it five years straight for Gottlieb\u2019s streak and sends the Trojans well on their way to signing back-to-back No. 1 classes.\n\nHeadlined by freshman guards Kennedy Smith, Kayleigh Heckel and Avery Howell \u2014 all of whom were ranked within the top 16 \u2014 the Trojans were the one of three schools to sign three five stars in 2024. What makes the Trojans stand out among the other two schools is how deep the 2024 class is. Gottlieb also landed commitments from forward Vivian Iwuchukwu, guard Rian Forestier, forward Laura Williams and guard Brooklyn Shamblin to complete the Trojans\u2019 2024 recruiting class, making it arguably more special than the 2023 class that brought home Watkins.\n\nSpecial has become the word for USC Athletics, as USC has deemed itself \u201cThe pLAce to be.\u201d The program\u2019s success in the offseason transfer portal has emphasized that message for the women\u2019s basketball team, as the Trojans landed commitments from Stanford graduate forward Kiki Iriafen and Oregon State graduate guard Talia von Oelhoffen, both of whom project to come in and make an instant impact. Adding both important veteran and young pieces around Watkins will only push USC closer to winning a national championship and with Davidson, USC might have another star on the horizon.

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Alexis Guzman\nSeptember 26, 2024 at 2:25 pm PDT\n\nAt this year\u2019s homecoming, the Trojans will commemorate 115 years of the USC Spirit Leaders, a unique group that has evolved from the all-male yell leaders who initially rallied the student section at USC sporting events. The Spirit Leaders were notoriously all male until 2006 when a co-ed team of students took the field with tumbling passes and partner stunts. With their megaphones, they rallied the crowd at games. They created a new team name, the USC Spirit Leaders, and it has been with the program ever since.\n\nThis group\u2019s transition marked a significant shift in the program\u2019s history. Through the years, the Spirit Leaders have taken different approaches to what a Leader should perform. The team eventually replaced stunting with more dancing. They still carried the traditional megaphone but incorporated stunts within dance choreography. As the Spirit Leaders experienced some coaching changes, they have currently moved into a much more collegiate cheerleading style.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve changed drastically from year to year with the tumbling that we\u2019ve done and the stunts that we\u2019ve done. This year has probably been the most talent we\u2019ve had on the team since I can remember,\u201d Grant K., fourth-year Spirit Leader, said. \u201cWe have so much great talent coming in from the freshman side, from people who are even just at USC and see Spirit Leaders who are interested. We\u2019re definitely on an upward trajectory and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re coming down anytime soon.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s roster contains high-level and experienced athletes who have competed at the most prestigious cheerleading competitions. Some team members have competed at The Cheerleading Worlds, National Cheerleaders Association (NCA) National Championships, Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA) Collegiate Nationals, and other prestigious events.\n\nThis year\u2019s USC Spirit Leaders have trained immensely to make it to this point. \u201cI\u2019ve been cheerleading all my life,\u201d veteran Samia S. said. \u201cThis was just kind of the perfect mix to continue growing as a cheerleader.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes. I have been cheering for around 10 years, and we do a lot. We train, and it\u2019s a lot on our bodies, but it\u2019s all worth it. We work hard and love to bring spirit to the university.\u201d junior Spirit Leader Malieya P. said.\n\nTo continue the growth of the team\u2019s existing talents and skills in a safe manner, they attended UCA Cheer Camp at UCSB. Senior Spirit Leader, Logan L. said, \u201cThis is the first year we went to UCA camp, and we got to train alongside a bunch of other cheer teams from all different conferences, and we had a great time there.\u201d\n\nAs first-time attendees of UCA Camp, they worked alongside other collegiate teams to enhance their technique, learn new challenging skills, and develop a cohesive team. They concluded camp with multiple blue ribbons and 2nd place for Timeout Routine, 2nd place Overall, and the 2024 College Spirit Camp Leadership Award.\n\nAs the Spirit Leaders enter full swing into their season, advisor Bria Biggs and coach Jenn Albeanu focus on the team\u2019s physical development, ensuring they are conditioned and making proper progressions to improve their stunting and tumbling skills. With over 45 routines choreographed and learned throughout the summer, the USC Spirit Leaders are taking the collegiate cheerleading industry by storm.\n\n\u201cWe decided to take the team to UCA camp this year so that they could be around other cheerleading teams that they could look up to and be inspired by and also gain the confidence that they need to know that they are just as talented and capable of being a great collegiate cheerleading team,\u201d advisor Bria Biggs, said. \u201cIt was a chance for us to bond as a team and get to know each other on a closer level before we joined the rest of the Trojan Marching Band and Song for Band camp. It is a way to learn new skills in a safe environment and it was even great for our advisor/coaches who attend UCA\u2019s coaches seminars and meet other coaches/advisors/directors of cheerleading and spirit programs from across the country.\u201d\n\nThe leadership of the band and Student Life work tirelessly to provide the athletes of Spirit tools and resources to give them the platform to grow as a team and to display elite stunt and tumbling skills and an overall eye-catching fan experience.\n\nYou can catch the USC Spirit Leaders in their cardinal uniforms and white poms at sporting events, rallies, and events around campus, fostering positive school spirit and good sportsmanship.\n```"}

His steadiness has been evident in all three matchups this season, as he consistently performs under pressure and delivers when the team needs him most. His performance against the Wolverines this weekend served as a beacon of hope in the middle of a tough game.\n\nInsights from practice interviews revealed the Trojans\u2019 struggles early in the game, a situation head coach Lincoln Riley described as one where \u201cthe entire group needs to improve\u201d. Riley acknowledged that while there were moments of solid blocking, missed assignments plagued the offense and  resulted in a tough loss.\n\nMarks, however, refused to let the struggles of others affect his performance. The running back has quickly developed into a crucial player for USC this season after transferring from Mississippi State and bringing his skill set to the Trojans. Throughout the first three games, he has consistently put up solid statistics despite the offensive line\u2019s inconsistencies.  In the Michigan game alone, he rushed for 100 yards.\n\nHighlighting his personal performance, Marks recalled a crucial moment in which he made a stunning chase-down strip fumble recovery. \u201cWhen he switched the ball, that\u2019s when I was like, I\u2019m not going to tackle him,\u201d Marks said. \u201cI probably don\u2019t know how to tackle him, hit his leg, but when he switched the ball, I just knew I was going for the ball.\u201d His effort in that moment demonstrated not just his ability, but also his comprehension of the game.\n\n\u201cDefensive players really don\u2019t know how to carry the ball...so they don\u2019t know how to protect it as well as we do on the offensive side,\u201d said Marks.\n\nQuarterback Miller Moss also noted Marks\u2019 effort saying, \u201cIt was one of the best single-player efforts I\u2019ve ever seen, which speaks to Woody\u2019s toughness and mentality.\u201d \u201cCoach Riley has always told us that the team looks to the quarterback for their identity,\u201d Moss continued. . \u201cWe have a lot of tough guys on this team, like Woody... I give everything I have because of how he plays.\u201d\n\nDespite his rather excellent performance, Marks faced disappointment when he was tackled just short of the end zone on a crucial drive for the Trojans. \u201c[The Big Ten] that\u2019s a big deal right there. Not very many penalties, quality football, going after it I..... played a heck of a game, physical game, so it was a good game overall,\u201d Marks said.\n\nThe showdown against Michigan was quite a learning experience for the Trojans. Marks acknowledged the team\u2019s slow start, emphasizing that games are won by attention to detail and communication. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play all four quarters,\u201d Marks said. \u201cToday in practice, I think we played all four quarters, and we\u2019ve just got to transition that into the game..... everyone needs to lock in. It starts with us as a team, not the coaches.\u201d\n\nMark\u2019s response stresses the importance of teamwork, reminding his teammates that the road to progress starts with self-control and dedication from each player. As USC looks to bounce back, Marks will undoubtedly remain a key player to watch. Going into the matchup against Wisconsin the emphasis on teamwork, dedication and attention to detail embodied by the running back will be crucial.\n```"}

There\u2019s also no deuce, no lets and no match-points. Piles of dirt and giant tractors now stand where the bright green and white lines of the recreational tennis courts used to be. Because of the construction of the new baseball stadium, USC closed the recreational tennis and pickleball courts that were previously open all day, every day, where any student could play for free. Now, students are left struggling to find accommodations to play tennis on campus.\n\nThe news was initially revealed in January and has now officially been put into effect. As last updated on September 16, \u201cOpen recreation pickleball is now available on Court C of the Lyon Center Main Gym.\u201d Earlier this year, many students petitioned for new tennis courts to be created. However, the construction project proceeded and no information from USC has been released about future plans to open new recreational tennis courts.\n\nWhen asked for comment on tennis court closures, USC PR directed Annenberg Media to the USC Student Life Recreational Sports page, which reported on August 2024, that \u201call courts will become unavailable beginning Monday, September 16th.\u201d The courts that were once accessible behind the Dedeaux Field are now enclosed with a flimsy black fence, separating the construction site from the remainder of campus.\n\nPearl Navratik, a sophomore studying cinema and media studies, who enjoys playing tennis for recreational purposes, said \u201cit\u2019s really inconvenient to play tennis because there\u2019s not really anywhere to play.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve had to reschedule multiple times because there\u2019s no court availability,\u201d Navratik said.\n\nIrika Katiyar, a senior studying computer science, is in the beginner tennis class at USC. She said that on the first day, the professor told her class the tennis court had shut down and they had to use the David X. Marks Tennis Stadium instead. In the past, this stadium was only used for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Division I tennis teams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad for him as well, because I don\u2019t think they know what the future of the tennis class is gonna be because it\u2019s not completely feasible for us to actually play in the stadium all the time,\u201d Katiyar said. Katiyar says that the tennis court isn\u2019t fully reserved for the class. Their class has to share the courts with other tennis club members.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not that many courts in the stadium. There\u2019s like six courts,\u201d Katiyar said. \u201dBut a lot of the time, part of the courts are being taken up by the actual tennis players practicing.\u201d\n\nRichard Li, a freshman studying sociology, is a tennis enthusiast who said not having a car makes it hard for him to find alternative places to play. He\u2019s a member of Trojan Tennis Club and now only plays once a week. USC students had the opportunity to sign up for the Trojan Tennis Club at the beginning of the semester. It costs $40 for the semester and $70 for the school year. Students who pay these can use the David X. Marks Tennis Stadium once a week on Wednesdays from 8-10 p.m.\n\n\u201cOne time a week is really not enough, and sometimes the time doesn\u2019t really work for me,\u201d Li said. \u201cTennis was my only sport and a way to relieve my stress and the school is cutting off that way.\u201d\n\nJerry Chen, a junior studying mathematics, was on the executive board of the general tennis club, so he knew about the closing earlier than most. \u201cKhai-Ly [Tran, vice president of the club team,] told us about how USC might remove the courts, she started a petition in the middle of the last semester, and there\u2019s like over 1,600 signs,\u201d Chen said.\n\nNow, Chen and his friends go to Rancho Cienega Recreation Center, which he said is about a 10-to-15 minute drive. \u201cIt\u2019s inconvenient for us right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe motivation for me to play tennis is to meet new friends or hang out with my old friends on the court,\u201d Chen said. \u201cIt definitely reduces the opportunity of running into cool people from USC on the courts.\u201d\n\nThough the solution for the tennis courts remains unknown to Trojans, many students hope the university will take into consideration how the closures affect such a wide variety of students and how it\u2019s important for them to provide a new place for students to go. Understanding that space may be a problem for campus, Chen said, \u201cIf USC can find or build courts nearby, that would be really ideal.\u201d Without them, some students said their college experience is incomplete.\n\n\u201cTennis courts are really necessary for the university,\u201d Li said.\n```"}

Harris, who is already the first Black and South Asian female U.S. vice president, might become the first female president in U.S. history.\n\n\u201c[Harris] is all about lifting women,\u201d Buckner said. \u201cShe\u2019s a strong candidate for ensuring that we as women, we as a country, and we as all, join forces together to make sure we are empowered.\u201d\n\nJust like Tay\u2019Paris, the crowd understood the historic nature of the Harris campaign. After seven hours of waiting, they couldn\u2019t wait to see the first campaign event of the union of Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. The crowd chanted, \u201cWe came for the first female president of the United States!\u201d\n\nHowever, on August 10, Harris talked about her prosecutorial track record, her proposal for small businesses and her stance on a potential Israel-Hamas ceasefire. She said nothing about her gender identity.\n\nDifferent news coverage, including NPR, NBC News and VOA, wrote about how the Harris\u2019 campaign does not emphasize her gender, even though reproductive rights for women is a top issue on the ballot, and critical to winning the White House. Politico suggested that Harris keep her female identity mostly unstated. Instead of highlighting her female identity, Harris emphasizes her middle-class background and her prosecutorial track record.\n\nPolitical experts drew comparisons with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2014 the first U.S. female Democratic presidential nominee. Extensive coverage pointed out that in the 2016 presidential election, Clinton focused quite a bit on her gender. As a former First Lady and senator, Clinton decided to present herself as a woman who could have a thriving political career, and also take good care of her family.\n\n\u201cWomen in politics have to emphasize the qualities of leadership that men often are assumed already to have,\u201d USC Center for Inclusive Democracy President Mindy Romero said.\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign adopts a different strategy just weeks from election day. When Harris was asked in a CNN interview last month what gender and race mean to her as a candidate, she replied, \u201cI am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender.\u201d\n\nRomero says there are two reasons Harris adopts this strategy. First, she needs to sway swing voters, and talking about her gender would not help. \u201cThe fact that she would be the first Asian American female president, but also of color, is important to a lot of folks on the left,\u201d Romero said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as important to some folks on the right, and certainly some swing voters.\u201d\n\nSecond, Romero said those who recognize the historic nature of Harris\u2019 campaign might already be disposed to vote for her. She wouldn\u2019t need to emphasize gender to persuade them.\n\nHarris became well known to the public through her confrontation of Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh. At his 2018 confirmation hearings, she asked Kavanaugh to clarify his views on Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that marked a constitutional right to abortion. Harris said, \u201c Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body ?\u201d\n\nThat spirit echoed in the recent presidential debate when Harris denounced former President Donald Trump for interfering with women\u2019s reproductive rights. Harris turned to Trump and said, \u201cCouples who pray and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments. Working women have to travel to another state, to get on a plane sitting next to strangers, to go and get the health care she needs.\u201d\n\nUSC Professor of Professional Practice of Journalism Christina Bellantoni said that as a woman, Harris has a powerful voice to talk about abortion rights. \u201cIt\u2019s just more showcasing she\u2019s a woman who is uniquely qualified to talk about these issues that happen to be on voters\u2019 minds,\u201d Bellantoni said.\n\nBellantoni suggested, \u201cThis country has already expressed that it wants a female president,\u201d referring to Clinton winning the popular vote in 2016 when Trump won the Electoral College. Bellantoni proposed that Clinton lost the 2016 election because some people didn\u2019t vote since they assumed she would win anyway, and their votes wouldn\u2019t matter.\n\nBellantoni explained the key to Harris\u2019s presidential campaign is encouraging voter turnout and political awareness. \u201cA woman\u2019s job is always harder in every circumstance,\u201d Bellantoni said. \u201cBut especially in politics.\u201d\n```"}

(AP/Matt York)\n\nBy Robert Westermann September 26, 2024 at 8:47 am PDT\n\nGolf is a game of ups and downs. For some golfers, these phases can last an entire season or longer. Scottie Scheffler\u2019s been in a three-year up period, with the 2022 and 2024 Masters titles under his belt to go alongside an Olympic gold medal from Paris. The consistency Scheffler\u2019s shown over that time signals that he won\u2019t go away anytime soon, either.\n\nIn contrast to Scheffler, Xander Schauffele had the biggest sustained surge in his career this season, notching his first major at the PGA Championship and adding a second two months later at the British Open. Schauffele has played well for a handful of years, but sinking a birdie putt on the 18th hole at Valhalla Golf Club, quashing Bryson DeChambeau\u2019s comeback attempt in the process, put Schauffele in a different tier of player.\n\nDeChambeau was still the third player to have a spotlight moment this year, winning the U.S. Open by way of a clutch bunker shot that left him a three-foot putt to win. It also helped that Rory McIlroy missed two putts he could\u2019ve made in his sleep, but DeChambeau\u2019s victory at Pinehurst No. 2 added substance to his previously outsized reputation as a character that had become more public than ever through social media and YouTube.\n\nScheffler, DeChambeau and Schauffele often sat comfortably atop the leaderboard throughout the year, while other golfers struggled to fight for spots below them. However, a few names stood out and had their moments this season and are set up for a revenge tour next year.\n\nWill Zalatoris\nZalatoris has had a rough go of it the last two years. After maintaining a leaderboard position at the 2022 Masters and finishing in a tie for sixth, he went on to be the runner-up at that year\u2019s U.S. Open, narrowly missing a putt that would\u2019ve forced a playoff with eventual champion Matt Fitzpatrick. At that point he had only been a professional for four years, and the former Demon Deacon had seemingly set himself up to be the next big star for years to come.\n\nThen, the injury bug hit. The 28-year-old\u2019s back problems began at the 2022 BMW Championship, and he was forced to pull himself out of several tournaments that year. In 2023, he attempted to return to the course but had to withdraw from the 2023 Masters and sat out the rest of the season after undergoing back surgery.\n\nZalatoris came into 2024 much healthier, and given some of his recent performances, he looks like he\u2019s ready to compete on the big stage again. He struggled and missed the cut at both the U.S. and British Opens, but finished tied for ninth at the Masters and played well enough to be in the top 15 at two PGA playoff events. While he\u2019ll have to recover from missing a year-and-a-half of golf, Zalatoris ended the year on a positive note and showed signs that he\u2019ll hit the ground running next year.\n\nViktor Hovland\nThe 2024 season was a long one for the Norwegian. Besides his solo-third finish at the PGA Championship and solid performances throughout the Tour Playoffs, Hovland missed the cut at every other major and recorded just two top-five finishes. The 27-year-old\u2019s season was disappointing compared to last year when he ran away with the TOUR Championship.\n\nHovland\u2019s issues this season likely stemmed from the frequent coaching changes he made. In 2023, the Oklahoma State grad made the shocking decision to split ways with swing coach Joe Mayo right before the 2024 season kicked off. Unsurprisingly, his results at the first few events of the season failed to meet his expectations, and it wasn\u2019t until he reunited with Mayo before the PGA Championship that he returned to the form fans expected.\n\nThe youngster\u2019s only been a professional for five seasons and has been better than just good. Now that he\u2019s gotten a disastrous personnel mistake out of the way, Hovland can use the offseason to refind his form and compete at the big tournaments as we\u2019ve seen him do before.\n\nWyndham Clark\nThere\u2019s good and bad news for Clark: he\u2019s won a major and gotten that proverbial monkey off his back. But ever since the 2023 U.S. Open, he hasn\u2019t been anywhere near the same. Clark\u2019s infamous for using a performance coach over the last few years to help with the mental side of his game, which seemed to help when he was neck and neck with McIlroy at Los Angeles Country Club.\n\nBut the results have simply not been there this year, especially in the majors. His best major finish this season was a tie for 56th at the U.S. Open, and he missed the three other cuts. Clark even began the year on a good note, claiming the Pebble Beach Pro-Am and coming in second at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, but things went severely downhill from there.\n\nDespite his struggles, Clark\u2019s proven he\u2019s one of the best on tour. He\u2019s already won a major and could easily win more if he can handle the spotlight like he did at LACC. However, Clark needs to return to the approach and short game he possessed during his run in 2023. He\u2019s always been solid off the tee, and putting hasn\u2019t been much of an issue either. For someone like Scheffler, though, success has come because of his consistent approach game. Clark has shown solidity in that area, and if he can find consistency with it in 2025, it\u2019s likely his name will be on the leaderboard at several big events.\n```"}

One person onboard was killed. The incident began at 12:45 a.m., when Lamont Campbell, 51, allegedly pulled a gun to the driver\u2019s head and attempted to hijack the bus. The ensuing LAPD pursuit lasted an hour.\n\nThe bus driver pulled the emergency panic button, causing the front of the bus to flash the words \u201cEmergency\u201d and \u201c911 Call Police\u201d on its exterior electronic boards. Shortly after, police officers arrived, with the chase concluding at the intersection of 6th Street and Alameda Street in downtown L.A. During a press conference following the conclusion of the pursuit, LAPD officials said they used \u201cspike stripes\u201d \u2014 road spikes that puncture tires \u2014 in order to stop the bus from moving. The spike stripes successfully punctured the right tire of the bus, ABC7 reported.\n\nOne person died onboard the vehicle, succumbing to their wounds from multiple gunshots fired by the alleged hijacker. The rest of the passengers and the bus driver were reported to have no injuries at this time. The alleged hijacker surrendered and was arrested.\n\nIn interviews with Annenberg Media, USC students have expressed doubt over the safety of LA public transportation. Max Kranzler, a senior studying psychology, called the incident \u201cterrifying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI lived in L.A. over the summer and there\u2019s always something that happens on the roads,\u201d he said. \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a car on fire or there is a high-speed pursuit.\u2019 I don\u2019t think that would necessarily stop me from riding the metro.\u201d\n\nZahra Shergadwala, a master\u2019s student studying computer science, said the incident makes her concerned the next time she rides L.A. public transportation.\n\n\u201cThat definitely raises a few concerns in my head because of course I mean, we are using the Metro almost every second day, and it just makes us more cautious,\u201d Shergadwala said. \u201cTo be more careful about traveling by the metro.\u201d\n\nDhruv Kantilal, a second-year master\u2019s student studying clinical and experimental therapeutics, contrasted the experience of riding USC\u2019s shuttle buses with L.A.\u2019s metro buses.\n\n\u201cThe USC bus is more safe because you don\u2019t have those kind of people who are not supposed to be there, because it\u2019s the university one, and it becomes more convenient,\u201d Kantilal said. \u201cThe USC one is obviously better off than the other metro.\u201d\n\nDavid Carlisle, Assistant Chief of the Department of Public Safety, recommends students use USC\u2019s shuttle services as an alternative option to travel in the area near campus.\n\n\u201cWe typically encourage students if they\u2019re traveling in the USC neighborhood or traveling back and forth between USC and, say, downtown Los Angeles or to our Health Sciences Campus, to use USC transportation service,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cRather than public transportation services, there are trams that run almost around the clock in the area around USC.\u201d\n\nSome students noted they make sure to stay aware of their surroundings while using L.A. public transportation.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep, keep my eyes open. I think that\u2019s also part of the privilege I have. Just says [I\u2019m] a guy,\u201d Kranzler said. \u201cI stay aware of my surroundings, just like any other urban area.\u201d\n\nShergadwala said after hearing about this morning\u2019s incident, she will be more cautious about using public transportation in the future and usually prefers to sit alone when she has the option.\n\n\u201cI mean, after hearing about such issues, I think I would kind of think twice if I take the metro and take another alternative,\u201d she said.\n\nKantilal said he has heard of other incidents involving people assaulting other metro riders and that he has witnessed it himself while using the metro.\n\n\u201cI have heard of incidents where people just hurt other people, punch other people, and just jump off the metro,\u201d Kantilal said. \u201cI have seen violence by myself. So even if it\u2019s not intentional, it\u2019s still scary.\u201d\n\nCarlisle said students who find themselves in a dangerous situation while using public transportation can use the LiveSafe app to share their location with DPS, regardless of proximity to campus.\n\n\u201cHave the LiveSafe application on your phone,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cAlert the driver of the bus, who usually has an emergency button.

In the early morning hours, a Metro bus was hijacked in South L.A., leading to an hourlong police chase and ultimately a standoff. The bus driver, who was not injured, was taken hostage and held at gunpoint. There were two passengers on the bus. One was rescued; the other suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was later pronounced dead at a local hospital.\n\nOn and around the USC campus, Metro bus and train riders weighed in on a tragedy that\u2019s easily a commuter\u2019s worst nightmare, and which comes amid an ongoing crime wave on L.A. public transit. \u201cThe time that the hijacking occurred is usually the time I take the bus back home,\u201d said Leslie Aguilar, a commuter waiting for a bus just off campus.

There was a 16% increase in crimes on buses and trains between March and April that include assault and homicide \u2013 this year, there were four reported killings.

Several political experts spoke about the upcoming elections during \u201cA House Up for Grabs,\u201d a USC webinar featuring a panel of political experts to discuss which party may control the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nChristian Grose, a political science and international relations professor at USC, cited the results of a recent poll conducted by the university\u2019s Center for Inclusive Democracy. \u201cThe house is probably going to swing one way or the other, it\u2019s going to stay with the Republicans or it\u2019s going to go to the Democrats based on what happens in these districts,\u201d Grose said.\n\nThere are six congressional districts that may sway the control of the House of Representatives. These include some in Central California that could swing to either side of the political spectrum. With ongoing concern over the economy in California, and some voters projecting the blame onto Democrats -- including Democratic presidential nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris -- Grose sees a shift in voting in these districts.\n\n\u201cRural areas of the state and of the country that have traditionally been Democratic are flirting more with voting for Trump and Republicans than in the past,\u201d Grose said.\n\nThis poll focused on voter eligibility in different racial and ethnic groups, some more prominent than others in these swing districts. This poll found that Latinos, African Americans and Asian Americans are just under 55 percent of California\u2019s eligible voters as the 2024 elections approach.\n\nAccording to Matthew Mendez Garcia, another panelist and associate professor of political science at CSU Long Beach, Congressional District 45, which encompasses parts of Orange and Los Angeles counties, has a prominent Vietnamese community. But this doesn\u2019t mean that Vietnamese American Democratic candidate Derek Tran has secured the community\u2019s vote for the House seat.\n\nJarred Cuellar, assistant professor of political science at Cal Poly Pomona, said that voting preferences based on ethnicity are not as strong as they used to be. \u201cWhen it comes to co-ethnic voting, research has found that it is very powerful in the Latino community,\u201d Cuellar said. \u201cBut when trying to replicate that to the Asian American community, it is not nearly as powerful, you don\u2019t see nearly as much looking for someone that looks like you.\u201d\n\nWith this polling and the projected outcomes of the 2024 elections, the election results might appear to already be set in stone. Garcia said that voters may still sway the results away from projected polling outcomes. \u201cPeople are just starting to tune in to the November race, right? Ballots are about to drop,\u201d Garcia said.\n\nThe contentious House of Representatives seat races and the presidential election might push more California voters to the polls again. In 2020, the nation saw the highest voter turnout at just under 67 percent. Raquel Conteno, a USC political science and international relations PhD student and panelist, said the turnout might maintain this upward momentum on Election Day. \u201cGenerally there is a level of excitement about the race,\u201d Conteno said. \u201cWith this sort of massive shift in the presidential race so close to actual Election Day, I think people are excited and maybe paying a little bit more attention because there\u2019s novelty to it.\u201d\n\nCalifornia ballot drop-off locations will open on October 8. Centers for early in-person voting will also open ahead of the election in some counties, including Los Angeles.\n```"}

Animal Services\u2019 citywide cat program.

Cats with ears cut at their tips have likely gone through TNR.\n\nSkyler Nahouray, a junior and president of the Humane Society chapter at USC, is one of the club\u2019s members who helps volunteer at animal shelters and other organizations in South L.A.\n\n\u201cIn the past two years alone, we have been contacted by numerous USC students at various times in the day asking for suggestions because they found a stray cat near their apartment or on 28th Street,\u201d Nahouray said. \u201cDepending on the responses we receive, we normally advise the students to try their best to build trust between themselves and the cat in an attempt to slowly pet it.\u201d\n\nFrom there, students can contact animal services in the area, such as the Stray Cat Alliance, a nonprofit organization located about seven minutes west of campus.\n\nTo not startle or make a cat feel threatened, it is best to avoid prolonged eye contact and to not force an interaction with an uninterested cat, according to the Humane Rescue Alliance.\n\nKitty Bungalow-Charm School for Wayward Cats, a community cat organization near USC\u2019s campus in South L.A., practices TNR and nurses cats who have contracted diseases or have been badly hurt.\n\nToni Barrett, executive director at Kitty Bungalow, helps nurse and treat cats at their headquarters, some of whom are feral or semi-feral cats that cannot be adopted.\n\n\u201cCats are smart. They\u2019re very smart,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cSo if you are approaching a truly feral cat, you\u2019re not going to get anywhere near that cat. They\u2019re just gonna bolt.

A 2022 study from Pew Research Center found that 50 years ago, a third of Congressional Democrats and Republicans were moderate, compared to about 4% today.\n\nAs a consequence of party formation, Washington foresaw the American people rallying behind an individual who \u201cturns his disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe textbook of history seemed to prescribe that [republics] would fail because of excessive factionalism, resulting in the rise of some type of dictator or strong man,\u201d Denver Brunsman, a history professor at George Washington University, said.\n\nTrump opponent Josh Avlon \u2014 currently running for a House seat in New York\u2019s first district and author of a book about Washington\u2019s farewell address \u2014 suggests the former president is the actualization of Washington\u2019s warning.\n\n\u201c[Washington] was such a \u2014 an essentially modest man. I think in some ways what Donald Trump is, is sort of a nightmare image of what democracy could have become,\u201d Avlon said on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d in 2017.\n\nTop Democrats\u2019 recent arguments against Trump echo Washington\u2019s indications of a selfish leader. At the Democratic National Convention in August, former President Barack Obama said Trump \u201cwants the middle class to pay the price for another huge tax cut that would mostly help him\u201d whereas Vice President Kamala Harris has repeatedly accused Trump of killing a bipartisan border security bill earlier this year to benefit his 2024 campaign.\n\nSome Republicans believe Harris has also benefited from party loyalty after Biden\u2019s exit from the presidential race and subsequent endorsement of Harris made her the de facto Democratic nominee.\n\nTrump likened Harris\u2019s nomination to a coup and cited her lack of participation in any primary races, while House Speaker Mike Johnson said Democrats \u201csteamrolled democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut [Biden] got 14 million votes, they threw him out, she got zero votes, and when she ran, she was the first one to leave because she failed,\u201d Trump said at the ABC News presidential debate on Sept. 10.\n\nWashington also warned that parties could lead to an uprising, and the potential catalysts he lists in his farewell address bear modern significance.\n\n\u201c[Party] agitates the community with ill founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection,\u201d Washington said.\n\nIt was widespread misinformation \u2014 arguably the modern equivalent of \u201cfalse alarms\u201d \u2014 about voter fraud in the 2020 election that led to an attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building in an attempt to block the certification of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory.\n\nTrump was indicted by a federal grand jury for his involvement in the events of January 6 but a July 2024 Supreme Court decision sent the case back to lower court and guaranteed Trump \u201cpresumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts.\u201d\n\nChervinsky says the founding fathers disagreed on many issues save for one exception \u2013 they explicitly rejected the idea of a king and wanted the president to be held accountable under the law.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court decision is both entirely inconsistent with Washington\u2019s example and the exact opposite of original intent,\u201d Chervinsky said.\n\nWashington also advised against establishing permanent alliances with foreign governments in his farewell address. He opposed a clause in a 1778 treaty that required the United States to come to the aid of France if they were attacked by Great Britain.\n\nHe believed the countries\u2019 constant wars had nothing to do with American interests, according to Chervinsky.\n\n\u201cThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave,\u201d Washington said.\n\nStaunch support of Ukraine and Israel has strained intergovernmental relationships and widened the political divide, both within and between the parties.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Republicans agree with Israel\u2019s military efforts in Gaza while 75% of Democrats disapprove, according to a March 2024 Gallup poll.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas war has garnered heavy criticism from Democrats who oppose additional military aid and believe their relationship with Israel has been too lenient, in part resulting in record low approval ratings.\n\nBrunsman says he believes Washington\u2019s stance was particular to the times and not necessarily a warning against involvement in all wars.\n\nThe general consensus among historians who spoke to Annenberg Media was that because so much has changed, it is impossible to know how Washington would have viewed permanent foreign alliances today.\n\nThe Senate has read Washington\u2019s farewell address on his birthday every year since 1862, and ironically the annual reader of the address alternates between parties.\n```"}

(AP/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nBy Ethan Inman September 25, 2024 at 1:59 pm PDT\n\nWith Shohei Ohtani having secured his 50/50 season and the team clinching a postseason berth now in the rearview mirror, there wasn\u2019t much at stake in the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 series against the Colorado Rockies this weekend. The Dodgers are still determined to stay ahead of the San Diego Padres and clinch the National League West division title. This series was between two teams whose postseason fates have been decided: one that will be in the thick of a championship chase, and another that will be on a beach in Cancun, a couch in the Colorado mountains or somewhere in between.\n\nGiven the stark contrast between the Rockies and Dodgers, LA had the option of sitting back, relaxing and focusing on the playoffs ahead. Instead, they attacked the series with the same energy and emotion as if it were the playoffs. Dodger fans can only hope the team will maintain that mentality for clutch situations in October.\n\nFriday\u2019s game was a true bullpen game. Brusdar Graterol was the only Dodger to throw multiple innings, getting through the third and fourth. Ryan Brasier, Joe Kelly, Daniel Hudson, Alex Vesia, Evan Phillips, Blake Treinen and Michael Kopech also threw an inning each. The eight arms each did their part to help the Dodgers secure a 6-4 victory, and Vesia was credited with the win and Kopech the save.\n\nOffensively, the story was clutch home runs. Ohtani hit a go-ahead two-run homer in the bottom of the fifth, and after the Rox tied it in the sixth, Teoscar Hernandez put the boys in blue right back ahead with a go-ahead solo shot. Hernandez also helped extend the lead with an RBI single in the bottom of the seventh.\n\nMuch has been made out of Ohtani\u2019s addition to the Dodgers\u2019 already deep and dangerous lineup with hopes he can help them get over the hump this postseason, but in October, its often unheralded heroes that come out of the woodworks. If he continues his clutch hitting, Hernandez could end up being the lineup addition that breaks the annual curse of Dodger bats freezing up in October.\n\nThe Dodgers dropped the middle game on Saturday 6-3. The game was tied 3-3 at one point, but Rockies infielder Ryan McMahon hit a go-ahead homer in the top of the fifth and the Rockies bullpen locked the game down from there while the bats continued to extend their lead.\n\nThe most encouraging aspect of the game for the Dodgers was Walker Buehler\u2019s start. It wasn\u2019t particularly great as he surrendered four runs, but he competed and kept the Dodgers in the game through five and a half innings of work. With so many rotation arms continuing to be on the shelf and the bullpen having to endure a high workload, Buehler\u2019s growth in stretching himself out coming off Tommy John is encouraging. If he can eat up innings and compete in October, that will do wonders for a Dodger rotation that desperately needs it. Fortunately, Buehler himself said that he felt like he competed well and he\u2019s simply hoping for better results. He has one more start before the postseason to sort things out.\n\nSunday\u2019s game was by far the most entertaining. After a short and mediocre start from Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the Dodgers found themselves down 5-1 early and still trailed 5-4 heading into the bottom of the ninth. In the ninth inning, however, the Dodgers\u2019 playoff energy came in. Leading off the inning, Ohtani jumped on an off-speed pitch from Seth Halvorsen and crushed it to right-center field to tie the game. The emotion was written all over Ohtani\u2019s face as he rounded the bases and screamed back at an erupting Dodger Stadium.\n\nPerhaps energized by Ohtani, Mookie Betts followed Ohtani\u2019s homer up by casually flipping a 100mph fastball over the left-field wall to give the Dodgers a 6-5 lead and the win. Betts emulated Ohtani\u2019s energy when he rounded the bases, looking as if the Dodgers had won a playoff game.\n\nBack-to-back home runs to win a game is not something seen every day, but that\u2019s exactly what the Dodgers will need in the postseason given the perennial target on their back: improbable exciting feats of stardom in desperate moments. Luckily, they have a roster full of players who can provide just that.\n\nThis article was written before the Dodgers 4-2 defeat to the San Diego Padres on September 24.\n```"}

Now, he\u2019s one of MLB\u2019s premier starters.\n\nChicago Cubs pitcher Shota Imanaga delivers during the first inning of a baseball game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Wednesday, Sept. 4, 2024, in Chicago. (AP/Charles Rex Arbogast)\n\nBy Ethan Inman September 25, 2024 at 1:40 pm PDT\n\nWhen Shota Imanaga signed with the Chicago Cubs this past offseason, a lot of people raised their eyebrows and shook their heads. Four years and $53 million seemed like a big risk for the Cubs at the time. Imanaga was 30 years old and had solid, but not overwhelmingly good stats in Japan\u2019s Nippon Professional Baseball league. His potential to improve seemed low and the likelihood he\u2019d regress soon due to his age seemed high. Standing at only 5 feet and 10 inches and averaging only 92 miles an hour on his fastball, Imanaga also represented a sharp detour from the tall, hard-throwing starter that every MLB team seems to want in this modern era. So, his velocity and physical attributes weren\u2019t making up for his age and statline either. Many fans wondered just what the Cubs saw in Imanaga to commit a not-insignificant sum of money to him over the next four years.\n\nBut then, Imanaga had his introductory press conference. You\u2019ve likely seen it, it took the sports community and really the entire internet by storm. \u201cHey Chicago, what do you say?\u201d Imanaga said in English, \u201cThe Cubs are going to win today.\u201d The line from the Cubs\u2019 famous victory song \u201cGo Cubs Go\u201d immediately endeared him to the team\u2019s fans and, really, baseball fans everywhere. It was only the beginning of what baseball fans would find out about Imanaga\u2019s unique, fun personality.\n\nIn Japan, Imanaga earned the moniker \u201cThe Throwing Philosopher,\u201d on account of his scholarly approach to studying and perfecting the art of pitching. As a result of his attitude towards pitching, he tends to sound uniquely sophisticated when talking about his craft. \u201cI know that I have a unique personality. Even if I\u2019m trying to say a normal thing, it comes out a little sophisticated,\u201d Imanaga said in an interview on MLB Central back in May.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t Imanaga\u2019s only nickname to go viral. He later revealed in a different interview that he uses the name \u201cMike\u201d at Starbucks because it makes it easier on baristas who would otherwise constantly misspell his real name. His teammates took it and ran with it, even changing the nameplate on his locker to \u201cMike Imanaga II.\u201d But why the suffix, indicating that he was Imanaga the Second? According to Imanaga, it \u201cjust sounds cool.\u201d\n\nImanaga also revealed in an interview during his first trip to New York that he recognized the city from the Spider-Man game, much to his delight. All of these moments and many more won over the hearts of Cubs and MLB fans, and even though initially they might\u2019ve had doubts that he could find success in the MLB, they couldn\u2019t help but root for him now.\n\nBut the thing is, Imanaga did find success, against all odds and all conventional knowledge held among prominent modern baseball minds. He was brilliant right from his first outing. Through his first nine starts, Imanaga wasn\u2019t just holding his own in the MLB. He was the best pitcher in the game. Through those nine games he owned a 5-0 record and a league-leading 0.84 ERA. He hasn\u2019t slowed down since then, either. Through almost the end of September, Imanaga has made 29 starts and holds a superb 15-3 record with a 2.91 ERA and 174 strikeouts in 173.1 innings pitched.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the accolades have poured in. Imanaga was National League Rookie of the Month for April and named a National League All-Star. He\u2019s sure to be in the running for the Rookie of the Year award and the National League Cy Young award. And on September 4, he threw the bulk of a Cubs combined no-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He threw seven hitless innings, and two relief pitchers finished the game off to secure the first no-hitter at Wrigley Field since 1972.\n\nWith each superb outing and every accolade he receives, Imanaga defies modern MLB conventions about age (only invest in the young), velocity (the faster the better), scouting (the NPB is deeper than we thought) and pitching in general (command, location, and diverse arsenals are still king!) Best of all, he\u2019s done it with a smile on his face, a can-do attitude, and a lot of studious hard work. And maybe most importantly, a big personality that sets him apart from everyone and makes him truly unique.\n\nWith his underdog status, brilliant success, and fun personality, how can Shota Imanaga not be one of your favorite players in the whole MLB?\n```"}

She answered a few questions related to nutrition that USC students should know.\n\nWhich nutrition standards does USC Hospitality hold itself to?\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) updated its nutrition guidelines for school meals in April. These updates include reducing added sugars and sodium. The guidelines are for public and nonprofit private K-12 schools, so universities such as USC are not held to these government standards.\n\nPine shared that USC is part of the Menus of Change University Research Collaborative, a global network of universities working towards healthier and more sustainable foods for their students. Some Menus of Change members include Columbia University, Harvard University and seven of the ten University of California campuses.\n\nUSC Hospitality develops menus based on the Menus of Change principles, which focus on the sustainability, nutrition and public health aspects of dining, said Pine. Pine said chefs keep these principles in mind when writing menus by \u201cleveraging globally inspired plant-forward culinary strategies, focusing on whole, minimally processed foods, emphasizing calorie quality over quantity, making whole, intact grains the new norm, [and] thinking produce first.\u201d\n\nRestaurants that do not fall under USC Hospitality, like Cava or Kobunga in the USC Village, do not have to follow these standards.\n\nWhat does the EatWell logo mean on meals?\n\nUSC Hospitality and USC Eatwell piloted the USC EatWell meal program last school year. EatWell meals are curated to fit specific nutrition guidelines, such as less than 800 mg of sodium for entrees, sandwiches and salads. EatWell meals are branded with an EatWell logo in person, on the campus dining mobile app and at ordering kiosks.\n\nMeals at Panda Express, Seeds Marketplace and Caf\u00e9 Annenberg have EatWell menu items. Rayna Williams, an athletic training fellow for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s water polo team, said she had never noticed EatWell logos around campus, but \u201cnow [she] knows [she] can look for the logo.\u201d\n\nWilliams added she thought \u201cbetter signage to point out healthier options\u201d would help students and athletes on campus. Pine says one of the most underrated EatWell meals is the breakfast Buddha bowl at Seeds Marketplace as \u201cthe portion is very generous and contains eggs, quinoa, sweet potatoes, pickled red onion and avocado. It\u2019s a fantastic way to fuel your day.\u201d\n\nWhere can I learn more about nutrition and healthy eating on campus?\n\nThe USC hospitality website has articles written by Pine and other registered dietitians covering topics ranging from Halal-friendly dining to foods that promote heart health. Pine highlighted that the USC Eatwell website has multiple how-to guides including a Trader Joe\u2019s grocery shopping guide for busy students.\n\nThe site features over 100 cooking videos and recipes, with a USC Eatwell cookbook coming soon. Maya Tauber, a senior studying cognitive science, said \u201cnutrition resources\u201d is a new phrase to her. She said for her, \u201csometimes it\u2019s hard in college to have things that are healthy\u201d and that \u201ccooking is a new venture,\u201d so she thinks these video recipes could be helpful.\n\nFor students wanting to dive further into certain nutrition topics, EatWell hosts monthly 30 minute webinars about healthy living called EatWell Bites. Registered Dietitian, Frida Hovik, gave an EatWell Bites presentation in July about optimizing nutrition on the go.\n\nHovik shared that the best thing students can remember when trying to cultivate a healthy lifestyle is that nutrition is simpler than people make it out to be, \u201cit\u2019s just back to the basics \u2014 eat real whole foods.\u201d\n\nWhere are the nutrition facts in USC dining halls?\n\nNutrition facts are not shared for meals in USC dining halls, in person or online. USC Hospitality intentionally does not share nutrition facts to be mindful of students who may be dealing with an eating disorder, said Pine.\n\n\u201cWe want students to focus on their education, not obsessing over food numbers. You don\u2019t need to count calories in order to be healthy,\u201d Pine said. Instead, she created an online guide for students on how to create a balanced meal.\n\nWhat are some easy changes to make that can improve overall nutrition and health?\n\nHovik shares that planning meals ahead of time and having healthy options on hand makes it easier to maintain a healthy diet. Hovik said she likes to visualize her days and take note of the options that will be available to her.\n\nTauber expressed the difficulty of eating healthy meals when she stays on campus past the 8 p.m. closing time many on campus dining options. \u201cI don\u2019t have a meal plan so I\u2019ll end up eating Panda Express,\u201d she said, \u201cso maybe accessibility to healthier meals later in the day is mainly [my concern]. \"\n\nHovik said having healthy snacks on hand like \u201cfruits, some nuts, greek yogurt if you can store it in a fridge somewhere, rice cakes, whole grain crackers\u201d can prevent students from going to a vending machine when they get hungry on a busy day.\n\nNext week, Brittany Gurney, a dietitian at the Keck School of Medicine, will give an EatWell Bites presentation on how to stick to nutrition goals.

During the public comment period of the session, Angelenos raised concerns on the qualifications of the rumored picks, reported by the Los Angeles Times to be former LAPD Deputy Chief Robert Arcos, LAPD Deputy Chief Emada Tingirides and former Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell. Dominic Choi, a USC alumnus and LAPD assistant chief, has served as the LAPD interim chief of police since March 1 after Michel Moore stepped down.\n\nOne community member who joined the event remotely questioned why there had been little discussion of the results of a survey showing support among officers for hiring a new chief from outside of LAPD. \u201c[LAPD] does not represent the people, and it\u2019s obvious,\u201d the caller said. \u201cWhy did [you] not mention once that the people and the officers requested an outside chief of police? Instead this commission sends three candidates forward who are all former LAPD ... this commission and our disgrace of a mayor would rather pick a puppet you can control.\u201d\n\nThe survey in question was conducted by the Mayor\u2019s office in the course of the search for a new police chief. Results released last week showed officers reported feeling significant disconnect with higher leadership and a workplace culture where minor mistakes are punished harshly.\n\nAnother virtual participant raised concerns that the options for chief were chosen on the basis of race and sex instead of experience. \u201cL.A. is being run by a radical DEI mayor with a radical DEI agenda,\u201d the caller said. \u201cYou guys are picking a DEI candidate for the new police chief ... isn\u2019t meritocracy important?\u201d\n\nSome Angelenos commented on defunding certain LAPD initiatives in order to reinvest in low-income communities. Jayme Kusyk, a member of Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, spoke in person about the Community Safety Partnership, an initiative launched in 2011 with the goal of promoting communication between officers and L.A. residents. \u201cThe idea of community policing is a counterinsurgency tactic intended to expand surveillance, cultivate informants and divert much needed resources from the community to create dependency,\u201d Kusyk said. \u201cWe refuse to be instrumentalized and deputized by the police and have our communities torn apart with distrust.\u201d\n\nShe added that the money spent on CSP would be better spent by investing in the low-income, minority communities the program is focused on. \u201cThe whole program is about presumption of guilt and assigning collective criminality to the community. Take the money out of the police budget and give it directly to the community,\u201d Kusyk said.\n\nHamid Khan, an organizer at Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, spoke in person about a number of past LAPD chiefs with a history of racist community policing tactics. Speaking to Annenberg Media after the session, Khan added it was important to look \u201cat the lineage of who these chiefs are.\u201d \u201cWe just want [policing] to be shut down,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we talk about public safety, who\u2019s the \u2018public\u2019 that needs to be kept safe, and from whom do they need to be kept safe?\u201d\n\nKusyk noted the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition is, on a larger scale, focused on the disestablishment of law enforcement as it currently stands. \u201cWe are an anti-reform group. We are dedicated to the abolition of policing entirely,\u201d she said. \u201cI would so much prefer that [LAPD\u2019s] money be diverted towards communities, towards individual people, to be put towards their welfare and well being.\u201d\n```"}

Residents alleged inadequate responses from the USC Department of Public Safety (DPS) and the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD).\n\nDPS removed the man from the area on September 16, nearly one week after a sophomore residing on Greek Row said she saw him exposing himself in public, sexually harassing female students and loitering outside of sorority houses.\n\n\u201cI was walking on the road, and he was on the sidewalk in front of me, staring at me and my friend. He was masturbating,\u201d the sophomore resident said. \u201cI ran inside and called DPS and reported it, and I thought that it was dealt with until a lot of my other friends kept approaching me telling me that they were having the same experience day after day after day.\u201d\n\nThe students quoted in this article requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the alleged incidents and concern for their safety.\n\nDPS Chief of Public Safety Lauretta Hill confirmed DPS had received multiple reports about an unhoused man on 28th St. in the past two weeks. She added in her statement that DPS actively monitors the area and encourages students to avoid engaging with \u201ca possible suspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe partnered with LAPD for a special detail to address this problem,\u201d Hill said in the statement. \u201cThe individual who was the subject of the complaints on 28th Street agreed to accept services and left the area on September 16.\u201d\n\nThe DPS statement did not acknowledge the sexual nature of the complaints made against the individual.\n\nAn Annenberg Media reporter found the man sleeping across the street from the USC Village on Sept. 17.

She said people gave the man food, so he stuck around, but added his presence was not an issue until September 8, when the man was seen masturbating in broad daylight.\n\nLAPD received three reports on September 11 regarding a Black male exposing himself, according to a statement shared via email with Annenberg Media. LAPD officers responded to one call made in the afternoon, detaining and releasing an individual. LAPD did not confirm the identity of the person.\n\n\u201cTwo phone calls did not have police response due to the caller stating the suspect had already left the location and the caller advising they would call back if the suspect returned,\u201d LAPD Officer Drake Madison said in the statement.\n\nThe PR student said that when she tried to report the man\u2019s behavior to a DPS officer, that person told her that DPS could not take action against the man until he escalated his behavior to physical assault. She said the officer recommended confronting the man if she wanted him off her property.\n\n\u201c[DPS] told us to pour bleach and water on the sidewalk where he would normally sit, so he wouldn\u2019t come back,\u201d the student said. \u201cThen they told us that they might be able to permanently remove him if we get a video recording of him doing it...why can\u2019t they do it themselves? Why is it that we have to get the recording?\u201d\n\nThe student said DPS responded to reports but were reluctant to take action because the unhoused man allegedly claimed to have a skin infection affecting his genitals. Eventually, she said DPS attempted to intervene, but the man continued his behavior.\n\nHill did not address these accusations in the statement from DPS.\n\n\u201cI witnessed [DPS] try to kick him out, and instead they aggravated him,\u201d the PR student said. \u201cThey left me and another girl who were walking on the sidewalk to deal with this man who\u2019s obviously not in the best mental state, who\u2019s aggravated and following us...they put us in an unsafe situation.\u201d\n\nThe same PR student said DPS encouraged those who reported incidents to stay in contact with university security and did not advise reaching out to LAPD. When a fellow resident called city police, the student said they were told LAPD \u201chad bigger issues to deal with.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The university] make[s] it seem like we have all these officers, all this surveillance, this two-mile radius, like you\u2019re going to be safe no matter what around campus.

Yellow Jacket security ambassadors are positioned at the intersection of 28th Street and University Avenue at night, but not during the day.\n\nThe 2.5 square-mile area around USC\u2019s University Park Campus that DPS says it patrols 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.\n\nAccording to its website, DPS patrols a 2.5 square-mile area around USC\u2019s University Park Campus 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.\n\nOther residents of the area raised complaints on Sidechat, a Reddit-like social media app where every post is anonymous. One user shared a picture of the man with the caption, \u201cCan someone get this dude out of here please.\u201d Another user reposted the image and commented that he was actively sleeping outside of a sorority while exposing himself.\n\nComments about the alleged sexual harassment posted to Sidechat, an anonymous social media app.\n\nA junior studying business administration who lives on Greek Row said while most unhoused people she has come across are harmless, she has sometimes had to find other ways to enter and exit her house because of people sleeping in the walkway outside.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of scary, because you really don\u2019t know where their heads are at,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what drugs they\u2019re on or what their state of consciousness is, or what they\u2019re capable of.\u201d\n\nIn June, an unhoused man was fatally stabbed by a USC student outside of a fraternity house on Greek Row. The student was arrested on suspicion of murder, but was later cleared of charges on the grounds that he had acted out of self defense and fear for his life and the safety of others.\n\nThe USC Office of Equity, Equal Opportunity and Title IX said they were unable to comment on reports of sexual misconduct due to privacy laws, but noted the office offers support to all students, faculty and staff who contact them, including \u201cacademic accommodations, workplace modifications, campus escort services and connecting to counseling.\u201d\n\nDPS works with unhoused individuals in communities around USC, according to the statement from Hill.\n\n\u201cWe work with the city\u2019s sanitation department, city council office and the Los Angeles Police Department to provide assistance to unhoused individuals. Officers coordinate with the L.A. CIRCLE Team (Crisis and Incident Response through Community-led Engagement) for shelter and various other social services that the team provides. We also connect unhoused individuals who need medical treatment with the USC Street Medicine team,\u201d she said in the statement.\n\nIn recent years, USC has implemented various programs to address homelessness. The Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work offers resources and programs for unhoused individuals, including employment programs and housing assistance. In 2021, the USC Keck School of Medicine launched the Street Medicine Program, offering medical care to unhoused individuals in local communities. Meanwhile, The Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research conducts intervention-focused research and trains homeless service practitioners.\n\nWhile students can raise concerns in person with DPS officers on duty, Hill said students can reach DPS in multiple ways.\n\n\u201cWe ask people to immediately contact us when they believe a crime is in progress,\u201d Hill said in the statement. \u201cWe encourage them to use the LiveSafe app but they also can call us at 213-740-4321 (University Park Campus) or 323-442-1000 (Health Sciences Campus).\u201d\n```"}

Bhatti earned 24% of the votes with 235 votes and Breitfelder won 18% of the votes with 177 votes total. This year\u2019s special election, held from September 18-20, was organized to fill two vacant senate seats after one seat went unelected last spring and one senator resigned over the summer. The third-place candidate, Jad Kilani, fell short by 15 votes. Unlike a ranked-choice system, this election followed a majority-wins format with the top two vote-getters earning the positions. The total number of 987 votes marks an increase from the USG November 2023 special election, where 674 students voted.\n\nUSG special election results from the Qualtrics data system.

She also campaigned with signs, markers and notes, actions that infringed on the special election campaign rules.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the special elections, everything is expedited and streamlined because the focus is to fill the vacant senate seats in order for the senators to operate for the rest of the year,\u201d  said Susanna Andryan, USG chief justice of the judicial branch. \u201cSo, with that being said, we did not give any candidates a budget; we restricted campaigning to mainly social media.\u201d\n\nBreitfelder shared his reaction to being elected, as well as his agenda for the future. \u201cI feel really grateful for this opportunity.

It\u2019s celebrated internationally every year September 16-23. \n\nBisexual Pride Flag at Fresno Rainbow Pride Parade 2023 on Olive Avenue in the Tower District. (Photo courtesy of David Prasad)\n\nBy Angie Pulmano and Sheridan Hunter September 24, 2024 at 7:03 pm PDT\n\nHow do members of the bisexual community define visibility, and what makes visibility so important for the queer community? Alicia Alvarez remembers when she came out to her family. \u201cI\u2019m half Mexican and half European, and I didn\u2019t come out to either [of] my parents until I was 18,\u201d said Alvarez, an award-winning graduate student journalist at USC Annenberg. \u201cI was really lucky that my brother, my half brother, on my father\u2019s side also came out a little bit before me.\u201d\n\nAs a journalist, Alvarez focuses on cultural and international stories in her reporting. She spoke about her experiences as a woman of color in the bi community. To her surprise, \u201c[My dad] was actually really accepting and really welcoming, and he really started asking me more questions about the community,\u201d she said. \u201cHe started educating himself and then, in turn, my Hispanic family started educating themselves.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from the UCLA School of Law Williams Institute, almost 14 million adults in the U.S. identify as LGBTQ+, and over half as bisexual. Despite these numbers, visibility for the bi community remains a challenge, and bi-phobia -- discrimination against bisexual individuals -- contributes to the erasure of the community. Alvarez said she experienced previous partners invalidating her identity. \u201cThey just don\u2019t really understand that just because I\u2019m dating men more often doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not interested in women, or that I don\u2019t still identify as bisexual,\u201d she said.\n\nStereotypes also contribute to the erasure bi people face. \u201cEspecially for bi women,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cWe\u2019re [seen as] straight with a little bit of zest.\u201d Bisexual men are often stereotyped to be gay and questioning. Dr. Mimi Hoang, co-founder and board member of the grassroots non-profit Los Angeles Bi+ Task Force, spoke about common misconceptions of the community. \u201dYou know, your family may not accept you ... I think there\u2019s still a lot of negative stereotypes that bisexual people are promiscuous or unfaithful,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s that mislabeling that also happens that\u2019s kind of a microaggression or [form of] erasure.\u201d\n\nSo where does this culture of invisibility come from? In the 1950s, during the Cold War, queer Americans were targeted in workplaces when many people felt threatened by communists, immigrants and queer communities. Tens of thousands of queer folks lost their jobs in the federal government or were forced to resign due to an order signed by President Eisenhower during an era called \u201cthe Lavender Scare.\u201d PBS released a documentary in 2019 about the Lavender Scare. USC Annenberg professor and senior producer on the documentary, Barbara Hyde Pierce, said the movement ultimately galvanized the queer community. \u201cIt was a horrible thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe aim was to drive them underground, to make them invisible, but eventually, what that actually ended up doing was to make them very visible and very angry. It led to the Gay Rights movement, which we\u2019re still seeing the effects of today.\u201d\n\nHoang lists just some of the places these days for bi folks to be visible and immersed in community. \u201cBowling, potlucks, movie nights, things like that,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s also different discussion groups that are around L.A. as well ... What better way to be visible in going to these events, right?\u201d\n\nAt USC, however, it\u2019s not that easy. \u201cI definitely haven\u2019t really made my identity known that much at USC,\u201d said Alvarez, the grad student. \u201cI feel safe in our own bubble of Annenberg, but if I were to go wearing the pride pin, I definitely would be concerned that I would get at least some type of verbal harassment.\u201d\n\nWhile progress has been made and safe spaces have become more common, people like Alvarez say there is still much more work that needs to be done for bi people to feel both visible and safe.\n```"}

There are a lot of information coming from from left and right, and you don\u2019t know what to believe and what to take seriously and what not to so it\u2019s really confusing.\u201d\n\nIt was hard to hang up the phone. I couldn\u2019t hold back my emotions and broke down towards the end of the call, reminding him that I\u2019m there for him.\n\nI asked Giovanni Zaarour, with the USC Lebanese club, how those of us with family in Lebanon can support one another here on campus. \u201cAs a community right now, we\u2019re just trying to foster humanitarian efforts and share those efforts out with the public,\u201d he said, \u201cand also our own community.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of Karolina Grabowska/Pexels)\n\nBy Gricelda Gallardo September 24, 2024 at 6:47 pm PDT\n\nThis week Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 3216, the Phone-Free Schools Act. It requires California schools to create policies limiting student cell phone use on K-12 campuses by July 1, 2026. The new law addresses concerns over the excessive use of cell phones in schools; cell phones on campus have been blamed for distracting students from learning and increasing the risk of mental health issues. AB 3216 aims to addresses these concerns and help students stay focused. Ways in which schools could do this include placing phones in locked pouches during class, or placing them in cell phone lockers. Previous legislation allowed school districts to restrict cell phone use, but did not require them to.\n\nUSC Rossier School of Education associate professor Stephen Aguilar said he believes the bill can help minimize distractions for students. \u201cThe pros for that are obviously,\u201d he said, \u201cpotentially more attention paid to school work. If students don\u2019t have this sort of portal to distraction, it might be helpful, and it will likely sort of help students stay more engaged.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, there are concerns about how students would contact loved ones during emergencies. Professor Morgan Polikoff with the USC Rossier School of Education believes the cell phone ban might pose challenges. \u201cI think (it) has primarily to do with concerns to the ability to be in touch with students,\u201d Polikoff said, \u201cboth in general, but also acutely during times of crisis like school shootings or other incidents like that.\u201d Aguilar similarly worries about how parents might feel not being able to contact their children. \u201cEvery school and every school district is going to need to respond to, well, okay, parents do have a right to be able to know where their their children are... and expect safety,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the meantime, schools will have the next two years to come up with a plan that balances keeping students both safe and focused while in the classroom.

(Photo courtesy of Elizabeth Newcomb)\n\nBy Jayden Higman\nSeptember 24, 2024 at 4:51 pm PDT\n\nOn September 17, former actress, current author and filmmaker Justine Bateman joined the class \u201cAging in the Media\u201d to discuss her perspective on aging and its stigma in women. The underclassmen seminar class, supported by the Interdisciplinary Teacher Grant, invited Bateman to present her ideas regarding aging through a discussion format with attending students. The seminar is taught by professor Caroline Cicero of the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, who co-teaches the class with professor Laura Casta\u00f1eda at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.\n\nJustine Bateman, known for her role on \u201cFamily Ties\u201d and her recent filmmaking projects, shared that her proactive part in combating negative views on aging didn\u2019t stem from her Hollywood stardom in the 1980s. \u201cI never saw [the criticism] at all,\u201d Bateman said. \u201cFunny enough, I never felt pressure about it, it was always from people outside the business.\u201d\n\nInstead, she told the class that things took a turn when she got older. \u201cI googled my name, which is a big mistake, and the autocomplete was \u2018looks old.\u2019 I was 43 years old, and my face hadn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Bateman, \u201cAnd then through that, I made the mistake of making them right and me wrong. I was like, \u2018well, there\u2019s so many of them and so few of me.\u2019\u201d\n\nBateman discussed the feeling of this public perception; how she turned to a vulnerable state rather than confront the issue. But, through a way of thinking, she overcame this grudge against the media, against her own looks. \u201cI was like, what\u2019s the anchor for society in general, that they hold on to this idea that women\u2019s faces, women\u2019s older faces, are broken and have to be fixed?\u201d Bateman told the class. \u201cThe core fear is ... an anchor for this belief.\u201d\n\nSince her involvement in the entertainment industry, Bateman admitted to students that social media hasn\u2019t been forgiving when it comes to aging. \u201cWe should see [somebody\u2019s spirit] more and more as we get older,\u201d Bateman said. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing that the internet has unfortunately done for us, is flatten our impression of people to a two-dimensional absorption of them.\u201d\n\nBateman embraces the saying \u201cit\u2019s never too late.\u201d After graduating from UCLA with a computer science degree at age 50, she wrote her book shortly after and later directed a movie at 55. Her overall advice to the seminar students was to follow her lead \u2014 that age shouldn\u2019t classify your ability to do something, that students should \u201ctry and remember [that] until you die, it\u2019s your time, and you can get anything you want done.\u201d```"}

This puts the tally of foreign mentions over 80, while \u201cAmerica\u201d and \u201cAmericans\u201d were mentioned 64 times.\n\nPolitical communications strategy expert and USC Instructor Steve Caplan weighed in on whether each candidate achieved their goals for the debate regarding foreign policy. \u201cI think that Kamala Harris had to send the message that she understands foreign policy, that she\u2019s capable of being the Commander in Chief, that she\u2019s been able to meet with world leaders and will maintain, to a certain extent, the current policy. She met all those tests,\u201d Caplan said. \u201cAs far as Donald Trump, I think he certainly extended and continued his brand of foreign policy, which is very much an America First policy, with a focus on having our allies stand for and put money into these conflicts.\u201d He thought each candidate achieved their goals and that \u201cthere were no surprises, which in this case is probably a good thing for both candidates.\u201d\n\nWithin the first minutes of the debate, Trump\u2019s opening answer discussed China, responding to Harris\u2019 claims that he would put in place a \u201cTrump tax\u201d in the form of tariffs on foreign imports. \u201cOther countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we\u2019ve done for the world,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd the tariff will be substantial in some cases. I took in billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China. In fact, they never took the tariff off because it was so much money, they can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe first mention of foreign policy in the debate, but not the last. On China alone, Harris condemned trade wars and Trump\u2019s selling of American chips to the nation, as well as his praise of President Xi Jinping in the early days of COVID-19. But how do these positions stand up against each candidate\u2019s real-world policies? After all, each has had their share of authority in the west wing over the past eight years.\n\nWhile in office, Trump did enact substantial tariffs, imposing several rounds on steel, aluminum, solar panels, laundry machines, and goods from China. According to the Tax Foundation, which provides research and analysis of tax policy, these affected more than $380 billion worth of trade at the time of implementation and amounted to a tax increase of nearly $80 billion for Americans. Since leaving office, some of these tariffs have expired, and some have been suspended by the Biden administration.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t the only one adding tariffs, however. In May 2024, President Joe Biden announced additional tariffs on $18 billion of Chinese goods, leading to a $3.6 billion tax increase at home. If elected, Trump plans to go further and may seek a more than 60% rise in tariffs on Chinese goods in particular, and tariffs of 10% to 20% on most imports. It is unclear what tariffs exactly would look like under a Harris administration, but a spokesperson for the campaign said she would employ strategic tariffs to support the American economy.\n\nLast month, the New York Times reported there wasn\u2019t an extreme divide on trade: \u201cOn economic policy and trade issues, you have both major parties moving in the same direction,\u201d they spoke to Nick Iacovella, a senior vice president at the Coalition for a Prosperous America. \u201cMr. Iacovella said that Mr. Trump would most likely go further on tariffs than Ms. Harris would, but that no matter who won the election \u2018it\u2019s still going to be a tariffs administration, and an industrial policy one.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat wasn\u2019t mentioned: Taiwanese Sovereignty, Territorial Conflicts in the South China Sea, China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nRussia\u2019s war in Ukraine was another flashpoint, on which each candidate painted a different picture of what would have happened if Trump had been in office at the time of the initial invasion. \u201cIf I were president Russia would have never, ever -- I know Putin very well...Have gone into Ukraine and killed millions of people,\u201d Trump said. However when asked if he wanted Ukraine to win the war, he reiterated \u201cI want the war to stop.\u201d He claimed that he would be able to achieve this while President elect.\n\nHarris discussed meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the importance of the NATO alliance. \u201cBecause of our support, because of the air defense, the ammunition, the artillery, the javelins, the Abrams tanks that we have provided, Ukraine stands as an independent and free country,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIf Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now.\u201d\n\nWhat wasn\u2019t mentioned: Use of American weapons by Ukraine inside of Russia, a plan to end the fighting.\n\nPerhaps the most top-of-mind foreign policy issue of the day is the Israel-Hamas war. It has been nearly a year since the October 7th attacks, and Harris was asked about her plan to get a ceasefire. \u201cThe way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal and we need the hostages out,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd so we will continue to work around the clock on that. Work around the clock also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution.\u201d\n\nHarris affirmed her goal of a two-state solution, while maintaining security for both Israelis and Palestinians. Trump criticized Harris in his answer, and did not provide specific details on his own plan to end the conflict. \u201cBut when she mentions about Israel all of a sudden -- she hates Israel. She wouldn\u2019t even meet with Netanyahu when he went to Congress to make a very important speech.\u201d\n\nHarris had a prior commitment during Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress, however she met with him the next day. Trump met with Netanyahu later that week at his Mar-a-Lago resort. During Trump\u2019s presidency, the two leaders had a positive relationship, however, Trump\u2019s view of Netanyahu reportedly changed when he congratulated Biden on his victory in the 2020 election, which Trump disputes.\n\nWhile in the White House, he cut funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) which has provided relief to Palestinian refugees. Biden reinstated this relief in 2021. However in January, the Biden administration joined other nations in withholding funding this year after Israel claimed a number of employees were involved in the Hamas-led October 7th Attack.\n\nTrump said in April he wants a \u201cfast\u201d end to the war and believes, similarly to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, that it would not have happened under his watch. Trump has yet to outline a detailed plan regarding Israel\u2019s military campaign or aid for Palestinians.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration has sought a ceasefire under terms outlined by the president on May 31. This proposal has not been agreed to, and negotiations have reportedly reached a stalemate, though talks are ongoing. Harris has expressed concern over what she describes as the \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d taking place in Gaza, and in December 2023, remarked that \u201cIsrael has the right to defend itself. It matters how.\u201d She has not yet clarified whether this stance will lead to any divergence from the president\u2019s policy.\n\nWhat wasn\u2019t mentioned: If Harris plans to differ from Biden\u2019s policy to seek a ceasefire, Trump\u2019s goals and/or plan: does he want a ceasefire? Will he continue to arm Israel?\n\nThe New York Times tracked speaking time and attacks during the debate, and broke this down further into time spent on issues discussed. At the top of the foreign policy agenda was the Russia Ukraine war, with over six minutes of speaking time. Broader foreign policy received five minutes, Israel Hamas, almost 2 1/2 minutes, and China just under one minute. It can be assumed that discussions of Afghanistan, North Korea, Victor Orban, and Iran fall under the broad foreign policy tracker.\n\nA presidential debate will always be centered on what the election of each candidate would mean for citizens at home, but when foreign countries are mentioned more often than America there is no question that international relations is a key priority in this election.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ronda Churchill)\n\nBy Mia Nu\u00f1ez September 24, 2024 at 10:32 am PDT\n\nAfter a tight race for the eighth playoff seed, the WNBA playoffs are finally set, with eight teams competing for a championship title. It\u2019ll start with a best-of-three series for the first round, and then a best-of-five series for both the semifinals and finals. Here are my predictions for each series of the first round.\n\nNew York Liberty vs. Atlanta Dream\nThe Liberty are taking this easy in what should be a 2-0 series win for New York. Last year, the Liberty were runner-up in the championship, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see them there again. The Dream barely made the playoffs. Even though they have guard Rhyne Howard, who is averaging 17.3 points per game, guard Allisha Gray, who is averaging 15.6 points, plus generational center Tina Charles, the Dream have simply had a disappointing season. Atlanta has a lot of talent but wasn\u2019t able to meet expectations this year with a 12-25 record. Additionally, the Dream don\u2019t have enough playoff experience, which is something that the Liberty have a lot of. This will be New York\u2019s fourth-straight playoff appearance. The Liberty have unfinished business after losing to the Las Vegas Aces last year and finished first in the league this year with a 32-8 record. They have an entirely healthy roster featuring championship-caliber players. The heartbeat consists of forward Brianna Stewart and guard Sabrina Ionescu saying enough about the team\u2019s talent. This round should be good practice for the Liberty.\n\nLas Vegas Aces vs. Seattle Storm\nThis is probably the most competitive matchup on paper in the first round. The Aces are proving that they\u2019re a dynasty, and the Storm are proving that they\u2019re back to their dominating culture. Seattle made two offseason additions, acquiring guard Skylar Diggins Smith and forward Nneka Ogwumike, to bolster its playoff chances. The Storm also added Gabby Williams after her dominance in the Olympics. Despite the Storm\u2019s impressiveness, the Aces have superstar A\u2019ja Wilson. She\u2019s carried her team all season and has been the Aces\u2019 highest scorer in 27 out of 40 games this season, in addition to being their leading rebounder in 34 games. Her leadership has boiled down to averaging 26.9 points with 11.9 rebounds per game. Wilson aside, the Aces have a stacked roster with plenty of playoff experience and are chasing their third straight championship. They haven\u2019t changed their core, and it worked for them the past two seasons, so who\u2019s to say it won\u2019t work now? Both of these teams have championship-contending rosters, which is ultimately what it comes down to. Nonetheless, Las Vegas\u2019 playoff resume and the dominance of Wilson this season will allow the Aces to win the series 2-0.\n\nMinnesota Lynx vs. Phoenix Mercury\nThe Lynx and Mercury will likely have games that will come down to the last second. Notably, Phoenix has legendary guard Diana Taurasi and center Brittany Griner. They both have playoff experience and veteran leadership that\u2019ll be huge for the Mercury. The Mercury are similar to the Storm in that they made two big additions to their squad this year, adding guards Kahleah Copper and Natasha Cloud to the roster. Copper and Cloud have been vital in the Mercury\u2019s success this year, but I think that they\u2019re still no match for Minnesota\u2019s forward Napheesa Collier, who has been having a monster season. The Lynx have been the most consistent team all year. Collier and guard Kayla McBride will get the job done against the Mercury. Collier is averaging 20.4 points and 9.7 rebounds, while McBride is averaging 15 points and 3.2 assists. The Lynx are ready to be a dominant championship team again, like when they had Maya Moore from 2011-2017. The teams will play a competitive series, but the Lynx will win 2-1.\n\nConnecticut Sun vs. Indiana Fever\nThe Sun and Fever have had some heated games against each other this season. Indiana got off to a sluggish start but made a comeback in the second half of the season. Guards Caitlin Clark and Kelsey Mitchell are both averaging 19.2 points and Clark has tallied 8.4 assists per game. Additionally, forwards Aliyah Boston and Nalyssa Smith have been getting it done in the front court for the Fever. The Fever are no match for Sun forwards Dewanna Bonner, Brianna Jones and Alyssa Thomas, who have all been averaging over 10 points and five rebounds. Connecticut guard Dijonai Carrington has had her breakout year by proving that she\u2019s a defensive lock and a versatile scorer. The Sun\u2019s biggest help during the second half of the season has been guard Marina Mabrey, who is averaging 14.9 points from coming off the bench. The Sun haven\u2019t lost a game to the Fever all year, and they will continue that streak with a 2-0 series win over the Fever.\n\nLooking way ahead to the championship series, I\u2019m calling it now that it\u2019ll be the Aces and Lynx, with the underdog Lynx winning in five.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/09/24/kim-knows-fantasy-recap-and-advice-for-week-4/", "response": "```\nKim Knows: Fantasy recap and advice for Week 4\n\nPlayers you should be trading for and away ahead of Week 4 and how injuries are making the waiver wire a necessity.\n\nBy Matt Kim September 24, 2024 at 1:27 am PDT\n\nBy now, most fantasy football managers have a general idea of how good their team is. For example, if you\u2019re a Mark Andrews owner like myself, it may be time to panic, as he posted zero points with just one target on Sunday. This is also a crucial time to trade, as frantic managers looking to improve their teams are prone to making mistakes. Making these exploitative trades will bolster your fantasy lineup in the long run and ensure that you\u2019ll compete for a playoff spot. Here are two moves you should be making ahead of Week 4.\n\nBuy: Josh Jacobs\n\nJosh Jacobs is among the few remaining workhorse running backs, as many teams have transitioned to running back committees. The then-Oakland Raiders selected Jacobs No. 24 overall in 2019 from Alabama and he quickly proved to be one of the most dynamic runners in the NFL. From 2019-2022, the former Crimson Tide tailback averaged 1,185 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns a year, including a monster 2022 season in which Jacobs rushed for over 1,600 yards and found the end zone 12 times. In 2023, however, Jacobs saw his numbers plummet, as he only rushed for 805 yards and six touchdowns on a measly 3.5 yards per carry. Jacobs also missed five games with various injuries, making his 2023 season one to forget.\n\nAt season\u2019s end, Jacobs opted to not re-sign with the Raiders and instead inked a four-year, $48-million deal with the Green Bay Packers, joining head coach Matt LaFleur and quarterback Jordan Love. Through three weeks of play, Jacobs hasn\u2019t caught the attention of many, as he\u2019s yet to score a touchdown and hasn\u2019t been involved in the receiving game. Many managers who have Jacobs are beginning to panic because of his sub-standard production, but there should be close to zero concern with his season-long outlook. The sixth-year running back has plenty of signs that he\u2019ll be great throughout the rest of the season, and coming off a tough matchup against the Titans in which he only recorded 5.4 fantasy points, this is a clear buy-low.\n\nIn the first two weeks, Jacobs posted 5.25 and 4.72 yards per carry respectively, showcasing his efficiency in an improved situation. Between the two contests, he also averaged 24 rushing attempts, many more than the inexperienced backfield of Emmanuel Wilson and rookie MarShawn Lloyd who\u2019s recovering from a hamstring injury. Jacobs also hasn\u2019t gotten any receiving work this season, something head coach Matt LaFleur almost always implements into his offensive attack. LaFleur\u2019s former star running back Aaron Jones was a great example of this, as in seasons in which he played at least 14 games, he never received any less than 63 targets. A trend that certainly won\u2019t continue is his three-game touchdown drought, as the offense that is expecting Jordan Love to return soon will give Jacobs plenty of red-zone opportunities. Managers who are looking to upgrade at running back should target Jacobs as it\u2019s only a matter of time before positive regression in the receiving and touchdown department makes him a definite RB1.\n\nSell: Rachaad White\n\nIn full PPR leagues, running backs who command a lot of targets should be highly sought after. In Rachaad White\u2019s case, he has been one of the best pass-catching backs in the NFL, but his efficiency on the ground is a cause for concern. In 2023, White finished with over 1,500 all-purpose yards, including 549 receiving yards. He also finished fourth in the NFL in targets and added nine total touchdowns. However, he benefited from an extremely friendly situation in which he finished second in the NFL in total touches, had little to no competition in the backfield and operated in a good offense. White\u2019s career yards per carry is only 3.6 and even with 272 rushing attempts, he was unable to crack 1,000 yards on the ground.\n\nIn addition to his inefficiencies, this season, third-round pick Bucky Irving has started to chip into his workload. He\u2019s already proven to be a much more efficient runner, as in a small sample size, he\u2019s rushed 25 times for 154 yards, good for 6.2 yards per carry. Head coach Todd Bowles will only give Irving increased chances if White continues to struggle and the only appealing factor he\u2019ll have for fantasy is his limited receiving work. The volume is no longer there for White, as the competition in the Bucs\u2019 backfield will only see him lose snaps over time. White is still a mid-tier RB2 in my book, but it will be virtually impossible for him to replicate his 2023 season. With Chris Godwin re-emerging in Tampa Bay\u2019s offense out of the slot, that will only further limit White\u2019s ceiling, and I highly advise any Rachaad White owner to sell based on name value.\n\nWhile trades are important to improve a fantasy football roster, being active on the waivers may be what makes or breaks your season. The Waiver Wire 2023 saw a plethora of waiver wire gems, including offensive rookie of the year C.J. Stroud, star rookie wideout Puka Nacua, running back Kyren Williams and others that contributed big points for managers that believed in them. This season has already seen big names hit the injured reserve, and it\u2019s important that you pick up whoever\u2019s behind them on the depth chart.\n\nFor example, Christian McCaffrey\u2014who has cemented himself as the best running back in the NFL\u2014went down with Achilles tendonitis and won\u2019t return until at least Week 6. Jordan Mason was next up on the depth chart and he\u2019s delivered in a big way for head coach Kyle Shanahan. Through three games as the starter, he\u2019s eclipsed 100 rushing yards twice, scored two touchdowns and has averaged 4.8 yards per carry.\n\nI\u2019m not advising managers to fill their bench with backups as it\u2019s unlikely that most of them will see significant action in their current situations. However, if you have a star player with an extensive injury history or see their talent fading, then picking up their \u201chandcuff\u201d before an injury will save you plenty of FAAB (free agent acquisition budget), or having to trade for them. Prime historical examples would be the aforementioned Williams and Devon Achane, two running backs who were behind the starters on the depth chart to begin the year, but with injuries and lackluster play, they pounced on their opportunities and took over the starting job.\n\nThis should only be done in deeper leagues as you shouldn\u2019t be sacrificing startable depth for a \u201cwhat if\u201d player. However, this season there are a couple of must-have handcuffs that will win you your league if they get their chance. You should also only be picking up handcuffs where they have an opportunity to flourish in a good offense. Williams and Achane were both a part of fantasy-friendly offenses, giving them valuable volume and touchdown opportunities. Managers shouldn\u2019t be looking at backup running backs and wide receivers on teams like the Panthers and Giants, as their upside is capped and won\u2019t be worth the roster spot, even if they get an expanded role with their teams.\n\nThere is one running back this season in particular that I see has the best chance of succeeding if given the opportunity and that\u2019s Cardinals running back Trey Benson. Benson was the second running back taken off the board in the 2024 NFL Draft, as Arizona selected him in the third round to back up James Conner. Conner has long been riddled with injuries and as he approaches his later years with a workhorse role, stashing Benson could be valuable if he\u2019s available. The Cardinals are led by quarterback Kyler Murray and have a solid offense. Should Benson get an opportunity with Conner sidelined, he would immediately be a mid- to high-end RB2. Any James Conner owner should be doing anything in their power to acquire Benson. This can also work against them if they don\u2019t, as other managers can charge a premium price given the circumstances and Conner\u2019s injury history.\n\nWhat separates a good manager from a bad one is being proactive, as missing out on the next bright star might be the difference between the playoffs and the toilet bowl.\n```"}

But not every public figure has been so forthcoming. The Guardian published an interview with rising pop superstar Chappell Roan on Friday in which she revealed she was not planning to endorse anyone for the upcoming presidential election. Roan stated there are, quote, \u201cproblems on both sides.\u201d\n\nThe singer\u2019s comment fueled controversy online, where some social media users accused Roan of resorting to false equivalence, among other things. Roan has previously taken a stand against some of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s policies; she rejected an invitation to perform at the White House, citing issues such as the ongoing conflict in Gaza and transgender rights.\n\nStudents on campus Monday expressed a range of feelings about Roan\u2019s statement. \u201dI feel like maybe you should separate the worlds of like, celebrities and politics. I feel like that\u2019s important\u201d said Malet Massey, a first-year biomedical engineering student. Politics and celebrities have never mixed well together. Some, like Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish, have vocally discussed their endorsements for Democratic presidential nominee Harris. According to NPR, Swift\u2019s singular Instagram post (which so far has 11 million likes) drove 35,000 new voters to register from her link alone.\n\nRoan\u2019s reluctance to endorse a candidate surprised some. Keilani Kozen, a sophomore studying computer science and business administration said, \u201cI feel like it makes more sense for someone like Chappell Roan to be more public about it, especially because Taylor Swift has been in the public eye for a really long time, and has had a large presence. But yeah ... I don\u2019t think I saw that one coming either.\u201d Angie Ho, a first year politics, philosophy and economics major, was similarly surprised given Roan\u2019s general outspokenness. \u201cChappell Roan is on the very liberal side of things, so I\u2019m pretty surprised that she didn\u2019t endorse,\u201d Ho said, \u201cbut at the same time, I feel like her Chappell Roan thing is like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m different from everyone else,\u2019 so non-endorsement actually does fit with her character.\u201d\n\nTo Dima Qaysi, a freshman studying astronomical engineering, Roan not picking a candidate made sense. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great stance to have, because it shows, like, it\u2019s an informed decision,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I think instead of like picking a side...(it\u2019s) knowing that both sides are wrong and they have issues, and sort of like acknowledging those issues.\u2019 There\u2019s just a little over a month until voters case their ballots in the Nov. 5 election.\n```"}

Each week, this column will highlight my top three contenders for the Heisman Trophy, as well as an extra, Heisman-related topic. At the end of the year, we\u2019ll compare each edition\u2019s results with who actually wins to see how accurate I was.\n\nThis week\u2019s top three\n\nTravis Hunter, Colorado, WR/CB\nThe Swiss army knife, also known as Travis Hunter, jumps off the page as someone who has made a huge impact under Coach Prime for the Colorado Buffaloes. Hunter has done amazing things this season, but the forced fumble that secured Colorado\u2019s win over Baylor instantly put him at the top of this list. With Colorado scoring on their first possession in overtime, it was up to the Buffaloes defense to hold it down. Baylor pushed the ball to Colorado\u2019s two-yard line, then handed the ball off to running back Dominic Richardson for what could have been the game-tying touchdown. Instead, Hunter put his shoulder straight into the ball, jarring it loose and into the back of the endzone.\n\nAlong with being one of the most feared corners in the league, Hunter is also consistently the top receiver for not only the Buffaloes, but one of the best in all of college football. In each game this season, he has amassed 100-plus yards, totalling 472 yards on 37 receptions. Those stats place him at sixth place in receiving yards and fourth in receptions. His five touchdowns are also good for tied-fourth in FBS football.\n\nThe Iron Man has played 532 snaps this season so far, and some wonder if it is possible to keep up. It\u2019s certainly early in the process, but at this point, the only way that Hunter is not the favorite to win the trophy is if the Buffaloes fail to win any games the rest of this season or if the lights become too bright and Hunter folds under the pressure.\n\nCam Ward, Miami (FL), QB\nMany people may disagree with not having the Hurricane\u2019s Cam Ward at the top of this list, but against the teams that he has played, Ward has not done enough. This is not to say that he hasn\u2019t been a fantastic quarterback, but he\u2019s benefitted from playing three poor teams in Florida A&M, Ball State and South Florida. He did merely what was expected of him in those three games: against the Rattlers, he had 304 yards and three touchdowns on 26 pass attempts; against the Cardinals he threw for 346 yards with five touchdowns on 28 attempts; and against the Bulls he threw for 404 yards and three touchdowns on 34 attempts.\n\nAs great as he looked in those games, he will need to show that he can reproduce what he did in week one at Florida against a full ACC schedule. While the Florida Gators are having a year from hell so far, Ward did ball out in a week one thriller when Miami traveled to Gainesville to decimate the Gators 41-17. In said game, Ward threw for 385 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nSenior wide receiver Xavier Restrepo and Ward have been a dynamic duo, connecting for over 360 yards and five touchdowns. The two have helped Miami jump from an initial No. 19 ranking in the AP poll up to No. 7 this past week.\n\nLooking ahead, Ward needs to continue putting up video game-like numbers against every team he plays to be considered a top choice and the team cannot afford to drop any games. Although being undefeated is always a challenge, the Hurricanes have the schedule to do it. The only tough matchups will be a sneaky California Golden Bears team in Berkeley and No. 15 Louisville\u2014currently the only ranked team on Miami\u2019s schedule. Georgia Tech, who took down an admittedly overrated Florida State team, could also be a challenge for the Canes.\n\nNico Iamaleava, Tennessee, QB\nUnlike Ward, quarterback Nico Iamaleava will have multiple big games to prove he should win the trophy this season, as the Tennessee Volunteers schedule is loaded. They\u2019re coming off a huge away win over the Oklahoma Sooners and still have to play the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Georgia Bulldogs.\n\nThe first three weeks were a walk in the park for Iamaleava and the Volunteers, outscoring Chattanooga, NC State and Kent State by a total of 178 points. In each of these games, Iamaleava was subbed out early to give some playing time to Gaston Moore and Jake Marklinger, which slightly skews his statistics.\n\nHe did, however, show that he is a legitimate top-level quarterback this past week against the Sooners. In their 25-15 victory, he threw for 194 yards and one touchdown. Those numbers don\u2019t jump off the page, but as a redshirt freshman in his first big away game, his solid performance helped secure a crucial win.\n\nFor Iamaleava to carry the trophy, he will need to lead the Volunteers to no more than three losses and make sure that his statistics rise against the Tide and Bulldogs. The SEC is undeniably one of the top two conferences in football, which gives Iamaleava plenty of opportunities to show off his talents.\n\nAn honorable mention\nJaxson Dart, Ole Miss, QB\nWhen I talked earlier about Ward not putting up the numbers he needed against bad teams, I was comparing him to Jaxson Dart. While head coach Lane Kiffin has given some time to backup Austin Simmons, Dart still averages 388.5 yards per game and three passing touchdowns. In his last game, against Furman, he threw for 418 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nNow, paying 3.7 million dollars, according to Sports Illustrated, to build a weak non-conference schedule should not necessarily win Dart the Heisman. However, their upcoming conference schedule certainly might. Ole Miss will have their first big challenge against No. 14 LSU in Tiger Stadium, followed by a tough game against the Sooners. The biggest game for Dart will be against Georgia to see how he competes against the cream of the crop.\n\nEven if he continues at 75% of the passing yards he is currently throwing, Dart will be one of the finalists on the stage.\n```"}

The official name for this asteroid is 2024 P-T-5. It will approach Earth beginning September 29 and remain in orbit around us, for almost two months. The rock is about 35 feet in diameter and will travel in a horseshoe path around Earth - but don\u2019t fret - this asteroid won\u2019t be a threat to your safety, scientists say 2024 P-T-5 is not on track to collide with Earth. After leaving Earth\u2019s orbit around November 25, the asteroid will return to its regular orbit around the sun, and is predicted to return to circle around us again. In about 31 years.\n\nUnfortunately this mini-moon will be too small and dim to be observed by the naked eye or amateur telescopes. Scientists, however, will be studying Earth\u2019s new celestial neighbor through their Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, a project that helped them predict 2024 P-T-5\u2032s upcoming activity in the first place. In order to be captured in Earth\u2019s orbit, asteroids must approach Earth at slow speeds and close range. To be classified as a mini moon, a body must make a full orbit around Earth which means 2024 P-T-5 with it\u2019s horseshoe orbit will technically not qualify. However scientists note the object is still among the largest objects ever captured by Earth\u2019s gravity. The first recorded mini-moon was in 1991, and just two years ago was the last visit from a mini-moon in Earth\u2019s orbit. This has been an active time for the solar system, as Los Angeles witnessed a harvest supermoon and a partial lunar eclipse just last week!

(Photo by JASON GOODE)\n\nBy Ian Maile and Antonia Brooks\nSeptember 23, 2024 at 6:43 pm PDT\n\nNo matter what he does, Trump seems to be making the rounds on the news. Just last Friday, he shared on Sharyl Attkinson\u2019s TV political show Full Measure, that if he loses this election he won\u2019t run again in 2028. \u201cTo me, it was something he hasn\u2019t said before. So in that sense, it was kind of a big deal. \" Kambiz Akhavan is Executive Director of the USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future. He thinks he\u2019s noticing some new ideas from the former President. \u201cHe has never really alluded to losing or life post presidential campaign, so and he sort of did about a week ago in a statement that he made at a gathering of Jewish Republicans, where he said that it basically could be their fault if he\u2019s not reelected.\u201d\n\nAnnenberg Professor Steve Caplan who teaches politics and marketing thinks Trump could be trying to rally his supporters. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the political world long enough to make educated guesses. I would think for his base, his base of voters, it would perhaps coalesce them around him more tightly.\u201d Dornsife\u2019s Akhavan doubts that this new strategy will change voter\u2019s opinion of the former president. \u201cPeople have something called confirmation bias, and that means what they hear needs to comport with what they already believe for someone who thinks Trump is an exaggerating liar, and he\u2019ll say that he won\u2019t run again, but he probably will. And for the other voters, they\u2019ll think President Trump is our champion.\u201d\n\nWhat Annenberg instructor Steve Caplan finds particularly striking about Trump\u2019s statement about not running again if he loses this year was the way he said it\u2014his tone. \u201cTypically, when asked about his future plans, Trump will vociferously push back, talk about rigged elections and how he had already won and again, not criticisms, but that is his style, and for him to answer that question in a almost muted way for me, was interesting.\u201d Caplan is still uncertain if Trump\u2019s statement will make much of a difference in the current election and that only time will tell. What we do know is that early voting has already begun including in crucial battleground states. And with just 42 days left until election day, Former President Trump will find out soon what his 2028 plans will look like.\n```"}

Gov Gavin Newsom signs plastic bag ban\n\nBy Gian Marco Vel\u00e1squez September 23, 2024 at 6:31 pm PDT\n\nCalifornia already has a law that requires plastic bags at grocery stores to be reusable. Critics say they often don\u2019t get reused, and that we\u2019re still throwing far too much plastic into the landfills. This new bill requires plastic bags to consist of at least 50% post-consumer recycled materials - like plastic - for the same 10-cent fee we have now. Meaning if we\u2019re going to use all this plastic, it should will be recycled plastic.\n\nThe initial ban on plastic bags was passed by the state legislature in 2014, and it was later affirmed in a referendum by voters in 2016. The intent of this new measure, signed into law Sunday by Gov. Gavin Newsom, is to further cut down, eventually banning all plastic shopping bags by 2026.\n\nOn Monday, USC students weighed in on the paper-plastic debate. Political Science Michelle Chavez said she hopes the new law will make more students aware of the abundance of plastic trash we create. \u201cMore people would start to use more eco-friendly kinds of bags,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the University Village Target, journalism senior Natalia Osuna was shopping for groceries. She said her habits might not change all that much, since she already tries to be sustainable. \u201cI try to take a couple of reusable bags, maybe like a cooler, you know, for cold stuff,\u201d Osuna said. \u201cSo I try to be more mindful about that. When I do get single use plastic bags, my roommates and I try to save them all up, and eventually, gradually, start using them as either trash bags or reuse them for something else, carrying something.\u201d\n\nPsychology student Jeanine Bautista, a junior, admitted that sometimes, she does the unspeakable. \u201cI occasionally will use plastic bags,\u201d Bautista said sheepishly. But she\u2019s in favor of being more eco-conscious. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good initiative,\u201d Bautista said. \u201cAnd, like, making college students just become more accountable of their waste. And so that would encourage students to always carry a reusable bag with them, or to think ahead when they\u2019re grocery shopping and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nThe state of California currently produces more plastic bag waste than ever before. Some shoppers have been transitioning to sustainable bags that can help mitigate an excess of plastic waste. Whether or not the new law helps lessen Californians\u2019 use of plastic remains to be seen. But Natalia Osuna, an optimist, says the state government is on the right track by making the law about single use plastic grocery bags a little tougher. \u201cI hope it has a better impact, even though I don\u2019t know what might happen or what the effects long term will be,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say it\u2019s really important for the government to make intentional efforts with their advertising of this new policy, of the new bill.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, the way to use the least plastic when shopping is still to bring your own bag.\n```"}

The exhibit celebrates the featured artists\u2019 reimagination of the future through multimedia pieces. PST ART by Getty collaborated with USC ONE Archives at the USC Library and the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art at the USC Fisher Museum of Art to host a reception for PST\u2019s first academic symposium, \u201cSci-fi, magick, Queer L.A.: Sexual Science and the Imagi-nation.\u201d\n\nDanielle Summer, assistant curator at the Fisher Museum, opened the event by introducing the group of about 50 attendees to the history of the Fisher Museum as the longest-standing museum in L.A. focused solely on art. She highlighted the exhibit\u2019s ability to \u201ccatalyze campus community communications through art.\u201d\n\nSandra Jackson-Dumont, founder and CEO of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, said the show is the product of years spent listening to colleagues and communities. Jackson-Dumont said that the collaborative event is \u201cencouraging each other to be curious about the \u2018what if\u2019 question.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are motivated and changed by each other,\u201d she said.\n\nPilar Tompkins Rivas, chief curator and deputy director of curatorial and collections for the Lucas Museum, said she sees this comprehensive, historical exhibit as a \u201ccatalyst for what we want to do as an institution.\u201d Rivas said she believes this is the \u201cstart of conversations that we will continue to have in years to come\u201d about underdeveloped and underserved topics and art forms.\n\n\u201cWith PST we shift and shape discourse,\u201d Rivas said.\n\nLexi Bard Johnson, curator for ONE Archives and Quetzal Ar\u00e9valo, brought attendees in to the Fisher Museum for a guided tour.

The map is designed to help viewers make the connections between the converging spheres. Most of the content comes from the 1930s, 40s and 50s, but spans up until the 70s.\n\nJohnson and Ar\u00e9valo first led viewers through the sci-fi room, with emerald green walls and seafoam text. At the center of the room there are two costumes, which are replicas of the first documented cosplay \u2014 the practice of dressing up as a character from a media source, usually television or video games \u2014 by Forrest J. Ackerman and Myrtle Douglas. Ar\u00e9valo said this display \u201chonors the legacy of cosplay for people to explore with identity and gender.\u201d\n\nReplica cosplay outfits serve as the centerpiece of the sci-fi room. (Photo by Alex Evans)\n\nJohnson said that the room represented the sci-fi audience and Queer population as \u201ctwo sides of the same coin.\u201d Each artist and piece provides a \u201ctiny dive and tiny vignette into how the communities were so enmeshed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe exhibit explores early alternative thought hubs, like the L.A. Science Fantasy Society (LASFS). Next, viewers move to the \u201cmagick\u201d room \u2014 spelled as such to indicate a difference from \u201cmagic\u201d \u2014 themed with cardinal red and golden text. Johnson describes magick as a rejection of the idea that science is rational and magic is fictional. To those practicing magick and engaged with sci-fi, it is real, according to Johnson.\n\nOne inspiration Johnson credited for providing magick with substance was Thelema, a religion by occultist Aleister Crowley focused on how to \u201cdo what thou wilt,\u201d or doing what you like as a form of self-discovery. Three watercolor tarot paintings, painted by Frieda Harris in collaboration with Crowley, are on display in the United States for the first time after being transferred from London.\n\nIn the last two rooms of the exhibit, viewers walk through a mock dressing room and then into a final white-walled room with a replica temple backdrop. Johnson and Ar\u00e9valo discussed a final connection between the Queer, sci-fi and magick communities through the L.A. Scottish Rite Freemasonry. The masonry produced shows with men dressed as women, included in the exhibit \u201cas a space for people to play around with things different than what society accepts.\u201d\n\nThe backdrop imagery in this final room is a massive blue universe with an orange light orb open in the middle. Stairs covered by a red carpet descend into the orb. The center reads \u201cspes mea in duo est\u201d in glitter text, meaning \u201cmy hope is in god.\u201d Johnson, who concludes with the imagery as a callback to L.A. culture, said this is an \u201cexhibition about how you see things...things that become queer depending on who does the collecting.\u201d\n\nThe exhibit lasts through Nov. 23. In addition, on Oct. 3, the Fisher Museum is hosting \u201cRadical Imagination, Queer Stories through Sci-Fi Storytelling,\u201d an event with sci-fi experts. On Oct. 29, USC Visions and Voices will collaborate with the exhibit to put on \u201cdemonic drag performances\u201d paired with a costume contest. On Nov. 17, Karen Maness will be giving a talk on visual arts and the production of the replica temple design.\n```"}

NASA-funded scientists identified the asteroid named 2024 PT5, which was discovered on August 7 during routine monitoring by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in South Africa. Because of its size, the asteroid will not be visible to the naked eye. Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and Ra\u00fal de la Fuente Marcos, researchers at Spain\u2019s Universidad Complutense de Madrid who made the discovery, believe that the asteroid is \u201ctoo small and dim for typical amateur telescopes and binoculars.\u201d Instead, professional-grade telescopes with at least 30 inches in diameter are needed to see the object, Carlos de la Fuente Marcos said in an interview with Space.com.\n\nWhile 2024 PT5 will be traveling along its usual path around the sun, it is expected to temporarily enter a \u201chorseshoe\u201d orbit around Earth for eight weeks. According to the study in \u201cResearch Notes of the American Astronomical Society\u201d, this \u201chorseshoe\u201d orbit means that it will not make a full rotation around the Earth. Despite their name, mini-moons aren\u2019t actually classified as moons. Moons, according to NASA are \u201cnaturally-formed bodies that orbit planets\u201d permanently. While mini-moons do orbit a planet, they don\u2019t always orbit for a long period of time. 2024 PT5 will only be orbiting for 57 days, leading some scientists to debate whether it can be called a mini-moon at all.\n\n\u201cI will call those gravitationally captured asteroid[s], because that\u2019s really what they are. They\u2019re not moon[s],\u201d Franck Marchis, the senior planetary astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first occurrence of such a controversial cosmic visitor. According to the study, in 2020, astronomers observed another mini-moon, 2020 CD3, which orbited Earth for over a year. Scientists anticipate that 2024 PT5 will return to Earth\u2019s gravitational influence in 2055, predicting that it may not be a one-time event. Originating from the Arjuna asteroid belt, located approximately 93 million miles away, 2024 PT5 is set to join the moon in its orbit next week, providing a fascinating opportunity for scientists to study this transient celestial object.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in an age [where] we\u2019re making discoveries almost on a daily basis,\u201d Vah\u00e9 Perooomian, a professor of physics and astronomy at USC said. \u201cIf all of these events together increase our interest in astronomy and the sciences, I think that\u2019s a really positive step for me.\u201d\n\nUSC students can attempt to view 2024 PT5 at Griffith Park\u2019s free public star parties taking place on Oct. 12 and Nov. 12 from 2-9 p.m.\n```"}

In the filing, Bush\u2019s attorneys claim all three organizations received the benefits from television contracts, merchandise sales and media rights linked to the Heisman winner\u2019s football career, according to CBS Sports. The suit alleges Bush was not compensated for these revenue streams resulting from his \u201csignificant popularity\u201d and \u201cprominence,\u201d during his time with the Trojans, according to ESPN.\n\n\u201cThis case is not just about seeking justice for Reggie Bush,\u201d Evan Selik, a lawyer representing Bush, said in a statement to CBS Sports. \u201cIt\u2019s about setting a precedent for the fair treatment of all college athletes. Our goal is to rectify this injustice and pave the way for a system where athletes are rightfully recognized, compensated and treated fairly for their contributions.\u201d\n\nDuring Bush\u2019s college career, the NCAA prohibited college athletes from profiting from their name, image and likeness. However, the organization updated its policy in 2021 to allow students to receive compensation for their NIL following a Supreme Court case that ruled that limiting education-related compensation violated the Sherman Act.\n\nBush played for USC from 2003 to 2005, winning two national titles and the Heisman Trophy. However, Bush forfeited his Heisman and his collegiate records were vacated in 2010 after an NCAA investigation found the running back received financial benefits during his college football career that were against NCAA rules at the time. Following the investigation, the NCAA also stripped USC of its 2004 national title and 14 victories from games that Bush played in, among other sanctions.\n\nThe Heisman Trust returned Bush\u2019s Heisman Trophy earlier this year, but the NCAA said it will not restore Bush\u2019s records. Following his college career, Bush played 11 years in the NFL, winning the Super Bowl with the New Orleans Saints in 2010.\n\nBush is involved in a separate ongoing defamation lawsuit against the NCAA after a spokesperson for the organization said it would not consider restoring Bush\u2019s college records due to his involvement in a \u201cpay-for-play\u201d arrangement while at USC. In a filing against the NCAA, Bush\u2019s legal team said the organization\u2019s claim was \u201ccompletely false and highly offensive,\u201d and damaging to the former Trojan\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest in a series of high-profile legal disputes concerning NIL rights. The NCAA voted in May to approve a settlement for three antitrust class action lawsuits to provide more than $2.7 billion in back pay to college athletes who were unable to profit from their NIL rights prior to 2021.\n\nBush\u2019s representatives and USC did not respond to requests for comment.\n```"}

All of us were trying to get tickets to keshi\u2019s upcoming Hell/Heaven tour. Vietnamese American singer-songwriter Casey Luong \u2014 more commonly known by his moniker, keshi \u2014 was a staple in our playlists. Now, coming off the success of a debut album with 3.1 billion streams and mainstream success, expectations were high with keshi\u2019s sophomore album, \u201cRequiem.\u201d Safe to say, he blew the expectations out of the water.\n\n\u201cRequiem\u201d is a journey of hubris, loss and longing. At the same time, it is keshi\u2019s rebirth. \u201cRequiem\u201d brings entirely new and refreshing sounds to the singer-songwriter\u2019s discography. It\u2019s imaginative and experimental, but at the same time, it\u2019s unabashedly keshi. While it\u2019s still characterized by his iconic falsetto and dreamy vocals, the instrumentals have been carefully polished with astounding strings and percussion into a complete sophomore album.\n\nAt a certain point as a long-time listener, keshi\u2019s R&B tracks with lo-fi beats began to feel repetitive. His debut album, \u201cGABRIEL,\u201d showed signs of promise as he explored ballads and refined his R&B sound. However, he ultimately didn\u2019t venture too far out of his comfort zone. Nonetheless, keshi is just at the beginning of his career and has time to traverse the world of music. For now, \u201cRequiem\u201d gives us a look into how keshi has polished and played around with his sound.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of every song on the new album:\n\n\u201cAMEN\u201d Ly\u2019s Rating: 8/10\nThe album starts off with keshi\u2019s soft vocals before he abruptly transitions into a tone akin to arrogance. The title of \u201cAmen\u201d is almost mocking as he sings, \u201cI don\u2019t pray to God that\u2019s a weakness / I\u2019ve been playing God in arenas.\u201d While \u201cAmen\u201d is barely a minute long, he makes a clear statement for his long-time fans as he chants \u201cI want more\u201d to end the song: this album is going to be different \u2014 8/10.\n\n\u201cSAY\u201d Ly\u2019s Rating: 7/10\nThe transition from \u201cAmen\u201d to \u201cSay\u201d is rather jarring as we go from an angelic, yet chaotic beat to a groovier sound. Lyrically, it\u2019s reminiscent of his older, more sultry songs, but this time, with a happier and tamer twist. However, the instrumental bares into new territory for keshi with a more upbeat, pop sound that\u2019s reminiscent of \u201890s Japanese city-pop. While it feels rather distant from the rest of the album, I quite enjoy the song regardless; put simply, it\u2019s fun. Just like keshi hoped for, this song is definitely one to dance to \u2014 7/10.\n\n\u201cNIGHT\u201d Ly\u2019s Rating: 7.5/10\nThere is another sharp transition from \u201cSay\u201d into \u201cNight\u201d which opens with an introduction that makes you feel like you\u2019re in a thriller. The sound is a bone-chilling sting chord that makes you feel like you\u2019re at the climax of a jump-scare before an abrupt \u201crequiem\u201d pulls you out of the scene, and into the depths of keshi\u2019s iconic falsetto. Ironically enough, the lyrics maintain a similar sentiment: \u201cEvery move I make I feel them watching me / Try to run away but I can\u2019t seem to make a sound,\u201d keshi sings. The startling SFX follows keshi throughout, instilling a sense of urgency throughout while simultaneously contrasting with the R&B elements of the song. \u201cNight\u201d is one of keshi\u2019s more experimental songs; it\u2019s Halloween-y and exploratory in all the right ways \u2014 7.5/10.\n\n\u201cSOFT SPOT\u201d Ly\u2019s Rating: 8.5/10\nImagine this: falling leaves, a chilly breeze, old hoodies and your local hometown band. This is what \u201cSoft Spot\u201d sounds like. Out of all the songs in the album, \u201cSoft Spot\u201d holds just that in my heart. It\u2019s romantic, dreamy and groovy \u2014 the elements for the perfect autumn-time-walking song. The electric guitar strumming throughout ties the song together into a cute little love song that feels extremely nostalgic \u2014 8.5/10.\n\n\u201cLIKE THAT\u201d Ly\u2019s Rating: 5.5/10\n\u201cLike That\u201d is most similar to what we\u2019ve previously seen from keshi: an R&B song with lo-fi beats and soft vocals. However, compared to \u201cGABRIEL\u201d and previous releases, \u201cLike That\u201d sounds a lot more polished. The second half of the song contains rather enjoyable moments where keshi overlaps lines with himself, reminiscent of 2000s R&B. Not bad, but frankly nothing to write home about \u2014 5.5/10.\n\n\u201cTEXAS\u201d Ly\u2019s Rating: 8/10\nHave I ever been to Texas? No. Does this song make me dream of chasing trains and the Texas heat? Well, yeah. \u201cTexas\u201d is a song full of yearning and nostalgia. keshi hits close to home as he sings about the mental dilemma between chasing after your dreams or staying comfortable with what you know. \u201cWhen I ran from nothing, and I wanted everything ... Don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going / But I think I gotta leave / Oh, take me home,\u201d keshi sings. In typical keshi fashion, we see the presence of lo-fi beats. However, the guitar, piano and harmonica adds a unique and nice touch to \u201cTexas\u201d that elevates the song For those suffering a quarter life crisis as they navigate their 20s, listen to \u201cTexas.\u201d Not sure if it will make you feel any better, but you\u2019ll relate \u2014 8/10.\n\n\u201cDREAM\u201d Ly\u2019s Rating: 8/10\nOne thing that keshi is particularly skilled at is creating toxic narratives for the dreamiest songs. Instrumentally, \u201cDream\u201d is like floating on clouds. It\u2019s a slower, acoustic song with a beautifully slow guitar strum and progressive piano melody. However, lyrically, \u201cDream\u201d is a nightmare scenario: the person you love is thinking about someone else. \u201cShe\u2019s a dream come true / But I have nightmares it should\u2019ve been you,\u201d keshi sings. As the song nears the end, keshi\u2019s soft vocals speed up and heighten in volume, thus, creating a sense of urgency within the listener. Beautifully tragic and full of guilty yearning; you\u2019ve done it again, keshi \u2014 8/10.\n\n\u201cWAR\u201d Ly\u2019s Rating: 9/10\nFor some reason, keshi is always fighting demons. \u201cWar\u201d is no different as he battles to hold onto a failing relationship. \u201cBuilt walls, drawn lines / Look at what we\u2019ve come to lately / Broke glass, spilled wine / Caught up in the crossfire, baby,\u201d keshi sings. While his love is weak, \u201cWar\u201d is one of the strongest songs on the album. From the tasteful staggering drum beat to the heavenly backing vocals and iconic falsetto, this song is hypnotizing in every way \u2014 9/10.\n\n\u201cBODIES\u201d Ly\u2019s Rating: 7.5/10\nLike in life, you can\u2019t have war without any bodies \u2014 whether they\u2019re fighting for you or strewn onto the ground. keshi dips his toes into the world of pop-rock through \u201cBodies,\u201d a song that directly parallels \u201cWar.\u201d In \u201cWar\u201d keshi sings, \u201cBut you always stay / Just for old time\u2019s sake.\u201d In \u201cBodies,\u201d he responds, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay you know / If it\u2019s all a waste of time.\u201d \u201cWar\u201d was the fight for the relationship whereas \u201cBodies\u201d is heartbreak thereafter. It\u2019s a simple premise that keshi executed fairly well. It isn\u2019t overtly corny and the track is well produced \u2014 7.5/10.\n\n\u201cREQUIEM\u201d Ly\u2019s Rating: 8/10\nThe closest way I can describe loss is like feeling the world closing in on you while your body goes numb in shock. It\u2019s chaotic, messy and overall heartbreaking. However, in \u201cRequiem,\u201d keshi packages the feelings of loss into a beautiful, gentle ballad full of heavenly piano melodies and heart-wrenching lyrics. Dedicated to his late friend, \u201cRequiem\u201d has a simple premise that explains the complex emotions of grief and loss very well. \u201cOh, it\u2019s not the same / I miss you everyday / Still some things I wish I told ya\u2019,\u201d keshi sings. The song ends with an unfinished piano melody where the final chord is never played followed by a few seconds of silence. Goodbyes are never easy, and grief is even harder to navigate, but keshi manages to beautifully articulate loss into graceful melodies and gentle lyrics \u2014 8/10.\n\n\u201cEUPHORIA\u201d Ly\u2019s Rating: 6.5/10\n\u201cEuphoria\u201d is a song that\u2019s unabashedly loud about yearning for someone who might not be too good for you. \u201cShe\u2019s toxic for the thrill of it / Bad news, but I\u2019m into it, she\u2019s all mine,\u201d keshi sings. keshi is loud as he repeatedly sings the word \u201ceuphoria\u201d while the guitars, piano and drums blare in the background during the chorus. It\u2019s desperate and messy \u2014 just like how a toxic relationship is. The lyrics feel a bit repetitive by the second chorus, however the instrumentals keep the song afloat. With an insane guitar solo near the end, most of my complaints are blown out of the water \u2014 6.5/10.\n\n\u201cJUST TO DIE\u201d Ly\u2019s Rating: 8/10\n\u201cJust To Die\u201d feels like a reflection of the grief experienced in \u201cRequiem.\u201d keshi is retrospective as he sings on the harsh realities of life and is borderline nihilistic. \u201cYou learn if you can\u2019t do it twice / You do what you can / When you\u2019re born into life just to die, oh,\u201d keshi sings. It almost sounds as if he\u2019s completely given up until the end where he chants, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna die.\u201d His shaken-up voice is accompanied by velvety strings in the instrumental. The song is heartbreakingly melancholic, but there\u2019s a sense of perseverance at the end that brings listeners hope \u2014 8/10.\n\n\u201cID\u201d Ly\u2019s Rating: 9.5/10\nThe album ends with \u201cID\u201d \u2014 an outro that absolutely defied all my expectations. The listener is first greeted with an angelic melody reminiscent of church music. There\u2019s a small build up before the beat changes into a hype song full of hubris and ego. The final verse directly parallels his intro with its entirety being the lyrics of \u201cAmen.\u201d However, this time, he sings with a tone of desperation, completely void of his previous arrogance. \u201cID\u201d is a jumbled, purposeful mess of mixed emotions and abrupt changes, making it the perfect outro for keshi\u2019s sophomore album \u2014 9.5/10.\n\n\u201cRequiem\u201d is now streaming on all platforms.\n```"}

(AP/Kevin M. Cox)\n\nBy Joel Robles September 23, 2024 at 3:17 pm PDT\n\nAfter beating the miserable 36-120 Chicago White Sox in a three-game series, the Los Angeles Angels headed to Houston for a long, four-game road trip. Veteran spot starter Jose Suarez started in the first game and pulled a pretty serviceable outing. In five innings of work, Suarez did not allow a run and struck out five. It was a pleasant surprise for Angels fans, considering Suarez has put up a 6.08 ERA on the season.\n\nThe Halos scored quickly in the first inning via a solo homer by veteran Taylor Ward. On the season, Ward has 24 homers, 69 RBIs, and an OPS of .761. After that point, though, the Angels failed to rack up runs. The bullpen was strong up with only allowing one run until the eighth, until reliever Ryan Miller blew the game. Miller couldn\u2019t put the rock in the strike zone, walking four batters and allowing two earned runs.\n\nAnother reason they couldn\u2019t maintain their small lead was the three errors the Angels committed, contributing to the team\u2019s 3-1 loss. Yusei Kikuchi continued to impress for the Astros after completing six innings with nine strikeouts and only one earned run allowed. Kikuchi\u2019s ERA with the Astros has fallen to an impressive 3.00. That ranks Kikuchi among the MLB\u2019s top 10 pitchers in ERA.\n\nWith the Angels needing a rebound, the second game didn\u2019t differ much from the first. Former all-star Tyler Anderson had a night to forget. Anderson threw two and a half innings while allowing eight hits and three earned runs. In just that short period of time, Anderson threw 75 pitches. The offense was rumbling, though, as the team managed to score six runs in three innings. But that effort wasn\u2019t enough as the Astros also continued to pour it on. Houston went on their own run at bat and scored eight runs in three innings. By the seventh inning, the Halos were down three and just couldn\u2019t climb out of that hole, losing by a final score of 9-7.\n\nThird baseman Eric Wagaman and catcher Matt Thaiss both had solid games as they both had two RBIs and multiple hits. The third game further compounded the Halos\u2019 misery. The Angels allowed 20 hits and seven Astros had a multi-hit game. Reid Detmers continued to struggle on the mound. Despite only pitching two innings, Detmers gave up seven earned runs, as well as seven hits and three walks.\n\nIt\u2019s been back-to-back games in which Detmers has allowed several runs and in total has allowed 14 in seven innings. In June, Detmers was optioned to Triple-A after having a 6.00 ERA. These statistical measures make it seem like Detmers\u2019 season has been a total disaster, but he has always been a streaky pitcher. As in his first four starts of this season Detmers posted a 1.19 ERA, so the Angels know he has strong performances in him. They\u2019ll hope Detmers can find his groove soon or for next season.\n\nAstros All-Star batters Yordan Alvarez and Kyle Tucker both had terrific performances, going for four hits each in this blowout 10-4 win. Despite losing the first three games and the series, the Angels managed to take one away from Houston at the last opportunity. Promising rookie Zach Neto was the hero of the game as Neto homered twice and batted in six runs, including a clutch hit in the ninth.\n\nHeading into the top of that inning the Halos were down 6-5 with closer Josh Hader coming in to secure the win for Houston. Angels catcher Logan O\u2019Hoppe walked in the team\u2019s first at-bat, outfielder Kevin Pillar singled and first baseman Nolan Schanuel singled to load the bases with no outs. Then, Hader walked Ward to tie the game. Finally, Neto came up to the plate and applied the finishing touch with some insurance runs for the Halos.\n\nThe Astros weren\u2019t ready to go down without a fight, scoring two runs in the bottom of the ninth, but came up short by one run to lose 9-8. The Angels earned their 63rd win of the season in Houston to go along with their 93 losses, and are still last in the AL West by four games. With this loss, it\u2019s hard to believe the Astros will catch up to the Guardians and Yankees for a better playoff seeding. They\u2019ll likely finish third in the American League and won\u2019t have the luxury of home field advantage throughout the playoffs.\n\nAt this point of the season the Angels are just looking for some sort of spark to help them propel them into the 2025 season. The Angels next head to Chicago, looking to give the White Sox the honor of losing the most games ever in a single season.\n```"}

The conversation, held in Lewis Hall on campus, was a part of the Sol Price School of Public Policy\u2019s monthly lecture series, \u201cBookMarked: Conversations about Civic Leadership.\u201d\n\nLowande, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, specializes in the study of presidential power and policy implementation. \u201cWe tend to see executive orders and other kinds of executive actions have very little direct effect on public policy,\u201d Lowande said. \u201cWe see a lot more of those in close proximity to elections, which suggests that presidents care about appearances and popularity in the moment.\u201d\n\nThe BookMarked lecture series is part of the Price School\u2019s Civic Leadership, Education and Research (CLEAR) initiative. According to CLEAR, the initiative was founded to develop a better understanding of public sector employment, including the civic leadership workforce. In a statement to Annenberg Media, Resh described CLEAR as an initiative that \u201cfocuses on issues of governance capacity, diversity and the impacts of technology, politics and the economy on attracting and retaining the talent necessary to effectively develop and implement public policy.\u201d\n\nLowande\u2019s discussion marks the first BookMarked event of the semester. The monthly speaker series provides policy scholars an opportunity to discuss their recently published books. Past lecturers have discussed topics including polarization and AI impact within government.\n\nLeo Lu, a second-year public policy master\u2019s degree student, said the lecture helped him understand why presidents make certain policy moves close to election season, citing President Joe Biden\u2019s executive order to restrict immigration from Mexico in June as an example. \u201cI was actually a little bit surprised by how many symbolic initiatives were out there,\u201d Lu said. \u201cFor example, the Biden border wall one didn\u2019t really make sense to me because I knew it would be struck down in courts, so why would they even do that? Now it makes a lot more sense for me.\u201d\n\nLowande hosted a workshop for the Political Institutions and Political Economy (PIPE) Collaborative, a university-wide research project, immediately following his BookMarked event. During the workshop, Lowande discussed the organizational hiring choices of presidents for their White House and the high turnover rates of White House staff. Lowande also explained why administrations hire staff close in ideology with the President and hire public relations experts over policy professionals.\n\nKyuwon Lee, an assistant professor of political science and international relations, found Dr. Lowande\u2019s incorporation of data particularly valuable. \u201cNowadays, a lot of people focus on the capacity of both executive and legislative branches, and for this talk, it\u2019s really interesting that the presenter tries to gather the actual data about White House staff and then compare it with congressional capacity,\u201d Lee said.\n\nPrevious BookMarked sessions are uploaded to CLEAR\u2019s website.

(AP/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Daniel Palmore\nSeptember 23, 2024 at 9:23 am PDT\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that the Los Angeles Rams saved their season on Sunday. The 2018 Houston Texans are the only team in NFL history to make the playoffs after an 0-3 start, and through the first three quarters against the San Francisco 49ers this weekend, it looked like the Rams were going to join that Texans team. Down All-Pro wide receivers Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua, the Rams managed to score only one touchdown by way of a 15-yard catch from running back Kyren Williams. Defensively, Los Angeles had no answers for 49ers wide receiver Juan Jennings, who caught two of his three touchdowns in the first half.\n\nIn the second half, LA turned it around on both sides of the ball and overcame a 10-point deficit to secure its first win of the season. With 3:53 remaining in the third quarter, Williams scored his second touchdown of the game to make it a one-score game. Following the scoring drive, both teams kicked field goals, and the score was 24-17 with just over six minutes remaining. After 49ers kicker Jake Moody missed a 55-yard field goal attempt, Los Angeles got the ball back with a chance to tie or win the game with 2:47 remaining.\n\nThe Rams quickly got in the endzone as quarterback Matthew Stafford connected with wide receiver TuTu Atwell for a 50-yard bomb to set the Rams up at San Francisco\u2019s five. Williams punched the ball into the endzone to record his third touchdown of the game. After forcing San Francisco to a quick three-and-out, Stafford put the Rams in field-goal position to win the game, and rookie kicker Joshua Karty nailed one from 37 yards out.\n\nThe victory not only prevented the Rams from joining the 2018 Texas but gave the Rams their first home win over the 49ers since the NFC Championship game in the 2021-22 season. Stafford finished the game with 221 yards and one touchdown, solid numbers considering he was down his two best wide receivers. The Rams had multiple players step up while the stars sat out, and six different receivers caught a pass with Tutu Atwell leading the way with 93 receiving yards.\n\nLA\u2019s rushing attack was also critical in the victory as Williams ran for 89 yards after rushing for 75 yards combined in the Rams\u2019 first two games of the season. Los Angeles\u2019 27 points scored on offense was a season-high and a drastic improvement after averaging just 15 points in the first two games of the season.\n\nWith no clear timetable for the return of Kupp and Nacua, Los Angeles will have to rely on their receiver-room depth step up in their absence. Atwell\u2019s 93 receiving yards were the second-most he has had in a game in his career. If the Rams want to continue winning games, they will need more production from their running backs. Even though Williams had a season-high 89 rushing yards, LA\u2019s second-leading rusher, running back Ronnie Rivers, had just two carries for nine yards. After leading the Rams in rushing yards last week against the Arizona Cardinals, running back Blake Corum did not get any carries against San Francisco.\n\nDespite playing better in the second half, LA\u2019s defense still showed it has room to improve defensively. Quarterback Brock Purdy had 288 passing yards and three touchdown passes, and Jennings had 11 catches for 175 yards in addition to his three scores. The 49ers offense also averaged 6.5 yards per play.\n\nThe most positive improvement is on the Rams\u2019 rush defense. After giving up 197 rushing yards per game in the first two weeks, Los Angeles limited 49ers running back Jordan Mason to under 100 rushing yards for the first time this year. Mason was limited to 77 yards on 19 attempts and zero touchdowns.\n\nLos Angeles will attempt to move back to .500 on the road next week against the 1-2 Chicago Bears, where rookie quarterback Caleb Williams has struggled so far in his rookie season with just two touchdown passes and four interceptions.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/09/22/chargers-handed-first-loss-against-steelers-in-week-3/", "response": "```\nChargers handed first loss against Steelers in Week 3\n\nLos Angeles performed well early, but injuries caused it to slow down as the game progressed.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers tight end Pat Freiermuth, right, is tackled by Los Angeles Chargers safeties Alohi Gilman (32) and Derwin James Jr. during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Sept. 22, 2024, in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Matt Freed)\n\nBy Victor Kevorkian\nSeptember 22, 2024 at 9:55 pm PDT\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers arrived in Pittsburgh expecting a hard-fought matchup, as Acrisure Stadium is an intense environment no matter how good the Steelers are. The bout got off to a slow start but would make for plenty of drama by the end. After both teams traded two punts on their opening drives, Los Angeles put together a five-play, 59-yard touchdown drive to open up scoring late in the first quarter. Justin Herbert capped off LA\u2019s third drive by finding second-year receiver Quentin Johnston wide-open down the left sideline for a 27-yard touchdown. Johnston continues to impress through three weeks, finishing Sunday\u2019s game with two catches for 44 yards and a touchdown, a very encouraging start for the former first-round pick who mightily struggled last season.\n\nLA\u2019s offense would struggle for the rest of the contest, adding only a field goal early in the second quarter. The Chargers totaled just 10 first downs, 168 total yards and were forced to punt seven times. They were unable to establish a potent ground attack like in past weeks, struggling to get a push on Pittsburgh\u2019s stout defensive front.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 offensive woes could be attributed to losing star quarterback Justin Herbert to injury. Herbert started hot, completing 12 of his 18 pass attempts for 125 yards and one touchdown. But after taking a sack midway through the third quarter, the signal-caller re-aggravated a high-ankle sprain suffered last week against the Panthers. He would not return to action and was spotted in a walking boot postgame. Taylor Heinicke would take over for the injured Herbert, completing both of his pass attempts for 24 yards.\n\nThe injury bug would not end there for the Chargers, as star left tackle Rashawn Slater would join his quarterback on the sideline with a pectoral injury. 2024 No. 5 overall pick Joe Alt would also suffer an injury late in the fourth quarter, although it came after Los Angeles\u2019 final offensive drive. Alt revealed that he tweaked his ankle, although no further details were given. The rookie right tackle has been as elite as advertised coming out of Notre Dame, seamlessly transitioning to the position after dominating at left tackle with the Fighting Irish.\n\nDespite the loss, LA\u2019s defense put together an adequate performance. New defensive coordinator Jesse Minter is coaching a more disciplined unit than last year. Minter\u2019s defense is allowing 11 points per game in 2024, which is the sixth-best in the NFL, A night-and-day comparison to a bottom-five unit in 2023, which allowed 23.4 points per game. The defense was not without injury either, as defensive end Joey Bosa was ruled out with a hip injury in the first quarter.\n\nWhile Minter has changed the defensive culture in LA, Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith\u2019s unit had an efficient day. Pittsburgh moved the sticks 20 times, converting seven of its 14 third-down attempts. The Steelers outgained the Chargers in yards 346-168 and punted only thrice. Quarterback Justin Fields continued his impressive 2024 campaign for Pittsburgh. The former Bear has played efficient, mistake-free football, leading the Steelers to a 3-0 record. Fields completed 25 of his 32 pass attempts for 245 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He added a rushing touchdown as well.\n\nFields found second-year receiver Calvin Austin for a 55-yard touchdown midway through the fourth quarter, which was the nail in the coffin. Austin led Pittsburgh with 95 yards and a touchdown, while running back Najee Harris had an efficient day on the ground with 18 carries for 70 yards.\n\nDespite the loss, Jim Harbaugh\u2019s Chargers are a team with playoff aspirations. But a playoff berth rides on the health of Los Angeles\u2019 key contributors in Herbert, Slater, Alt and Bosa, who are all wounded. The 2-1 Chargers are set to host the 3-0 Kansas City Chiefs in an AFC West showdown next week. The reigning back-to-back Super Bowl Champions have won their last five games against Los Angeles, with Patrick Mahomes holding a 5-1 record against Justin Herbert. Sunday\u2019s matchup will be a tall order for the Bolts, who will certainly need Herbert and company to suit up.\n```"}

The Trojans are winners of five straight and have beaten every single unranked team they have played. Three of those matchups came this past week, playing host for the Trojans/Lions Invitational. USC was able to overcome multiple slow starts and near blown leads. Here are Annenberg Media\u2019s recaps of the Trojans\u2019 matchups against UC San Diego and Loyola Marymount. USC also beat the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in four sets (25-21, 25-18, 25-27, 25-20) Friday night, sandwiched in between the Trojans\u2019 matchups against their fellow SoCal teams.\n\nUSC women\u2019s volleyball defeats the LMU Lions despite blowing a 2-0 lead\n\nBy: Brooke Lordino\n\nIn the second edition of a tournament co-hosted by LMU and USC, No. 21 USC women\u2019s volleyball defeated the unranked Loyola Marymount Lions in five sets (26-24, 28-26, 18-25, 33-35, 15-10). The five-set thriller was a battle for both teams, with multiple sets going over the 25-point mark. However, USC was able to come back from losing its 2-0 lead and get the win over the Lions.\n\n\u201cIn the last set we really talked about no room,\u201d graduate outside hitter Ally Batenhorst said. \u201cNot giving them any space to come back at all.\u201d\n\nIt was no easy first set for either team as points went back and forth as the score was tied a whopping 12 times in the opening frame. The Lions gained momentum early on with their serving pressure, catching USC\u2019s offense off guard. LMU freshman setter Delfina Schuh and senior setter Mia Schafer each notched a service ace against the Trojans, giving the Lions a steady 15-11 lead.\n\n\u201cWe were prepared, but not quite to that speed, and I thought we just hung in there long enough to get some rhythm at the very very end,\u201d said head coach Brad Keller.\n\nThe Trojans, however, soon found their groove as Batenhorst got hot with three kills, hitting 60.0%. USC steadily took back control of the set and worked its way back to a tie at 20-20. While the Lions outnumbered the Trojans in kills 15-12, USC took the first set 26-24 with a solid .233 hitting percentage to LMU\u2019s close .200.\n\nA similar trend continued in the second set as both teams kept the score tight. Leading the offensive charge was LMU graduate outside hitter Paige Flickinger, who had no problem finding the empty court on USC\u2019s side. She kept her team neck and neck with the Trojans for a while, but USC took the set to a thrilling 28-26 final to take a steady two-set lead.\n\nThe energy quickly changed in the third set in favor of the Lions. Blocking pressure from sophomore middle blocker Kaitlyn Evans quickly gave LMU an 18-12 lead. The Lions finished the set with four total blocks, completely shutting down USC\u2019s offense. USC managed to cut the deficit by a couple of points behind senior setter Mia Tuaniga. She led the Trojan offense with nine assists, almost single-handedly out-assisting the Lions for the set, but LMU\u2019s blocking was too much to handle. The Lions extended the match, winning set three 25-18.\n\nAlthough USC came back firing in the fourth set 12-7, the Lions\u2019 dominant front row formed wall after wall, tying it up at 13-13. Not too long after, LMU went on a four-point scoring run on the Trojans. The end of the fourth was a nail biter, going well past the 24-24 point deuce once again. Each team continued to go back and forth, holding the audience on the edge of their seats. After many long rallies, the set finally ended with a block from LMU at 35-33. The match was tied 2-2.\n\nLMU\u2019s momentum was short-lived in the fifth set as USC was able to fight back after losing two straight sets to the Lions. With Batenhorst having the hot hand on the outside pin, she ended the 15-point fifth set to secure the win for the Trojans.\n\nKeller pointed out Batenhorst\u2019s improvement this season and how it has been a key factor for USC\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cAt Nebraska she was averaging .165 as a hitter,\u201d Keller said. \u201cShe\u2019s averaging way over .200 for us so that shows you the growth of Ally right now and what she\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nTrojan volleyball tops Tritons to sweep Trojans/Lions Invitational\n\nBy: Sean Campbell\n\nUSC women\u2019s volleyball took down the UC San Diego Tritons 3-1 (30-32, 25-20, 25-19, 25-11), in the final matchup of the Trojans/LMU Lions Invitational on Saturday night at Galen Center. The win improves the Trojans to 8-2 and drops UC San Diego to 6-5.\n\nComing off of four straight victories \u2014 including wins against LMU and UNLV during the tournament \u2014 the Trojans were looking to handle business against the visiting Tritons. After dropping its first two games of the invitational against the Lions and Rebels, UC San Diego \u2013\u2013 in its first all-time meeting with USC \u2013\u2013 was looking for a good start out of the gates.\n\nBut it was the Trojans who went up 8-2 in the opening frame, thanks to strong front-line play and two kills each from graduate outside hitter Ally Batenhorst and junior middle blocker Rylie McGinest. Then, a Triton timeout squashed any momentum USC had. With help from a few USC defensive mistakes, San Diego embarked on a 6-1 run to bring the set within one, and it wouldn\u2019t get much further apart.\n\nAfter a Trojan offensive error tied the game at 20, the Tritons took their first lead of the game, 21-20, off a kill. For the next 19 points, the team\u2019s would trade blows, neither team able to secure a two-point lead that would win the set. Twice, when the Trojans had a chance to take the set \u2013\u2013 up 24-23 and then 30-29 \u2013\u2013 a service error let the Tritons off the hook. The visitors didn\u2019t waste the opportunity, taking two consecutive points to win the elongated set, 32-30.\n\n\u201cAfter the first set, I don\u2019t remember much because we had to get our s**t together really fast,\u201d senior setter Mia Tuaniga said postgame. \u201cAll we did was say look, alright, whatever we put out there in the first set, we know that is not us, and we know that is not the standard we want to play at.\u201d\n\nOut of the break, USC was looking to front a comeback. A service ace from Tuaniga and the fourth of Batenhorst\u2019s 17 kills on the night gave the Trojans an advantage they would not relinquish. More kills from Batenhorst and freshman outside hitter Jadyn Livings helped the Trojans take a healthy 18-12 lead, but the Tritons began to fight back, closing the gap to two points at 21-19. Batenhorst didn\u2019t like that very much. Three kills over the next four points from the Nebraska transfer put the Trojans within a point of evening the match at one set apiece. Livings and McGinest did just that on an assisted block one play later, one of five blocks for both.\n\nDespite going down 6-3 early in the third set, the Trojans battled back and cruised to a set victory. The usual suspects, Batenhorst and Livings, led the way for USC yet again, adding seven and three slams to their tallies respectively. Livings ended her night with 13 kills, notching double-digit kills in four straight matches. Redshirt freshman middle blocker Leah Ford and McGinest, both not typical starters for the Trojans, added to their strong performances with multiple kills each in the set.\n\n\u201cI am very proud of them,\u201d Tuaniga said. \u201cThey very much stepped into this new role ... and they [had] fantastic hitting high percentages, always being up, coming in there and being a leader.\u201d\n\nOn the defensive end, graduate outside hitter Grae Gosnell stepped in as libero \u2014 with junior libero Gala Trubint missing her second straight game \u2014 finishing her night with a stellar 20 digs, including six in the third.\n\n\u201cGrae did a great job of stepping in at the libero spot, which she hadn\u2019t done for her previous program,\u201d USC head coach Brad Keller said. \u201cShe stepped in on a last minute notice and played two fantastic matches for us.\u201d\n\nAs much as the first set was a back and forth for the lead, the final frame was a Trojan push to double the score of the visitors. After a Triton kill brought them under that dominant benchmark at 19-10, a USC run, aided by Triton attacking errors, gave the Trojans a clean 25-11 victory to close the match.\n\nDespite winning the game, Keller was unhappy with the team\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cI was extremely disappointed in my team and my staff and myself tonight,\u201d Keller said. \u201cWhen you can put up a 25-11 [set] at the end of a match, you are clearly not tapping into everything that you have all the way from start to finish.\u201d\n\nNext up for the Trojans is their Big Ten debut against Ohio State (6-3) Friday at Galen Center with first serve set for 7 p.m. To win, Keller said it will come down to discipline both on and off the court.\n\n\u201cI clearly think that the Big Ten is the best conference in the country, hands down, it is not even close,\u201d Keller said. \u201cThere are people that run towards burning buildings, there are people that run away from burning buildings, and we should be people that run towards burning buildings. Safely, that is.\u201d\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/09/22/why-you-should-listen-to-new-music/", "response": "```\nWhy you should listen to new music\n\nBecoming more mindful listeners\n\nBy Audrey Schreck\n\nSeptember 22, 2024 at 10:24 am PDT\n\nWhen you open your phone to play music, what do you click? Of course there\u2019s your playlist, some curated genre hits, some trending billboard songs, but... you\u2019re stuck. You\u2019re stuck in a loop of recommended \u201cToday\u2019s biggest hits,\u201d \u201cRecommended radios,\u201d \u201cTeen Pop Hits,\u201d or \u201cFeel-Good Hip Hop and R&B\u201ds. The music industry has trapped you in a cycle of music produced by three companies: Warner Music Group, Sony Music Group and Universal Music Group. These three companies, according to Statistica, have a monopoly on the industry, controlling over 70% of the global music market.\n\nBut, if a love for music is universal, then why does it matter where it comes from? Music plays an incredibly vast role in our daily lives. According to the National Library of Medicine, adults listen to an average of 18 hours a week of music. With something so inconspicuously pivotal to our day to day lives, it is important to look critically and analyze what that says about our taste and us as people.\n\nDo you come from a musical family? Did music have a big role in your childhood? Did your parents/guardians intentionally introduce you to music, sign you up for music lessons or take you to concerts? Beatriz Ilari, professor at USC\u2019s Thornton School of Music notices that the younger one is, the more receptive and more open they are to others music. As we grow, musical taste can be rooted in new forms of exposure such as friends, generational trends and social media.\n\nIlari recounts her son repeatedly singing \u201cScaramouche\u201d from Queen\u2019s \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d after constant exposure. She says a song isn\u2019t just a random song; rather, children grasp onto specific elements and kindle special connections. \u201cThere are studies showing that children who are exposed to music of different cultures [also] develop positive attitudes towards these cultures,\u201d says Ilari.\n\nRecently, she elaborates, research has been done about using music as a form of prejudice prevention. Illari notices, the younger one is, the more open they are to others music. As we grow, musical taste can be rooted in new forms of exposure such as friends, generational trends and social media. Openness to music is a reflection of our openness to others.\n\nOf course, this is not a one-to-one comparison. You could be racist or xenophobic and still listen to different languages. As Vice Provost of Arts and Professor & Chair of Cross-Cultural Communications Josh Kun puts it, \u201cMusic is not some silver bullet of global enlightenment.\u201d However, Illari notices, the younger one is, the more receptive they are to others\u2019 music. As we grow, musical taste can be rooted in new forms of exposure such as friends, generational trends and social media.\n\nOur attachment to music can be formed from ethno-cultural significance, country chart trends, curated radio mixes and a myriad of other factors. Thanks to the digitalization of music, we have access to more types of music than ever before. Music has become more democratized with a lower barrier of entry for new artists who can freely release music on the internet. Moreover, we also have more access to music from across the globe.\n\nMusic selection is no longer confined to the record, CD or radio. Yet despite this access and America\u2019s diverse ethnic demographics, the charts still maintain predominantly English-sung popular music. One may argue that it is because of the linguistic differences and people\u2019s desire to sing and understand the lyrics. However, this is just one of the many ways people interpret music.\n\nAs Kenneth Foster, director of the Graduate Arts Leadership Program of USC, explains, the United States cultural iconography is globally broadcasted through American entertainment. However, America itself is very insular; It doesn\u2019t look beyond its borders. Illari clarifies that newer generations, like her students, listen to a variety of global music styles. Ilari says that they listen to a lot of different things, including music in foreign languages.\n\nAs younger demographic cohorts like Gen Z and Gen Alpha grow up exposed to the Internet, much of their taste has evolved to align with the globalizing world. Yet still, many older generations and even younger peers actively avoid this musical amalgamation. Foster explains that this may be rooted in xenophobic ideas of American centrism and the idea of American-made music.\n\nFoster says that depending on whether you\u2019re encouraged or discouraged to explore and try new things one can easily fall into a spiral of monocultural reinforcement. Most of the world does not speak English, yet in the Western music scene, artists have sold out massive stadiums globally. Taylor Swift performed for three sold out shows of 220,000 fans in Buenos Aires during one of her stops in the South America leg of her Era\u2019s tour. Likewise, 200,000 Japanese fans saw Bruno Mars in concert at Tokyo Dome.\n\nWhile artists like Bruno Mars don\u2019t have Japanese songs, these audiences still connect through other elements. As noted by Foster, there are so many ways to appreciate music beyond lyrics. We can find beauty in so many other parts like the melody, unique music structurings or vocal flares. Maybe we find songs\u2019 backstories to be fascinating. For instance, Taylor Swift\u2019s complex lore and worldbuilding is similar to the SM multiverse of Korean Pop (K-pop) groups like \u00e6spa and NCT.\n\nPerhaps the album\u2019s marketing, dances or music videos have caught our eye No matter the entrypoint into an artist\u2019s discography, music surpasses linguistic boundaries. It is only an uncompromising mentality that limits people from realizing this. For these global American superstars, a crucial role in their international success is their loyalty and catering to worldwide audiences.\n\nBruno Mars makes regular performances in Japan, integrates Japanese music onstage and even learns some phrases for his fans. These good faith efforts make audiences feel heard and more willing to open up to artists abroad. But there are other ways singers have worked to integrate larger audiences.\n\nRecently massive artists like Charlie Puth, Demi Lovato and Sia have collaborated with Youtube on the Dream Track program, an AI experiment where users can create 30 second songs in the styles of these artists. By signing on to this project, these musicians demonstrate a foresight for the globalized market. They stay ahead of the curb and push the boundaries of the music industry.\n\nIn order to make it in the ever-changing music industry, current and future innovative musicians must focus on expanding their music past just America. Take the rise of the Latin American and K-pop genres. K-pop artists appeal to a global audience by singing songs in multiple languages. Their songs often mix Korean and English. K-pop artists even release songs and sing covers in Japanese, Spanish, Thai, Chinese and more to connect to their worldwide fanbase.\n\nAs of recently, popular acts like Bad Bunny and Karol G have gained massive followings in America, with Bad Bunny even opening for the 2023 Grammys. These artists show the American public\u2019s interest in music outside of just English songs. As Kun explains, every song, English or not, comes from someone with a different story. Yet, these stranger\u2019s songs can become the soundtrack of your life.\n\nThe power of music stems from its ability to expose us to other people\u2019s narratives. It opens a door for empathy and sociocultural education. \u2014 Audrey Schreck\n\nTo escape this musical isolation, it is critical that we take initiative with the music we listen to. Oftentimes when we hear the words \u201cactive listening,\u201d we think of being attentive and responsive in conversation. Let\u2019s reimagine this term in another light: being an active music listener is having user autonomy, actively searching for and trying to branch out to new genres and artists.\n\nThat is not to say active listeners can never listen to what\u2019s on the car radio or some random Spotify hit music playlist. However, this should be done in tandem with regular explorations of new music outside of our downloads. Non-English music is all around us if we stop and listen.\n\nOne exercise I practiced was asking my friends for recommendations of songs in their native languages. Additionally, when the radio plays international artists like BTS, Karol G, Fujii Kaze etc., they too, inadvertently diversify the general public\u2019s music playlist. TikTok and other short form reels sites have helped bolster indie and international artists\u2019 songs across their platforms.\n\nTake the viral phenomenon: Water by Tyla. Often without knowing it, listeners are being exposed to South African rhythmic styles. Tyla, who comes from South Africa, melds Western pop music with amapiano, a South African house subgenre, in her music. By emphasizing South African beats, \u201cWater\u201d, despite being sung in English, sounds distinctly African, explains Tyla in an interview for Rolling Stones.\n\nShe elaborates on the song\u2019s impact saying \u201cWater\u201d is for the world, it\u2019s for her bringing Africa to the world. Tyla\u2019s music and the work of other international artists show this overlap of music across cultures. This integration has expanded people\u2019s awareness of a global spectrum of music.\n\nBy being more attentive to the music they listen to, people can expand their understanding of not only other musical styles, but also the cultures that come with them. As Professor Illari explains, the more we expose ourselves to the rest of the world, the more we learn about ourselves. We are able to think about our place in the world and learn about the underlying similarities inherent in all of us.\n\nLike with any song, when someone enjoys a song in a different language, they will want to learn more about the artist(s), listen to their other albums and find out who they are. This ultimately leads to exploring deeper into the music\u2019 background, whether that be its beats and vibes, or even what the lyrics mean.\n\nFor some people, being able to understand the linguistic nuances of their artists is important. Nuance and extended meaning can often be lost in the translation process. These questions can fuel research into the proper meanings of these misinterpreted lyrics and eventually, a desire to learn what they all mean.\n\nMusical enjoyment can evolve into an interest to understand other cultures and languages. For instance, on a global service trip to China, I fell in love with K-pop. During the trip, some of my newfound friends encouraged me to learn the dance to a K-pop song. I knew of K-pop beforehand, but my preconceptions of the genre and its fan culture scared me away from it.\n\nPutting myself in the shoes of the artists as I learnt their dance choreography, I dropped my barrier of preconceived notions. I was so focused on perfecting each step that I forgot any external biases and enjoyed the music for what it actually was. My love for the musical genre only blossomed.\n\nConsequently, my K-pop enthusiasm has led me to start learning Korean so I can more accurately and efficiently understand song subtexts. Interestingly, in return I also began to appreciate the Chinese half of my ethnicity. Once I recognized how closed off my music taste was, I was reinvigorated to appreciate my own culture.\n\nThis shared passion for Korean and Chinese has led me to major in East Asian Languages and Cultures. But it all began with music. \u2014 Audrey Schreck\n\nThe desire to learn other languages can be escalated by encouraging listener autonomy and global understanding at a young age. By teaching a variety of song genres and styles from across the world, in school and at home, we can foster a globalized mindset in future generations.\n\nMore musical variety exposure at young ages can ease the barrier of entry for new global genres. As Illari emphasizes, children around the age of 4-6 years old are prime candidates for cross-cultural musical exposure. This is because their brains are more intuitive and are not hindered by their ingrained native first language yet.\n\nIf children already begin listening to non-English music, they will be gifted with a basic understanding of these styles and cultures. This makes it much easier for them to continue this exploration of these genres on their own.\n\nThe next time you turn on some music, think about it. Ponder on why you listen to the artists and genres that you do. Maybe ask your friends for some of their favorite non-English songs. Take the time to listen and learn a little about them and, in turn, you.\n\nBranch out and explore genres you might have been predisposed to find strange, and learn how significant they are to others cultures. Just actively listen and maybe, like me, you\u2019ll find yourself dancing.\n\nSpotify Playlist\n\nTo assist in your escape of that bubble of the same curated songs, here are some recommendations. These songs come from a variety of individuals from a variety of ages and ethnic backgrounds. Not every song will suit your tastes, but at least one is sure to catch your eye and inspire you to listen on. Audrey Schreck's curated Spotify playlist\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/09/22/the-best-dumplings-in-the-la-area/", "response": "```\nThe best dumplings in the L.A. area\n\nFood that tastes like home\n\nBy Sammie Yen\nSeptember 22, 2024 at 10:03 am PDT\n\nOne of my strongest childhood memories is making pork dumplings with my grandmother in her apartment in Brooklyn. Despite the language barrier between us, dumplings were the first food I ever learned how to make. The whole process was an artistic alchemy. Mesmerized, I could only watch as my grandmothers\u2019 hands moved of their own accord, flying over the store-bought flour wrappers. She would tuck the meat and vegetable filling into the doughy circle and fold the wrapping like a punctuation of goodnight. She would transform the lumpy half-moon into a pristinely pleated dumpling ready to be boiled or pan-fried. The apartment walls echoed both the stovepots\u2019 murmurs and hisses. The next part was pure magic. My grandmother would drop the dumplings into a pot of boiling water with a definitive plop! and scoop them up only minutes later with a ladle. She would place them in a porcelain bowl in front of me and add a drizzle of ponzu and soy sauce. I would eat it while the steam still curled from the edges, completely ignoring the burning sensation in my mouth. I could have eaten the whole batch if sharing with your brother didn\u2019t exist. Then I was my grandmother\u2019s apprentice, crimping the edges of my dumplings, except my dumplings were bursting at the seams with filling, and my pleats looked more like wrinkles. Nevertheless, I loved what I did, particularly because each step she taught me was essentially a sentiment she was communicating. When she showed me how to properly pleat the dumplings, she was really saying, Try again. You will get it right. When she gave me a slight smile of approval, that was I love you. Perhaps this is why I had and will always have a special relationship with dumplings, for their powerful ability to bridge the gap between generations. When dumplings are in front of me \u2014 whether home-cooked or in a restaurant \u2014 I understand that it is more than food, more than a quick bite made for consumption. I see nourishment. I see my grandmother\u2019s hands over my own, guiding me in that apartment over a decade ago. I see I love you.\n\nIf her dumplings were Brooklyn\u2019s love, I needed to seek out the dumplings that say I love you in the greater Los Angeles area. This list is a compilation of all the dumplings and dumpling variants that exceed the rubric of \u201chome\u201d to me. So, what is home?\n\n1. The First Bite\nDing\u2019s Garden\nFirst impressions matter. A good dumpling is not about how it simply appears on a plate but more so the first bite feeling. The first bite is the precursor, the premise. I could not look any further than my hometown for the perfect first bite: Ding\u2019s Garden, a true staple. It has two dishes that are guaranteed to satisfy your dumpling cravings. The first is the Shanghai-style Pan Fried Dumpling. The first bite in this spherical dumpling is crucial. Although it has largely to do with the other components below, there\u2019s just something about this first bite that will give you the perfect preview of the entire dumpling. It is both steamed on the top and pan fried on the bottom. In the first bite, you get fluffiness and crunchiness. The second must-try is the pork xiao long bao. Personally, I like to put one dumpling in my spoon, bite off a tiny hole in the side of the dough, watch a sliver of steam escape the dumpling, and pour a bit of vinegar into the spoon. For this smaller dumpling, the first bite is the entire bite. You get a combination of everything from the one spoon: the warmth, the soup, the dough.\n\n2. Texture\nMr. Dragon Noodle House\nPan fried dumplings are the crowning jewels of this Rosemead gem. The dumplings are served \u201cupside down,\u201d held together with a golden-brown sheet of crispness. This crispiness is largely the reason for my love of Mr. Dragon Noodle\u2019s half-moon bites. It all melts together in your mouth.\n\n3. Familiarity\nLittle Pan\nWith a grand opening last summer, Little Pan is conveniently only minutes away from the university campus. If you can spare a few moments to walk out to Figueroa, you should give Little Pan a try. Part of why I enjoy its dumplings is because of its familiarity. It reminds me of the soft doughy exterior and tender filling that I love in Ding\u2019s Garden\u2019s dumplings. It may be situated next to more popular chains, but you can see Little Pan hand-making the dumplings.\n\n4. Exploratory\nCHD Mandu\nLocated in Koreatown, CHD Mandu spins the traditional dumpling Korean cultural twist. You have the option to try pork, galbi, or kimchi dumplings, the latter two of which I have never seen at a dumpling place. The crown jewels at this location are the kimchi dumplings \u2014 they\u2019re buttery, crunchy and spicy. They go perfectly with the banchan, or various Korean side dishes that come with the meal. You also can\u2019t go wrong trying the restaurant\u2019s tteokbokki. It augments the spicy flavors of the dumplings.\n\n5. Flavor\nKen\u2019s Potstickers\nThe components of a good dumpling speak to each other. The flavors are in constant conversation with each other. Ken\u2019s pot stickers accomplish exactly that. I first encountered Ken\u2019s Potstickers in the middle of a parking lot. They \u2014 a catering-delivery hybrid \u2014 were one of a handful of food vendors that comprised a small, small food market. (Think 626 Night Market, then imagine only two percent of those merchants, during the blazing midday, and no inflatable signs.) It was there that I ate the most flavorful dumpling in my life. Taste is subjective. I can\u2019t tell you what their exact recipe is, how many parts green onion they have to soy sauce, but all I know is that it\u2019s all the right things. Ken\u2019s Potstickers does not have a brick-and-mortar presence yet, but they both cater and deliver batches of frozen dumplings around the San Gabriel Valley.

(AP/Ebrahim Noroozi)\n\nBy Robert Westermann September 22, 2024 at 8:57 am PDT\n\nSchool\u2019s back in session, which means the summer\u2019s over and tennis\u2019 main events are too. While it\u2019ll be a few months until the major season restarts with the Australian Open in January, the gap gives fans and players time to reflect on the last year. On the court, the emergence of Jannik Sinner and the consistency of Carlos Alcaraz defined the season. Both players took home two major trophies, with Sinner dominating the hard courts in Melbourne and New York while Alcaraz defended his Wimbledon title and won for the first time at Roland-Garros. 24-time slam winner Novak Djokovic didn\u2019t add to his collection this year, but he didn\u2019t end the year empty-handed after he took down Alcaraz in straight sets at the Olympics. Sinner took home titles and climbed to the No. 1 spot in the ATP ranking, but he wasn\u2019t the only player to improve over the year. Americans Taylor Fritz and Frances Tiafoe both earned semifinal appearances at the U.S. Open, with Fritz ultimately falling to the Italian phenom in the final. Sebastian Korda saw the most change this year, winning the Citi Open in D.C. and recently surpassing Tiafoe and Ben Shelton in the ranking. And, like always, some players rose or fell. Alexander Zverev has yet to claim a major title, but still seems to be there or thereabouts among the contenders and is now ranked No. 2. Lorenzo Musetti and Jack Draper made Cinderella runs at different points in the year, while mainstays like Stefanos Tsitsipas and Casper Ruud were disappointing and showed few signs of life.\n\nThe ups and downs of the year then beg the question, out of the players yet to win a slam, who has the best chance of making it happen next year?\n\nLorenzo Musetti\n\nThe second-ranked Italian nearly made it happen this year at Wimbledon before he fell to Djokovic in the semifinals in straight sets. Though Musetti didn\u2019t have the toughest path to the semis\u2014the only other seeded player he faced was a No. 13 Fritz\u2014he\u2019s proven he can play with the best on grass. At Queen\u2019s Club in the weeks leading up to Wimbledon, Musetti took himself to the finals. A long history of injuries and cramping have impaired Musetti\u2019s agility, but if he were to get healthy this offseason he stands a solid chance of making a similar run at Wimbledon next season. Musetti\u2019s also proven he can play on clay. He made the semifinals at the Olympics and had a strong showing at the French Open before Djokovic stopped him there as well. The 22-year-old has shown he can play at the net too, utilizing drop shots when the opportunity arises and moving up and down the court as necessary. Musetti also possesses the patience to play out points and not be too quick to go for winners, which is crucial in the five-set matches played at slams. The underlying issue for Musetti is his ability to stay composed in top-level matches against the likes of Alcaraz and Sinner, fellow youngsters whom Musetti will be competing against in the foreseeable future. If Musetti can improve his fitness throughout the offseason and stay injury-free next year, look for the No. 15 to play for a slam next season.\n\nBen Shelton\n\nThe 21-year-old American has only been a pro for two years and has already made quite a name for himself. Through these two years, Shelton\u2019s won two tournaments in Houston and Tokyo, and most notably made a semifinal run at the U.S. Open in 2023. Performances aside, Shelton\u2019s charismatic playstyle often means he has the crowd on his side, and he\u2019s proven fearless on the big stage. With a serve that once reached 149 miles per hour, Shelton\u2019s hard-hitting game is something opponents dread. With a 6-foot-4, 195-pound frame, his serving power and accuracy have given him the edge throughout his deep tournament runs. Shelton also possesses a left-hand forehand, which allows him to slip shots past unprepared opponents. Shelton\u2019s by no means invincible, though. During long rallies, Shelton often emerges as the loser because of impatience or greed. He can sometimes be too quick to go for winners and doesn\u2019t have the agility other players on tour do. Shelton\u2019s a gifted athlete, but one area he could improve upon this offseason is his quickness and getting to every ball. Besides minor details in his game, time is the only real obstacle between Shelton and winning a major. He\u2019s on the younger side of the tour, and if he continues trending upward it\u2019ll only be a matter of time before Shelton hoists a major trophy.\n\nAlex de Minaur\n\nAlex de Minaur\u2019s had his fair share of success over the last five years. He\u2019s won nine ATP tournaments over that period, namely Atlanta in 2019 and 2022, so he\u2019s not unaccustomed to the spotlight. The Australian made the quarterfinals in every slam this year except for his home Australian Open, and was set to face Djokovic in the Wimbledon quarters until a hip injury forced him to retire. The 25-year-old climbed to No. 6 in the world after he ran in London, but took the next month-and-a-half off to recover in time for the U.S. Open, where he reached yet another quarterfinal. De Minaur is in a similar boat to Musetti and needs to use the offseason to return to full fitness before next year. Given the stamina required to go deep in slams and Masters 1000 tournaments, de Minaur\u2019s injury bug was holding him back and prevented him from playing Djokovic in a match that would have been the biggest of his life. Compared to Shelton, de Minaur is one of the quickest players on tour and can stay in points. That speed has been a huge part of his success, but if he wants to take his career to the next level he needs to improve on some of the fundamentals, like backhand returns and matching the ball spin that other players have. Adolfo Gutierrez has been in de Minaur\u2019s coaching box since the Aussie turned nine, and the bond between the two is stronger than ever. Gutierrez emphasizes the mental side of the sport, and de Minaur seems to have no issues there. But if the nine-year professional wants to take it to the next level, he needs to match the likes of Sinner and Alcaraz in ball speed, serve and returns.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan\nSeptember 21, 2024 at 8:05 pm PDT\n\nUSC knew Michigan would run the ball over and over again, but when it mattered most, the Trojans still couldn\u2019t stop it. After a dismal offensive performance in the first half left USC in an 11-point hole, redshirt junior quarterback Miller Moss managed to establish some momentum in the second half, nearly leading the Trojans to a comeback. But Michigan\u2019s senior running back Kalel Mullings scored Michigan\u2019s only offensive touchdown of the half to give the Wolverines a 27-24 lead with just 41 seconds left in the fourth quarter.\n\nUSC\u2019s defense held firm for almost the entire second half, forcing multiple three-and-outs and a fumble, but ultimately Michigan\u2019s run game won the battle both teams knew was coming. Michigan entered the game with a new starting quarterback, junior Alex Orji, who the Wolverines had previously used as a runner from time to time, but was unproven as a passer.\n\nDespite Michigan\u2019s expected reliance on the run game, the Wolverines still had their way in the first half. Using a combination of Orji, Mullings and senior running back Donovan Edwards, Michigan averaged 7.4 yards per carry in the first two quarters and scored on a pair of breakaways for Mullings and Edwards, of 53 and 41 yards, respectively.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 offense struggled mightily in the first half, having not earned a first down until the team\u2019s fifth drive of the game, when Moss found sophomore receiver Zachariah Branch for a 24-yard gain. Michigan found it easy to pressure Moss, and eventually finished the game with four sacks and 10 quarterback hurries.\n\nEven when USC first visited Michigan territory, the Trojans had to settle for a field goal after a pair of incompletions and a tackle for a loss on redshirt junior Lake McRee. McRee would later exit the game with an injury accrued from a tackle on a similar short-yards catch.\n\nIn the second half, though, the Trojans seemed determined to write a different story. The offense found momentum and the run game, which accounted for just five yards in the first half, started finding gaps for redshirt senior Woody Marks to run into. He ultimately finished with 100 rushing yards and 140 all-purpose.\n\nOn the first drive of the third quarter, USC went 75 yards on 12 plays\u2014the most the offense had strung together to that point\u2014for a touchdown from sophomore wide receiver Duce Robinson. However, after the Trojans forced the Wolverines into a three-and-out, Moss threw the first interception of his career to Michigan\u2019s All-American junior cornerback Will Johnson, which Johnson took to the house to dampen USC\u2019s burgeoning confidence.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 next drive, a solid six-play, 66-yard march, was interrupted by a wild series of events in which Moss fumbled and Michigan junior defensive lineman Kenneth Grant recovered the ball, only for Marks to hustle back and strip the ball out of Grant\u2019s grasp, keeping USC in scoring range. The Trojans ultimately took advantage, with Moss throwing to a wide-open Jay Fair for USC\u2019s second touchdown.\n\nMichigan punted on the following drive and it seemed like USC had the necessary momentum to win. It nearly worked out that way. The two teams went back-and-forth with a few punts, until the Wolverines fumbled mid-way through the fourth, handing USC the ball back at Michigan\u2019s 18 yard line. And on third and 16, Moss flicked the football up to sophomore receiver Ja\u2019Kobi Lane in the end zone, giving the Trojans their first lead of the game with about seven minutes left in the fourth quarter.\n\nTo that point, Michigan\u2019s offense had not earned a single first down in the second half and had gained just nine yards of total offense. Had the Wolverines continued at that pace, they would\u2019ve totaled about 17 yards of offense in the third and fourth quarters. For context, when USC\u2019s offense was sputtering at their worst in the half, they still managed 125 total yards. The Trojans appeared firmly in control.\n\nThat feeling lasted for about four minutes and 30 seconds of clock time, until Mullings broke free once again for 63 yards, putting Michigan in scoring position. Once inside of USC\u2019s 20-yard line, Michigan ran down the clock with its sturdy run game, with Mullings scoring on a one-yard run on fourth and goal.\n\nUSC had just 37 seconds to work with on the team\u2019s final drive and a pair of completions to Lane were insufficient for the Trojans to make their way into field goal range. Between Johnson\u2019s pick six and three Michigan carries for over 40 yards each, it felt like USC\u2019s fortune was determined on just a few plays.\n\nHead coach Lincoln Riley said similarly in his postgame press conference. \u201cWe probably won 80, 85 percent of the defensive snaps,\u201d Riley said. \u201cBut we lost some of them big, and [those] are the mistakes that you can\u2019t make and those are things we\u2019ll have to clean up.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to reflect on USC\u2019s drive before Michigan scored its final touchdown, which ended after three snaps for a total loss of three yards, Riley took the blame for USC\u2019s failure to hold onto the ball for longer. \u201cI thought I could\u2019ve been better,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I called a very good drive there.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will have an opportunity to arrest their big-play fragility next week when they take on the Wisconsin Badgers at the Coliseum on Saturday, September 28.\n```"}

For many fans of the original series, the game\u2019s release was underwhelming, as it diverged significantly from the gameplay and charm that had made the franchise a beloved classic. The strategic depth, familiar mechanics, and unique aesthetic of the earlier titles were replaced by simplified mechanics and design choices that failed to resonate with the fanbase. As a result, the initial excitement surrounding the release quickly faded, leaving many to feel that the game had lost the essence of what made the series so special.\n\nHowever, EA reignited interest almost 5 years later with a renewed promotional push, reminding its community that the game was still in development after years of refinement. Four Years in the Making, But Missing the Mark\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding the franchise, the four-year development cycle for Plants vs. Zombies 3 raised concerns. A mobile game taking this long to come out especially when more complex games, for more complex supports, like EA\u2019s Battlefield 2042, which only took three years to develop. According to Stepico Games, Kevuru Games, and ARC Academy, most modern PC or console games typically take three to five years to complete, with AAA games taking anywhere from two to seven years.\n\nThe development time for AAA games is often influenced by the game\u2019s art style, with 3D titles in a realistic art style generally taking longer to develop than cartoonish 2D games, making the extended timeline for a mobile game like Plants vs. Zombies 3 particularly out of the ordinary.\n\nWhen the initial version of Plants vs. Zombies 3 was revealed, fans were disappointed and expressed their criticisms publicly. PvZ3 has abandoned the approach that made PvZ1 and PvZ2 standout titles. Right now, it\u2019s just a generic mobile game with a PvZ skin, and that\u2019s incredibly unfortunate. We\u2019ve been providing feedback since 2021, but none of our gameplay criticism has been addressed, leaving us with a game that feels too similar to Gardenscapes and lacks the originality that once defined the series.\n\nThe game\u2019s identity as a strategic tower defense game seemed lost, leaving fans nostalgic for the classic experience. The version was met with widespread criticism, with players feeling the game had become just another generic mobile game.\n\nEA\u2019s Attempts to Course Correct\n\nFollowing the 2019 release, EA made several attempts to correct the course. In September 2021, EA tried again. The second iteration of Plants vs. Zombies 3 was soft-launched in select regions, including Australia and the Philippines. The game director at EA Mobile, Matt Townsend, reassured players that the new version would return to the roots of the franchise, specifically the lawn battles that had made the original game so beloved.\n\nThis update reintroduced horizontal gameplay and a more refined aesthetic, including 3D-rendered plants and zombies, bringing back some of the original mechanics. Despite these efforts, many felt that the game still lacked the strategic depth of its predecessors. The ability to customize plant lineups was removed, and accusations of the game becoming a \u201cpay-to-win\u201d experience arose.\n\nBy early 2023, a third iteration of Plants vs. Zombies 3 was in the soft launch phase across various regions. This version, according to the game\u2019s producer and game lead Alex McGregor, aimed to balance fun and nostalgia with new gameplay mechanics. \u201cWe have a lot of new features that we\u2019re excited for players to experience while in soft launch, and the team is looking forward to incorporating player feedback to create a game that is both fun and achieves our target KPIs. Based on that, we could go global sometime this year,\u201d McGregor explained.\n\nYet, the game continued to trend toward a more casual experience, with strategy giving way to mechanics like limited-use items and dynamic terrain features. The introduction of a storyline and simulation elements also signaled a shift in the game\u2019s direction as it moved the game away from its traditional, purely strategic tower defense gameplay.\n\nInstead, it leaned more toward casual, narrative-driven play, where players were tasked with rebuilding Neighborville, alongside series mascot Crazy Dave. While Plants vs. Zombies 3 retained some of its original charm, the shift toward more casual mechanics and the increased focus on in-game purchases continued to alienate certain longtime fans.\n\nThe addition of simulation-style features, reminiscent of games like Gardenscapes, further moved the game away from its traditional strategic roots, opening up new monetization opportunities but distancing it from the formula that had initially captivated players.\n\nA Fan-Led Revival: Plants vs. Zombies Hybrid Version\n\nWhile Plants vs. Zombies 3 struggled to win back its fanbase, another game emerged that reignited the franchise\u2019s spark: Plants vs. Zombies Hybrid Version. This fan-made version developed by a Bilibili user known as \u201c\u6f5c\u8247\u4f1f\u4f1f\u8ff7,\u201d (SubmarineWeiWeiPVZ on YouTube) took social media by storm and officially collaborated with the original Plants vs. Zombies.\n\nThis fan-driven revival became a viral sensation, with gameplay tutorials and strategies spreading across Asian platforms like Bilibili, Weibo, and Xiaohongshu and Western platforms like YouTube. The Hybrid Version is built on the core mechanics that made the original series so engaging, but adds fresh twists with the introduction of hybrid plants.\n\nFor example, the Pea Sunflower combines the resource-generating abilities of the classic Sunflower with the offensive capabilities of a Peashooter, making it a versatile asset in any battle. Similarly, the Pea Cannon fuses the powerful blasts of the Corn Cannon with the rapid-fire of the Peashooter, offering new strategic options.\n\nHybrid zombie-plants, like the unpredictable Zombie Peashooter and Red-Eye Shroom, further increase the game\u2019s complexity, introducing unexpected elements that keep players on their toes and add a new layer of challenge to every match.\n\nOne of the seemingly key aspects of the Hybrid Version\u2019s success was its accessibility. The game offered both casual and hard modes, allowing players of all skill levels to enjoy it. This blend of nostalgia and innovation captured the hearts of longtime fans and newcomers alike, which showed that the franchise still had an enduring appeal.\n\nBalancing Nostalgia and New Ideas\n\nThe evolution of the Plants vs. Zombies franchise reflects a broader trend in mobile gaming: balancing the demands for new content with the nostalgia that fans crave. While EA\u2019s official Plants vs. Zombies 3 struggled to find this balance, the Hybrid Version succeeded by staying true to the original\u2019s charm while introducing creative twists.\n\nThe future of Plants vs. Zombies remains uncertain, as many fans remain loyal to the classic versions they enjoyed as kids. As Alex McGregor noted, while the original franchise still \u201cenjoys very healthy install and DAU volumes,\u201d the challenge lies in balancing fan expectations with the need for innovation, complicating the company\u2019s product management decisions.\n\nThe challenge of maintaining relevance while respecting the past is not unique to Plants vs. Zombies. Other iconic mobile game franchises, like Angry Birds, have faced similar hurdles. Players often resist change, preferring the familiar experience of the original game over newer iterations.\n\nThe fan-made Hybrid Version shows that there is still a deep love for the original gameplay mechanics of Plants vs. Zombies, and its success demonstrates that innovation and nostalgia can coexist. Whether through official releases like Plants vs. Zombies 3 or fan-made projects like Hybrid Version, the future of the Plants vs. Zombies series will depend on its ability to honor the magic of the original games while pushing new ideas that invite both old and new players to the lawn for one more battle.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Kyusung Gong)\n\nBy Matt Kim September 20, 2024 at 6:04 pm PDT\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams are set to host the San Francisco 49ers at SoFi Stadium on Sunday, where both teams will look to gain ground in the crowded NFC West division. The Rams have struggled through two weeks, and are winless at 0-2. This includes a Week 2 blowout at the hands of the Arizona Cardinals, in which rookie wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. torched LA\u2019s defense.\n\nWhile the Rams made the playoffs last year in surprising fashion, the wheels have seemingly already fallen off in 2024 as the current roster has been decimated by injuries and an overall lack of depth. Just two games into the season, star wide receivers Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua are expected to miss an extended amount of time with injuries, as Nacua has already been placed on injury reserve and Kupp may join him in the coming days.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 offensive line has also been battered with injuries as they currently have five offensive linemen on their injured reserve list. The secondary has also struggled to stay on the field, including veteran defensive back Darious Williams.\n\nWhile the injuries have derailed the start of their season, the product on the field hasn\u2019t done much to fill in the gaps. Newly signed cornerback Tre\u2019Davious White has been lackluster, allowing 163 yards through the air, rounding out to a staggering 23.3 yards per reception.\n\nThe Rams haven\u2019t gotten much going on the ground either. Breakout star Kyren Williams posted over 1,300 all-purpose yards in 2023 while adding 12 touchdowns, but this season has seen him average a measly 2.5 yards per carry behind a deteriorated offensive line.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 next task is the reigning NFC champions, the 49ers. Quarterback Matthew Stafford hasn\u2019t been able to do much with his main targets sidelined, only passing for a single touchdown so far. Stafford will get another tough matchup this week as 49ers defensive lineman Nick Bosa and linebacker Fred Warner pose major threats.\n\nDating back to their last ten matchups, the Rams are 2-8 against the 49ers as San Francisco has dominated them in the regular season. However, the 49ers have also caught the injury bug, and they\u2019re missing plenty of their superstars early in the campaign.\n\nAt the forefront of the 49ers\u2019 injury problems is running back Christian McCaffrey who was placed on injury reserve with Achilles tendonitis. McCaffrey is often considered the top tailback in the league and is the main core of the 49ers\u2019 offense. Running back Jordan Mason has filled in admirably so far, but it\u2019s a far cry from McCaffrey\u2019s MVP-level production.\n\nThe 49ers will also be without wide receiver Deebo Samuel, as he suffered a calf strain that will hold him out for at least a couple of weeks. Samuel has been a swiss army knife of sorts for head coach Kyle Shanahan, as his capability to run the ball and rack up yards after the catch has been crucial for San Francisco\u2019s high-powered offense.\n\nAs the week has progressed, plenty of key cogs of the 49ers\u2019 championship-caliber roster have appeared on the injury report, as cornerback Charvarious Ward and tight end George Kittle missed practice on Thursday and are trending towards game-time decisions come Sunday.\n\nWide receiver Brandon Aiyuk\u2014who recently inked a massive four-year, $120-million deal\u2014has gotten off to a shockingly slow start. In two games, Aiyuk has only converted six catches for 71 yards and is still vying for his first touchdown of 2024.\n\nAt the helm of the offense, quarterback Brock Purdy hasn\u2019t performed poorly, but he\u2019s only tossed one touchdown, matching his one interception. He\u2019s recorded 550 passing yards, but if the 49ers want to compete for another Super Bowl appearance this year, he\u2019ll have to be more productive, especially in the red zone.\n\nFor instance, against the Jets in Week 1, kicker Jake Moody shouldn\u2019t have been relied upon to make six field goals with how much talent San Francisco\u2019s offense has.\n\nTo the Rams\u2019 credit, head coach Sean McVay has done a tremendous job with developing unknown offensive and defensive players, and many of them will have a shot to compete for starting jobs on Sunday. Wide receivers Demarcus Robinson, Jordan Whittington and Tyler Johnson will all get a chance to win a starting spot in the absence of Kupp and Nacua.\n\nAlthough a team led by Matthew Stafford should never be counted out, the Rams\u2019 expectations should be modified amid the injury bug.\n```"}

The strike came to an end in September 2023, after a new contract was made with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).\n\nIn a forum held at the USC School of Cinematic Arts (SCA) in April 2023, the consensus was that AI could facilitate faster iterations of works like script drafts, storyboards and production design as a tool rather than as a creator.\n\n\u201cWhat excites me for myself is being able to use it like a tool to accelerate the process and to see what you have and don\u2019t have more quickly and inexpensively,\u201d Athena Wickham, a SCA alumna as well as the executive producer of Westword and The Peripheral, said. \u201cWhat scares me is people getting lazy with it. I do worry that... someone hasn\u2019t taken the time to edit it and put their own spin on it and that\u2019s going to piss me off.\u201d\n\nIn 2024 ShowCAIS, the signature event for The USC Center for AI in Society (CAIS), Stephen Gibler, a Hollywood producer and USC School of Cinematic Arts adjunct assistant professor, explored AI\u2019s emerging role in democratizing film production through his presentation \u201cDemocratizing Hollywood: Envisioning a Future with Singular AI-Driven Film Creation.\u201d\n\n\u201cFilm making usually is made all at once... Now because of how quickly AI can change and build stuff, we can actually make a film very quickly and be riskier with ideas,\u201d Gibler said.\n\nHowever, demands are continuously circulating and increased conversation has been had surrounding the ethics of AI in film. Annika Brown, a freshman studying animation, does not think AI should be used in film making at all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s thievery, and it\u2019s wrong,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt... steals from other people\u2019s work without crediting them [and] it kind of takes away from the beauty of human-made art.\u201d\n\nBrown finds Newsom\u2019s newly passed bill to be a first step in protecting the creativity of artists.\n\n\u201cOur society is kind of heavily driven by art and replacing the people who make that come alive,\u201d she said.\n\nConcern shared by students in USC\u2019s Cinematic Arts Schools is growing and evident.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really scary. I think that it has the potential to take away a lot of creative freedom,\u201d said Isadora Swann, a senior double majoring in NGOs and Social Change and Theater with an emphasis in acting. \u201cI think everyone should be aware and be given the choice to have their entity in their form, be uploaded into AI software.\u201d\n\nWith the newly-released bills, Swann feels safer within the industry.\n\n\u201cI, as an actor, would definitely want to be aware and want to be able to have the choice to say no before that was done to my body and my voice,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite concerns regarding the protection of actors and writers\u2019 creative work, students also recognize the benefits AI in film may have. Olivia Robitaille, a freshman studying screenwriting, believed AI could be helpful in parts of her work for \u201cspelling and grammar and just anything correcting yourself.\u201d\n\nHowever, when it comes to the story itself, like characters, locations and plot, she said these are \u201cthings that are actually important to us building the story\u201d and \u201cshould be left to the writer.\u201d\n\nCalifornia is not the only state who is enhancing protections for creative spaces in AI. On July 31, 2024, the The Nurture Originals, Foster Art, and Keep Entertainment Safe (NO FAKES) act was introduced into Congress, protecting the \u201cvoice and visual likeness of all individuals\u201d from AI.\n\nLawmakers are rushing to pass laws and regulations to monitor AI\u2019s use as new companies release AI video generation tools. Adobe Premiere plans to release a generative AI tool later this year. The new tool will allow users to create videos or images from text in Photoshop and Premiere.\n\n\u201cTo me, AI is always an assistance, not a replacement for anything in life,\u201d said Jennifer Zhang, a sophomore studying AI for Business. \u201cI think especially in the US, we have trouble with controlling these markets that are so profitable to us. I\u2019m glad that California has done this. I think this is the right direction. It is just like a continuous process, and it\u2019s ever changing.\u201d\n```"}

In an interview with the Westside Current, Harris-Dawson said his two major priorities are homelessness and the cost of housing in the city.

In May, Harris-Dawson was chosen by his colleagues to succeed Paul Krekorian and will serve as Council president through December. Harris-Dawson grew up in South L.A. and the San Gabriel Valley before attending Morehouse College in 1994.

(Photo by Marcus Heatherly)  By   Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier September 20, 2024 at  4:01 pm PDT \n\nOne of the most anticipated matchups of the college football season takes place on Saturday. The No. 11 USC Trojans (2-0) head to Michigan Stadium to take on the No. 18 Michigan Wolverines (2-1) in the Trojans\u2019 first Big Ten game, holding steady at No. 11 in the  latest Associated Press Top 25  following a bye week after shutting out the Aggies 48-0. The Trojans and Wolverines have faced each other 10 times previously, with the Trojans winning six of those games. USC and Michigan last played each other in the 2007 Rose Bowl, when the Trojans won 32-18. The week off should give the Trojans an advantage, coming into the matchup more rested. Michigan, the defending national champion, has wins over Fresno State and Arkansas State, but suffered a lopsided 31-12 loss to Texas in Week 2. The Wolverines dropped a spot in the AP poll after struggling to put away Arkansas State at the Big House last Saturday in a 28-18 victory, especially considering the Red Wolves staged a comeback in the fourth quarter. Part of Michigan\u2019s struggles can be attributed to the departures of former head coach Jim Harbaugh and quarterback J.J. McCarthy to the NFL. Sherrone Moore, who succeeded Harbaugh as Michigan\u2019s head coach after previously working as the offensive coordinator, did serve as the interim head coach for four of the six games last season when Harbaugh was suspended due to violations. During Moore\u2019s short time in charge, issues have also flared up at quarterback. Moore announced on Monday that he would be making a change at quarterback by benching senior Davis Warren in favor of junior Alex Orji. In three games this year, Warren has only thrown two touchdown passes, but six interceptions. In the limited action Orji has seen this year across Michigan\u2019s first three games, he has thrown two touchdowns but has yet to record an interception. While USC head coach Lincoln Riley can understand why Moore decided to announce his decision to change quarterbacks, rather than waiting to surprise USC with a surprise change, he is more focused on what the Trojans can control. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and guess why they did [that] or why they made that choice,\u201d Riley said after practice on Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s their decision. We gotta be ready for everybody they have.\u201d Michigan\u2019s struggles at quarterback could help the Trojans\u2019 defense come up big in this game, in what could arguably be the most hostile environment that USC might face this season. USC must also stop the run game, which has been much more effective for Michigan so far this season. USC\u2019s offense may face a defense familiar to the one it sees in practice. This is because USC defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn worked for and learned from Michigan defensive coordinator Don \u201cWink\u201d Martindale during their time with the Baltimore Ravens. As a result, it is clear to see the influence that Martindale has had on the way Lynn schemes defensively. Moore hired Martindale this offseason after former defensive coordinator Jesse Minter followed Harbaugh to the Los Angeles Chargers. \u201cHe\u2019s a really good coach, obviously,\u201d Riley said of Martindale on Tuesday at practice. \u201cI mean, a ton of success in the NFL. He\u2019s been kind of a pioneer defensively in that league, and certainly, for some of the things that they do schematically.\u201d To have success against Michigan\u2019s defense, USC will once again need to have a balanced attack. Redshirt junior quarterback Miller Moss will want to rely on the multiple deep threats USC has at its disposal. The Trojans will also look to get their running backs involved in the passing game, especially with a versatile running back like redshirt senior Woody Marks, who has 47 consecutive games with a catch dating back to his time with Mississippi State. As USC is gearing up for its first Big Ten season, Riley has also commented on how he and his assistant coaches have sat in on position meetings other than their own position group, which has allowed him and his staff to increase their knowledge of the game. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot in terms of their experience, how they present, how they coach, how they teach, that I\u2019ve been able to learn from,\u201d Riley said during his weekly press conference on Thursday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one advantage of having a really good staff is you got guys on the staff that are going to push each other with different ways to be effective.\u201d The Trojans will take on Michigan at 12:30 p.m. PST on Saturday in their first Big Ten game on CBS at the Big House.\n```"}

The Trojans scored the match\u2019s opening \u2014 and only \u2014 goal about three minutes in. A beautiful through ball played by graduate forward Hannah Griffin gave the opportunity for senior forward Kayla Colbert to feed freshman forward Faith George in the box. George found a spot between the keeper and the near pipe, giving the momentum and the match\u2019s only goal to USC.\n\nOffensively, the team continued to be strong, with 10 shots in the match and six finding the frame. Purdue\u2019s sophomore keeper, Emily Edwards, had a great match, making multiple diving saves to keep the Boilermakers in contention. Anchored by goaltender Laurence Gladu, a graduate transfer from Penn, the Trojans were also quite strong defensively. This three-save performance was Gladu\u2019s fourth shutout of the season.\n\nThe Trojans have been on the road nearly the entire duration of this season, only playing an exhibition match at their temporary home, Dignity Health Sports Park. \u201cFlying out to Indiana on a four-hour flight... is quite difficult,\u201d head coach Jane Alukonis said. \u201cWe knew it was going to be a challenge... but I thought the team was super brave.\u201d\n\nThis was USC\u2019s eighth straight away match, but that has not hurt the team\u2019s record. After the first game in Indiana, the Trojans are 6-1-1 and show little signs of stopping heading into the second half of the season. Looking ahead, they will face six straight unranked teams before facing No. 17 Ohio State and No. 9 Penn State. They will then finish the season against the UCLA Bruins inside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.\n\nAlukonis talked briefly about what she was looking to improve in the second half of the season and focused specifically on the group\u2019s foundation. \u201cThe team possessed the ball very well,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cYou have to have the foundation right to be able to be good in the other parts and to fully dominate the game.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans played a dangerous game in the backfield today, with many possessions starting with pressure at the top of their own box. In the end, however, it worked out well, as USC moved past the Boilermakers and improved to 4-1 all-time against the West Layette team. Alukonis\u2019 squad will look toward Indiana University on Sunday at 9 a.m. before the Trojans are finally able to play on their home turf again.\n```"}

The modern building is located between Michelson Hall and Kaprielian Hall. It will be the new home for the Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science and the new USC School of Advanced Computing. Ginsburg Hall is equipped with a 300+ seat auditorium, a sunken garden, and more. In addition to the modern style of the building, the new facility emphasizes sustainability with proper rainwater management, solar panels, and light efficiency.\n\nSome students share excitement over the new building\u2019s designs, facilities, and most importantly, the push to bring Viterbi up to date with the rest of the buildings. \u201cI think it\u2019s exciting because it looks pretty and I mean, I love Viterbi but a lot of our buildings are definitely a little bit more outdated,\u201d Abby Moll, a sophomore studying computer science, said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to hopefully spend some time in the computer science building this upcoming year.\u201d\n\nStudents outside of Viterbi look forward to the facilities and the space Viterbi has created for its students. \u201cI\u2019m excited for a modern area.

But if anybody else from other schools want to go explore it or use any of its resources, it\u2019s kind of hard.\u201d\n\nThe building was named after Dr. Allen, a retired ophthalmologist and Charlotte Ginsburg, a philanthropist, in honor of their $10 million gift to establish the Institute for Biomedical therapeutics. In a press release, Director Mark Humayun MD, PhD said, \u201cI am incredibly grateful for Allen and Charlotte and their generosity, creativity, foresight and entrepreneurship and delighted to be celebrating them and this extraordinary partnership today.\u201d \u201cIBT strives to engage and inspire the students of tomorrow,\u201d Hamayu said. \u201cWe have established programs and courses in the area of biomimetic neuro-engineering and medical device development.

He originally played 5 seasons of professional baseball for the Fighters in Japan. Then, soon after making his MLB debut for the Los Angeles Angels in 2018, he won the American League Rookie of the Year Award.

With the latest win Thursday, the Dodgers have now clinched a spot in this year\u2019s postseason, one step closer to the Fall Classic. Losing the first battle 11-9, the Dodgers rebounded in the next two games, winning 8-4 and 20-4, respectively.\n\nThe Dodgers\u2019 hitters came swinging in Miami. While inconsistent pitching was a sore spot, the offense took control led by the inaugural member of the 50-home run, 50-stolen base club, Shohei Ohtani. The two-way superstar had all eyes on him, tallying four home runs and 12 RBIs during the series. Three of the moonshots and 10 RBIs came in the finale, cementing the Japanese slugger in the record books. His All-Star-level performance in Miami has undoubtedly proved his case to win another MVP award this season.\n\nIn other news, once-sensational pitching prospect Bobby Miller\u2019s recent performance should be worrisome for Dodgers fans. Only lasting two innings in Game 1, the right-hander\u2019s ERA is now up to a lackluster 8.52, and he gave up six hits while only striking out two hitters. This rough performance was not even his worst of the season, making fans wonder what his true impact may be, or if he should even make the cut for the postseason roster.\n\nUtility player and trade deadline acquisition Tommy Edman played a vital role in the series win as he continued to be an offensive force. His key base hits and RBIs will play a big role in the team\u2019s postseason run if he keeps this up. His much-appreciated versatility in the field has allowed his impact to be even stronger. Edman played all around and was featured in both center field and shortstop during the series. He has been a reliable asset to the team so far this season, proving to be a great trade pickup.\n\nWhile pitching wasn\u2019t the primary focal point of the series, rookie right-hander Landon Knack had a stellar performance in which he struck out seven batters while only allowing four on base. Allowing zero runs, Knack has brought his ERA down to a solid 3.39. He will certainly see time in October.\n\nGame 3 was highly entertaining for LA fans. Thanks to a 20-run scoring flurry, the Dodgers have brought themselves up to 91 wins in the regular season. Whether it was Ohtani\u2019s six-for-six day or outfielder Andy Pages\u2019 consistency, the team worked together to earn the series victory against a struggling Marlins team.\n\nThe Dodgers only have three series left before the postseason, and if their electric offense can stay hot, they should be set for October. Dodger fans have seen it all in the last decade, with breathtaking wins and heartbreaking losses. But with the new additions and a star-studded group on hand, LA looks to be in position for another deep postseason run.\n```"}

I did avail the student health services that USC provides, and it helped me a lot.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s event featured a panel of student wellness advocates and other outside organizations focused on eliminating mental health stigma. \u201cI feel like they highlighted a lot of the accessible ways students at USC have access to mental health, whether that\u2019s through the mindfulness programs or even stuff as basic as journaling or going on the nice nature walks around campus,\u201d Maria Laguna, a freshman studying biology, said. \u201cHearing different student perspectives, especially from upperclassmen, is super important as I start my journey here at USC.\u201d\n\nMembers of USC\u2019s The Happy Hour \u2014 a student-led organization that aims to improve USC students\u2019 mental health, safety and overall well-being \u2014 shared their mission with those in attendance. \u201cJust being a person, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d Gillian Podell, The Happy Hour social-media manager said. \u201cMental health is something that everyone struggles with and needs to be talked about and addressed and we all just want to help each other, and The Happy Hour aims to do that.\u201d\n\nSam Stack, a senior studying communication and the president of Men\u2019s Mental Health Initiative, an organization dedicated to destigmatizing men\u2019s mental health at USC, emphasized the importance of sharing one\u2019s mental health journey with others. \u201cSo many people are going through similar issues and acknowledging the fact that they\u2019re not alone and bringing forward this issue shows that there is a community within college,\u201d he said.\n\nThe panel also included the Amick-Alexis family, a mother, father, son and daughter who came together to start their own direct-impact nonprofit, Don\u2019t MIND Me, which focuses on advocacy, action and access. \u201cAdvocacy: We share our story, we invite others to share theirs,\u201d co-founder M\u00e4dchen Amick said. \u201cWe had a podcast. We do lots of interviews, lots of social media interactions. Our action pillar: we provide ways to connect you to resources that you may need.\u201d\n\nAs for access, the family is in the beginning stages of opening a mental health treatment center and collecting scholarships for those who cannot afford the help they need. The effort stems from the family\u2019s personal battles with mental health issues. Mina Tobias, co-founder of Don\u2019t MIND Me said that 75% of mental health diagnoses occur before the age of 25, making the mission to reach out to college students all that more crucial. \u201cIf you are in college, and you\u2019ve made it here, especially to a school like USC, you are already somebody who works very hard, who probably takes on a lot of stress, and it\u2019s a lot to balance,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cAnd leaving home for the first time, you\u2019re experiencing a lot of first times.\u201d\n\nTobias detailed that having the information and a support system in place before issues arise is incredibly important. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do it when it\u2019s too late,\u201d Tobias said.\n\nKind Fest will be back next year to continue its mission to erase mental health stigma and provide students with a community that understands we are all human and that being human can be hard.\n```"}

(AP/Abbie Parr)\n\nBy Dylan Luden September 20, 2024 at 11:00 am PDT\n\nIt has been a bleak year for the Los Angeles Angels. As things stand, the 2024 Angels could be the worst team in franchise history. With a 62-91 record, the Angels are just three losses from being etched into the history books to join or possibly surpass the 1980 Anaheim Angels (65-95). The Halos\u2019 future isn\u2019t looking exceptional either. According to MLB Pipeline, the Angels have the second-worst farm system in all of baseball. The ranking may be a bit skewed, though, since they typically promote their top draft picks so early that their farm can never develop. In fact, the Angels have promoted their first draft pick to the MLB in each of the last three classes.\n\nThis season, some of the Angels\u2019 younger talent has shined and produced somewhat of a core for general manager Perry Minasian to build around. Here are the top five 25-and-under players that the Angels should look to build around for next season:\n\n5. Christian Moore (21 years old)\nChristian Moore has yet to appear in an MLB game, but it shouldn\u2019t be long before he does. Moore was selected 8th overall in this year\u2019s draft by the Angels out of the University of Tennessee and he has already put up exceptional numbers in AA. The NCAA national champion is hitting .347/.400/.584 with six home runs in 25 minor league games. Like previous Angels first-round draft picks, look for Moore to be fast-tracked so he can become a core part of the Halos squad.\n\n4. Caden Dana (20 years old)\nCaden Dana is the youngest of the bunch. The former 11th-round draft pick out of the New Jersey high school ranks was offered first-round money to sign away from his commitment to the University of Kentucky. He made his MLB debut this season, but things didn\u2019t go as planned for the Angels No. 1 prospect. Dana started three games in September and showcased himself to Angels fans. In his first start, he allowed two runs and four walks while striking out four in six innings. His next two appearances were so rough that the Angels quickly sent him to the minors and shut him down for the year. His AA season with the Rocket City Trash Pandas proved he\u2019s one of the best young pitchers in the minors, compiling a 2.53 ERA in 135.2 innings pitched with 147 strikeouts and a 0.94 WHIP. If all goes well for Dana in spring training, he could make the opening-day roster and provide a future for a weaker Angels rotation.\n\n3. Nolan Schanuel (22 years old)\nNolan Schanuel was the Angels\u2019 first-round draft pick back in 2023. The Florida Atlantic grad made his MLB debut just 40 days after he was selected. Schanuel shot out of the gate, reaching base safely in his first 29 games, setting a franchise record and tying for the third-longest on-base streak to start a major league career. In his first full MLB season, Schanuel slashed .252/.346/.365 with 13 home runs and 52 RBI. Schanuel is known for his bat-to-ball skills and an incredible eye, but isn\u2019t well known for his pop. During his time at FAU, Schanuel improved each season in the power department and finished his senior year with 19 home runs. Should the trend continue, Schanuel could be in line for a bigger breakout in 2025 much like Zach Neto had this season.\n\n2. Logan O\u2019Hoppe (24 years old)\nIt\u2019s been a tale of two halves for the Angels backstop this season. After finishing last season with 14 home runs and a .796 OPS in just 51 games, Logan O\u2019Hoppe was primed to become one of the best young catchers in the game. During the first half of the season, O\u2019Hoppe rose to the occasion and was an American League All-Star team candidate, batting .276/.328/.472 with 14 home runs and 42 RBI, great numbers for a young catcher. The second half of the season couldn\u2019t have gone much worse for O\u2019Hoppe, who\u2019s been in a dreadful slump. Since the break, he\u2019s slashing .158/.228/.255 with only five home runs and 13 RBIs. His 74 strikeouts in the second half almost matched his first-half total of 76. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how O\u2019Hoppe can bounce back next season after playing in over 125 games for the first time in his career.\n\n1. Zach Neto (23 years old)\nNeto, the Angels\u2019 first-round draft pick, broke out in a big way for the Angels in 2024 by breaking the single-season home run record for a shortstop in Angels history with 21. He\u2019s also displayed impressive speed as well, notching 30 stolen bases. Overall, Neto is hitting .248/.318/.435 and has accumulated 3.1 WAR due to his value on the basepaths and on defense. Neto is also the Angels\u2019 team leader in multiple categories like stolen bases, RBI (71) and doubles (32). Neto has improved the most out of any Angels player this season. His profile strikes similarly to Ezequiel Tovar of the Colorado Rockies: two young shortstops who upped their offensive profile and provided value with their gloves and speed. If Neto can take another step forward next season, an All-Star appearance may be in the fold.\n\nWhile the Angels look to improve their farm system in the coming years, they can certainly look to this core that has a decent amount of Major League experience to build for their future.\n```"}

(AP/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler September 20, 2024 at 8:37 am PDT\n\nFirst AL and NL playoff spots clinched\n\nWith nine games left to play, the New York Yankees and the Milwaukee Brewers are the first two teams to secure a playoff bid. At 89-63 and 88-64 respectively, the two have been dominant in the AL East and NL Central divisions. Led by AL MVP front-runner Aaron Judge, this Yankees squad has been one of the top offensive teams in the league all year. They lead the league with 222 home runs (almost 1.5 per game), 760 total runs and are slugging .470. They haven\u2019t clinched the division over the rival Baltimore Orioles, but with a 4.5-game lead, they are likely to do so very soon.\n\nThe Brewers have put up solid numbers this season despite being in the worst division on paper. They clinched the division with relative ease, with the just-above .500 Chicago Cubs 11 games back. They are a top-five pitching and hitting team (3.64 ERA and 735 runs), and are capable of making a deep postseason run.\n\nSeattle\u2019s base-running disasters\n\nSometimes an overlooked skill in baseball, base running is one of the game\u2019s fundamentals that\u2019s taught during tee-ball. In the second half of the season especially, the Seattle Mariners, however, have moments when it seems like they\u2019ve forgotten those fundamentals.\n\nThe first blooper of the week was in a bases-loaded, two-outs scenario with former NLCS MVP Justin Turner of the Mariners at the plate against the Yankees. After a 2-0 pitch missed the zone to make it three balls and no strikes, Yankees pitcher Luis Gil looked to be taking his time and slowly walked back to the mound and grabbed the rosin bag. The Seattle runner on third, Victor Robles, decided it was the right time to steal home, but Gil was aware of the situation, quickly threw the ball to his catcher to record the out and the Mariners left the inning empty-handed.\n\nThe next day, when the Mariners and Yankees went to extra innings, Seattle found themselves with a 2-2 count in the bottom of the 10th. Randy Arozarena stepped into the box looking to score Julio Rodriguez, who was on third. On a 90-mph offspeed pitch, Arozarena swung and let go of the bat, which flew right to Rodriguez. The startled base runner jumped out of the way, toward his dugout, and New York catcher Austin Wells threw the ball to third-baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. to notch the out.\n\nA first in San Francisco\n\nThe San Francisco Giants\u2019 McCovey Cove is one of the most famous landmarks in baseball. The Cove is the mouth of a creek that leads into the bay where players have been hitting home runs for 25 years. Not just every player\u2019s hit homers there, though\u2014only lefties have hit the ball 366 feet into the cove. Giants outfielder Heliot Ramos changed that this week when he became the first righty to do it.\n\nOn a full count in the bottom of the ninth inning, San Diego Padres pitcher Robert Su\u00e1rez threw a 100-mph fastball to the outside of the plate which Ramos took the opposite way. Even though it took a righty 25 years to nail one into the Cove, it all makes sense when looking at the bat\u2019s angle, the necessary speed and the distance that needs to be covered.\n\nThe double play going into the weekend\n\nThe New York Mets have garnered a one-and-a-half game lead over the Atlanta Braves for an NL Wild Card bid. Facing one of the top teams in the league in the Philadelphia Phillies does not make it easy to hold on in the season\u2019s final weeks, but it is imperative they do so if they want to keep their season alive. Prediction: The Mets take two of three games.\n\nSimilar to last week, the Braves are on the other side of that coin. They have a much easier opponent in the second-worst team\u2014the Miami Marlins. Coming off of a 20-4 loss against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Miami will try to play spoiler at the end of the season. Prediction: The Braves take all three games.\n\nLast weekend the Phillies won their series and the Dodgers split theirs, moving my prediction total to 10-13-3.\n```"}

(Photo/Dominique Williams)\n\nBy Mia Nu\u00f1ez\nSeptember 20, 2024 at 2:30 am PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 The Sparks lost to the Phoenix Mercury 85-82 and followed their trend of losing their lead in the second half on Tuesday. The Sparks\u2019 last home game of the season started like every other, they got off to a hot start. Center Li Yueru had six points in the second quarter, including a 3-pointer. Before the second quarter ended guard Rickea Jackson had eight points and three rebounds. The team\u2019s rhythm flowed well and it appeared like it was going to play its best basketball of the season.\n\nEverything seemed sweet until it wasn\u2019t. With less than a full shot clock left in the second frame, LA was up 36-43. When guard Celeste Taylor made her free throws and right after center Brittney Griner and Jackson got into an altercation, leaving them both with ejections. Griner elbowed Jackson which led to shared words between the two. Griner put her hands in Jackson\u2019s face, so she swatted her hands away and both players started to square up. Coaches, referees and teammates were separated. Jackson and Griner each received a double technical foul, leading to ejections.\n\nHead coach Curt Miller talked about how he hadn\u2019t seen the film leading to the technicals during the postgame press conference. \u201cMy initial words to Rickea were \u2018hang in there,\u2019\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have an opportunity to talk with her.\u201d\n\nGriner was having a dominant performance right before the half with 14 points, three rebounds and one assist. It\u2019s questionable why Griner would participate in this altercation knowing that the Mercury are already in the playoffs and the game against the Sparks doesn\u2019t mean much. Griner already has five technicals and will face suspension this season and if she keeps racking them up. The Mercury already had star guard Kahleah Copper out, so with Griner\u2019s ejection, they lost another key player with plenty of time left.\n\nAfter the altercation, the Mercury came out with vengeance, but the Sparks couldn\u2019t match their energy. Losing Jackson meant LA lost one of its best offensive players and it showed during the third quarter. Despite coming off a 30-point quarter, the Sparks only scored 10 points in the third frame. \u201cOur lack of offense may have affected our defense at times,\u201d coach Miller said. \u201cThat third quarter got away from us.\u201d\n\nDespite the loss, Yureru had a career night with 19 points and 12 rebounds, her first career double-double. \u201cI\u2019m really appreciative of my coach and teammates because they help me every game,\u201d Yureru said. \u201cI feel really grown up on the court.\u201d\n\nSparks guard Dearica Hamby also had a solid game, trying to boost her Most Improved Player of the Year campaign with 21 points and nine rebounds. LA\u2019s foul struggles reflect its disappointing season; the Sparks just can\u2019t seem to get it together on either side of the ball. The loss of Copper didn\u2019t affect the Mercury as guard Sophie Cunningham took her spot and exploded with 14 points. Guard Diana Taurasi had an excellent performance in potentially her last away game ever. She recorded 13 points, five assists and three rebounds.\n\nLA plays its final game of the season against the Minnesota Lynx on Thursday at Target Center where the Sparks will try to avoid losing nine straight.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Suzanne Schofield September 19, 2024 at 9:07 pm PDT\n\nAs USC gears up to face defending national champion Michigan, the team has entered a crucial stage of preparation. Tuesday\u2019s practice set the tone for what will be USC\u2019s first Big Ten conference game, a high-stakes matchup against a team still loaded with NFL-level talent.\n\nFor sophomore wide receiver Zachariah Branch, the game presents both an exciting opportunity and a challenge, as he prepares to face one of the top secondaries in college football. Branch, who has been a standout for the Trojans this season, is no stranger to high-pressure environments, thriving so far in USC\u2019s fast-paced offense.\n\nWhen asked about Michigan, he was measured in his response but clearly eager to take the field. \u201cThey\u2019re a pretty great team, man,\u201d Branch said with a grin after practice. \u201cJust excited to go out there and play in that atmosphere.\u201d\n\nMichigan\u2019s defense, anchored by junior cornerback Will Johnson, has been tough to crack, but Branch does not seem fazed at the challenge. \u201cOh yeah, he\u2019s a pretty good player.,\u201d Branch said. \u201cSeen it on film, and like I said, just excited to go out there and play in that atmosphere.\u201d\n\nFacing off against Johnson, projected to be a first-round NFL Draft pick, Branch knows what\u2019s at stake. Johnson\u2019s reputation as a lockdown corner has earned him national recognition, and Michigan\u2019s defense as a whole remains one of the best in the country.\n\nBranch, though, has his sights set on keeping matters in perspective. \u201cJust treat it like every other game,\u201d Branch said, when asked how he plans to handle playing in front of over 100,000 fans at Michigan\u2019s infamous Big House. \" You can\u2019t look at it like it\u2019s too big or too little of a game. Everyone\u2019s the same, and we just need to have that mentality. It\u2019s a great atmosphere, but we\u2019ll prepare and focus on ourselves and our scheme, then go out and execute.\u201d\n\nIt is evident that Branch\u2019s versatility and speed are difficult to compete with, making him a major component of USC\u2019s offense. As such, redshirt junior quarterback Miller Moss emphasized the role the young receiver will play in the matchup against Michigan, especially given the Wolverines\u2019 strong defense.\n\n\u201cZach\u2019s an extremely hard worker,\u201d Miller said. \u201cObviously, there was an effort in running track to get faster. I don\u2019t know how much faster he can really get before he\u2019s running in the Olympics or whatever. But no, I mean, he\u2019s a phenomenal kid that works really hard and continues to improve in all facets of his game.\u201d\n\nAdditionally head coach Lincoln Riley also touched on the importance of facing a team like Michigan early in the season, particularly one with the defensive pedigree and experience of the Wolverines.\n\n\u201cThey have NFL players all over the place, and a lot of guys were part of winning a national championship last year. A lot of good players, a lot of good coaches at that place,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good football team that we have a lot of respect for, and to have anything less would be a mistake on our part.\u201d\n\nWith Michigan\u2019s new defensive coordinator Wink Martindale, formerly of the NFL\u2019s New York Giants, USC\u2019s offense has also been working overtime to prepare for some potentially tricky defensive schemes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a really good coach, obviously. A ton of success in the NFL,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a pioneer defensively in that league, and certainly for some of the things they do schematically. He\u2019s an elite coordinator, and the way they\u2019re playing right now, you can see his impact on their defense.\u201d\n\nAs for Branch, his speed and playmaking ability will be key to unlocking Michigan\u2019s defense, but he\u2019s ready to handle the pressure.\n\n\u201cWe just need to stick to our game plan,\u201d Branch said. \u201cDo what we do best and execute. At the end of the day, that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d\n\nWith the showdown against Michigan only days away, all eyes are on USC, particularly Zachariah Branch, as the Trojans aim to take down last year\u2019s national champions and make a statement in their new conference.\n```"}

The Boyle Heights Beat (BHB) is the inaugural LA Local News Initiative member, a nonprofit seeking to bridge the information gap within L.A. The initiative started a couple of years ago when the American Journalism Project (AJP) asked residents in Boyle Heights and other East LA neighborhoods where they get their news from. BHB was a name that came up multiple times, prompting the AJP to launch a first-of-its-kind initiative with the paper.\n\nThe LA Local News Initiative will establish local newsrooms throughout Los Angeles and help them collaborate with media partners, community organizations, and each other. BHB will serve as the launching pad newsroom. The initiative is working to build an ecosystem of publications that work together to distribute and inform communities across Los Angeles.\n\nElisa Garcia, a resident of Boyle Heights and reader of the newspaper, stressed the paper\u2019s importance to the community, \u201cThey\u2019re a big part of the way we consume information, and they\u2019re a very trusted source ... There\u2019s so much talent in neighborhoods like Boyle Heights; if you bring the resources and create the spaces, the talent is here,\u201d Garcia said.\n\nThe initiative comes at a time when local papers across the country are closing their doors. A lack of local news leads to an informational gap for people who cannot afford access to trusted news sources via subscriptions. LA local news initiative aims to \u201cprovide free access to high-quality news that looks to increase civic engagement, maintain accountability, build trust, and [uplift] local communities.\u201d\n\nA 2023 Medill School of Journalism study found that the country is losing nearly two local papers a week, many belonging to historically underserved communities. Local newspapers are critical for covering important stories, especially in cities like Boyle Heights which is 61% Latino. Latino stories often go underreported, and members of the community are starting to lose the Spanish-language newspapers they turn to. Therefore, BHB is looking to change the local news media landscape.\n\n\u201cWhen we first launched in 2010, our mission, really was por y para la comunidad, for and by the community, and that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Jessica Perez, the Senior Editor of BHB.

Moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis asked both candidates questions regarding topics that are top of mind for everyone this election cycle such as fracking, the war in Gaza and Ukraine, and the current state of the economy. For Latino voters, questions about immigration policy and reproductive rights were what drew the most attention, as well as criticism.\n\nDuring Biden\u2019s presidency, Roe V Wade, the landmark case protecting a woman\u2019s right to an abortion, was overturned by the Supreme Court. Biden also limited the number of immigrants allowed to seek asylum when the border experiences a high number of border encounters through an executive order back in June. Weeks later, he passed the \u201cparole in place\u201d policy allowing up to half a million undocumented residents to obtain permanent residency without having to leave the country.\n\nNow, the question amongst Latinos is whether Kamala or Trump promise a better presidency following Biden\u2019s. After the debate, the consensus among experts and voters was that Vice President Harris had won, but many Latinos were disappointed with the Vice President\u2019s lack of direct answers in regard to her policy plans, including immigration reform. Trump, who has used racist rhetoric against Latinos in previous public appearances, lied frequently and was dismissive of the moderator\u2019s live fact-checking.\n\nVoto Latino, an organization that aims to educate and empower Latino voters, said in a press release, \u201cIt is clear that Harris won the debate. The Vice President made herself better known to Americans and presented concrete plans and proposals that will make our country stronger and our people more prosperous. ... With all eyes on the debate, [Trump] once again demonized immigrants and trotted out the same old anti-Latino rhetoric.\u201d\n\nHowever, not everyone agreed that Kamala was the clear winner, and many felt the moderators went easy on Harris in both fact-checking her statements and asking tough questions. The Republican National Hispanic Assembly, an organization that seeks to promote Hispanic-American interests within the Republican Party, believed Trump to have won as stated in a post made from their X account: \u201cWe are disappointed by the evident bias displayed by the moderators during tonight\u2019s debate. Despite the one-sided nature of the questions, President Trump responded with strength and confidence, navigating the challenge exceptionally well. He clearly won the debate.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign is already looking for a second debate, but Trump\u2019s has not agreed to any. Regardless of who won, the two-hour-long back and forth between both candidates did little to sway the confidence of some Latino voters.\n\n\u201cIt felt like two kids arguing with each other. I think that\u2019s mostly because Trump doesn\u2019t know how to take criticism,\u201d said Amanda Canales, a model living in Los Angeles. Before the debate, Canales hadn\u2019t felt particularly strongly about either candidate, and the debate only further cemented her frustration with her current options. \u201cI think Kamala won for sure, but I do think that at the end of the day, they\u2019re both just trying to win, and I don\u2019t really take what they say very seriously.\u201d\n\nOne moment of the debate that stood out to many voters was Trump\u2019s claim that Haitian immigrants were eating other people\u2019s pets. The comment was in reference to a city in Ohio that had experienced a large influx of immigrants from Haiti within the past four years, and while police have debunked these rumors, it hasn\u2019t stopped J.D. Vance or Trump from sharing the myth.\n\nAssembly speaker of the California Latino Caucus, Robert Rivas, shared on his X account following Trump\u2019s statement: \u201cCats and dogs!? This guy is unhinged!\u201d\n\nMany Latinos who have heard Trump\u2019s statements for three election cycles now, continue to feel frustrated by the same rhetoric of Trump threatening to deport millions of undocumented Latinos, attempting to get rid of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and that immigrants are surging crime rates in the country.\n\n\u201c[Trump] had said a lot of contradictions, a lot of lies. He said he was going to deport millions of Mexicans\u2013millions of Latinos. How is he going to deport so many people? You take out all the Latinos, the country will cease to exist because it\u2019s a country of immigrants.\u201d said Rafael Quintero, a street vendor originally from Mexico.\n\nQuintero believes having a woman for president can be promising, as he\u2019s seen in his home country where Claudia Sheinbaum won the Mexican presidential election in June of this year. \u201cTrump is for the rich people,\u201d said Quintero. \u201c[former president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador] is for the poor people. [Sheinbaum] is for the poor people. And why don\u2019t people like them? Because they are doing things in favor of everyday people, and perhaps that can happen [in the U.S.] as well.\u201d\n\nReproductive rights were also among the top concerns for voters leading up to the election. Vice President Harris has promised to bring back women\u2019s right to an abortion if she were to win the election. Meanwhile, Trump has largely kept quiet and tried to distance himself from Project 2025, a proposal made by the right-wing organization Heritage Foundation, that plans to add even more restrictions on abortions.\n\nTrump\u2019s comment of Democrats wanting to allow for the \u201cexecution\u201d of babies after they are born, or allowing abortions after 9 months, garnered a lot of attention both online and within the community. He lauded his own involvement in overturning Roe V Wade, which has been met with criticism from voters on both sides and has been a pressing matter for the GOP.\n\nDuring the debate, Trump reiterated that he wanted to leave it to the states to take a stance on abortion, a decision he said represents the desires of the American people. According to a study done by the Research Pew Center, however, six out of ten Americans disagree with the original overturning of Roe V Wade.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just not knowledgeable,\u201d said Celeste Olague, who works at a car dealership. \u201cSaying that people still have an abortion after birth, that\u2019s obviously not possible.\u201d\n\nModerator Davis quickly clarified Trump\u2019s statement as untrue, but it didn\u2019t make the claim any less concerning. Watching the debate made Olague root for Kamala, \u201cbecause [Trump] felt more like a dictator.\u201d\n\nVoters hoping to get better ideas of the presidential candidates\u2019 policies will have to be satisfied with what may be the only debate of this election cycle. Both candidates did their best to garner undecided voters, including Latinos who account for about one in every seven voters. The question remains whether Latinos will be swayed by Trump\u2019s erratic behavior as commitment to his country, or Harris\u2019 promise of a better future as fact.\n```"}

The early closures according to USC Libraries is based on observation. \u201cWe look periodically at library hours and have made some changes this year after assessing usage patterns of spaces and services,\u201d USC Libraries said in a statement to Annenberg Media.\n\n\u201cA lot of my classes are sort of midday, so I like to use the library right after my class is finished, just to finish any work that I need to be done,\u201d Christian Waldron, a sophomore studying business administration, said. \u201cAnd I just feel like having it close at 8 p.m. or 7 p.m. will make things a lot more difficult for me.\u201d\n\nInstead of closing at 10 p.m. as it has in prior semesters, Doheny Memorial Library, home to the Cinematic Arts Library, East Asian Library, Music Library and Special Collection now closes two hours earlier at 8:00 p.m. The Library for International and Public Affairs and the Architecture and Fine Arts Library both now close at 7 p.m., three hours earlier than they did last semester.

Thirteen students are currently vying for the two senate seats open due to a lack of candidates during the general election this past spring. The election was only supposed to run until Thursday, but due to technical delays \u2014 including the opening of the election portal being delayed by seven hours \u2014 it was pushed back.\n\nThe voting period for special elections is shorter than a general election because the entire process has to be expedited, said USG Chief Justice Susanna Andryan, a senior majoring in legal studies and philosophy, politics and law. \u201cThe main goal is we just want to fill up the senate seats as soon as possible,\u201d Andryan said. \u201cThen those senators can be well acquainted within their roles, and they can just continue on with their role throughout the entire year.\u201d\n\nThe last special election was held in November 2023. A total of 674 students voted in that election, Andryana said, though she said she expects more students to vote in this one. But, without a public relations team, USG does not have the capacity to send a mass email to the undergraduate student body like it did during the general election, so the organization has struggled to get the word out. There won\u2019t be any tabling telling students to vote like during the general election either, Andryan said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, but that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to use other resources that we have, like our Instagram and just telling the candidates to spread the [word],\u201d Andryan said.\n\nThis results in many voters being people who follow the candidates or are already involved or otherwise associated with USG, said Tanisha Saraff, a senatorial candidate and sophomore majoring in economics/mathematics and global geodesign. She felt that those who lacked information about the election weren\u2019t going to make the effort to learn about all the candidate\u2019s platforms and were more likely to vote for superficial reasons such as who\u2019s on the top of the candidate\u2019s list.\n\n\u201cUSG could have done a better job of publicizing the special election, because there was no information on social media or on any of the communication channels about it until voting already began,\u201d Saraff said.\n\nFew students actually even knew that the election was happening, and not all those who did have made plans to vote. Andrej Obradovic, a junior majoring in music industry, and Samuel Avalos, a senior majoring in communications, said they were unaware of the election. Neither have voted in a USG election before.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know what it was until right now, so I can\u2019t even say if I would vote,\u201d Avalos said.\n\nObradovic said he had received \u201cliterally zero communication,\u201d but would consider voting if \u201cthe right candidate\u201d persuaded him to.\n\n\u201cIf the candidates are trying to get my vote, why haven\u2019t I seen them around or heard anything about them?\u201d Obradovic said.\n\nStudents can see candidates\u2019 platforms on the USG website and vote until 11:59 p.m. Friday.

(AP/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Brooke Lordino September 19, 2024 at 4:14 pm PDT\n\nAs September winds down, the fight for the seven automatic playoff qualification spots has heated up in Major League Soccer. Los Angeles Football Club, the 2022 MLS Cup champions and the runner-up in 2023, finds itself in a good position heading into October, largely thanks to three key players. Currently sitting in third place in the Western Conference, just seven points behind the Los Angeles Galaxy, LAFC is looking to secure a top stop in the 2024 playoffs.\n\nForward Denis Bouanga, has been a key contributor for LAFC this season, leading the team in multiple stats. With a total of 17 goals in MLS this season, Bouanga has dominated the field in attack and is without a doubt LAFC\u2019s greatest offensive threat on any given night. Plus, he does more for his team than just score. He opens up the field for his team and also possesses a selfless streak, providing a team-leading nine assists on the season. He\u2019s a legitimate contender for MVP, especially given LAFC\u2019s regular season success thus far.\n\nBouanga\u2019s presence was certainly missed when he was out for international duty during LAFC\u2019s match against the Houston Dynamo, where his team only managed to draw 0-0. LAFC only attempted six shots against Houston, eight fewer shots than head coach Steve Cherundolo\u2019s team managed against the Galaxy the following week with Bouanga back in the lineup. Bouanga\u2019s outstanding offensive play will need to continue as LAFC nears the playoffs hoping to return to the MLS Cup final.\n\nFrench goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, has also come up big for LAFC, especially in recent games. Lloris\u2019 performance was exceptional in the Houston match, where he made four key saves. In the process, he recorded his 10th shutout of the season and became the first goalkeeper in MLS to record 10 or more shutouts in the 2024 season. In LAFC\u2019s recent El Tr\u00e1fico showdown, the LA Galaxy kept Lloris busy, forcing to make seven saves in an eventual loss. With a total of 79 saves on the season, Lloris has averaged a healthy 2.8 per match, showing that the defense keeps him safe most matches, but that the Frenchman can bail his team out when needed.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t made an appearance for LAFC yet this season, but Carlos Vela could be a secret weapon for LAFC down the stretch. The team upgraded its roster recently by re-acquiring black and gold club legend Carlos Vela, signing him out of free agency. The 2019 MLS MVP is returning to Los Angeles and could join Bouanga as a key offensive threat. In a recent interview, Vela said that \u201cLAFC is a special club, and I am proud of what we have built here. I am excited to return to LAFC and try to help the team achieve great things in any way that I can.\u201d Vela may be 35 years old, but he still managed to contribute 14 goals and 11 assists in all competitions for LAFC in 2023, so fans should be excited about Vela\u2019s presence and the options it creates for LAFC\u2019s attack.\n\nWith Bounaga and other major players returning to the lineup from international duty, and Vela\u2019s addition to the roster, watch out for LAFC as they have a chance to sneak past LA Galaxy and secure the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference.\n```"}

(Photo by Kate Stuzin)\n\nBy Kayla Quintero\nSeptember 19, 2024 at 3:20 pm PDT\n\nWhen students and faculty at the University of Southern California stepped foot on campus for the start of the 2024 fall semester, the excitement shared by Trojans, old and new, wasn\u2019t the only experience they already had in common. Upon their arrival to USC\u2019s main campus, visitors encountered \u201cwelcome\u201d tents of Allied Universal security guards and equipment to scan university IDs. These increased security measures arose during the pro-Palestinian protests that took place at the university earlier this year.\n\nConflict first arose after Valedictorian Asna Tabassum, who faced criticism from pro-Israel groups for her public support of Palestine, had her commencement speech canceled \u2014 a decision made by USC officials without detailing cited safety concerns.\n\nMembers of the USC community have begun to question what the cost of these increased security measures is and how it could impact them. The president of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) at the University of Southern California, Christina Dunbar-Hester, confirmed that faculty have not received any information regarding the price of these increased security measures, and are concerned about its financial implications, not just for staff, but also students.\n\n\u201cWe worry what this security apparatus costs and what other possible expenditures that would benefit students, staff and faculty are being sacrificed to pay for it,\u201d Dunbar-Hester said.\n\nWhile the AAUP president could not confirm whether or not the cost of these increased security measures has impacted other budgets in any way, she shared that last spring, Bovard administrators notified the deans of individual schools that \u201cfairly substantial budget-trimming\u201d would be to come.\n\n\u201cOver time, this affects faculty and staff workloads, which can affect students\u2019 learning and campus experience as well. Budget trimming also tends to invite worries about compensation, and whether annual raises will keep up with cost of living,\u201d Dunbar-Hester said.\n\nFor her department, this meant postponing hires that were supposed to replace faculty members who had left or retired. She added that she believes many of the university\u2019s departments have experienced hiring freezes for staff.\n\n\u201cGiven the fiscal constraints USC is apparently already operating in, it does not seem remotely justified to spend a small fortune on security unless administrators can make a strong case as to its necessity, which they have not done,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Allied Universal was first approached regarding their presence on campus and compensation for it, Director of Public Relations Kari Garcia said in an email, \u201cAllied Universal is dedicated to the safety of our clients, their customers and the public. Due to client confidentiality terms outlined in our contract, we are unable to comment on the security services provided to keep university personnel, students and the public safe.\u201d\n\nAccording to USC\u2019s Department of Public Safety (DPS) website, Allied Universal Security is serving as the new vendor for the school\u2019s Security Ambassador Program, replacing the previous vendor, Contemporary Services Corporation (CPC).\n\nDPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said that a subdivision of CPC, Apex, previously provided guards that supplemented the university\u2019s officers by staffing posts at access gates and select locations within the campus. While he was not able to provide information about Apex guards\u2019 compensation, he did note that they were not currently being used.\n\nHowever, Carlisle said that when it comes to Allied Universal Security, he estimates that between 85 and 100 of their guards are on campus between the hours of 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. at a pay rate of $19.50 per hour. These numbers are reduced after hours when access to campus becomes more limited, with about 34 \u201cYellow Jacket\u201d ambassadors taking over between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n\nWith USC having funded both CPC and Allied Universal Security guards just in this last year on top of what the institution already allocates for DPS officials, some in the USC community have begun demanding more transparency into these changes and how they will affect them.\n\nAlthough Carlisle has said he does not possess any information surrounding the university\u2019s budgeting for the increased security measures, he said from what he\u2019s aware of, these implemented changes will be enforced \u201cindefinitely.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, unionized graduate student workers at USC (GSWOC-UAW Local 872) gathered over 1,000 signatures this past summer for a petition sent to President Carol Folt, Provost Andrew Guzman, Vice President of Student Life Monique Allard and Associate Senior Vice President of Safety and Risk Assurance Erroll Southers, calling on the administration to \u201celiminate the excessive security measures that have been in place since the Spring semester.\u201d\n\nThe university did not provide a breakdown of how much money is being spent on these security measures nor comment on how it will impact USC\u2019s budgeting in other areas. They directed us to the University Comptroller\u2019s annual financial reports which provide any budgeting information that is publicly available.\n```"}

(Courtesy of Gus Ruelas/USC News)\n\nBy Daniella Lake September 19, 2024 at 3:08 pm PDT\n\nA 4.7 magnitude earthquake rattled through the USC campus last Thursday morning. The earthquake, centered near Malibu, was just one of the many earthquakes felt in Los Angeles recently. For the past century, scientists have been saying that California is due for an earthquake larger than magnitude 6.7, what they call \u201cthe big one.\u201d\n\nSteven Goldfarb, USC\u2019s Director of Fire Safety, Emergency Management and Business Continuity says it\u2019s not a matter of \u201cif\u201d the big one will hit California, but \u201cwhen.\u201d USC has an all-hazards emergency plan and earthquake preparedness is a major part of that plan. Today, students can attend the Safety and Preparedness Fair at the Health Sciences Campus. Goldfarb said that students and faculty are encouraged to participate in the Great ShakeOut earthquake drill on October 17 at 10:17 a.m., where they can practice earthquake safety.\n\nDuring the Great ShakeOut and at other times of the year, the university\u2019s critical response teams test their equipment, check their supplies and practice how they would respond to an earthquake, according to Goldfarb. He says they have medical supplies, emergency food and water filters ready to go.\n\nThe university may have a plan, but some students say they don\u2019t feel personally prepared. Nehir Keskin, a computer science major from Turkey, woke up to the earthquake and said she felt scared. \u201cI have no idea what to do [if a quake hit USC]...under panic anyone can do anything.\u201d\n\nSarah Little, an industrial engineering student from North Carolina, thinks that educating out-of-state students about earthquakes would be helpful because, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it really.\u201d Some international students also aren\u2019t familiar with earthquake safety procedures. Ploypetch Pooljun, an MBA student from Thailand, has lived in the United States for only three months. She said she doesn\u2019t know what she should do during an earthquake. She wondered if she should go to the ground floor of her building or stay in her room.\n\nHowever, even students from California don\u2019t feel confident they\u2019d know what to do if a big earthquake hit. Oliver Wyman, a film student and native Californian grew up hearing about the San Andreas fault line, but never learned how to prepare for an earthquake. \u201cNo, I\u2019d be screwed. I have terrible survival skills. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do,\u201d he said.\n\nSome students don\u2019t think earthquake preparedness is talked about enough. \u201cI am a little nervous though. I just feel like we don\u2019t talk about it a lot. So I feel like earthquake preparedness is pretty low...I feel like it\u2019s not really brought up enough considering the high risk potential,\u201d said Sara Bazan, a biological sciences major.\n\nHalo Lyman, a comparative literature and French major, has experienced a few small tornadoes, but doesn\u2019t know what precautions to take during an earthquake other than hiding under a table. She\u2019s had trouble keeping up with university communication. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t read the crazy mass emails they send out, maybe I should. I feel like they would send things that say \u2018earthquake preparedness\u2019 in the title though, and I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve seen that,\u201d she said.\n\nGoldfarb was in Los Angeles for the 6.7 magnitude earthquake centered in Northridge in 1994. \u201cIt was a crazy experience, but also an eye opening experience to just how bad it could be,\u201d he said. He encourages everyone to have at least three days worth of emergency food and water, along with anything you can\u2019t live without, like medication or a spare pair of glasses.\n\nIn addition to having an emergency kit, Goldfarb encourages students to have an emergency communication plan with their families. He also suggests students download LiveSafe and MyShake. LiveSafe allows students to contact campus emergency services and MyShake gives earthquake warnings shortly before shaking occurs.\n\nGoldfarb says the university has a plan in case of mass casualties or if there were many injuries on campus at once. He says USC\u2019s response team practices the plan over the summer and they do so annually, but he encourages students to be personally prepared.\n\nGoldfarb said the biggest misconception people have about emergency preparedness is \u201cthinking that their city, their government, their state, their county, is going to do something for them, or an organization like a Red Cross, or something might come in, swoop in and save the day.\u201d\n\nStudents who\u2019ve never experienced a large earthquake may not feel as motivated to be prepared, but emergency experts like Goldfarb don\u2019t think it should take a catastrophe to happen to be ready for one.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Edie Cingrani, a sophomore international relations and global economy major.)\n\nBy Kate Stuzin\nSeptember 19, 2024 at 2:31 pm PDT\n\nOfficials detained a student holding a replica handgun on the second-floor balcony of McMorrow Residential Hall shortly before 10 p.m. yesterday. USC Department of Public Security and Los Angeles Police Department officers arrived on the scene at about 9:40 p.m. after a surveillance camera operator allegedly spotted a person with a handgun.\n\n\u201cThe replica handgun was seized and a report was taken on the incident,\u201d DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said. \u201cObviously, although it was a prank, it was a very dangerous situation. Important things that you don\u2019t anticipate could happen. Be mindful of how your actions could be interpreted.\u201d\n\nThe student was not arrested and DPS has referred the incident to the student judicial system, according to Carlisle. Under California Penal Code 12556(a), carrying an imitation firearm is an infraction punishable by a fine. DPS did not reveal the identity of the student.\n\nMcMorrow resident and sophomore stage management major Sara Gutierrez was sitting outside her apartment when she said she saw \u201cofficers run in with huge rifles.\u201d Gutierrez said she \u201cfelt unsafe,\u201d left the area and was not allowed back inside until police cleared the scene.\n\n\u201cThis happened on my floor and everyone was trying to figure out what happened,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cThe only place we were getting information from at this point was Sidechat. We got no DPS alerts to stay in our dorms or stay away from McMorrow. I feel like stuff that happens off campus is always alerted, but something happening in the dorm wasn\u2019t. I was very confused, and this was an urgent situation, so I was just a little disappointed.\u201d\n\nResidents posted photos and commentary on Sidechat, an anonymous student messaging platform. Gutierrez said neither her residential advisor or USC Housing has given any information about the incident.\n\n\u201cThe student was quickly detained, and it was determined that it was a replica handgun, so it was not necessary to send out an alert. The other situation was very similar. He was quickly taken, so there was no exigency,\u201d Carlisle said.\n\nOn Tuesday at 10:06 p.m., the LAPD arrested a man outside the PED building for an outstanding warrant after students reported him to DPS for possibly carrying a knife, though no weapon was found. Justin Adams, 33, was booked in 77th St. Jail and then transferred to the Los Angeles Men\u2019s Central Jail, according to the LAPD.\n\n\u201cHe has a no-bail warrant, but I don\u2019t know the initial charge,\u201d LAPD Officer Charles Miller said. Adams was first detained by DPS before LAPD arrived on the scene. The Men\u2019s Central Jail did not respond to our request for comment on the charge.\n\n\u201cThe man is likely mentally disordered,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cHe was waving his hands around, and they [the students] thought they saw something shiny in his hand. And they thought it was suspicious, appropriately.\u201d\n\nCarlisle is unsure how Adams entered campus, as USC restricts visitor access from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., requiring students to scan in with ID cards after hours.\n```"}

(Photo by Yolanda Hu)\n\nBy Danica Palmersheim, David Sosa, Lindsay Augustine, and Sophia Zhang\nSeptember 19, 2024, at 2:03 pm PDT\n\nWith recent changes to the Recognized Student Organization (RSO) application requirements, organizations new and established face difficulty reapplying for recognition from USC. Specifically, for clubs associated with the Marshall School of Business, these changes have had a large-scale effect on the \u201cexclusivity\u201d aspect of the approximately 40 RSOs housed by the school.\n\nThe changes made to the process include an open membership requirement. Clubs must allow all students, staff, faculty, and alumni who are eligible to be non-voting members. The change is meant to promote the university\u2019s unity and fight against discrimination based on social standing and other factors, according to USC Campus Activities.\n\n\u201cAs part of the application process, all officers and advisors must complete the required training and documents. This year the trainings are focused on the Student Commitment and the Unifying Values, as well as accessibility, leadership responsibilities, hazing prevention, and anti-discrimination,\u201d USC Campus Activities said in a statement to Annenberg Media.\n\nThe policy affects clubs and organizations on campus differently; some have reconstructed new student outreach while others have more or less maintained their usual process. Clubs under Marshall have some of the most rigorous recruitment processes. They now have to adjust their intensive interview processes and are now required to allow more people into their clubs.\n\nJulia Mendez, a junior business administration major, said Marshall\u2019s Women\u2019s Leadership Board has been affected by this new policy. Mendez said that many students who are able to get into these clubs don\u2019t participate, \u201cand there\u2019s people who can\u2019t get into clubs and they would go to stuff if they had the opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe 40 Marshall RSOs range from associations designated for students of a particular race or ethnicity to societies based around consulting and accounting. For several consulting clubs under Marshall, the thorough application process aims to be selective.\n\nDaniel Kong, vice president of projects at RISE, a campus organization specializing in startup consulting, said he believes the rigorous application process is to better serve clubs and students. \u201cIt\u2019s not because we want to take away the consulting experience from people...even those that want to join it,\u201d Kong said. \u201cIt\u2019s more of the fact that the work that we want to give to the business analysts and the new people that are coming for these consulting experiences is valuable enough to the point where we\u2019re giving them enough work and experience where they feel like, \u2018Oh, we got enough in return for being part of such a rigorous application process.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn addition to consulting clubs under Marshall, other organizations around campus are also feeling the effects of the policy change. For those with less intensive application processes, the time it takes to be officially recognized by Campus Activities has caused delays in recruitment, mounting up obstacles in a hectic first few weeks of the semester.\n\nAs the Vice President of Delta Phi Epsilon, an international and professional co-ed sorority, Orion Dennin has mixed feelings about the changes made. \u201cI think that these clubs, in a sort of way, are a mirror of how the real world works, or at least how the employment process works,\u201d Dennin said. \u201cIt\u2019s about networking and your skills, and the effort that you put into it. It doesn\u2019t have to be shady and unethical.\u201d\n\nBut some students said they feel differently about this new process, believing that excluding people from these clubs does not make the club any better, and that this new policy is essential for groups to include the people who will be passionate and interested in the ongoing events.\n\nAva Satterfield, a sophomore business administration major, said the process has been \u201cdifficult.\u201d \u201cEspecially if you don\u2019t know older people in those clubs, to get into them,\u201d Satterfield said. \u201cA lot of the application process has to do with who you know more than your experience.\u201d\n\nSatterfield, like many students, has conflicting feelings but hopes to see a beneficial outcome from these changes. \u201cBut then also, I think by excluding people, you\u2019re missing a lot of other perspectives that could have been shared,\u201d she said.\n```"}

It was the latest in a series of power outages caused by a dangerous heatwave in the region that prompted officials to warn residents to stay indoors. The excessive heat, which neared 110 degrees, left many in the Adams-Normandie, Exposition Park and University Park area without power.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, extreme weather events, like a prolonged heatwave, can strain the utility\u2019s equipment, causing power outages city wide. During this heatwave, LADWP said more than 5,000 residents were left without power.\n\n\u201cThis could be the new normal with climate extremes that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d a LADWP spokesperson told Annenberg Media about the high temperatures. The spokesperson said the situation was particularly unique because the majority of the outages affected relatively small numbers of customers, meaning it took crews a significant amount of work for lines that would only restore power to dozens of people at a time.\n\nJunior Grace Love said her power was out for several hours. \u201cMy roommates were cooking and, for about an hour, the electricity would go in and out for a couple seconds, and then at around 3 p.m., it just went out,\u201d Love said.\n\nLADWP said it has been upgrading its equipment yearly and hopes to \u201censure the reliability of [its] infrastructure.\u201d\n\nAs for those at the game, the fourth quarter power outage surprised many in the 75,000 capacity stadium. According to a spokesperson for the stadium, the power went out for a few minutes before generators were able to kick in.\n\nFor long-time USC football fan and freshman Hunter Hales, the power outage was an unexpected interruption to the game. Hales has attended Trojan football games since he was 3-years old, but this was his first game as a USC student.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty loud and noticeable,\u201d Hales said. \u201cI heard that it was hard to see the ball and that the other team was complaining.\u201d\n\nSophomore Ben Llados was extremely confused while sitting in the stands with his friends. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was about, or what caused it, so it was a little bit concerning,\u201d said sophomore Ben Llados. \u201cMost of us were just confused on what happened.\u201d\n\nDuring a power outage, LADWP encourages residents to consider seeking shelter at one of the city\u2019s cooling centers. Other tips included keeping a flashlight and batteries on hand, making sure electronics are charged or having an extra portable battery pack and turning off or unplugging any electronics to help in service restorations.\n\nThis story has been updated to provide additional context and clarity.\n```"}

With seven weeks remaining until their first regular season game at Galen Center against the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga on November 4, the Trojans are gearing up by hosting another open practice on Tuesday.\n\nHead coach Eric Musselman reported that graduate guard Chibuzo Agbo (knee soreness) should be practicing again on Monday while graduate forward Matt Knowling (sports hernia) did practice in limited live situations, but will be a full-go on Monday as well. Freshman guard Kallai Patton will be out indefinitely and doesn\u2019t have a timetable to return.\n\nDuring practice, the Trojans focused on attacking the glass with authority on offense and defense. Rebounding is going to be a key focus point for this roster as there\u2019s no one listed above 7-feet tall. Incoming UMass transfer and graduate forward Josh Cohen along with returning senior forward Harrison Hornery are the tallest players for USC standing at 6-foot-10, with Hornery almost exclusively going to operate as a center according to Musselman.\n\nOne big man who stood out in particular during Tuesday\u2019s practice was graduate forward Rashaun Agee. Musselman stopped in the middle of practice to applaud the 6-foot-8 transfer from Bowling Green on improving his practice habits the most on the team. \u201cI thought practice habits wise he had a ways to go for our culture so to speak, and he\u2019s been unbelievable,\u201d Musselman said. \u201cI kind of whispered to [assistant coach Michael Musselman] at one point that he does our DNA stuff maybe better than anybody.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will rely on Agee to be an anchor in the paint after having a big season last year for Bowling Green, averaging 13.3 points per game and a team leading 9.9 rebounds per game to earn a spot on the All-Mid-American Conference second team. Besides Agee, there are seven graduate students on this Trojan roster. These veterans will look to use their experience to help guide USC as they progress during the season.\n\n\u201cI think we want to be a player-led team because we have tons of experience,\u201d graduate guard Clark Slajchert said. \u201cWe all know what it takes to win games. When you know what it takes and guys aren\u2019t doing it, it\u2019s on us to hold each other accountable.\u201d\n\nWith 16 new players joining the USC roster, this group didn\u2019t have the built-in chemistry and bond as some other USC teams from the past. So far throughout the off-season, this team seems like they\u2019re clicking on and off the court. Musselman said that his staff gave his players the weekend off for the USC vs. LSU football game on September 1 so that they could go watch the game and be seen by the fans in a group. In addition, the team also supported the women\u2019s volleyball team by attending its first home game on September 11.\n\n\u201cIt starts with our interaction with our own student-athletes,\u201d Musselman said. \u201cThat\u2019s the first group of people that we have to get to be like family and feel like we\u2019re supporting them.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will look to continue building upon their existing chemistry on and off the court for the next month and a half before their season officially kicks off with 12 non-conference games before their first season in the Big Ten.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Mia Nu\u00f1ez September 19, 2024 at 8:13 am PDT\n\nWith the 2024-25 season slowly approaching, the women\u2019s basketball program announced its 11-game non-conference schedule. The Trojans open their season in Paris against the University of Mississippi in one of two Aflac Oui-Play games on November 4. It\u2019ll mark the first time that Ole Miss and USC have met in women\u2019s basketball.\n\nUSC is set for a promising season after clinching the No. 1 seed in the NCAA March Madness tournament since 1986. They made it to the Elite Eight before falling to the University of Connecticut.\n\nLast season, National Freshman of the Year guard JuJu Watkins led USC to the NCAA tournament\u2019s Elite Eight. In the offseason, head coach Lindsay Gottlieb has added even more star power this year with graduate transfers Kiki Iriafen and Talia von Oelhoffen. Iriafen was the 2024 power forward of the year and von Oelhoffen was an All-Pac-12 Team honoree.\n\nUSC opens its first home stand against the Cal Poly Mustangs, followed by more home games against the California State Northridge Matadors, Santa Clara University and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. The Trojans will battle their historic rivals on November 23, a game between two AP All-America first team recipients in Watkins and Notre Dame sophomore guard Hannah Hidalgo.\n\nWatkins set national records by breaking the national freshman scoring record with 920 points. Hidalgo set a pair of Notre Dame records with the highest single-season averages for points per game at 22.6 and steals per game, with 6.2. The Irish and USC\u2019s women\u2019s basketball teams haven\u2019t played each other since 2011.\n\nHidalgo and Watkins are both in the same class, so the head-to-head battle between the two should make for an exciting showdown. Notre Dame will be USC\u2019s last home game before Thanksgiving, when the Trojans will play Seton Hall and Saint Louis University in the Acrisure Series in Palm Springs.\n\nLooking towards the end of the season, the Trojans will take on California Baptist University, Fresno State and Elon University. USC ends the year with an anticipated Elite Eight rematch against the University of Connecticut. The Trojans fell to the Huskies in the Elite Eight last year, by a 80-73 score.\n\nUConn has one of the best players in the country in redshirt senior guard Paige Bueckers. Bueckers is a former National Player of the Year, earning the award as a freshman during the 2020-2021 season. She averaged 21.9 points per game, 5.2 rebounds and 3.8 assists last year. Her career has been stunted by injuries, but despite the odds, she led her team to the Final Four as a redshirt junior.\n\nWatkins is a star who will only continue to develop her game in the coming season. Additionally, Bueckers and Iriafen are both headed to the WNBA draft next spring and mock drafts have them both going in the top two.\n\nThe Huskies lost two starting players to the WNBA, forward Aaliyah Edwards and guard Nika Muhl. The Trojans lost forwards McKenzie Forbes and Kaitlyn Davis, but they still have Rayah Marshall and added Iriafen to their roster. As such, UConn has two big roles to fill, while USC has only strengthened its roster with established college stars.\n\nSince it\u2019ll be the last game of their non-conference schedules, both teams should find themselves in rhythm, having worked out any early-season kinks. If the Trojans can come away with a win against UConn, a national championship is even more firmly on the horizon.\n```"}

It represents the longstanding efforts towards the achievement of equal pay for equal work. According to the U.N., women are paid less than men across all regions: the gender pay gap is estimated to be at around 20 per cent globally. In the United States, women working full time, year round jobs earn about 84 per cent of what men earn, according to federal labor statistics. The pay gap is even more pronounced for women of color, LGBTQ individuals, and those from marginalized communities. For example, the U.N. says Black, Native, and Latina women earn significantly less than white men; Latinas face the biggest pay gap, earning as little as 57 cents on the dollar. Gender pay gaps also apply in journalism. Studies by media companies like the BBC and Gannet have revealed that female journalists earn less than their male colleagues. The International Labor Organization estimates it will take at least until 2086 to achieve wage equality worldwide.\n```"}

Companies like Mattel and Target advertise their collections as Hispanic and Latine representation, but not everyone finds this sudden celebration genuine.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice to see it year \u2018round because when you do it during the month it does come off as a potential money grab. If you do it all year long that would be great because representation always matters. Not just one month out of the twelve,\u201d said computer engineering and computer science junior Jessica Luna. Luna works at La CASA, USC\u2019s Latinx/Chicanx Center for Advocacy and Student Affairs.\n\nLuna was not the only student that wanted to see more representation for the community.

In a Barbie \u201cpodcast\u201d on YouTube, two animated Barbie co-hosts introduced \u201cthe world renowned Chilean-American author, drum roll please, Isabel Allende.\u201d\n\nThe Barbie Podcast released this new episode days after Mattel announced a new Barbie doll honoring Allende. With Barbie being an iconic figure in many children\u2019s lives, Jessica Luna reminisced about toys from her own childhood.\n\n\u201cWhen I was growing up I was also a Barbie kid, but all my Barbies were blonde hair and blue eyes, the only one I did have that was Hispanic was one made after Mia from Rebelde,\u201d Luna said.\n\nOther Latinas have been honored with a Barbie doll during previous Hispanic Heritage Months. Last year, Mattel released a doll honoring iconic Cuban singer Celia Cruz. Cuban-American singer and actress Gloria Estefan was honored with a doll in 2022. Mattel also has a variety of Hispanic and Latine-inspired dolls in various collections that are not confined to Hispanic Heritage Month.\n\n\u201cNow compared to 15 years ago there is a lot more representation ... especially Latino community representation, and I feel that is very valuable thing for young people, like kids right now growing up. To see themselves and being like no, they are being representative,\u201d Falcon said.\n\nThe commercial inclusion and diversity we see today developed over decades since the first official month-long national celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month in 1988, and it is likely to evolve as the celebration continues. Hispanic Heritage Month is far from over. We\u2019re sure to see more companies release merchandise inspired by these cultures in the coming days.\n```"}

(Photo by Kendall Arjoon) \n\nBy Mia Nu\u00f1ez and Jake Petroff September 18, 2024 at 6:46 pm PDT\n\nUSC hosted a panel Wednesday with some of the states leading political experts to discuss 10 separate state propositions, ranging from a minimum wage increases, rent control and harsher penalties for fentanyl dealers. Emily Schultheis, a reporter at POLITICO, broke down one of the most talked about propositions, Prop 36. It attempts to reform a 10 year old measure that back then, loosened penalties around drug and theft crimes. \u201cIt would reimpose some of the felony position, felony designations for repeat offenders of some of these crimes, so People who are repeatedly stealing from from stores,\u201d Schultheis said. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve done that a certain number of times, you would face a felony charge versus a misdemeanor charge. The same thing is true with certain types of drug crimes, including fentanyl.\u201d \n\nThe panelists went on to dive into a number of propositions that could potentially impact USC students specifically. One of these is Prop 32, a change that would raise the states minimum wage, which is currently $16 dollars an hour, by $2 dollars over the next two years. Mindy Romero, director of USC\u2019s Center for Inclusive Democracy said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at $18 an hour, with the exception, of course, of fast food restaurants as well as the healthcare industry, which is that $25 an hour. I think there\u2019s a lot of conversation around this bill. It hits people\u2019s pocketbooks.\u201d \n\nAnother proposition that could affect students is Prop 33, which gives local cities the power to expand rent control. Schultheis also emphasized Prop 35. It is an an effort to make permanent a tax on health insurance providers; the money would be used to reimburse health providers that serve MediCal patients. Many health care providers complain that MediCal does not pay them enough. \u201cWhat prop 35 would do is guarantee that the benefits, or, sorry, the revenue from that tax goes is guaranteed to go toward the Medi Cal program,\u201d Schultheis said. \n\nMore information on all 10 ballot measures can be found at the California Secretary of State website.\n```"}

The booth appeared to be a major hit among students: \u201cThey\u2019re really, really yum, and the chips are, like, really fresh,\u201d said one student, munching on the treats.\n\nThe open-air market is packed from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. every Wednesday. For almost a decade, it\u2019s attracted crowds of USC students interested in healthy food options, or just good food that\u2019s different from what they usually get on campus. Whether it\u2019s trying new foods, visiting with friends, or stocking up on weekly groceries, there really is something for everyone.\n\nSome of the vendors are family businesses who have been selling here for years, like Katherine Aranda of Bonanza Farm. \u201cIt\u2019s like a family owned business,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been running for more than 15 years, starting off with my dad and my uncle, and then it started expanding with all of us ... Every Wednesday we\u2019re here at USC, and then we also do other farmers markets throughout the week as well.\u201d\n\nUSC Health was also there, not selling food, but offering free flu shots. The shots will be offered at the farmer\u2019s market until around November, USC Health staff said. \u201cStudents can just come up, give their USC ID number, fill out a quick form, and they should be in and out with within a couple of minutes,\u201d USC Student Health Ambassador Gray Mandabach said.\n\nSo, for most of this fall, you can get a flu shot along with your lunch.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Thrive Living)\n\nBy Matthew Royer\nSeptember 18, 2024 at 6:25 pm PDT\n\nNear the intersection of La Brea Avenue and Coliseum Street, the leader of a carpenter\u2019s union shouted to his crew Wednesday morning. \u201cAre you guys ready to build this project?\u201d he said. The crew cheered.\n\nThe carpenters were present for the groundbreaking of an 800-unit apartment building, with nearly 200 units set aside for low-income affordable housing. A Costco Wholesale store will serve as a downstairs neighbor and ground-level tenant.\n\nThe building, along with the store, isn\u2019t expected to be finished and open for two and a half years. It will feature a fitness center, community rooms and even a rooftop pool.\n\nIt will be built as the first project in Los Angeles under California\u2019s Affordable Housing and High Road Act that took effect July 1 of last year. The bill is supposed to expedite affordable and sustainable housing projects in communities across California.\n\nCostco estimates that its newest location will provide up to 400 jobs. The store will feature a pharmacy, optical services and a delivery service.\n\nL.A. Mayor Karen Bass said the building and the store will benefit South L.A. by providing retail, housing and jobs without displacing residents. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what Los Angeles needs,\u201d Bass said.\n\nSouth L.A. has long been considered a food desert with limited options for fresh groceries. Kayla De Le Haye, who directs USC\u2019s Institute for Food System Equity, said she was glad to see the groundbreaking of a Costco that local residents can walk to.\n\n\u201cOne in three of our residents are food insecure,\u201d she said. \u201cSo addressing this issue in South L.A. and providing people with more affordable food options is also really in service of trying to help folks that are struggling to get enough food.\u201d\n\nBack at USC, students said they also look forward to the addition of a nearby Costco for buying groceries. First-year business administration major Marissa Sanchez said that while she may only buy groceries when needed at the moment, the opportunity to buy in bulk is enticing.\n\n\u201cThe value\u2019s better,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the membership might be a little bit too expensive for me as of right now.\u201d\n\nJarod Mendoza, a materials engineering graduate student, said he believes students may choose to shop at Costco instead of the USC Village once it opens.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll probably drive away some customers from Target and Trader Joe\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll change our habits for sure.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Robert Westermann)\n\nBy Laya Albert September 18, 2024 at 5:31 pm PDT\n\nAn empty bar, an untouched lost-and-found, burnt cars, bullet hole-ridden porta potties and posters of kidnapped children \u2014 all intentionally placed inside a 50,000-square-foot Culver City warehouse under eerie, neon lighting. The Nova Festival Exhibition is an in-depth memorial to the more than 1,200 victims of the terrorist attack carried out by Hamas on Oct. 7 at the Nova Music Festival in southern Israel\u2019s Negev Desert.\n\nMore than 200 USC students and faculty attended the exhibit on Tuesday evening, sponsored by USC Chabad Jewish student center and USC Tikvah, a new club for Zionist students.\n\n\u201cEmpathy for innocent people should extend to all innocent people,\u201d said Scooter Braun, one of the exhibit\u2019s partners in an interview with Annenberg Media. \u201cEspecially when those kids [killed at the Nova Festival] are just like the kids at USC.\u201d\n\nMostly known as a music mogul, Braun explained that the Nova Festival is no different than Stagecoach, Coachella and Burning Man. Braun partnered with the exhibit and brought it to the United States this year after it premiered in Tel Aviv for 10 weeks. The exhibit first spent two months in New York and then came to Los Angeles in late August. He hopes to bring it to other cities in the future.\n\n\u201cPeople should have enough empathy to come see this [exhibit], and care about these kids, representing over 20 countries and every religion, as much as they have empathy for a kid in Palestine,\u201d said Braun, who is the grandchild of Holocaust concentration camp survivors.\n\nWhen USC students walked through the exhibit doors, their chatter quickly faded as the sound of screams and sirens filled the air. Remnants from the festival\u2019s campgrounds lay scattered on the sandy ground \u2014 abandoned tents, a red and black Nike sneaker, baby wipes and a bottle of Coca-Cola. These were actual items collected from the site of the attack.\n\nShoes left behind at the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel on display at the Nova Music Festival Exhibit in Los Angeles.

Many of the attendees were hiding in the bushes, saying their final goodbyes to their families.\n\n\u201cIt all felt very real,\u201d said Naya Pollack after seeing the exhibition. A junior studying economics and business finance, Pollack\u2019s close family member survived the Nova Festival.\n\n\u201cThis was a really amazing experience that not only Jewish people should go through.\u201d\n\nFollowing the campgrounds display, the exhibit expanded to a room that depicted the festival\u2019s music. USC students stood under the same large, colorful canopy where the nearly 3,000 party-goers danced to trance music on that day. Additional screens displayed in-depth witness testimony of survivors, sharing their interactions with Hamas. There was also footage taken by Hamas.\n\nElia Groode, a senior studying law, history and culture, reflected on a recording of a Hamas member calling his father from an Israeli\u2019s phone.\n\n\u201cAll he wanted to do was share with his father how many people he killed,\u201d she said.\n\nGroode, who is also USC Tikvah\u2019s director of education, visited a memorial at the site of the Nova Festival in Israel this summer. She said the Los Angeles exhibit was almost more powerful and different because \u201cyou felt like you were there at the time of the Nova Festival.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles Nova Music Festival exhibit wall memorializing Israelis killed on Oct. 7.

A slow, instrumental version of the Israeli national anthem, Hatikvah\u2014which translates to \u201cThe Hope\u201d \u2014 filled the room as teary-eyed students read the brief biographies beneath each victim\u2019s smiling headshot.\n\n\u201cThese people are human beings, some of them are around our age,\u201d Groode said. \u201cUnderstanding how they felt is so important.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to come see other people\u2019s stories,\u201d third-year law student Allen Nobel said. The son of Nobel\u2019s cousin was at the festival, and was shot in the arm while witnessing close friends being murdered by Hamas.\n\nThe evening concluded in a brightly lit commemoration room, where students listened to stories from two Nova Festival survivors and from Scooter Braun. They then shared hugs and reflected over falafel and mango nectar.\n\n\u201cPowerful, overwhelming, challenging,\u201d are three words the USC Office of Religious and Spiritual Life\u2019s former interfaith director Jessica Spence Moss said when asked to reflect on the exhibit a day after attending.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for all students to see it,\u201d said Moss, who is currently the Assistant Director of Interfaith programs at California State University, Long Beach.\n\nStudents have another opportunity to view the exhibit this Sunday as part of a group sponsored by USC Hillel. They can also visit independently until the exhibit closes on Oct. 8.\n```"}

The artists \u2013 Sammi Wong, Isabel Jasper and Yoon Seo Lee \u2013 each submitted proposals last spring to showcase their exhibitions, which they began installing \u201cliterally on the first day of school,\u201d said Hattie Schultz, gallery coordinator and postgraduate student in curatorial studies.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with IFT, it can be a very rough place to suddenly get thrown into. We want these student exhibitors to practice not just showing art, but all the aspects of exhibiting that come with that that are not often talked about,\u201d Schultz said, referencing space, lighting, sight lines, and other curatorial considerations.\n\nLee, a junior majoring in fine arts, presented her exhibition \u201cChrysalis,\u201d a representation of familial protection in two distinct tones: warmth and coolness. Being away from her family for almost four years because Lee\u2019s father was ill largely influenced the focus of her work.\n\n\u201cWhen a caterpillar turns into a cocoon, it\u2019s forming its own shield and making its own protection,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI was apart from family, and I still feel like I needed protection in a certain way.\u201d\n\nMany of the artifacts used in her art hold personal meaning for Lee, from paintings of animals shielded in a blanket fabric from her childhood, to a bird\u2019s nest composed of tree branches picked from the garden of a family friend.\n\n\u201cI feel like people all over the world can connect to this theme of protection because all people grew up under their parents, under their protection. I feel like any animals or anything around this warmth could be related to my theme,\u201d Lee said.\n\nThree large-scale photorealistic paintings of Lee were shown side-by-side, showcasing her fluency in traditional forms of art. In the paintings, Lee is featured in her family\u2019s sushi restaurant in Mission Viejo, Orange County, hiding \u201cunderneath the cabinet, and behind the chair, [to] use it as kind of a shield of connection,\u201d according to Lee.\n\n\u201cI like [a] place that I have to hide my emotions,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI also wanted to convey to the audience the other side of the protection. What if I\u2019m surrounded by a cool, impersonal object?\u201d\n\nA cyanotype-colored canvas combines Prussian blue prints of family photos, tulle, lace and string to form a web.\n\n\u201cI love painting, but sometimes I feel like painting is just not enough to convey what I want to tell the audience for sure,\u201d Lee said.\n\nJasper\u2019s exhibit, \u201cGentle Grounds for Seeing,\u201d is a \u201cdemonstration of the process of observation itself,\u201d the senior design major said. The exhibit is informed by her experience with obsessive-compulsive disorder and a universal treatment known as exposure and response prevention, which involves observation as a key component.\n\n\u201cMy OCD usually revolves around these unwanted, really disturbing thoughts, and then the compulsion to do something to get rid of those thoughts, disprove them, or kind of alleviate the anxiety around them, and which then kind of throws you into the cycle,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cObservation has been really significant to me \u2013 just observing my thoughts and when I\u2019m really anxious, taking [in] my surroundings.\u201d\n\nJasper recalled sketching her observations during the summer in her hometown, Marin County, located in the northwestern part of the Bay Area and known for its redwood trees. Throughout the exhibit were patterns found in the natural world accompanied by text.\n\n\u201cThe forest floor is my gentle ground; that is where I feel its gentle energy,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cMy gentle grounds for seeing are where I feel safe enough to observe and where I am brave enough, where I have this ability to just observe and just exist.\u201d\n\nWith a background in typography and publication design, Jasper translated her 2D design knowledge onto the 3D plane \u2013 most apparent in the large wall of sketches and text resembling a grid on Adobe InDesign.\n\n\u201cDesign is like branding, like curating a brand, a visual identity,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cThe entire thing just felt really satisfying. Because I feel like I spent a lot of time making work about this personal topic throughout last year, I feel like I\u2019ve closed a chapter a little bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore is More,\u201d the exhibit curated by junior fine arts major Sammi Wong, considered the illusory culture surrounding competition. A divider made from fabric and burned wood created a sense of \u201ctunnel vision\u201d from the seat of the observer as it obscured the periphery of the exhibit.\n\n\u201cThe subject \u201cmore is more\u201d is more specifically what we see and don\u2019t see in terms of the division of sight, and kind of thinking about what comparatively to other people, what we see as the final product,\u201d Wong said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m looking at other people\u2019s work, there\u2019s so much work that goes [on] in between that it\u2019s kind of lost,\u201d Wong said.\n\nHer creative process itself is intended as a demonstration of this idea. Ceramic structures on display took on a fluid form as Wong emphasized the intuitive process of art rather than methodically planning the finished products.\n\n\u201cGrinding away at this material and then exposing it and letting it come forward when I would burn the wood \u2013 that texture and that pattern kind of comes to the surface and reveals itself,\u201d Wong said. \u201cA lot of it is just kind of like almost retracting, kind of turning off my mind and just working with the material again and creating these organic shapes. It\u2019s going back to obscurity and having an inkling of what someone is working to or towards, but not really getting the full picture.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, curating the pieces took much planning and thought. \u201cEven though I had very minimal pieces, it just took a lot of time, just because it\u2019s like deciding with the other two artists how we\u2019re going to partition divided space, that kind of determines how I\u2019d go about laying out everything. It\u2019s definitely a learning experience, for sure,\u201d Wong said.\n\nThe cycle of installing and showing exhibits repeats every three to four weeks. With the first exhibit of the school year at a close, Schultz hopes to continue teaching students the practical aspects of art.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tedious process in Roski and in the real world,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cNot only do those minor details help to relay the message or theme of a show, but it also makes it more enjoyable for the audience, and when it\u2019s more enjoyable for the audience, then that encourages people to keep viewing your work, which is ultimately how you become a successful artist. Real world art skills aren\u2019t necessarily in the description of displaying art.\u201d```"}

(AP/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Joel Robles September 18, 2024 at 12:19 pm PDT\n\nAlready lost at the bottom of the American League West, the Halos began an end-of-week series against the always-favored Houston Astros on Friday. Rookie starter Sam Aldeghri began the game on the mound and delivered a horrific outing. Aldeghri allowed four earned runs, five walks, six hits, and zero strikeouts in two innings. This was Aldeghri\u2019s third career start and his ERA after Friday\u2019s game inflated to 4.85. However, the bullpen did its job, only allowing one ER in 6 innings.\n\nThe Angels found momentum in the third and fourth innings with three runs altogether but couldn\u2019t get going after that point. Astros\u2019 starter Yusei Kikuchi threw an impressive seven innings of work, allowing only three ERs while throwing six strikeouts. Since being traded to the Astros at the deadline, Kikuchi has a 3.19 ERA and 0.94 WHIP through eight games. After a 5-3 final score, Kikuchi earned the win.\n\nLooking to tie up the series on Saturday, the results were the same, despite the Halos\u2019 efforts. Tyler Anderson started the game and threw a middle-of-the-pack outing, lasting five innings and allowing four ERs. Anderson struggled to keep players off base, allowing seven hits and three walks. Once again, most of the damage was done by the time Anderson left the field; relievers Hunter Strickland, Ryan Zeferjahn and Guillermo Zuniga only allowed one run in four innings. Catcher Logan O\u2019Hoppe had a great showing with two hits, one RBI and scoring a run. On the season, O\u2019Hoppe has 55 RBIs and 19 HRs\u2014one of the few bright spots on a forgettable Angels season.\n\nThree-time Cy Young winner Justin Verlander was on the bump for the Astros and threw a serviceable game, especially considering how Verlander\u2019s season has gone. During his five innings of work, Verlander gave up two earned runs, four hits and walked a couple. The Angels were down three runs heading into the eighth and managed to pull one run back, but were left needing more. With bases loaded and only one out, Astros reliever Ryan Pressly shut down the chance of any comeback with a 1.2 inning save, his fourth of the season.\n\nLooking for some sort of spark in the final game of this three-round series, nothing seemed to work for the Angels. The same old story repeated itself, as Caden Dana had a pitiful game. Dana only managed to stay in the game for 3.1 innings, allowing four earned runs in the process. Dana just couldn\u2019t locate the strike zone as he walked two batters and surrendered five hits. Miraculously, the Angels bullpen once again did its job and threw a gem. It did not allow any runs in the following five innings and the Halos almost made the comeback, scoring all four runs in the eighth and ninth. Taylor Ward started the offensive run with a solo homer to bring it within five. In his last 15 games, Ward has produced a .302 average, .696 slugging percentage and six homers. Heading into the final out in the ninth, rookie Zach Neto\u2014up against the heat-throwing closer Josh Hader\u2014could\u2019ve tied the game with a man on first, but ultimately couldn\u2019t capitalize.\n\nThe Angels record dropped to 60-90 after the swept and lost the first game of a three game series to the MLB-worst 36-115 Chicago White Sox. The Halos will hope for a turnaround series against one of the worst baseball teams of all time.\n```"}

We need help, and we need to put the right person in office,\u201d Agboola said. \u201cThat will be able to get us that help and be able to get us back up and running.\u201d Katie Howard, a sophomore biomedical major said she is concerned with the rulings lawmakers are implementing that she believes are hurting people and hurting the future of the country. \u201cI don\u2019t really like the trajectory that we\u2019re moving right now, especially with stuff like Chevron getting overturned,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about where we\u2019re headed.\u201d The overturn of Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council changed how regulatory agencies prompt challenges in the courts instead of the use of executive power. It affects federal agencies that regulate the environment, health care and consumer safety, according to  The New York Times . Leslie Rodriguez, a senior student majoring in computer engineering science, said that the most concerning issue for her as a first-time voter is abortion and education, as it\u2019s the heaviest topic right now. Since the overturn of Roe v. Wade in 2022, many states have implemented bans and restrictions that prevent women from having the right to an abortion. In states with restrictions, it has made it difficult for doctors to perform abortion procedures due to law restrictions that can cost them their careers and be arrested. School education has become a wide issue in many states that have banned books from school libraries and public libraries that talk about LGBTQ+ rights or race. States with education restrictions have reshaped how educators teach race specifically, banning critical race theory from being taught. First-time voters want USC to do more in guiding other first-time voters who feel confused or need support on how to vote or even how they should register to vote. Some first-time voters feel lost about how they are going to vote in the November election and need the university to reach out to students with information. Benjamin Ro, a junior student majoring in biological sciences with an emphasis in biotechnology, said that he mainly has been researching his information online in his own time and feels USC is not providing resources for the election. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure, because I don\u2019t really know what USC offers. I just been doing a lot of more, just like reading up on the news.\u201d Said Ro. In terms of registering, how to vote. I\u2019m not really familiar with, like, what services are here [at USC]. First-time voters emphasize that after the November presidential election, they plan to continue to vote in future elections. Are you a first-time voter? The University of Southern California  website outlines the steps on how to register as well as providing more information for students who are out of state. The deadline to register to vote in the state of California is Oct. 21. For additional information on voting, visit  Vote .\n```"}

Here\u2019s how to stay safe at USC\n\nStudents, alumni and USC\u2019s Chief Health Officer recommend their best practices for students to prevent overdoses and access resources.\n\nTeam Awareness Combating Overdose (TACO) Inc. is a USC-born nonprofit that was founded in 2020 after four students died from accidental fentanyl overdoses in 2019. (Photo courtesy of TACO USC)\n\nBy Kate Stuzin and Sophie Sullivan September 18, 2024 at 11:30 am PDT\n\nUSC is back up and running \u2014 not just on campus, but at parties, tailgates and social gatherings for students new and returning. For many students, that means party culture is back. But something that\u2019s never left? Accidental fentanyl overdoses in Los Angeles. In fact, they\u2019re not leaving \u2014 but dangerously on the rise.\n\nLos Angeles County\u2019s most recent report on fentanyl overdoses, published in July, showed that deaths have almost doubled in the last decade. It remains the leading cause of death of adults through the age of 45, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nNow, students are again pushing to get education on how to use nasal naloxone, or Narcan \u2014 a life-saving medication that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose \u2014 into dorms. And USC Student Health, student organizations and alumni spoke out on their advice for students navigating a safer return to campus.\n\nIn light of September\u2019s National Recovery Month, here\u2019s what to know about fentanyl, where to find Narcan, how to use it and why it matters that you know.\n\nHow deadly is fentanyl?\n\nFentanyl is an opioid that has become widespread in drug markets over the last decade. In Los Angeles County, accidental deaths by overdoses have increased by about 68 times since 2014 \u2014 and over 3,000 Angelenos died from fentanyl last year alone.\n\n\u201cIt has been one of the most devastating public health challenges we face as a nation over the last 10 years,\u201d USC\u2019s Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said of the opioid crisis. \u201cIt continues to unfortunately impact so many people, and higher-ed and college campuses have not remained immune from this.\u201d\n\nThe drug is about 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Experts say a strawberry-seed amount of fentanyl is enough to kill an adult, and it can start to kill in two minutes.\n\nHow do you stop an overdose?\n\nRecognizing the rapidly growing crisis, the Food and Drug Administration approved nasal Narcan, or naloxone, as a treatment for overdoses. If you suspect someone is overdosing, and they are unable to wake up or breathe properly, using Narcan is simple: Insert the nozzle into either nostril and press the plunger to give a dose. It\u2019s good to know that there are few side effects of Narcan if the person is not overdosing \u2014 and Narcan works on any opioids. But since opioids can stay in the body longer than Narcan does, multiple doses may be necessary.\n\nThe key point is access. Van Orman said it\u2019s easier than ever to get Narcan, since laws on distribution have relaxed over the last few years.\n\n\u201cNow, we\u2019re able to really just provide it to anyone with just-in-time training,\u201d Van Orman said.\n\nWhere do you get Narcan?\n\nFor almost a year, USC has offered Narcan and testing strips to students free-of-charge, no-questions-asked at the Engemann and Eric Cohen Student Health Centers, as well as the Wednesday farmers markets in McCarthy Quad. It\u2019s part of an effort by NaloxoneSC, a graduate student and university partnership to prevent opioid overdoses through education, resource distribution and destigmatization.\n\nOver the last few years, USC students have emerged as a leader in prevention education amid the opioid crisis. Team Awareness Combating Overdose (TACO) Inc. is a USC-born nonprofit that was founded in 2020 after four students died from accidental fentanyl overdoses in 2019. TACO hosts weekly distributions of fentanyl test strips at stands at the Hoover campus entrance, and along the Row on Tuesdays and Fridays. They provide test strips at a subsidized cost to on-campus delivery services SNAG and Duffl. Many Greek life organizations order test strips in bulk from TACO to protect their members.\n\nTACO also offers Narcan training to on-campus organizations for free, and posts harm reduction methods on their social media (@taco.usc on Instagram, and @tacoinc_ on Instagram and TikTok).\n\nTACO Executive Director and senior majoring in pharmacology and drug development, Reem Alharithi said her main goal is to \u201cprevent accidental drug exposure.\u201d\n\n\u201cTest every single substance and carry nasal Naloxone, because you never know who around you may be overdosing, and you never know whether a drug that you are taking has illicit fentanyl, if you yourself did not pick it up from a licensed pharmacy or dispensary,\u201d Alharithi said.\n\nThe difficult road to getting Narcan in dorms\n\nAfter a string of overdoses claimed four students\u2019 lives, students sought to get Narcan made available in dorms, like UCLA currently offers. In 2020, Van Orman said USC was not considering it because data showed upperclassmen, who typically live off-campus, were most at-risk.\n\nThen in 2022, Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Brianna Sanchez \u2014 then a freshman and general member on the Wellness Committee \u2014 re-opened the conversation with a project proposal that she and the committee presented to the Office for Residential Education. She advocated for training resident assistants (RAs) in how to use Narcan and to equip them with it.\n\nIn response, she was told Residential Education didn\u2019t want to \u201cput [RAs] in that type of situation where they feel like they need to save someone\u2019s life,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nAfter proposing to have Narcan available in dorm lobbies for students to take, like Student Health Centers, Sanchez said she was told \u201cthey didn\u2019t want to endorse the use of narcotics, and that a situation like this has never happened on campus.\u201d\n\nThough disappointed, Sanchez diverted her efforts to partnering with NaloxoneSC and Van Orman, developing workshops for RAs, students and faculty to get trained whenever and wherever, a program she says has had some success.\n\nStill, she passed the project down to her now-Executive Aide to the Vice President Varun Tummalapalli. The university would not say whether they would make Narcan available in dorms, instead encouraging students, departments, clubs and leaders to visit its online resources page and to request prevention training alongside Narcan distribution.\n\n\u201cThis \u2018train the trainer\u2019 approach ensures education and awareness are combined with the distribution,\u201d the university said. \u201cIt helps socialize and normalize carrying Narcan. It also ensures the reversal medication is more widely accessible to the community.\u201d\n\nTummalapalli, also a former Wellness Committee member, said he reshaped the project to get those workshops offered and incentivized inside of residence halls and make Narcan available at meetings.\n\nOn September 9, he received a green light from the student-led Residential Housing Association (RHA), a liaison to Residential Education.\n\n\u201cThey were very open and supportive of the initiative,\u201d Tummalapalli said, and despite Residential Education having \u201cgiven [them] trouble in the past two years ... RHA only had positive things to say about the new ResEd Director, Shigeo Iwamiya,\u201d who must approve the project next.\n\nStudents, past and present, speak out\n\nBecause the crisis has grown rapidly in the last decade, it emerged as a challenge uniquely facing this generation. But one USC alumna has advocated for the issue publicly and in front of Congress.\n\nFormer California congresswoman Mary Bono is one of the many politicians calling for the implementation of Narcan as part of emergency protocol and rigorous drug education programs in schools \u2014 namely at USC.\n\n\u201cYou start with naloxone. It should be accessible, readily available,\u201d she said. \u201cThere should be resources on it, training kids to use it, training professors to use it. It should be more ubiquitous on a college campus than a defibrillator ... If I were Dr. Folt, that\u2019s what I would do.\u201d\n\nAnother part of Bono\u2019s strategy is destigmatization. She said creating a network that extends beyond the school environment is crucial to having true open dialogues with students, parents and the broader community.\n\n\u201cThe number one problem is people think it\u2019s not going to happen to them, and if we can get over that hurdle, and talk to people in the loving kind way about raising the dangers of drugs and how important it is to carry naloxone, we\u2019ll make change,\u201d she said.\n\nBono recognized how the landscape has changed since her college days: Today\u2019s dealers are not just street-level operatives but sophisticated transnational criminal organizations and cartels.\n\n\u201cIt was just a different time. It\u2019s not the same, and the risk is so much bigger,\u201d Bono said. \u201cIf you would have told me as a senior at USC, one day there\u2019s going to be pills on campus that you take one and you might not make it through the day, I couldn\u2019t have even imagined that.\u201d\n\nTACO Executive Director Alharithi agreed. She said TACO reduces accidental overdose through two main arms: peer-to-peer education and harm-reduction supplies.\n\n\u201cBoth of our essential efforts are equally important because without the education about fentanyl and drug use, people wouldn\u2019t use the tools,\u201d she said. \u201cIf people don\u2019t know about what fentanyl is and why it\u2019s so dangerous, no one\u2019s going to use the fentanyl test strips, and no one\u2019s going to carry Narcan.\u201d\n\nDealers use fentanyl to bulk up their supply of Xanax, Adderall, OxyContin or other drugs because of its low cost and highly addictive nature. These potent, counterfeit pills \u2014 often marketed as prescription Percocet or oxycodone \u2014 are easily accessible through social media or from friends, usually costing only a few dollars each.\n\n\u201cThe problem is these illicit pills,\u201d Bono said. \u201cThey\u2019re manufactured in such horrible labs and part of the pill can have fentanyl in it, and part of the pill might not have fentanyl in it. So if you try a fentanyl test strip, you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re actually testing the part of the pill where the fentanyl is.\u201d\n\nBono finished her congressional term in 2013, but that hasn\u2019t stopped her from continuing to advocate for both national and state level policy. As the CEO and Chair of Mothers Against Prescription Drug Abuse, she spearheaded a letter this past August alongside other nonprofits to all U.S. governors detailing steps each state can take to mitigate the opioid epidemic.\n\n\u201cCongress is finally awakened to this problem. A decade ago, they were not really engaging. They know we need more funding,\u201d Bono said. \u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s reauthorizing legislation that has to happen. The hurdles aren\u2019t philosophical disagreements between Republicans and Democrats. The hurdles, unfortunately, this year [are] the calendar timing of election year and other priorities.\u201d```"}

Personal, private, powerful.\u201d (Photo by Laurenz Heymann/Unsplash)\n\nBy Mysha Amir September 18, 2024 at 11:13 am PDT\n\nOn Sept. 16, Apple released their new update, with a new iPhone, watch, and airpod models available for purchase starting Friday, Sept. 20th. Apple describes the new iPhone 16 as \u201cnew display technology,\u201d with a more durable build, a better camera, longer battery life and a heavy integration of AI technology with \u201cgroundbreaking privacy.\u201d New AI technology now allows AI to access editing of photos, text, and other detailed information through Siri, all features advertised to enhance the user experience.\n\nReactions geared towards the new update seem doubtful, as students find the yearly updates to be nothing out of the ordinary. Esteban Vargas, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, said he feels that the new iPhones are redundant. \u201cThere\u2019s a new version coming out, like every year,\u201d Vargas said. Eliza Torres, a freshman studying industrial and systems engineering, seemed to share the same concern. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the new products aren\u2019t really that different anymore. Aside from adding a couple new features, it\u2019s really not worth paying to just get a whole new product when it\u2019s barely different,\u201d she said.\n\nAlong with the students finding Apple\u2019s yearly updates to be less and less impressive, Jonathan May, a research associate professor of computer science at the CS department in the Viterbi School described the reactions of attendees at a recent meeting with political leaders as being \u201cunderwhelmed with what was coming out.\u201d The doubtful reactions with the release itself were followed by hesitant reactions towards the new AI technology and Apple\u2019s promise of groundbreaking privacy.\n\nThese new capabilities of AI technology, such as the ability to remove objects from images and booking a flight entirely through Siri, highlight concerns of privacy in potential users of the product. Natalia Hernandez, an electrical and computer engineering major, said she\u2019s worried about her security. \u201cHow is it going to be trained, and will it be continuously trained with our personal data, such as phones and text messages? That\u2019s a major security concern I think a lot of people have,\u201d Hernandez said. She doubts that Apple would give users the privacy that they want.\n\nProfessor May further described the lack of confirmation when it comes to promising privacy for users: \u201cThe data leaves the phone a lot, right? And once it leaves the phone, even if it\u2019s going somewhere secure, [it] could get leaked, right?\u201d He further described how humans tend to be fairly willing to give up their privacy without realizing it and processing the consequences.\n\nAs AI becomes more prevalent and an easily accessible part of an individual\u2019s everyday lives, which raises concerns about AI\u2019s heavy integration in one\u2019s general day-to-day life. \u201cI think AI can do a lot, but I think people aren\u2019t using it in the way they should be,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cAI should not be trying to replace jobs ... it should mostly just be making things more convenient.\u201d Torres shared a similar sentiment as she described how AI should be used to help others, like people with disabilities with tasks they are unable to do at home or work, such as opening the light or similar simple tasks.\n\nMay described how AI technology has the potential of diminishing human interaction, which has the opposite effect on society as it should. \u201cI would ideally like to generate...systems that help people be better humans...to work on the things they want to do,\u201d he said.\n\nOverall, Apple users were unimpressed with Apple\u2019s new release. So I don\u2019t think that Apple\u2019s, the technology that they were showing, is necessarily so groundbreaking or is unlike anything that we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d May said. \u201cBut what it is, is it\u2019s democratized, and relatively democratized in terms of availability.\u201d Hernandez ended her interview with her final remark about Apple: \u201cInstead of trying to keep up with trends, I think Apple should really look into developing something new. It\u2019s about time.\u201d```"}

For many like Julian, Amini\u2019s death felt like a wake-up call for people to address the social and political issues of Iran more candidly, and to come together as a community to strive for change in hopes of Iranian women\u2019s rights and freedoms.\n\n\u201cI think people are more willing to be themselves and feel more free and empowered, and if they do go against the government, that they\u2019re not alone in it,\u201d Julian said.\n\nJulian believes there is a lot more work to be done by the international community to support the rights of Iranian women. \u201cI feel like every country or internationally, they\u2019re just worried about themselves, which is fair, but I feel like if we were to support Iran\u2019s people and actually make a difference, then it would be possible,\u201d she said.\n\nKamyar Moradi, a journalism student at USC, participated in the protests in 2022 while he was in Montreal visiting family. \u201cNext thing you know you see like some streets closed, and you see like this like noise that just gets louder and louder,\u201d Moradi said, \u201cand then all I could see was ... just what felt like a mass of culture and a mass of ... people who wanted just to fight, people who wanted justice.\u201d\n\nProtesting Amini\u2019s death made Iranians like Moradi feel closer to their cultural values. \u201cI heard someone describe what it meant to be like from Iranian descent, and it\u2019s (that) you kinda have to have optimism built into you because if you don\u2019t, then you\u2019ll let the reality of your situation consume you,\u201d Moradi said.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Iranian authorities have continued to suppress the rights of women and girls, along with freedom of expression, in the aftermath of Amini\u2019s death and the Women, Life, Freedom movement.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/09/17/the-aftermath-of-diddys-indictment/", "response": "```\nHip-hop music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was arrested Monday night following a grand jury indictment on sex trafficking and racketeering charges. The indictment comes after years of abuse allegations. The indictment alleges that since 2008, Combs has abused, threatened and coerced women and others. It also alleges he led a racketeering conspiracy that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor and kidnapping, among other things.\n\nFor fans of hip-hop, the indictment is heartbreaking -- even if not unexpected. Combs\u2019 former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, filed a lawsuit last year accusing him of abuse. Earlier this year, CNN obtained a 2016 hotel surveillance video in which Combs is seen physically assaulting Ventura.\n\nWe took to the USC campus to gauge the larger cultural impact that Diddy\u2019s indictment is having on hip-hop amid the resurrecting #MeToo movement. Jade Gibbs, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, said Diddy\u2019s indictment has been a long time coming. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of rumors about his activities just through [being] a pop culture junkie,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cBut to see it actually come to fruition, and see him actually get charged with...and have consequences for his actions is honestly very vindicating.\u201d\n\nIn Gibbs\u2019 eyes, the indictment is just the tip of the iceberg. She hopes it will encourage more people to speak out about sexual abuse. \u201cI think that the more and more that they press to get justice for not only Cassie...or just for people in general that were on Bad Boy Records, because I feel like there\u2019s a lot more stories that we are not hearing, either due to NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) or just due to being scared to say something and in fear of retaliation,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just glad that they feel comfortable enough to come out and speak out against it after being silenced for so long.\u201d\n\nThe indictment of the hip-hop icon has a particular impact on the Black community at large, said Miki Turner, a Professor of Professional Practice of Journalism at USC. \u201cYou know, I think any time something like this happens to a member of the Black community, it hits us all in different ways,\u201d Turner said. \u201cI think honestly, everyone\u2019s first reaction is always, how could this happen? Why did this happen, and...what message is this sending to our kids?\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the ongoing conversation about sexual harassment and violence against women. \u201cSo that\u2019s what...will be really interesting to see,\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd you know, what it does to the #MeToo movement? That\u2019s a movement that really is never going to die because there are still people out there doing nefarious things to women in the entertainment industry and in the political arena and other places. So, you know, this is just one more incident.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to separating art from the artist, Turner thinks this might prove difficult. \u201cI think this is going to be one of those situations where as creative as he\u2019s been, as successful as he\u2019s been, as innovative as he\u2019s been, this is going to be the thing that people remember,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he goes down for this, which it looks like he very well may go down for it, that\u2019s going to be his lasting legacy. So, you know, that\u2019s a shame. Yeah, it really is a shame.\u201d\n\nDiddy was denied bail after pleading not guilty on the sex trafficking charges. For now, he will remain in custody.\n```"}

The Dr. Allen and Charlotte Ginsburg Human-Centered Computation Hall \u2014 USC\u2019s first platinum-certified LEED building \u2014 will house the Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science and the newly formed School of Advanced Computing under the Viterbi School of Engineering.\n\nLeadership in Energy and Environmental Design, also known as LEED certification, refers to a set of construction guidelines established by the U.S. Green Building Council as a framework for creating environmentally sustainable buildings. Platinum is the highest level possible.\n\nTim Cowell, Viterbi\u2019s director of space planning and design, said \u201cno expense was spared\u201d in the planning and construction process for the building. \u201cPlatinum is a north star and very hard to achieve, but you have to understand from day one that that\u2019s what your goal is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to get it right.\u201d\n\nCowell said the final budget for the building stood at $130 million, an increase from the initial estimate of $90 million set in 2019. The project was in part made possible by a donation from philanthropists Dr. Allen and Charlotte Ginsburg, who in recent years have made similar contributions to establish scientific research centers at the California Institute of Technology and the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nAllen and Charlotte Ginsburg, as well as USC President Carol Folt, were in attendance on Tuesday, delivering remarks at the opening address prior to the ribbon cutting ceremony\n\nNenad Medvidovi\u0107, chair of the department of computer science, said after working at USC for almost 26 years, the opening of the Ginsburg building felt \u201ccompletely unreal.\u201d \u201cThe primary building for CS was [Grace Ford Salvatori Hall], which is a relatively small building that was built in the 1970s and it\u2019s not a very large space,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d have to find the space for everything. \u2018Let\u2019s meet, where are we going to meet? What time? How do we book?\u2019 And so on.\u201d\n\nMedvidovi\u0107 added he and other faculty members were involved in the design process of the building from its early stages. \u201cThings that were burning needs for us that we couldn\u2019t really realize with the space that we had, that was all in a way baked into the design of the building itself,\u201d he said.\n\nThe computer science department is made up of close to 6000 students across its undergraduate and graduate programs and employs 100 full-time faculty. The new building includes several new facilities, including a cyber physical systems lab, a server room for artificial intelligence research and a two-story \u201cdrone aviary\u201d for indoor testing of drone technology.\n\nMany graduate students were in attendance at Tuesday\u2019s event, some of whom conducted live demonstrations of their lab projects in action. Nathan Dennler, a fifth-year PhD student in computer science, presented a robot with the ability to respond to thumbs-up and thumbs-down hand signals, originally designed to interact with children who have cerebral palsy.\n\nDennler said he was looking forward to a building design more conducive to working with other students and faculty. \u201cCurrently we\u2019re in Ronald Tutor Hall. All the labs are very separated and segmented by physical walls, which I hear is not the case here,\u201d they said. \u201cSo it should help promote collaboration.\u201d\n\nAmy O\u2019Connell, a fourth-year PhD student in computer science, shared her work on a robot named \u201cBlossom,\u201d programmed to deliver guided meditation exercises. She shared a similar sentiment on the design of the new building. \u201cI\u2019m excited to have a collaborative space with all of the other robotics students, so that we can be more in tune with what each other is working on,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cBecause we have really cool stuff going on.\u201d\n\nCowell noted in addition to an expansion of collaborative space, Viterbi students will have access to 19 customizable \u201cprivacy pods\u201d to study or relax in. Users can make changes to settings such as the lighting level, color and geographical environment. Four of these pods will be reservable for non-Viterbi students as well.\n\n\u201cYou can reserve them, and you can take your time and meditate,\u201d Cowell said. \u201cYou can do whatever you need to in that space ... I think as a gift to students, that is a great place for students to go and just have a moment.\u201d\n```"}

This exhibition is presented in partnership with the National Geographic Society and the National Museum of Wildlife Art, and supported through the patronship of Jacques Marie Mago.\n\nBy Angie Pulmano\nSeptember 17, 2024 at 6:24 pm PDT\n\nToday, the National History Museum opened a new exhibit featuring National Geographic photographer Ronan Donovan\u2019s images of the North American wolf population. \u201cWolves are a keystone species, meaning that their presence on the landscape is one that has cascading effects,\u201d Donovan explains in a video excerpt from the exhibit. Donovan is a field biologist-turned-National Geographic photographer who has documented the secret lives of wolves in North America, with an emphasis on the wolf population in Yellowstone National Park.\n\nThe exhibit is a mix of photographs and video documentary that shows Donovan on his adventures through North America, setting up camera traps. Throughout the video, Donovan tells the story of the wolves he photographs. \u201cFor 70 years, there were no wolves in Yellowstone, and what began to happen was this slow unraveling of the tapestry of the ecosystem,\u201d he explains in the video. \u201cEssentially, elk numbers started to skyrocket. There were thousands of elk that were starving to death through winter because they had already overgrazed the landscape.\u201d Wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone beginning in the 1990s.\n\nLate Tuesday morning, guests slowly trickled into the gallery to take in the striking images. In one photo, a white-furred wolf with piercing gray eyes peers through the ribcage of a discarded animal carcass, scavenging for more. Another photo shows a bird\u2019s-eye view of a pack of gray wolves investigating grizzly bear tracks in the Yellowstone snow.\n\nSome guests, like Jeanne Wade, came to the exhibit as avid wolf enthusiasts and fans of Donovan\u2019s work. \u201cWolves,\u201d she said, \u201cWe would love to see one. We came here to the museum to see this exhibit, and we\u2019re also going to see this individual in Thousand Oaks in May. He\u2019s giving a talk, so we\u2019re looking forward to that.\u201d Other guests stumbled upon the gallery by chance. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that it was a wolf exhibition,\u201d said Fernando Berdaguer, a physician visiting from Uruguay. \u201cWe find it very interesting that [it] really brings up a consciousness about the wolf, needing of care and preservation. I think it\u2019s a very good thing that we can all take a look, have a chance to learn about these beautiful animals. They are endangered, like many other ones.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Park Service, some of the greatest threats to the wolf population have been habitat destruction and extermination programs. Museum guest Quingzhi Wong said he\u2019s been to Yellowstone but has never seen a wolf in the wild. \u201cI only see the wolves in the zoos,\u201d he said. The Greater Yellowstone Coalition tracks the wolf population in the national park, and reports that approximately 500 wolves are present throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem due to conservation efforts.\n\nDonovan worked with scientists back in 2014 helping to reintroduce wolves back into the ecosystem. \u201cI hope these images pull people in to the lives of wolves to give them a better understanding of the benefits wolves have to a functional ecosystem,\u201d Donovan says in the video documentary, \u201cand draw people into discussions about whether humans and wolves can coexist on the same landscape.\u201d The exhibit runs until June of next year.\n```"}

DragCon 2022. (Photo courtesy of Wikimedia Commons)\n\nBy The Angel September 17, 2024 at 5:46 pm PDT\n\nAficionados of the beloved series \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d are treated to a high-fashion runway spectacle weekly, which made its way to the Emmys on Sunday. Vying for a consecutive victory in the \u2018Outstanding Reality Competition Program\u2019 category among ten other nominations, each member of the 14-person cast showcased a look crafted by an independent designer.\n\nThe first eliminated contestant, Hershii LiqCour-Jet\u00e9, donned a chocolate velvet gown adorned with golden appliqu\u00e9s crafted by LaBling by Vontez. Hershii was deliberate in her choice of designer, honoring her St. Louis roots, in what she described as her final \u201cDrag Race\u201d appearance. The fabric\u2019s embrace of Hershii\u2019s curves and its movement on the red carpet was so compelling, it was surprising to learn that there had been a last minute change to the look. \u201cThe horns that were on the front, I kind of curled them over because they were flapping all over the place,\u201d Hershii said. \u201cI was supposed to have a breastplate but the breastplate didn\u2019t get here on time.\u201d Complete with an updo by Gee L. Walton, this classic red carpet ensemble harks back to the traditional pageantry of the drag community, countering the recent minimalist trend. \u201cI wanted to bring drag to the Emmys [...] I want to get back to big drag. Big hair. Big dresses. No room for anything. Unnecessarily large,\u201d Hershii said.\n\nMirage emerged as one of the standout stars of Season 16, captivating audiences with her performance of \u201cShe\u2019s Such a Bitch\u201d during the talent show of the first episode. Mirage described her style humorously as \u201cvery colorful, kind of like a stripper who shops at Claire\u2019s.\u201d Yet, this Las Vegas showgirl has since evolved her aesthetic. With Mirage donning a green gown accentuated by nude panels and strategically placed rhinestones that highlighted her svelte figure, this look was expertly executed. The green appliqu\u00e9s that extended from her dress to her gray wig, creating a seamless visual connection. The integration of couture hair has become a pervasive trend across LGBTQ+ nightlife, and Mirage delivered a masterclass in its application. Complemented by matching green earrings and beaded fringe, Mirage demonstrated that Sin City continues to produce some of the most luminous talents to grace the show.\n\nAmanda Tori Meating\u2019s ensemble seemed to echo her \u201cRuveal Yourself\u201d runway look, matured and refined. She wore a purple gown by independent designer Andrew Shields, elegantly complemented by a lime green ostrich feather boa \u2014 a striking choice that highlighted her silhouette perfectly. The gown featured a plunging neckline and a sharply pointed bodice, enhancing her figure. The lime green detailing at her waist and the feathers in her hair, which she crafted herself, cohesively tied the look together. However, if there\u2019s one aspect that felt slightly discordant, it was the wig by Bitchcraft. While the wig itself was flawlessly constructed, the gray color choice seemed misplaced against the vibrant purple and lime green, a somewhat muddled palette that detracted from the overall impact of the outfit.\n\nGeneva Karr\u2019s most acclaimed looks and acts have paid tribute to her Mexican heritage, reflecting her upbringing in Brownsville, Texas, along the U.S.-Mexico border. At the Emmys, Geneva had much to demonstrate, yet her red carpet look left something to be desired. While Geneva\u2019s overall silhouette was visually appealing and her vision clear, the choice of gold in her garment was slightly amiss, photographing weakly (the gold she opted for was a true metallic, which runs the risk of casting undesirable green undertones). The gown, designed by Texas\u2019s own Rico Cavalli, included black ruffles around the waistline \u2014 a perplexing addition. A more cinched waist without the ruffles might have accentuated her stunning hourglass figure more. The rhinestones on her gloves fragmented the outfit\u2019s cohesion. Had they matched those on the dress, it could have unified the look. Instead, they appeared disjointed, as if drawn from disparate visions.\n\nMegami stepped onto the Emmys red carpet channeling Lydia (most recently, Winona Ryder) from the 1988 film \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d \u2014 albeit with a twist. Megami\u2019s affinity for cosplay made her choice to adopt this theme unsurprising. However, the execution was, regrettably, less than stellar. Her reinterpretation involved a slit in the dress to reveal classic Beetlejuice-esque black and white pin stripes \u2014 an addition that felt forced. This was particularly evident in the incongruent pairing with red shoes. The dress itself \u2014 crafted by designer Whitney Newman \u2014 was impeccably constructed. Yet, it was the deviation from the iconic look where the concept faltered.\n\nXunami Muse\u2019s journey on the show was marked by consistently being placed as \u201csafe\u201d \u2014 neither a standout nor underperforming \u2014 until her elimination. Unfortunately, this trend seemed to persist at the Emmys. Adorned in a \u201cRevenge Dress\u201d style gown in red from the fashion brand Noid, her look felt somewhat plain compared to her peers. While the Emmys often celebrate classic beauty, and Xunami\u2019s makeup beautifully aligned with this theme, one could argue she might have ventured further.\n\nPlasma hails from the vibrant streets of NYC with a background in classical Broadway training. On Sunday, she channeled Marilyn Monroe with a classic blonde wig. She collaborated with LizDress, a company known for recreating iconic movie and celebrity dresses at affordable prices, to replicate Monroe\u2019s gown from \u201cThere\u2019s No Business Like Show Business.\u201d The gown mirrored the original with its dramatic flair, featuring a square neckline, a snugly fitted bodice and a fluted bottom transitioning into an ombre of blues. The gown\u2019s embellishments were a joint effort with castmate Dawn, Megami and Plasma herself, resulting in an impeccable presentation.\n\nMhi\u2019ya Iman Le\u2019Paige\u2019s memorable entrance line, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t set the bar; she flips it,\u201d perfectly encapsulated her performance ethos, and it was a sentiment she lived up to at the Emmys. For the evening, Mhi\u2019ya opted for a stunning velvet gown in black, designed by Leonardo Alvarez, which gracefully highlighted her figure. The pairing of black with white crystal rhinestones exuded a luxurious aura. The only minor critique would be the asymmetry in the embellishments, possibly a result of the delicate nature of the garment during transport.\n\nDawn appeared not just of another era but from another world altogether. Her presence guarantees something visually striking and inventively conceived, never just for shock value but always imbued with clear intentionality. Her keen eye for aesthetics was on full display on Sunday. Donning a gown she designed, crafted by NYC costume designer Beck Jones, the gown was nothing short of magnificent, tailored flawlessly to her form. The artful incorporation of fur and feathers not only on the gown but extended to the nails, neck and hair was sheer genius.\n\nMorphine Love Dion, the BBL Queen, the Mug of Season 16 and the Lip Sync Assassin, has a litany of titles that speak volumes to her indelible impact on the show. Striding into the Emmys, Morphine was on a mission to dazzle \u2014 and she did. Dressed in a gown by Mulan Gabby, with hair styled by Thomas Mata and adorned with jewelry by Reikolyn, Morphine\u2019s ensemble was the epitome of drag excellence. The puffed sleeves lent her arms a delicate appearance and her braided ponytail elegantly draped in front of the gown added a touch of grace.\n\nQ took a different route at the Emmys, presenting her own designs, embodying both the creator and the muse on the red carpet \u2014 a bold and somewhat risky endeavor that highlighted her dedication to her craft. This move paid off, displaying her clear understanding and execution of high fashion. The ensemble she chose lacked notable flaws. From the precision of her eyeliner and the style of her hair to her selection of jewelry, every element was harmoniously integrated.\n\nPlane Jane\u2019s look was a bold statement, and while it may not have been to everyone\u2019s taste, it was undoubtedly memorable.\n\nSapphira is undeniably a multifaceted queen \u2014 excelling in fashion, singing, acting, delivering comedic one-liners, dancing and performing. With such a stellar track record on the runway, expectations are invariably high. However, her latest appearance felt like a rare miss. While the brown quilted fabric of her gown, designed by OminousBreakfast, was undoubtedly cozy and well-constructed, it simply didn\u2019t captivate.\n\nNymphia Wind\u2019s banana-themed outfit, a direct extension of her recurring motif throughout the season, strikes a balance between cartoonish whimsy and runway glamor. Her presentation resonates as a clever, if not poetic, commentary on the nature of drag itself \u2014 fun, irreverent and not to be taken too seriously.\n\nDespite not clinching the award for \u2018Outstanding Reality Program\u2019 at the Emmys, Season 16 of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d affirmed that drag queens are an essential and dazzling part of the red carpet landscape. Their presence challenges traditional norms and expectations, showcasing that fashion doesn\u2019t need to conform to conventional standards of glamor. This shift towards more expressive and individualistic presentations on the red carpet is not just about aesthetics but is also a broader commentary on creativity and self-expression in tumultuous times. \u201cWith everything that\u2019s going on in the world, be extra! Be loud! Bigger hair! Bigger clothes,\u201d Hershii said. \u201cAnd when someone asks you, \u2018For what?\u2019 Just because it\u2019s Tuesday. That\u2019s why! Make every day the Met Gala.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2024/09/17/the-medium-is-transient/", "response": "```\nTransient: lasting only for a short time; impermanent. All of our moments are just that\u2014moments. They are temporary, ending and beginning with rapidity: our minds will soon forget them. This is our medium of existence, living in each moment, anticipating the next, repeating the process endlessly. I feel that we understand the concept that time passes, and that we will never return to certain moments; we understand that time can only move forwards, and we use phrases such as \u2018carpe diem\u2019 and \u2018savor the moment\u2019 to illustrate this. We reminisce, we yearn for the nostalgia of \u2018the good old days\u2019 (whatever those were, or whatever they will be), we attend reunions for high schools we left decades ago, and we are obsessed with the concept of vintage: tattered and weathered aviator jackets, cookbook recipes from the sixties, and polaroid cameras, to name a few. But what I want to bring attention to, that I think we have left behind, are our moments as periods of time. There is already a campaign to \u2018live in the moment\u2019, along the same lines of \u2018carpe diem\u2019\u2014but this is not what I am calling for. Our lives are impermanent, for now, and our memories act as our highlight reels; the time we felt the most happy, the most sad, the most nervous.  I want us to remember the smaller things, the things that made us happy for a moment, or sad for a moment, or another hard to place emotion that we won\u2019t remember beyond that day, for our minds will deem them unimportant. \u2014  Maya Din Beyond this, I want us to make them worthy of our memory, as sometimes it is only the small things that can help us when there is little to look forward to. I want us to root ourselves in these moments, and draw from them when necessary. This is a call for a move towards restorative nostalgia, rather than its reflective counterpart. Rather than longing, let us move to fondness, based on the understanding that small things that occur each day are just as powerful as the larger events we hyper-fixate upon. I understand the absurdity of using one medium to make ours less transient, seeing as how mediums themselves have evolved and have embraced their own transiency as time has gone on. The phasing out of cassettes and DVDs, alongside projectors and vinyls\u2014although the latter two are having a resurrection right now, something that speaks to our nostalgia for a past, as I discussed earlier\u2014illustrate this. There\u2019s something to be said, however, for the longevity of photography as a medium. It has lasted in our society, thoroughly involved and connected, since its inception, a medium imprinted in our memory. There was the creation of the camera, then called a heliograph, in 1816 by Joseph Ni\u00e9pce, then the daguerreotype created by Louis Daguerre in 1839. The first Polaroid went on the market in 1948, and the first digital camera made by Kodak was released in 1986. To this day in the 21st century, we see cameras in every part of our lives: our phones, of course; the photos in the daily news; the recent trend of digital photography on compact cameras, toted around in pockets and purses. We\u2019ve become over-familiarized to the medium, in the same way that we have to our own lives\u2014so much so, that to both examples, we\u2019ve created an entire industry around this: reality television. We are flooded with photographs, and even have entire apps revolving around this: Instagram, a platform dedicated to socializing (or glamorizing, or establishing superiority) operates through snapshots of life; Pinterest, a network dedicated to reducing the individuality of a photograph, branding it as part of a larger aesthetic to be easily pinned. The photograph has lost some of what has made it unique: a look through the eye of the (camera) beholder. The medium has taken on a form of objectivity in journalism and commercial photography, and has fallen prey to the mass demands of popular culture (think trends of over-saturated photos on vsco, or the replication of poses in front of the trendy pink wall in Los Angeles). As such, I feel the use of photography as a medium of bringing our attention to smaller things is fair, bringing forth the familiar mediums in a new light, embarking on this adventure hand-in-hand. Hito Steyerl brings up the concept of \u201cthe poor image\u201d: an image with nonoptimal quality, one that is imperfect. That is what our photos should aim to do, with art that \u201c...insists upon its own imperfection, is popular but not consumerist, committed without becoming bureaucratic.\u201d The photos may not be the most aesthetic ones that we save to our Pinterest boards, but they will explore space and time within the photographic medium, broaching our own perception of the same concepts. Some will be mundane; others will take an artistic license that may have you questioning the validity of the photograph itself. After all, as Steyerl asserts: \u201cin short: it is about reality.\u201d This story is in Capsule\u2019s Spring 2024 collection.\n```"}

Arriving at the LAX airport with the excitement of being at the center of the entertainment world, big blue ocean and sky, prestigious academia with tons of new different people, I imagined myself thriving in this environment. Now for almost two years, the disappointment hits differently, the burnout hits differently, the loneliness hits differently.\n\nSmall things that made me happy back home were everyday walks with my mom and two dogs, late night stroll or chit chats with my best friend and waking up in the morning saying good morning to my family. Most importantly, I loved talking with my mom or my close friends for hours and hours on random topics. Now, those are all gone, and I\u2019m left in this strange city. Everything here is so unfamiliar. The streets, buildings, cars, smells, sounds and air are all different. Every joke, gesture and interaction is different.\n\nTwo things struck me: I am not sure how to be myself in this place, and I am not sure how to express myself in this language. During my first year, I lived on campus. I could safely walk at night and go to Target or Trader Joe\u2019s at night with my best friend, who I luckily met at USC. Even though there were lots of crime alert emails from DPS (USC Department of Public Safety), I felt safe being inside the campus. Since I lived with my high school friend, I could talk and laugh with her before we went to bed. This lifestyle quenched some of my thirst for my lifestyle back at home.\n\nSecond year looked a little different. I had to assign myself to off-campus housing, as I did not have an option to live on campus. Now I am stuck in the room after classes, as I am not courageous enough to get out after the sunset. Those crime alerts feel a little closer now, and to top it off, my best friend isn\u2019t even here with me.\n\nIn my native language, I am quite fine at making new friends as I am pretty good at making conversation fun with little jokes and nuanced compliments. Looking at me now, I have no idea how to lead a good conversation in English with new people. I act like a broken toy awkwardly rambling random things out. I just don\u2019t get what their facial expressions mean, what their tone means, what their nuance means. Thousands of intrusive thoughts overwhelm my head while talking to others: how should I adjust my facial expressions based on what I say? What tone is suitable for my statements? Am I effectively delivering the nuances of what I am saying? After every conversation, I find myself tangled in thoughts of insecurity and concerns about how it went.\n\nIt is adulting, valuable life experiences and a step for my success\u2013 repeating to myself, encouraging myself to go through it and break the walls. However, the burn out hit me during my first semester of sophomore year after spending summer in LA. Stressed about my academic concerns and dissatisfaction with my lifestyle, I lost confidence in myself and started to rant about how much I hate this place and how lonely I felt lonely to my mom over hundreds of FaceTime calls. I was a 19-year-old who came to this place with a big dream, lost in the middle of a bustling, busy, bright Los Angeles.\n\nThe Role Of Second Language Anxiety\n\nThe experts say: International students, regardless of their time spent in the United States, experience second language anxiety. They face language and communication challenges, experiencing anxiety regarding accents, keeping up with conversation, and navigating cultural references.\n\nIt was an American Dream of mine, to be 5,994 miles away from my home. The ambition to be in an advanced education system, surrounded by people with an advanced mindset and opportunities to succeed. From the start, I always had the double consciousness of being an \u201cinternational student\u201d and \u201cforeigner.\u201d I felt like I would not be academically thriving or as great as other peers who were born and raised in this country. I have been trapped in the thought that they would view me as a second-language speaking foreigner.\n\nMy mindset has created the anxiety and nervousness to speak in English, especially in front of other classmates. Whenever it is my turn to speak, my heart pounds, my throat tightens, my brain goes blank and my voice shivers, which makes me ramble and mess up on pronunciations. Whenever I speak in English, I have a hard time projecting my voice. After repeated experiences of seeing the professors or other native speakers frowning from being unable to hear me clearly, the insecurity of speaking out grew inside me.\n\nAfter a good winter break at my homeland, I made a resolution to be confident in speaking, allow for mistakes and to just be myself. However, another comment hit me like a sharp arrow when my instructor said \u201cpeople with a small voice like Shyloh.\u201d The resolution that I have built over the winter break collapsed with growing insecurity. That day, I immediately searched up tutoring videos for Koreans to find the optimum pitch for English.\n\nEnglish has been a major medium in my social and academic life. Being anxious and insecure while using this language was a huge factor that dragged my mental health down to the floor.\n\nThe Boundaries Of Social Interaction\n\nThe experts say: International students often struggle with limited social interaction not only due to busy schedules but also because of the language barrier, difficulty identifying common interests with domestic peers and cultural misunderstandings. They tend to find it challenging to keep up with small talk and U.S. social norms, which can lead to loneliness and isolation, contributing to more severe mental health issues for these students.\n\nIf small talk is my worst nightmare, how could I make friends? When forming new friendships, the chemistry during the conversation is very important. However, it is hard to catch onto the jokes, nuances and flow of a conversation. I am actually a chatty and fun person to talk to, but in English, it is like I am outside of my personality. I can\u2019t joke like I do, I can\u2019t laugh like I do and I can\u2019t express my feelings like I do.\n\nIt is deeper than just a social life. I use a different name for English-speaking countries, as my Korean name, Seunghyeon, is difficult to pronounce in English. I go by Shyloh, which labels my English-speaking personality. I think I should just have been myself, but in the process of adopting the language, I failed to invite myself.\n\nAlso, the experts say: Living away from your home country often stimulates shifts in students\u2019 perceptions of their nationality and cultural practices, potentially resulting in an identity crisis. In the modern era, embracing language involves more than just words; it encompasses adopting the culture and social trends derived from social media.\n\nShyloh became my second persona, which I struggled to settle with. I had the temporary moment where I\u2019ve tried so hard to look like Hailey Bieber, Kendall Jenner or Matilda Djerf, even imitating their personalities or their ways of talking. This was an effort to absorb the mainstream culture of English-speaking people, as these girls were the \u2018it-girls\u2019 and \u2018trends\u2019 in the U.S. However, I realized that I cannot look like them because I am an Asian who has an Asian face, Asian hair and an Asian body.\n\nRealizing the discrepancy between my identity and the \u2018it-girl\u2019 led me to the disappointing realization that I cannot \u2018fit\u2019 into this language of mainstream trends. I lost the real me in the maze of Shyloh, who tried too hard to be the mainstream girl of this country, defying my own Korean beauty, Korean personality and Korean culture.\n\nThe experts say: Deviation from self-expectations, academic struggles and shifts in career paths or interests can contribute to feelings of failure, intensifying the mental well-being challenges.\n\nBeing an international student is standing alone and figuring out our life, such as career path, academic grades, social life and the constant internal struggle to fit in the U.S. society from being away from home. The ideals of going to college sports games and parties, having a group of friends to hangout on the weekends and night outs, thriving with English and academic work, and maintaining a healthy life balance with assignments, rest and workouts have all been crumbling down with furious waves of reality.\n\nThe Alienation Of The International Student // The Double Life\n\nThe experts say: International students often hesitate from sharing their challenges with family members. It is due to concerns about causing worry, the perception that the family may not understand or provide effective support related to their struggles. This may create discrepancy where families believe students are enjoying their lives while they may be experiencing suffering, failure, confusion, and desperation. This can intensify feelings of loss, loneliness and isolation, which ultimately contributes to increased mental distress.\n\nI assume this is common for international students. I never told my mom about my feelings and thoughts until the burnout really pushed me into the place where I had to talk about it. I knew that my parents wanted the best for me, which means they wouldn\u2019t be disappointed in me for going through hardships and being unhappy in this place. However, I did not believe there would ever be a way that my parents could help me in the situation of having difficulties here.\n\nThe problem of adapting to a new environment, culture and language while figuring out my academic struggle and career path at the same time was too big and unsolvable in the short term. I thought the only way was to give up everything and go back home.\n\nInitially, I was skeptical about joining ethnic-specific societies such as the Korean society. I did not want to be too comfortable with my ethnicity and forget the goal of making diverse friends and developing my English. Maybe not. Maybe we all need a place to feel like home with people who we can connect to over our mother language. Maybe that is why there are such diverse ethnicities and communities in our campus for me and for you to find.\n```"}

But are they free?\n\nBy Marie Louise Leone and Veronique Louis-Jacques\n\nSeptember 17, 2024 at 4:45 pm PDT\n\n\"It's a saying, it's a way of living, it's a form of resistance and sinning, low-riders are religion, they're candy-red disciples with rims like a sunrise.\" An excerpt from \"Low and Slow\" by Jorge Q.\n\nIt's six p.m. and Juan Ramirez is walking to his car in the dark after a long day of driving for FedEx. He works eight hours a day delivering packages across the congested Southern California streets, a tiring, thankless job \u2013 and that's \"as far as I'm gonna go,\" he said.\n\nThe thing is, Ramirez drives a delivery truck for work, but his real passion isn't that vehicle at all. He's the founder of Los Angeles Lowrider Community, a group that works for the preservation of lowrider culture in L.A. and head of the car club Just Memories. Ramirez is proud of his Angeleno heritage and isn't afraid to let people know it: \"It's more felt in the heart down here.\"\n\nOn January 1, 2024, the ban on cruising \u2013 defined as the slow driving of a car around an area with no specific place to be or end goal in mind \u2013 was lifted in the state of California. Cruising has been banned since 1988 in an effort to specifically target lowriders, who are largely Latine and are associated with gangs. Since the beginning of this year, the cars are free to roll down L.A.'s streets. Or at least, that's what lowriders thought.\n\n\"The reaction was when we first heard [about lifting the cruising ban], it was like, man, it's crazy,\" Ramirez recalled. \"They're gonna allow us to do what we wanted to do, what we've always wanted to do.\"\n\nMerriam Webster defines the term lowrider as \"a customized car with a chassis that has been lowered so that it narrowly clears the ground.\" But for the Mexican community, especially in Los Angeles, the term represents a celebration of culture and resistance.\n\nHowever, the police and city of Los Angeles have not been as welcoming as lowriders had hoped, according to Ramirez. He says that the hydraulics \u2013 the part of the car that makes it \"jump\" up and down \u2013 are the real sticking point. \"That's what defines us as a lowrider,\" he said. \"That separates us from the hot rods. That separates us from, you know, from the classic vintage [cars], the purists.\"\n\n\"In LA, pre-war, the car was a big thing.\" said Charles M. Tatum, author of Lowriders in Chicano Culture: From Low to Slow to Show, which details the history and influence that lowriding has had on the Chicano community and emphasizes its social, artistic, and political impact. \"Lowriders had not been around... but hot rods were.\"\n\nTo understand the origins of lowriding, one must first look at the origins of the hot rod. During the Great Depression in the late 1920s and 1930s, men who couldn't afford brand-new speed designed cars resorted to cheaper and older models \u2013 Model T's and Chevrolets \u2013 altering both the exterior and interior of the cars they purchased. Using junkyard parts and paint jobs that decorated their cars with racing stripes and unique designs, these individuals made their cars their own.\n\nA strong culture was built as car clubs began forming \u2013 a huge step in dismantling the notion that hot rodders were youth gang members who partook in crime. Southern California soon became the unofficial capital of hot rod culture, as its flat terrain allowed hotrodders to race their cars freely.\n\nBut juxtaposing the hot rod craze was another movement that sought to do the exact opposite: custom cars. Car owners took part in lowering their cars, and with deep and dark paint jobs, elaborate designs, and plush interiors, their vehicles completely transformed into works of art. Custom cars would become the basis for what would later become known as lowrider cars.\n\nUnlike hot rods, custom cars were not meant to impress people by how fast they drove, but by the artistic work put into making them. Riders of these custom cars rode slowly through city streets to show off what they had made.\n\nLowriding itself began in the 1950s after Mexican-American veterans returned from World War II. During the war, the boom of the automobile industry had come to a halt, as many hot rodders and lowriders were drafted. However, as veterans returned home with impressive mechanical skills from their military experience, the culture of lowriding began to pick up speed.\n\nThe ability to purchase reliable vehicles also became more possible as veterans received a $20 weekly stipend for their service. The popularity of cars that had been lost during the war had now returned with full force, as the rising industrial sector attracted Mexican veterans all across the Southwest.\n\nThe value of their mechanical skills were not lost on the well-established automotive industry in L.A., allowing them to acquire well-paying jobs after returning home.\n\nBut by the late 1950s, lowriders began to face harassment. While law enforcement had deemed their interference with lowriders as a way to prevent the low cars from scraping the street pavements, the hostility toward lowriders can be traced back to the decades-long tension between Mexican communities and those in power.\n\nMedia coverage heavily portrayed lowriders as criminals and gang members hovering over white communities. As lines of lowriders gathered and cruised down Whittier Boulevard, their presence was characterized as a threat.\n\nA law passed in 1958 \u2013 California Vehicle Code 24008 \u2013 would essentially make low riding a crime, prohibiting any part of a car from being below the base of its rims.\n\nIt was a father and son's disdain for the harassment and love for lowriding that would revolutionize the culture forever. Tired of getting stopped by traffic officers for having their car lowered, Ron and Louis Aguirre would not let that stop them. The pair would install a used system of hydraulics on their 1957 Corvette, allowing them to raise and lower their car as they please and more importantly, avoid any trouble with law enforcement.\n\nThousands would watch in amazement as the newly-transformed Corvette debuted at the 1958 Long Beach Memorial Day car show. And while hydraulic systems had been used in cars before, cruisers would take notice of their impact and hydraulics would quickly become linked to lowriding culture.\n\nTatum has long been familiar with the culture surrounding lowriding. While he was raised in Mexico, his Mexican-American mother would frequently take him to his birthplace of El Paso, Texas, where he witnessed the rise of the artform first hand, eying with curiosity at the lowriders that would cruise through the streets.\n\nDecades later, Tatum continued to see its influence and how the culture had spread, as lowrider clubs dominated Las Cruces, New Mexico, a small city of 40,000 from which Tatum taught at New Mexico State University.\n\nAfter attending lowrider shows years later, he gained a more informed perspective and newfound appreciation for lowrider culture.\n\n\"For some of these cars, people have invested ten to $50,000 in them. So they're not going to take the chance of having them damaged or scratched or whatever,\" Tatum said. \"So they're like pieces of art, canvases that go from museum to museum.\"\n\nOne way lowriders show off their pieces of art is through rolling around the streets of their town on a cruise. However, the lifting of the California cruising ban doesn't mean that lowriders can use their hydraulics, go up on two wheels or generally do any of the tricks that lowriders are built for.\n\nLowriders, who had celebrated the end of the cruising ban, found themselves ticketed in the first few days after the new legislation went into effect.\n\n\"We should have known better,\" Ramirez said.\n\nIn the city of L.A. proper, police are very harsh on lowriding. He recalled that on January 1, 2024, the morning of the cruising ban being lifted, lowriders were faced with \"so many cops\" ready to ticket them on Van Nuys Boulevard.\n\n\"It's New Year's Day \u2013 you guys couldn't be somewhere else?\" he asked in disbelief.\n\nRamirez claimed that while this isn't an isolated incident, the policing is less restrictive on the fringes of L.A. County, where lowriding is also popular.\n\nLowriding has long been a staple of political resistance and community organizing. After the turbulent Watts Riots of 1965, the tensions between law enforcement and minority groups in East and South Central Los Angeles heightened.\n\nBecause of the increased law enforcement presence, more confrontations between cruisers and police officers occurred on Crenshaw Avenue. Law enforcement was not only targeting Mexican youth but were now targeting Black youth as well, using lowrider as a derogatory term correlated with crime and gang activity.\n\nBut despite this, young Mexican Americans still formed lowrider clubs as a way to separate themselves from the growing gang population that had impeded on their cities.\n\nAnd when a group of UCLA students discovered from an economist's report that a majority of the businesses on Whittier Boulevard were owned by non-Chicanos who had pressured law enforcement to increase their presence on the street \u2013 a decision that ultimately led to the harassment of lowriders for minor traffic violations \u2013 lowriders stood right beside community members and student activists during a mass protest demonstration on July 3, 1968.\n\nTheir presence at the protest was a fight for their freedom, as the constant harassment they faced for minor traffic violations was a direct result of the pressure for more police presence.\n\nA three-night riot would ensue, as demonstrators smashed car windshields and glass storefronts. The media and police would use this incident as a way to further perpetuate the idea that lowriders were thugs, solely blaming the violence and destruction on the lowriding community.\n\nThe misconception that lowriding is directly correlated with gang activity has plagued the culture for decades. And while Tatum admits that there may be some gang members in lowrider car clubs, more often than not, lowriders are just average everyday people who cherish the art and community lowriding has to offer.\n\n\"You have professional people, doctors, lawyers, who do lowriding... and they're committed to the artistic and mechanical dimension of it,\" Tatum said.\n\nBut despite the decades-long struggle to freely do what they love, many Angelenos persist.\n\n\"A lot of places too, especially in East L.A., some people only have one car. Some families only have one vehicle, and that vehicle just happens to be a lowrider because that's how much they love it,\" Ramirez explained.\n\nEven cruising, which has long carried implications of gang activity in the minds of the police and city, is something different for Ramirez as well. He described a typical morning outing after breakfast with his family.\n\n\"I'm talking about a real family, the kids and the wife and everything, and we're going cruising, we're going on Sundays,\" Ramirez said. \"That's why, you know, there's a lot of prayer, a lot of people consider it a Sunday car.\"\n\nBut the culture isn't just the cars, and it certainly isn't just the perception of criminality. Ramirez described how during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, car clubs would provide aid to neighborhoods and families in need.\n\nFor years, lowrider car clubs have organized food donations, packed school supplies and run toy drives. The community fends for itself but it also supports itself.\n\n\"I want to leave something to my kids that they could enjoy,\" he said. \"That this culture wasn't gonna fly by.\"\n\nLowriding has been part of Ramirez's family for decades. His parents are lowriders; he's passed down the tradition to his children, too. With Just Memories, Ramirez wanted to recognize that this was a culture that spanned generations.\n\nThe car club was founded, in its own words, to maintain lowrider culture and work on \"removing all negative stereotypes of it.\" Ramirez named his club after the memories and values he associates with lowriding.\n\n\"It always brought me back to being in the backseat, when they're hitting the switch and [the lowrider] went up and down. And then you know, it just felt surreal,\" said Ramirez. \"It was something different, it's an experience you can ever understand, unless you've been in one.\"\n\nStig De Block, a photographer and artist living in Antwerp, Belgium, could not be any more different than Ramirez on paper. But they both share a love for lowriders.\n\nDe Block learned about funk and soul music from his father as a young child and began to see that same music sampled in rap videos by artists he followed in his teens.\n\n\"They used to feature those lowrider hydraulic cars very, very clearly in their music videos. And I was always very attracted to the visual aesthetic of it and amazed by how the car would move on the four different axes,\" De Block said.\n\nThe aesthetic of the cars \u2013 and of Los Angeles \u2013 fascinated him. It wasn't just the visual that he became interested in. The community of lowriders drew De Block in as well.\n\n\"For me, it's about people from different backgrounds, different communities that come together on mutual ground that provide a safe zone for the youth,\" he said. \"We know very positive things for the community, like raising funds for breast cancer awareness, for example.\"\n\nLowrider events also tend to be \"color neutral zones,\" or areas where no one is allowed to wear explicit gang colors, said De Block. This means that lowriders who are involved in different gangs get a chance to meet each other and learn about one another.\n\nIn his art, De Block has photographed lowriders and the families that own and drive them. To him, the beauty goes beyond the chrome and paint job.\n\n\"The interesting part is that the car is a one-to-one representation of the owner's imagination. He or she spends a lot of time, money and effort trying to build a car like that,\" said De Block. \"That's super cool, of course. But for me it goes \u2013 I like to get deeper on the cultural part of it.\"\n\nRamirez agrees. As cool as the lowrider is, nothing in his mind compares to owning one \u2013 having a form of personal expression that many people don't even think about.\n\n\"To be like, oh, man, those things are the coolest things. Not just cool just to see them, it's cool to have one or be in one,\" Ramirez said. \"And then having your own cars, it's your rolling canvas.\"```"}

I think he matured a lot and grew from his experience.\u201d\n\nHeading toward USC\u2019s game against Michigan, Riley reflected on the balance between maintaining tradition and implementing his own philosophy, drawing parallels to his experience of becoming the head coach at Oklahoma and Wolverine head coach Sherrone Moore\u2019s situation at Michigan.\n\n\u201cI tried to take stock of what was already working well and where improvements were needed. I didn\u2019t want to change things just for the sake of change,\u201d Riley explained. \u201cIt\u2019s about trusting what\u2019s best for the program and finding that balance.\n\nRiley highlighted one of the latest advancements to coaching, the use of tablets on the sidelines, which has significantly sped up in-game adjustments.\n\n\u201cIt has made the role of people in the press box less important, as now you can just watch the plays yourself,\u201d Riley noted. But he did caution that the fast pace of the game means coaches must be selective about which information to focus on.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still getting used to it, but there are advantages,\u201d Riley said.\n\nAs for the timing of the bye week, Riley sees it as an opportunity to regroup and improve.\n\n\u201cThe bye week is what it is, and if you handle it well, there are advantages like working on yourself, getting players healthy and developing young talent,\u201d Riley said.\n\nHe praised the team for staying focused and avoiding distractions, adding, \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any indication that the players are getting distracted by outside noise.\u201d\n\nWith the bye week offering a chance for reflection and recovery, USC remains focused on the road ahead, ready to build on its early success and continue its march toward the College Football Playoff.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Jason Allen)\n\nBy Ethan Inman\nSeptember 17, 2024 at 2:21 pm PDT\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers had a roller coaster of a weekend series against the Atlanta Braves, which shouldn\u2019t come as too much of a surprise given LA\u2019s recent play. The Boys in Blue dropped their first two games to the Braves, falling Friday 6-2 and Saturday in a 10-1 blowout. But the Dodgers rebounded heading into the new week with a 9-2 win Sunday night and a 9-0 shutout Monday night to earn a split in the four-game series.\n\nAll eyes were on the rotation for the series after news that ace Tyler Glasnow would be sidelined for the rest of the 2024 season and postseason, joining Clayton Kershaw and Gavin Stone on the growing list of sidelined Dodger arms. After the first two games versus the Braves, those worries had only grown. Neither Landon Knack nor Jack Flaherty put together starting performances that exactly inspired confidence in the first two games.\n\nKnack only made it through two innings and gave up five earned runs in the Friday loss, putting the Dodgers in a hole they couldn\u2019t climb out of despite a solid bullpen performance. To make matters worse, Flaherty put the bullpen right back to work after he only made it through three innings and gave up four runs. The bullpen fatigue showed as it surrendered six more runs in the remaining five innings, though most of those can be credited to a poor performance by veteran Evan Phillips in the sixth.\n\nThe biggest concern from the Dodgers\u2019 two defeats, however, should not be the rotation. Flaherty\u2019s poor performance can likely be written off as a one-off day, he\u2019s been reliable all season long\u2014and especially for the Dodgers\u2014after coming over from Detroit in a midseason trade. And even amid all the injuries, the Dodger rotation remains one of the most deep and talented in the league.\n\nNor should the concern be seeding. The Dodgers have made the race for the NL West much closer than it needs to be, and they missed an opportunity to set one of their most fierce recent postseason rivals back significantly in their race for the final Wild Card spot with the Mets. But high seeding hasn\u2019t benefited the Dodgers much in recent years and they have fallen to inferior teams both in seeding and talent in the playoffs in numerous years, with the exception of 2020.\n\nTo succeed in October, they\u2019ll need to be way more concerned with being on top of their game and not what the other side is putting up against them. The biggest concern should be the offensive performance against NL Cy Young favorite Chris Sale on Friday night. The Dodgers managed only one run and seven baserunners against the Atlanta ace through six innings, and by the time the Braves\u2019 bullpen came in, the game was out of reach.\n\nDodger fans will remember the lineup\u2019s inability to perform when the lights are brightest. At the heart of their massively disappointing postseason exit last season against the Arizona Diamondbacks was the disappearing act of LA\u2019s middle-of-the-order hitters. Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, fresh off MVP-caliber regular season campaigns during the regular season, went a combined one-for-21 in that NLDS sweep.\n\nWhen a pitcher like Sale takes the mound, especially in the upcoming playoffs, the Dodgers\u2019 star hitters must rise to the occasion. Especially with injuries in their rotation, the Dodgers need to know that their lineup, the best in the league on paper, can jump on these types of aces early to give their younger arms a chance.\n\nFortunately, the Sunday and Monday games were a sight for sore eyes for weary Dodger fans. The Dodgers outscored the Braves 18-2 in the two contests behind both solid pitching and timely hitting. The most encouraging sight was Walker Buehler\u2019s start Sunday night. Buehler struggled with his command, walking five Braves, but was able to make it through six innings while only surrendering two earned runs on three hits.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been the easiest road back for Buehler coming off Tommy John surgery, but if he can pitch like he did Sunday and like he has most of his young career, he\u2019ll be a key piece for a Dodger rotation that sorely needs him. The game also featured back-to-back-to-back home runs from Teoscar Hernandez, Tommy Edman and Max Muncy in the ninth inning, showcasing the depth of the Dodger lineup that is dangerously powerful from top to bottom.\n\nRookie pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto also made a solid, albeit short start Monday with four innings of shutout ball that the bullpen took to the distance for the 9-0 shutout. He was especially good at getting out of jams, and though the Dodgers would like to see him pitch more innings in the future, it was encouraging to see him be effective, even with the briefness of his second start off the injured list.\n\nThis is likely how the rest of the regular season will continue to play out for Los Angeles. As the healthy arms experience September fatigue, and arms coming off extended IL stays like Buehler and Yamamoto attempt to ramp back up, there may be bumps in the road. But the Dodgers need to be much more concerned with how they\u2019ll do when the season resets in October than finishing with a great record or locking up a top seed. A win in September may not be the difference between winning and losing the World Series, but a key player\u2019s confidence just might.\n```"}

(Photo by Cooper Bates)\n\nBy Ona Martini September 17, 2024 at 2:13 pm PDT\n\nHave you ever wished you could choose your parents? Thirteen-year-old Julien has. He\u2019s looking for a new dad. On first impression, the story of \u201cPascal & Julien\u201d seems like a tearjerker \u2014 and yet, I found myself smiling more often than not.\n\nWritten by acclaimed Australian playwright Daniel Keene, \u201cPascal & Julien\u201d was originally commissioned in France. Here in Los Angeles, 24th Street Theatre brings a lighthearted charm and whimsy to the U.S. and English-language premiere of the show.\n\nWith Spanish supertitles throughout the play and a pay-what-you-can performance option, 24th Street Theatre is a leading example of accessibility in the LA theater community. The space felt warm and communal in a way I love the theater to be. It only made sense that the story was equally pleasant.\n\nSet in Paris, Julien (Darby Winn) searches for a new dad among regulars at a caf\u00e9 across the street from his family\u2019s apartment \u2014 where his actual father lives. Their day-to-day turmoil isn\u2019t the focus of this play, however, because Julien finds a replacement dad. The socially-isolated crossword puzzle enthusiast, Pascal (Paul Turbiak), is Julien\u2019s chosen surrogate.\n\nFrom their first interaction at the caf\u00e9, the audience understands the potential for Pascal and Julien\u2019s connection, perhaps even more than they do. Despite their bickering over that Sunday\u2019s crossword, there is a glimmer of opportunity \u2014 a reminder that anything is possible, even the most unlikely companionship.\n\nEach scene serves as a vignette, through which the seasons change and Pascal and Julien form a bittersweet connection. During all of this, it\u2019s evident that Julien\u2019s father is an absent parent who doesn\u2019t notice or care that his son has replaced him with an unfamiliar man. This point underscores the entire play without ever being communicated outright.\n\nWinn\u2019s honest portrayal of youthful naivety is marked by the fact that Julien seemingly doesn\u2019t comprehend his biological father\u2019s neglect. Frankly, we don\u2019t understand it either. And yet, I never felt a need for rationality while watching Pascal and Julien\u2019s bond come to be.\n\nWhen they are optimistic, so are we. When they are trusting, so are we. Turbiak and Winn\u2019s chemistry is palpable and their characters\u2019 energy is contagious \u2014 they illuminate the room with their combined physical presence.\n\nThough \u201cPascal & Julien\u201d only features two actors, the stage never feels empty or boring. Each scene is introduced by a life-sized dynamic doodle of the characters projected onto a transparent screen. In tandem with Bradley Brough\u2019s brilliantly playful score, these moments brought me so much joy. Simply put, you\u2019d have to see it to appreciate it.\n\nDebbie Devine lends a tender hand to the direction of this play. It\u2019s obvious that the award-winning director is a seasoned leader in youth arts education. \u201cPascal & Julien\u201d teaches you a lesson without you realizing it \u2014 a lesson in patience and the importance of human connection.\n\n\u201cThis is what family means to me,\u201d Devine said, \u201cFolks that are there for one another.\u201d\n\n\u201cPascal & Julien\u201d is simple and lighthearted, a refreshing reminder that theater doesn\u2019t have to be painful, even if the story is emotionally loaded. This kind of theater is for everyone \u2014 it seems this inclusivity is what Debbie Devine and 24th Street Theatre do best.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a novice theater-goer or a seasoned veteran, \u201cPascal and Julien\u201d is digestible and joyous. 24th Street Theatre reinforces that the most wonderful things are just outside your door \u2014 and like Julien, sometimes you just have to look.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of the Shea family)\n\nBy Paige Shea\nSeptember 17, 2024 at 12:11 pm PDT\n\nWhen my mom sent me a CNN article on Friday evening, her message underneath the link was simple: \u201cI love you.\u201d The article announced that China ended its foreign adoption, leaving hundreds of American families trying to adopt Chinese children in limbo. I immediately burst into tears, but I wasn\u2019t exactly sure why. My cascade of emotions was grief mixed with shock, gratefulness, and even a fragment of relief.\n\nAccording to Chinese officials, the policy change was made to stay \u201cin line\u201d with international trends. The rapidly declining birth rate in China is also a huge factor in the decision. Simple enough, from a public policy standpoint \u2013 but the legacy of Chinese adoption is anything but simple.\n\nI belong to a cohort of 82,674 Chinese children\u2013primarily girls \u2013adopted from China by American parents since China opened its international adoption in 1992. I was born under the one-child policy that was Chinese law from 1980 to 2016. I\u2019m from Guilin, a city in southern China, that I haven\u2019t been to since I was adopted in 2003. Like many others, I was adopted by American parents at 13 months old and brought to the United States to begin my life in Pittsburgh.\n\nAll I know of my year in Guilin is through pictures provided to my family by my orphanage nurses. I was abandoned when I was two months old, an age actually much older than the norm, left on the side of a busy road so that someone would find me. A note was left with my birthday on it. It sounds harsh, but ask any other Chinese adoptee, and you\u2019ll get a similar story. Some adoptees don\u2019t even know their real birthday, just an estimate.\n\nChinese adoptees have three main documents that offer insight into their early lives: a certificate of adoption, a certificate of birth, and a certificate of abandonment. These three documents contain information such as the date of \u201cabandonment,\u201d adoptees\u2019 approximate age or exact birthday, who found them, what family adopted them, and when they were adopted. These three documents were the only things that defined me\u2013everything else, I had to discover on my own.\n\nI grew up being unable to trace any of my facial features to my parents or family members, pausing when doctors would ask \u201cAny family history of [X]?\u201d Instead of bedtime stories as a child, I would ask my parents to tell me my adoption story, and they would, without hesitation, for what I\u2019m sure was over 100 times. In addition to birthdays and holidays, we celebrate my adoption anniversary: September 12, 2003.\n\nGrowing up, I always knew that I was adopted, but the true meaning of my situation is something that I still grapple with, even at 22 years old. Throughout the years, I\u2019ve heard it all\u2013all of the questions people somehow feel comfortable asking: \u201cDo you know your real parents?\u201d to \u201cDon\u2019t you want to meet your real parents?\u201d to \u201cDo you remember anything from China?\u201d And there are the accusations: \u201cWell, your real parents must not have loved you.\u201d\n\nBut my least favorite are the people who view Chinese adoption as nothing more than a transaction of goods. I vividly remember a moment at 10 years old when a customs agent at the airport asked me if the people I was traveling with were my \u201creal parents.\u201d The use of the adjective real as a means of differentiating my family from a purely biological one has always deeply unsettled me\u2013sure, my family may look different, but that doesn\u2019t disparage the love we have for each other in any way.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that I don\u2019t look like my parents, in the same way that anyone with biological parents doesn\u2019t think about resemblance constantly. But in circumstances when I hear \u201creal parents\u201d as an othering term, I remember very quickly. Being an adoptee, especially to parents of a different race, is an incredibly specific cultural identity crisis: a balancing act of the American culture that I was raised in and the Chinese culture that I am only partially a member of.\n\nIt\u2019s the external assumption that I intrinsically understand\u2013and belong to\u2013Chinese culture. Accusations of being a \u201cwhitewashed Asian\u201d have always bothered me \u2013 are we not all a product of the culture in which we were raised, in one way or another? That\u2019s not to say that my parents didn\u2019t try to help me connect with my heritage; I participated in traditional Chinese dance for seven years of my life, my parents read me Chinese and American children\u2019s stories in equal measures, and my mom attempted to introduce me to Chinese school at six years old\u2013to no avail. (Sorry, Mom.)\n\nMy parents always gave me personal agency in terms of connecting to Chinese culture, and for the most part, I accepted the blend of cultures. However, the true heart of being a Chinese adoptee lies in the unanswered questions that are an inherent part of the situation: wondering why your birth parents abandoned you, if they are still alive, what they look like, if you have a sibling, and how differently your life could have been had it not been for that one decision on that one day.\n\nIt\u2019s a life spent wondering how to balance your two identities, and if you are even a true part of either one. The New York Times defined China\u2019s three decades of international adoption as a means of population control as \u201ccomplicated.\u201d I think that\u2019s the most all-encompassing, while simplistic, word to describe it.\n\nChinese adoption was a gift\u2013a miracle\u2013for my family, for many families in America, and worldwide. It was a gift made possible by an archaic government policy, at the expense of decades of generations of Chinese boys and girls who will spend the rest of their lives asking questions that, in all likelihood, won\u2019t be answered. But still a gift, nonetheless\u2013at least in my situation. But I am just one of hundreds of thousands\u2013each adoptee has their own unique experience.\n\nWhen I think of the sacrifice made by my birth parents that made my life possible and the anguish that it may have caused them, it makes me infinitely more grateful for my life. I cannot fathom spending two months with your child to give them up, either due to the one-child policy or other circumstances that I\u2019ll never know. The sacrifice of my birth parents\u2013and the love that my parents have for me\u2013guides me in everything that I do.\n\nMy parents have always called me their \u201cmiracle baby.\u201d After years of infertility and an extra six months in their adoption journey\u2013thanks to the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak \u2013 it\u2019s easy to understand why. My mom\u2019s affirmation has always been: \u201cI couldn\u2019t love you more than I do, regardless of if I gave birth to you or not.\u201d It\u2019s an affirmation that I\u2019ve heard for the past 21 years, and one that every adoptee deserves to hear.\n\nMy identity as a Chinese adoptee has defined my life; it has instilled my inherent sense of curiosity, given me a unique blend of cultural perspectives, and has taught me that the true meaning of family derives from love, not from blood relation. It\u2019s the reason that I have the life that I do, and a wonderful one at that.\n\nAs this chapter of Chinese history closes, I hope that more Chinese adoptees continue to share their stories so that we can find each other. I hope that more adoptees continue to ask questions so that we may share in the discomfort of our unknown and connect with one another. We are a uniquely fixed group of individuals who have everything to gain by meeting each other.\n\nSo, why did I cry when I heard that China was ending international adoption? The same reason that I feel overwhelming heartache when I think of my birth parents and the unknowable parts of my story, and the same reason that I feel overwhelming gratitude for my incredible parents every day. Articulating my emotions and experiences is an ongoing process, one that will probably take my entire life. But this article is a starting point, one that I can only hope encourages others to share their stories as well.\n```"}

(AP/Bruce Kluckhohn)\n\nBy Mia Nu\u00f1ez September 16, 2024 at 7:06 pm PDT\n\nWNBA fans can expect an exciting playoff qualification push, as three teams are currently tied for eighth place. Seven of the eight spots have been locked up, but right now, the Washington Mystics, Chicago Sky and Atlanta Dream all have a record of 13-25. Each team will play its last two games of the season on Tuesday and Thursday, setting us up for a dramatic conclusion as the standings will change in real time.\n\nThe Sky and the Dream face off against each other on Tuesday, with Chicago currently leading the season series 2-1. Despite rookie forward Angel Reese\u2019s season-ending wrist injury, the Sky will win its game. Rookie Center Kamilla Cardoso has been racking up the rebounds that Reese would normally contribute and the Brazilian has stepped up in her role. Chicago guard Chennedy Carter had 20 points in her last outing against the Mercury, a team with a better record. If Carter stays hot and doesn\u2019t get distracted, she will lead the Sky to a victory against the Dream. Additionally, guard Lindsay Allen was named the WNBA Player of the Month for August and has performed consistently since. I should note that the Dream are the home team and as such, I don\u2019t want to count out the Dream guard Allisha Gray, who is averaging 15.7 points on the season. Despite her scoring threat, I still think the Sky will come away with an all-important win.\n\nIf the Sky wants to completely guarantee that eighth spot, they\u2019ll need to beat the Connecticut Sun on Thursday\u2014a seemingly unlikely outcome since the Sun have won all three matchups in 2024. If the Sky beat the Dream though, they don\u2019t have to win against the Sun if the Dream loses against the New York Liberty. The Mystics would also have to lose against the Liberty and the Indiana Fever. The Dream and Mystics have both failed to defeat the Liberty this season, as New York has dominated the regular season. I see a greater chance of the Sky winning against the Sun than either Atlanta or Washington finding a victory against the Liberty. Also, the Mystics could win their game against the Fever and that would give them a shot at the playoffs. But, the Mystics are 1-2 against the Fever and the Fever are 7-3 in their last 10 games. The only three games the Fever have lost were against the notoriously talented Las Vegas Aces and Minnesota Lynx. So, a win against the Fever doesn\u2019t seem likely either. Mystics Guard Ariel Atkins has been fueling her team\u2019s offense with 14.7 points per game, but I just don\u2019t think they have enough offensive prowess to make it to the playoffs. The team who gets the eighth spot isn\u2019t because they\u2019re the best team. It\u2019s going to come down to the rigor of the games. Based on each franchise\u2019s schedule, whoever wins the Sky and Dream matchup on Tuesday will clinch the eighth spot, and it will be Chicago ultimately playing in the postseason, although a first-round defeat almost certainly awaits the Sky.\n```"}

Plus, what\u2019s up with the tight ends?\n\nArizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray (1) hands the ball off to Arizona Cardinals running back James Conner (6) during the second half of an NFL football game against the Los Angeles Rams Sunday, Sept. 15, 2024, in Glendale, Ariz. The Cardinals won 41-10. (AP/Ross D. Franklin)\n\nBy Matt Kim September 16, 2024 at 6:51 pm PDT\n\nAll stats are from full PPR (points per reception) format leagues like ESPN, Yahoo and Sleeper. Week two featured plenty of entertaining matchups, including a pair of upsets over some of the best teams in the NFL. The New Orleans Saints went into Dallas and put up 44 points on a top-tier defense, showing that the Saints\u2019 years of mediocrity in the post-Drew Brees era may finally be over. In another close AFC matchup, the Las Vegas Raiders squeaked out a 26-23 win over the Baltimore Ravens, pushing the former AFC North champs to a surprising 0-2 start.\n\nFor fantasy football implications, we now have a clearer picture of each team\u2019s main contributors and we can now identify some potential league-winners going forward. On the other end of the spectrum, some picks have already flamed out.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals Offense\n\nSince their 11-5 season in 2021, the Cardinals have been marred by injuries, poor coaching and a lack of roster depth. The number one question surrounding the Cardinals was former offensive rookie of the year QB Kyler Murray. Many analysts once considered the dual-threat QB the future of the NFL, even though his small stature made some skeptical of his skillset. In each of his first three NFL seasons, though, Murray finished as a top 10 fantasy QB, including a top three overall finish in 2020. However, an ACL tear derailed parts of his 2022 and 2023 seasons and there was speculation that Murray would never be the same.\n\nComing into this season, the Cardinals were an afterthought in a competitive NFC West that also featured the Rams, Seahawks and 49ers. After a slow start against the Bills, in which the Cardinals narrowly lost to Buffalo in a wild week one matchup, Murray and the Cardinals exploded against the Rams. The Oklahoma product threw three touchdowns, two of which went to Marvin Harrison, accumulating 266 air yards. Quarterbacks only receive 0.04 points per passing yard but rushing yards count for the usual 0.1 points per yard. QBs only receive four points per passing touchdown and six points for every rushing touchdown. Those simple disparities are why Murray, who finished with 59 rushing yards in Sunday\u2019s contest against the Rams, has top five-QB upside. He\u2019s scored 26 career rushing touchdowns and that\u2019s why fantasy football managers should continue targeting QBs like Murray.\n\nThe Cardinals were also the second-worst-ranked rush defense in football, meaning that Murray, along with RB James Conner, TE Trey McBride and WR Marvin Harrison Jr. will often have to play a high passing-volume offense, with their fantasy managers reaping the benefits. In their two games so far, the Cards have scored 28 and 41 points while allowing a combined 44 points. The trio mentioned beforehand put up some monster numbers on Sunday, especially MHJ, this past NFL draft\u2019s fourth overall pick. Week one saw the talented wideout only post one catch for four yards, but he burst onto the scene in week two with a Randy Moss-esque statline. He recorded four catches for 130 yards alongside two touchdowns. This generated a monster 29 full-PPR points in a game that the Cardinals led the whole way.\n\nRB Conner and TE McBride are top options as well, as Conner has posted back-to-back 19 point games. The Pitt product has had two top ten RB finishes in fantasy football, as he\u2019s a dynamic back with receiving upside, but he occasionally struggles to stay on the field. He\u2019s dealt with a slew of injuries and the 29 year-old is approaching the age at which we expect RBs\u2019 production to fall off. However, on the field in 2024, he\u2019s as electric as ever and should be considered as a low-end RB1. McBride has emerged as one of Kyler\u2019s favorite targets, finishing as the TE7 last season despite only being named the starter in week six. With TEs putting up duds all across the league, McBride should be highly sought after as one of the few clear TE1s. Fantasy managers should do anything they can to acquire McBride, as his consistency at TE will win leagues.\n\nOverall, fantasy football managers should strive to be highly invested in this Cardinals offense, as we\u2019ll see Arizona in plenty of shootouts that will rack up points on a weekly basis.\n\nHow to Navigate Starting Tight Ends\n\nBoy, have there been some horrific fantasy performances from tight ends. This has been an ongoing trend as teams turn more towards the run game. As a Mark Andrews owner myself, it was extremely frustrating to watch someone I invested high draft capital in put up a stinker. However, there\u2019s another tight end besides McBride that\u2019s a clear-cut target: Dalton Kincaid.\n\nThe Bills drafted Kincaid 25th overall in 2023 out of the University of Utah and had some lofty expectations for him. And in the second half of last season, from weeks 7-14, he delivered, averaging over seven and a half targets a game\u2014great volume for a TE. The Bills\u2019 lack of receiving depth also works in his favor. What\u2019s also working in his favor is the lack of receiving depth on the Bills roster. Buffalo\u2019s WR depth chart currently consists of Khalil Shakir, Curtis Samuel and rookie Keon Coleman, but none of them have great upside. This paves the way for Kincaid to continue building chemistry with QB Josh Allen, as there are plenty of vacated targets following Stefon Diggs\u2019 departure to the Houston Texans. Allen has supported strong fantasy seasons for his receivers, including Diggs, so it\u2019s only a matter of time before the second-year TE becomes one of the best at his position. Managers should target his current buy-low price.\n\nFor the other star TEs like Travis Kelce, Mark Andrews and Sam LaPorta, it\u2019s understandable that managers are frustrated with their lack of production. However, as I mentioned before, they each sit in prime situations for a breakout in the near future, especially with a slew of injuries that have hit their respective teams. The one I\u2019m trusting most out of the three is Sam LaPorta, as his finish as the TE1 in 2023 didn\u2019t come by accident. Some are already hitting the panic button on LaPorta after he\u2019s only recorded six catches in the Lions\u2019 first two games. However, this Lions offense was one of the best in all of the NFL in 2023 and have just gotten out to a slow start. Goff has been the main culprit behind the Lions\u2019 offensive struggles, as his stats through two games aren\u2019t that appealing. While he\u2019s racked up over 500 passing yards across two games, his 1-3 TD-INT ratio hasn\u2019t helped Detroit\u2019s receivers. A huge factor in LaPorta\u2019s game is his TD upside, as he finished with 10 last year and is one of the most-trusted red zone targets in Dan Cambell\u2019s offense. Goff has been a top-10 QB in fantasy football in his time with Detroit and there\u2019s little to no chance that this type of production will continue. Managers should expect LaPorta\u2019s numbers to increase as Goff and the Lions rebound from a tough week two loss against the Bucs.\n\nThe only real concern I have with LaPorta is WR Jameson Williams\u2019 emergence. The former first-round pick has shown signs of the player the Lions drafted out of Alabama, as he\u2019s commended a high target share for the first time in his NFL career. This will eat into LaPorta\u2019s workload, but this Lions offense can sustain multiple top fantasy football players with ease. Lions star WR and former USC product Amon-Ra St. Brown is also dealing with an injury as well, so if he were to miss time, this would be the perfect opportunity for LaPorta to start replicating his monster 2023 numbers.\n\nFantasy consists of a lot of luck, but closely monitoring each player\u2019s situation and production will give you a much better chance of winning your league.\n```"}

Times launches \u2018Times of Troy\u2019 newsletter covering USC Sports\n\nThe publication\u2019s USC beat writer launched a weekly newsletter giving insights on all things Trojan athletics on September 16.\n\nWith Caleb Williams now in the NFL, a new squad will have to carry on the legacy of USC football. (Photo by Wesley Chen)\n\nBy Ana Susman, Alexandra Evans and Samantha Lee\nSeptember 16, 2024 at 6:38 pm PDT\n\nThis morning the Los Angeles Times formally introduced \u201cThe Times of Troy,\u201d a newsletter exclusively covering sports at the University of Southern California. The announcement comes just in time for USC\u2019s inaugural season in the Big Ten, reflecting a demand for higher-profile coverage of USC athletics.\n\nUSC beat reporter, Ryan Kartje, writes the newsletter, released weekly on Mondays beginning September 16. Kartje has reported on USC sports for six seasons, mainly covering football and administration changes, in addition to other sports features. Both the Associated Press sports editor and the Los Angeles Press Club have honored Kartje for his coverage of the Trojans.\n\nToday\u2019s debut newsletter focuses on football. However, with his prior experience covering a wide array of USC sports, Kartje plans to offer readers insights on a variety of stories across USC athletics. The newsletter plans to delve deeper into the women\u2019s basketball program, which has become a national power, the L.A. Times said.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve kind of reached a point in the state of the industry that people want to feel more connected to the people who cover their teams,\u201d Kartje said. To rekindle the tight-knit feeling readers crave, he wants his newsletter to feel \u201clike talking with friends after the game.\u201d He hopes that the intimate nature of it will offer a fresh way for people to connect with his coverage in a way they might not through a traditional newspaper, he said.\n\nOn top of USC\u2019s entry into the Big Ten, Kartje noted the importance of this season for Head Coach Lincoln Riley. He explained the high stakes with Riley coming off an \u201carguably a down season\u201d and entering a conference facing teams that \u201cmay be held in a higher esteem than some members of the Pac-12 at the time.\u201d\n\nWith these culminating factors, the newsletter comes at a \u201ctransformative\u201d time in Trojan History,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability to make a national impression is higher now than it ever has been,\u201d Kartje said. There\u2019s a lot of factors that are all coalescing this one year.\u201d\n\nIn addition to USC-specific stories, the newsletter will cover Big Ten travel tips and Big Ten best bets. As the Trojans gear up to play their first Big Ten game in Ann Arbor on September 21, today\u2019s issue of The Times of Troy set USC fans up with must-know information about Michigan.\n\nHaving grown up in Michigan and attended the University of Michigan, Kartje has a wealth of Big 10 background knowledge.\n\n\u201cI would definitely follow an L.A. Times thing,\u201d Omar Abd-Elhamid, a senior political science student said. \u201cI prefer following a USC outlet for USC sports than [a national one], but it\u2019s good to get an outside perspective.\u201d\n\nTo access this newsletter, fans can visit the L.A. Times newsletters page. Kartje encourages those with questions to reach out to his L.A. Times email, which he will respond to in the newsletter, the L.A. Times said.\n\nTo view USC sports live, Trojans can watch with Big Ten Networks providers, or subscribe to B1G+ \u2014 the Big Ten Network\u2019s direct-to-consumer video streaming platform, USC Athletics said.\n\nOther outlets also provide USC sports beat coverage. Annenberg Media covers USC sports in broadcast, editorial, podcast and multimedia formats through ATVN\u2019s Wednesday Sports SCene segment, ARN shows, and digital coverage at the sports desk. The Daily Trojan also covers campus athletics, and the Los Angeles Daily News hosts a USC sports beat written by reporter Luca Evans.\n```"}

Drawing on research conducted by the Getty, the exhibition opens to the public on Tuesday and dives into the accomplished artist\u2019s use of gunpowder and pyrotechnics through an extensive collection of Guo-Qiang\u2019s renowned works in different stages of his life.\n\nThe exhibit is an \u201cunbelievable collaboration\u201d between the USC Pacific Asia Museum and the Getty Center, Bethany Montagno, executive director of USC museums, said in the exhibit\u2019s opening speech. Guo-Qiang\u2019s artwork makes people believe they are \u201ccapable of doing impossible things,\u201d Montagno said.\n\nGuo-Qiang has been working with gunpowder and pyrotechnics to create drawings, paintings and explosion events for more than 40 years. The lack of control and predictability of this material invented in China over a millennium ago deeply fascinated Guo-Qiang from a young age.\n\nThe exhibit debuted in 2020 at Beijing\u2019s Palace Museum and went to Shanghai\u2019s Museum of Art Pudong in 2021.

In the exhibit\u2019s guided tour he stated he believes that AI should not be hidden behind the screen.\n\nThe artist\u2019s newest commission, a daytime fireworks show entitled \u201cWE ARE: Explosion Event\u201d for PST ART presented by the Getty in collaboration with USC, was displayed at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Sunday. Guo-Qiang choreographed the event using his custom AI model, cAI.\n\nAnother theme central to Guo-Qiang\u2019s works is eternity. The artist believes eternity transcends the existence of time. He attempts to capture the instantaneous moments to grasp their eternity. \u201cEven when something is eternal, you can\u2019t own it forever,\u201d Guo-Qiang said in 2016.\n\nThe Getty\u2019s interdisciplinary research analyzed the compounds and pigments in Guo-Qiang\u2019s pyrotechnic powders for their longevity and will publish the findings in the Getty Conservation Institute\u2019s \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Materials\u201d series.\n\nGuo-Qiang shared the story of the last painting of the exhibition, which he calls the \u201cending of his cosmic travel,\u201d inspired by the Tibetan Buddhist mandala. The sand mandala is a Tibetan Buddhist tradition involving the creation and destruction of geometric diagrams made from colored sand. Once complete, the mandala will be dismantled.\n\n\u201c[Buddhists] put the dedicated mandalas into the river. The fire in my work functions similarly to the river...

(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)\n\nBy Daniel Palmore\nSeptember 16, 2024 at 1:00 pm PDT\n\nSince the NFL expanded to a 14-team playoff field in 2020, only 6.25% of teams that started with two-straight losses have made the postseason. That\u2019s not promising for the Los Angeles Rams, who are now 0-2 after a 41-10 loss to the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nAfter receiving the game\u2019s opening kickoff, LA\u2019s offense was quickly taken off the field after they failed to pick up a first down. On Arizona\u2019s opening drive, the LA defense surrendered the game\u2019s first touchdown after quarterback Kyler Murray connected with rookie wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. on a 23-yard touchdown, capping off a six-play, 60-yard drive.\n\nCardinal wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. proved why he was the No. 4 pick in last year\u2019s NFL draft, scoring two touchdowns on his first two receptions. The former Ohio State Buckeye recorded all of his 130 receiving yards in the first quarter, and the developing connection between him and quarterback Kyler Murray had the game over barely after it got underway.\n\nThe Cardinals kept the momentum after their first touchdown, forcing the Rams to a three-and-out. Already facing a seven-point deficit, Los Angeles\u2019 defense gave up another touchdown to the Cardinals as Murray found Harrison Jr. again for his second touchdown of the game, this time on a 60-yard pass.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 offense had no answers for the Cardinals\u2019 defense and was forced to punt four times throughout the game, just one better than their Week One loss to the Detroit Lions. On the other hand, Arizona\u2019s offense dominated the LA defense in both the run and pass games, with Cardinal\u2019s running back James Conner tallying 122 yards and one touchdown.\n\nTo make matters worse for the Rams after two tough results, wide receiver Cooper Kupp limped his way to the locker room with an apparent ankle injury with 43 seconds left in the first half. Kupp did not play in the second half and was seen wearing a walking boot postgame.\n\nThe Rams are already playing without All-Pro wide receiver Puca Nacua, and it is likely that Kupp will have to miss some time as well. If Stafford is going to be without his two best receivers, he will have to rely on a committee of wideouts featuring Demarcus Robinson, Tyler Johnson and Tutu Atwell.\n\nThrough the first two games of the season, the LA offense is averaging just 15 points per game, tied with the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Miami Dolphins for the sixth fewest in the league.\n\nWith Los Angeles needing a spark on the offensive side of the ball, one player the Rams need to step up is rookie running back Blake Corum. Although Corum only had 28 rushing yards in the loss, his three-and-a-half yards per carry on eight rushing attempts was higher than fellow running back Kyren Williams, who had four more carries in Sunday\u2019s game.\n\nWith the Rams missing key receivers, Los Angeles should also look for tight end Colby Parkinson to be more productive. After catching four passes for 47 yards in week one, Parkinson was held to just one catch for 12 yards against Arizona. Parkinson signed a three-year deal with the Rams this offseason after spending the first four seasons of his career with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nIf the Rams are going to right the ship, improving the defensive side of the ball should be a priority. Through the first two weeks of the season, Los Angeles is dead last in yards allowed and second to last in points allowed. The LA defense has particularly struggled against the run this season, allowing 197 yards per game.\n\nWithout defensive tackle Aaron Donald anchoring the middle, Los Angeles will need interior linemen such as Bobby Brown III and Neville Gallimore to cause more disruption for opposing offenses.\n\nThere is still a lot of season left, but if the Rams are going to get back on track, it needs to do so soon. Los Angeles has an opportunity to bounce back next week in its home opener, a matchup against the 1-1 San Francisco 49ers.\n```"}

(Photo via X/@Farjestad_BK)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner September 16, 2024 at 12:32 pm PDT\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks have featured talented goaltender John Gibson between the pipes for over a decade, but Gibson\u2019s success has significantly waned along with his team\u2019s in recent years. Youngster Lukas Dostal has shown flashes in net, but behind an up-and-coming defensive prospect pool, the Ducks would surely like to have another youthful option in the crease to command games and eventually succeed Gibson.\n\nEnter 19-year-old Damian Clara, the first Italian-born draftee in NHL history and the tallest-ever Duck selected by the franchise. Anaheim nabbed Clara at No. 60 overall in the 2023 draft, taking a chance on the 6-foot-6 journeyman who toured Europe before hearing his name called by Ducks general manager Pat Verbeek.\n\nFinding success everywhere he\u2019s played, Clara shined in Sweden before getting drafted, posting a .903 save percentage with a 2.79 goals-against average for F\u00e4rjestad BK at the J20 level. Clara went 25-8-0 with four shutouts in the HockeyAllsvenskan\u2014Sweden\u2019s second league\u2014in 2023-24, further aiding his growth.\n\nAs goaltenders tend to take extensive time to develop, Clara has yet to debut in the Swedish Hockey League but will look to take a leap in 2024-25 after signing his three-year entry-level contract with Anaheim. Clara was named the top junior player in the HockeyAllsvenskan in 2023-24, leading Bryn\u00e4s IF to an SHL promotion while on loan.\n\nDuring the qualification round, he posted incredible figures, recording a 1.68 goals-against average and a .931 save percentage. For a large and stout goaltender, Clara has swift mobility, complementing his beneficially massive frame to stop pucks. He has an eye for tracking the puck and can set his feet well, allowing him to avoid giving up goals on deceptive plays.\n\nClara can also lower himself efficiently to reach pucks, a skill he has polished over the years. His size can\u2019t be emphasized enough, as it gives him the ability to stretch out and stop wrap-around shots, loose pucks and other dangerous plays.\n\nAlthough he\u2019ll likely spend at least one more season in Sweden, Clara\u2019s path to North America will become clearer if he can have a breakout SHL season. The Ducks\u2019 aforementioned tandem at the NHL level appears to be stable and immovable for the time being, but Clara\u2019s age and NHL-caliber size should give him a solid chance to compete for a spot in the coming seasons, especially now that he\u2019s on contract.\n\nClara\u2019s uniqueness\u2014in his heritage and towering size\u2014make him an intriguing prospect for Anaheim, a team with plenty of prospect depth but needing improvement in the defensive zone. With plenty of eyes on him in Europe, Clara will aim to adapt to the SHL\u2019s competitiveness and speed, continuing to use his puck-tracking abilities to put the team on his back like he did while in the HockeyAllsvenskan.\n\nHe\u2019ll want to stay consistent when jumping up a level, as Ducks brass will certainly judge his ability to do so against stronger competition. But Clara is no stranger to change, as he\u2019s already played for three different teams in Sweden plus other programs in Austria prior to beginning juniors.\n\nThe Ducks\u2019 2023 draft pool is shaping out to be a potentially star-studded class, and although development might appear slow for Clara, he\u2019ll certainly be in consideration as one of Anaheim\u2019s future main options in the crease.\n```"}

Los Angeles gained nearly 200 more scrimmage yards than Carolina and out-possessed the home team by just under 13 minutes. The Chargers were able to control time of possession due in large part to Harbaugh\u2019s offensive philosophy: running the football.

The former Raven has sprung onto the scene in Los Angeles after tearing both his ACL and Achilles in past years. The running back\u2019s career was looking bleak, but he has found success in his role in offensive coordinator Greg Roman\u2019s system. Quarterback Justin Herbert had an efficient performance, remaining calm and poised while going through his progressions. The Chargers\u2019 offensive line was able to protect its signal caller throughout, allowing just one sack. Herbert completed 14 of his 20 pass attempts for two touchdowns and one interception. Second-year receiver Quentin Johnston had perhaps his best performance in blue and gold. The former No. 21 overall pick out of TCU has often struggled with creating separation and drops throughout his pro career. But against the Panthers, Johnston hauled in five of his six targets for 51 yards and two scores, including a 29-yard touchdown to open up scoring on Los Angeles\u2019 opening drive. Herbert found Johnston down the left sideline, perfectly placing the ball in his outstretched hands after Johnston beat cornerback Jaycee Horn on a go-ball. While offensive skill position players impressed for the Chargers, it was first-year defensive coordinator Jesse Minter\u2019s group who shined. The defense allowed only seven first downs, 159 total yards, forced seven punts and kept Carolina out of the end zone. While no player particularly popped on the stat sheet, the Chargers\u2019 defense was flying around the field, making tackles in open space and keeping everything in front of them. Los Angeles\u2019 front seven held its own in run support, allowing just 90 yards on the ground. Cornerback Elijah Molden intercepted Panthers quarterback Bryce Young over the middle late in the second quarter, allowing the Chargers to extend their lead to 20 going into halftime. Young\u2019s tenure in Carolina continues to disappoint Panthers fans, as he completed 18 of his 26 pass attempts for just 84 yards and an interception. Young was also one-for-six for seven yards on passes beyond the sticks. Tight end Tommy Tremble led the team with just 23 receiving yards and running back Chubba Hubbard led the team with 64 rushing yards on 10 attempts. The Chargers are off to arguably their most exciting start in the Justin Herbert era, as there appears to be a clear culture change in Los Angeles through two games. The team continues to show its impressive defensive prowess and efficient ground attack through two weeks, an encouraging sight for a team that struggled in both categories last season. Harbaugh\u2019s squad will head to Pittsburgh next week to take on Mike Tomlin\u2019s 2-0 Steelers.\n```"}

LAFC took a quick 2-0 lead during the first half, but it was the Galaxy who charged back and ultimately won at home, scoring four unanswered goals to win 4-2 and clinch a playoff berth. The win also gives the Galaxy a seven point lead over second-place LAFC in the Western Conference, allowing the Galaxy to control their destiny for the No. 1 seed with five matches remaining in the regular season.\n\nComing into the match, the Galaxy had lost both of their previous two games against LAFC in 2024 by a 2-1 scoreline. Besides the fact the club couldn\u2019t get over the hump against their intra-city enemy, its original four-point lead could\u2019ve dwindled to one if LAFC were victorious, signaling that this game was possibly the most important matchup of the year for both sides. However, the Galaxy didn\u2019t begin the game as if it were a make-or-break game for the team\u2019s No. 1-seed aspirations, allowing two goals to LAFC in just the first 15 minutes.\n\nLAFC\u2019s star forward Denis Bouanga placed his stamp on this game from the get-go. Even though he wasn\u2019t credited for an assist on LAFC\u2019s first goal, he set up the chance. Bouanga cut in from the left wing, as he often does, and played a ball towards the center of the box that was deflected into the air, permitting Mateusz Bogusz to capitalize by heading home past Galaxy goalkeeper and former LAFC player John McCarthy in the fourth minute. Then in the 15th minute, it was Bouanga again who stormed in from the left, spinning around Galaxy defender Jalen Neal and finishing past McCarthy on the near post to make it 2-0.\n\nEven though they were shut out at the half, the Galaxy offense kept clicking with midfielder Riqui Puig controlling the tempo. Puig and forward Gabriel Pec created some great chances in the first half, but they couldn\u2019t find the net against LAFC keeper and World Cup-winner Hugo Lloris. \u201cI felt like even in the first half we created chances, we didn\u2019t finish them,\u201d Galaxy manager Greg Vanney said in his postgame press conference. \u201cIt was looking at the first half and saying okay we can\u2019t do anything about what has happened behind us...we just need to raise our intensity and raise the intention.\u201d\n\nThe Galaxy offense did exactly that at the start of the second half, applying pressure vigorously on the LAFC defense. They finally broke through in the 53rd minute when striker Dejan Jovelji\u0107 displayed fancy footwork in the penalty box to sidestep an LAFC defender and finish in the top left corner past Lloris. Applying the pressure again in LAFC\u2019s box just two minutes later, Puig played a ball back to midfielder Edwin Cerrillo, who rocketed one into the top left corner from the top of the 18 to even the score at two apiece.\n\nThe Galaxy\u2019s leaky first-half defense sealed itself in the second, allowing one of the league\u2019s best offenses to flourish. It was Puig again at the heart of the attack in the 67th minute, when he received the ball in the box from a nice cutback delivered by new star Marco Reus. Puig decided to take the shot with minimal power, but the deflection fell right to Jovelji\u0107, who tapped one past Lloris to give the Galaxy a 3-2 lead and send the supporters at the Dignity Health Sports Park into a frenzy.\n\nLAFC couldn\u2019t contain the Galaxy\u2019s firepower on offense in the second half and to make matters worse, midfielder Lewis O\u2019Brien received a red card in the 79th minute. With O\u2019Brien off the pitch, the Galaxy had even more space to operate and utilize in the midfield. Reus and Puig had their way in that area of the pitch, with Reus playing Puig on a no-look, give-and-go pass that the Spanish midfielder fired from the top of the box, fooling Lloris to boost the Galaxy lead to 4-2 in the 86th minute, effectively putting the game to bed.\n\nSecond half comebacks are no stranger in El Tr\u00e1fico, as this match almost mirrored Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107's debut in 2018. That day, he came off the bench to score two goals and win the first ever LA derby. Six years later, the Galaxy now own a 10-5-9 record over LAFC. The Galaxy currently have the most goals scored in the Western Conference at 57, further proving why they\u2019re one of the favorites to win the MLS Cup. They\u2019ll have to take care of business with five matches remaining, with the next one coming up on the road against the Portland Timbers on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo by Enzo Luna)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler\nSeptember 15, 2024 at 8:58 pm PDT\n\nIn its home-opening doubleheader on Saturday, the No. 3 USC men\u2019s water polo team defeated the No. 9 University of Irvine Anteaters and the Whittier College Poets. The Trojans started the day with a 15-11 win against the Anteaters. The game was back-and-forth, with the Trojans leading 6-5 at halftime, but a strong second half turned it into a strong win.\n\nA main goal from head coach Marko Pintaric heading into this season was for his team to come out hot in the second half. \u201cOne of our goals for this season is that when it hits halftime, it\u2019s a brand new game,\u201d fifth-year 2-meter Max Miller said. USC did just that, winning the sprint before Miller scored his second of three goals in the game. Senior 2-meter Luka Brnetic \u2014 originally from Croatia \u2014 scored shortly after, putting USC up by three goals.\n\nThe two teams traded blows until the Trojans were able to score three straight at the end of the final period and push the lead to four goals. While eight Trojans compiled at least two points, the special aspect of this game was Miller and fifth-year driver Carson Kranz, who both tallied the 100th career goals at USC. Miller and Kranz both started with the Trojan in 2020, making it that much sweeter they hit the milestone in the same game. \u201cIt\u2019s super fun,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI think Carson [Kranz] was also about to get 100, so we were just making a little competition out of it.\u201d\n\nAfter a close first two periods, Pintaric was much happier with how his team played the second half of the game. \u201cWe started a little slow, but the guys really responded well,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Trojans also continued this momentum into the second game, flattening Whittier 21-9. The star of this game was Brnetic, who scored three goals in the span of 90 seconds. His third-period tirade \u2014 combined with two goals each from senior driver Jake Carter, sophomore utility Luke Nelson, redshirt junior 2-meter Jack Martin and senior driver Aidan Wattson \u2014 all led to a lopsided victory for USC.\n\nThe Trojan goaltenders came to play \u2013 with redshirt sophomore starter Bernardo Herzer holding down the pipes in the first game. Redshirt freshman Charlie Mills and redshirt junior Eric Hubner combined for a stellar effort in the second game. During game one, Herzer made seven saves and worked well with the defense to limit shots from the set position. Mills and Hubner held it down in the cage during game two, combining for five saves as a tandem. Mills stood out in the transition game, constantly feeding accurate outlets to his teammates to start early offense. He also garnered two steals in the game, compounding on the two saves that he made.\n\nPintaric loved the outcome of the games, especially since it was a tough doubleheader, leading with the highly ranked Irvine. \u201cIt\u2019s good for us to know that, no matter what the game is, what the tempo is, that we can push through and come out with that victory,\u201d he said postgame.\n\nThis article was written before USC\u2019s 16-7 win over the No. 4 Pepperdine Waves on Sunday.\n```"}

Mascarenas-Arnold\u2019s transition to USC has been marked by significant contributions on the field and strong leadership. In the past two games, Arnold\u2019s performance has stood out. Against LSU, he recorded two solo tackles and four assisted tackles, playing a crucial role in controlling the Tigers\u2019 offense. His efforts were even more pronounced in the matchup against Utah State, where he made four solo tackles and three assisted tackles. His consistent presence reflects his growing impact on the defense and his adaptability in high-pressure situations.\n\nHead coach Lincoln Riley has been particularly impressed with Mascarenas-Arnold\u2019s influence since his arrival. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s very steady. He did a good job of coming in and getting to know the guys and trying to win the respect of the locker room,\u201d Riley remarked. Riley\u2019s observation underscores Mascarenas-Arnold\u2019s successful integration into the team dynamic. His ability to connect with teammates and earn their trust has been crucial in establishing his role as a leader.\n\nThe Trojan skipper further elaborated on Mascarenas-Arnold\u2019s qualities, emphasizing his balanced approach. \u201cHe\u2019s a consistent guy, he\u2019s a high-energy guy,\u201d Riley said. \u201cFootball\u2019s really, really important to him. This team, this defense, are very important to him and that doesn\u2019t ever waver.\u201d This statement highlights Arnold\u2019s dedication to the sport and his consistent effort to bring intensity and focus to every practice and game.\n\nRiley noted that Mascarenas-Arnold\u2019s leadership stems from his reliability. \u201cOne of the best characteristics as a leader is being steady,\u201d Riley said. \u201cNot being one person one day and different the next, where people know exactly what they can expect out of you.\u201d Mascarenas-Arnold\u2019s steadiness and reliability provide the team with a dependable presence, which is essential for building cohesion and confidence.\n\nRedshirt senior offensive lineman Jonah Monheim also praised Mascarenas-Arnold\u2019s leadership and dedication. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly stepped into that role from the day he got here, and it starts with his work ethic,\u201d Monheim said. Mascarenas-Arnold\u2019s strong work ethic, combined with his natural leadership abilities, has allowed him to quickly become a cornerstone of the Trojans\u2019 defense. \u201cHe\u2019s a great dude on and off the field, and he really takes pride in everything he does,\u201d Monheim said. This sentiment reflects Mascarenas-Arnold\u2019s dedication, not only to his football responsibilities, but also to his role as a teammate and mentor.\n\nMascarenas-Arnold impressively blends a high level of play with strong interpersonal skills and his impact is expected to continue growing, reinforcing his role as a leader and a key defensive player.\n```"}

(Photo by Malcolm Caminero)\n\nBy Sydnie McClain September 15, 2024 at 12:52 pm PDT\n\nAfter sweeping the Utah State Aggies in a 3-0 victory on Thursday, the No. 23 USC women\u2019s volleyball team (5-2) hosted the Ohio Bobcats (3-4) on the second day of the SoCal Cup I tournament on Friday. The Trojans came back to win three sets in a row (25-17, 26-24, 29-27) after falling behind 0-1 after the first set (25-23).\n\nFrom the start of the match, it seemed like the Trojans would have to battle it out. In the first set, the Trojans and Bobcats were neck and neck with eight total lead changes, but in the end, the Bobcats went on a three-point streak to win the first set 25-23.\n\nGraduate outside hitter Ally Batenhorst won the first point of the second set with a kill, setting the tone for the rest of the frame. Later, the Trojans surged with a five-point streak, and despite Ohio going on a four-point stretch when the score stood at 24-13, the Trojans were able to close out the set, 25-17.\n\nBatenhorst matched her career high with 19.5 points gained on a career-high 17 kills. She also secured her third double-double of the year with 11 digs.\n\nThe Trojans and the Bobcats traded points throughout the third set. USC didn\u2019t go on a run of more than two points until they were down 24-21, when they scored the last five points of the set.\n\nGraduate outside hitter Grae Gosnell posted a season-high 15 digs in the match, gaining three crucial digs to win the game point in the third set, which put USC up 2-1 going into the fourth set.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I was thinking in my head was somebody\u2019s gonna have to wheel me off this court because I\u2019m hurt before I let a ball drop, because I need to get this for my teammates,\u201d Gosnell said postgame.\n\nGosnell, a transfer from Indiana, has been a really strong asset for USC thus far, primarily coming into games as a defensive or service specialist.\n\n\u201cI can only go as hard for myself as my trust goes for my teammates. And I have a lot of trust with my teammates,\u201d Gosnell said. \u201cI feel the harder I go, the harder they go, and we pull each other up. And my only thought was, nothing\u2019s touching that floor.\u201d\n\nIn the fourth set, both teams fought to the end with 13 tie scores in that frame alone. In the end, the Trojans got the win 29-27 behind strong kills from redshirt junior middle blocker Tyrah Ariail, who scored a season-best 12 kills and recorded a .611 hitting percentage.\n\nThough the Trojans pulled off the win 3-1, head coach Brad Keller expressed his frustration about the game in a postgame conference.\n\n\u201cI think this was probably the most confusing night for me,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI thought I did a pretty poor job coaching tonight. Honestly, I told the team that in the locker room. I just felt like it was just... nothing was working and everything was off.\u201d\n\nAlong with giving his dues to the team for finding ways to win when things did not go as planned, Keller specifically credits Batenhorst for her impact on the win.\n\n\u201cShe had 40 swings and hit .350, so she carried us,\u201d Keller said. \u201cShe was lights out, and she made big play after big play when we needed [it], and she made the last play on the wall. So, she\u2019s been there and done that. She knows how to win.\u201d\n\nNext week, the Trojans co-host SoCal Cup II and welcome LMU (September 19), UNLV (September 20) and UC San Diego (September 21) to Galen Center for matches.

In addition to contracting polio as a child, she encountered a nearly fatal bus accident at 18, which led to several broken bones, a fractured spine, and a shattered pelvis. This led to nearly 30 surgeries throughout Frida\u2019s life.\n\nSophy Jiwon Kim, the producer of \u201cFrida: The Last Night Show\u201d describes, \u201cFrida went through unimaginable pain since the beginning of her life, but...she was not defined by her pain, and was a bright and at times, humorous person. We hope that the show will provide comfort to the audience. That is why we chose to produce the show.\u201d\n\nThe performance, which featured explosive vocals performances, heart-wrenching stories, and comedic audience interactions, deserved a standing ovation. All actors, including lead actress Sohyang Sophie Kim, communicated deep emotions through their candid acting. In particular, some scenes that shifted the mood of the crowd included the miscarriage scene, where Frida transitions from a joyful celebratory lullaby sung to her child, to an outburst of anguish following the tragic news. Coupled with audio of the ER doctors operating on Frida and alerting siren sounds, tension and heaviness filled the room.\n\nThe set and lighting also worked seamlessly with the musical to emphasize important cues, such as power relations. When Frida first meets her husband, Diego Rivera, the audience learns of his unquestionable status and lust for women that will soon doom his relationship with Frida. In this scene, Diego does not appear in front of the audience. Instead, his shadow is projected on the curtain while he stands on a staircase looming over Frida. Incorporating humor, the shadow also consistently shoots hand shaped hearts at Frida and the audience members, showing his uncontrollable attraction to various women.\n\nParticularly interesting to note is the show\u2019s incorporation of elements reminiscent of K-pop and K-drama elements. Throughout the show, the four all female cast members engage in synchronized, charismatic choreography. Further, the musical\u2019s storytelling leads to emotional catharsis and features complex, well developed characters that engage in rich dialogue, characteristics that international audiences may compare to K-drama.\n\nThe visual and emotional impact of \u201cFrida\u201d was astonishing, to say the very least. Not only does the storytelling evoke deep sympathy for Frida, it also motivates the audience to maintain resilience in their many trials. For K-pop fans and international broadway lovers alike, the show transcends language barriers and delivers an emotionally healing experience. Perhaps following a K-pop and K-drama frenzy over the last few years, Korean musicals may soon thrive in the international market.\n```"}

Head coach Curt Miller had previously referred to the Sparks\u2019 matchups with the Connecticut Sun and Seattle as opportunities for the team to practice under playoff-style intensity.\n\nEvery player in LA\u2019s starting lineup had points by the second quarter. This was a beneficial change, as recently, the Sparks have been solely led by their top stars. Forward Azur\u00e1 Stevens showed out for Los Angeles with 18 points, 15 rebounds and four 3-pointers. Her stat line made her the third WNBA player in history to record at least 15 points, 15 rebounds and four 3-pointers in a game.\n\nRookie forward Rickea Jackson continued to show her development with 22 points, seven rebounds and three assists. Ten-year veteran guard Odyssey Sims exerted her leadership with 16 points, six assists and three rebounds. Sims is currently on a hardship contract with the Sparks. She\u2019s been bouncing around the league for the last handful of years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been staying ready,\u201d Sims said. \u201cI\u2019m not done playing yet and I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be done. I\u2019m excited to be with this group ... I want to come back if it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nAs a team, LA shot 49.2% from the field with 48 points in the paint. This is an improvement from the last game against the Connecticut Sun when the Sparks shot 38.3% with only 36 points in the paint.\n\n\u201cWhen we do start winning, it\u2019s going to feel that much better because we\u2019ll remember this moment to set us up for the future,\u201d Sims said.\n\nDespite the positives, the Sparks couldn\u2019t finish the job. In the fourth quarter, they missed crucial shots and allowed Seattle to go on a six-point run for two minutes near the end of the frame. Storm guard Skylar Diggins-Smith was a huge contributor to the win with 26 points, five assists and four steals. Additionally, Storm forward Nneka Ogwumike showed up against her former team with 16 points and eight rebounds.\n\nThe Storm continued to stay hot and the Sparks got shut down. LA missed some key shots and just couldn\u2019t continue producing like at the start of the game.

The show is based off the Pulitzer Prize winning novel written by Viet Thanh Nguyen (Photo courtesy of Hopper Stone for HBO)\n\nBy Katelyn Do September 14, 2024 at 3:00 pm PDT\n\nWhen \u201cThe Sympathizer\u201d premiered in April on HBO, the miniseries challenged mainstream narratives of the Vietnam War, telling stories of the war through the Vietnamese perspective to an American audience. Based on the bestselling book by Viet Thanh Nguyen, the show boasted an unprecedented predominately Vietnamese cast along with Hollywood stars like Robert Downey Jr. and Sandra Oh. The show received praise for its diversity and showcasing of the Vietnamese perspective of the war when previously, films about the war often were told through the American perspective. Blockbusters such as \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d or \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d two of the most popular depictions of the Vietnam War, follow white American soldier protagonists.\n\nNaturally, \u201cThe Sympathizer\u201d and its focus on an Asian cast would be nominated for many Emmys for this achievement, right? Not quite. HBO has campaigned for the show\u2019s recognition from the Television Academy Emmy Awards, submitting it to 27 different categories. However, The Sympathizer only landed one nomination in \u2018Outstanding Supporting Actor In A Limited Or Anthology Series Or Movie\u2019 for Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s performance, in which he portrayed four different characters. Each of Downey Jr.\u2019s roles represent a distinct aspect of the American machine, from CIA to Hollywood. Downey Jr. is the show\u2019s only white actor and many have considered this nomination to have snubbed the show\u2019s predominantly Asian cast.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. as Claude with Hoa Xuande as The Captain in HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Sympathizer\u201d. (Photo courtesy of Hopper Stone for HBO)\n\nDuy Nguyen, who plays a supporting role on the show, praised Downey Jr. \u2018s support of the cast and show, but admitted his disappointment to see that none of the Vietnamese actors who campaigned for an Emmy nomination received one. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of power but at least we have a stepping stone. It\u2019s a stepping stone [...] to have more and more Vietnamese stories,\u201d said Duy Nguyen \u201cOne day we\u2019ll see a Vietnamese actor being represented on that stage.\u201d\n\nHistorically, Asian actors accounted for less than 6% of speaking roles in mainstream Hollywood films. Casting director, Jennifer Venditti, told Variety that it was important for the show to cast people who came directly from the community. For most of the cast, it was their first time being featured in a project of its magnitude.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s giving this opportunity for Vietnamese actors, not only in America, but all over the world to be able to represent themselves, to have a footing in Hollywood because it\u2019s been so white dominant. That\u2019s just the history of Hollywood,\u201d said Vy Le, one of the miniseries\u2019 actors.\n\nNguyen Cao Ky Duyen as Madame and Vy Le as Lana in HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Sympathizer\u201d. The miniseries is Le\u2019s on-screen debut. (Photo courtesy of Hopper Stone for HBO)\n\nLe, 21, was a junior in high school when a friend sent her a casting call looking for Vietnamese talent for the show. Originally from Nha Trang, Vietnam, says she was stunned as she read the description for a character called Lana \u2014 the General\u2019s rebellious teenage daughter who wants to be an entertainer \u2014 because of how similar the role was to her own life. Lana is the General\u2019s rebellious teenage daughter who wants to be an entertainer. At the age of 14, Le traveled to Boston from Vietnam to study theater at an arts school, despite her parents\u2019 objections. Le made her on-screen debut this year in the miniseries. Similarly, the character Lana flees Vietnam after the war where she then goes on to pursue a career in entertainment.\n\nLe made her on-screen debut this year in the miniseries. \u201cThis is the first time that the Vietnamese American people can accurately represent themselves and tell that story that\u2019s been kind of swept under the rug this whole time,\u201d Le said.\n\nDuy Nguyen is also originally from Vietnam. Unlike Le, however, Nguyen says he got into acting by complete accident. Nguyen traveled from Hanoi, Vietnam to Canada when he was 17 to study business, but came too early to start his program and was placed in a theater arts program instead. \u201cI had no idea what the hell it was, didn\u2019t never done acting in my entire life,\u201d said Nguyen. \u201cDid not know what theater was. But I got into it. And then after two years, I fell in love with it, you know, and then never stopped since.\u201d\n\nNguyen portrays the character Man, a North Vietnamese spy and best friend to the protagonist. He has been acting professionally for six years but says he has faced struggles as an immigrant actor. \u201cI\u2019ve been told by many people, by my old agent, by my teacher, that I would never make it in this industry because of my accent [...] and because nobody\u2019s going to know how to pronounce my name,\u201d said Nguyen. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t care. I just want to care about what is true to me. And if I make it, I\u2019ll make it. If not, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nDuy Nguyen portrays Man in HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Sympathizer\u201d. Nguyen is originally from Hanoi, Vietnam. (Photo courtesy of Hopper Stone for HBO)\n\nFor Nguyen and Ly, acting in the show were eye-opening experiences. \u201cReading \u2018The Sympathizer\u2019 was actually my first time actually learning of what happened,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cThen working on \u2018The Sympathizer\u2019, doing research for my character, that\u2019s when I actually learned about the real history. How nuanced it was,.\u201d\n\nFor Nguyen, taking the role also meant taking on some personal risks too. \u2018The Sympathizer\u2019 criticizes the Vietnamese government, the South Vietnamese government and American government throughout the show. Nguyen says he feared retaliation against his family for his participation in the show because Vietnam has a history of restricting government criticism. \u201cThere was a lot of thinking when I got the gig. I had to talk to my whole family about the thing that I\u2019m doing because it might affect them. They live there [in Vietnam], they have their business, their house, their health, their whole life is there,\u201d said Nguyen.\n\nAfter the show premiered, Nguyen said he put all of his money aside in case his family faced any retaliation to move his family to Canada.\n\nLe says the show also gave her a chance to learn more about the South Vietnamese perspective as those perspectives are not discussed in Vietnam. \u201cThe people in the South who fled to America to Australia to Canada, those stories are very much swept under the rug, it\u2019s not talked about anywhere, not in history books. They\u2019re considered traitors,\u201d said Ly.\n\nLy says she hopes the show sparks more open conversation and dialogue within the Vietnamese community. \u201cThere\u2019s always multiple sides to a story [...] You can\u2019t end the discussion at villainizing the other side because that\u2019s just plain ignorant,\u201d Ly said. \u201cDespite the generational trauma, it\u2019s important to at least hear that conversation.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Joel Robles)\n\nBy Joel Robles\nSeptember 14, 2024 at 11:15 am PDT\n\nIn partnership with sponsors Security Benefit and LA84 Foundation, the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation hosted a ceremony at Jim Thorpe Park that kicked off the construction of LADF\u2019s newest project for Hawthorne residents. Jim Thorpe Park\u2019s Dodger Dreamfield will be the 64th and 65th fields in its history, revitalizing 50% of the city\u2019s public baseball and softball fields. More than 24,000 youths in Hawthorne will have access to renovated green spaces.\n\nDodgers ace Clayton Kershaw discussed the variety of experiences baseball can provide. \u201cBaseball can mean a lot of different things for a lot of different people,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just playing the game, it\u2019s about these kids. I remember playing baseball with my friends from 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. It\u2019s a special time in kids\u2019 lives and for them to have something to do during that time is really cool.\u201d\n\nHawthorne has more than 96,000 residents and 11 school districts with 71,000 students enrolled. However, only 1% of the city\u2019s land is devoted to parks and recreation. Changes coming to Jim Thorpe Park include upgraded fencing, new customized signage, new foul poles, upgraded dugouts, an enlarged field, two scoreboards, new infield mix and sod, refurbished backstops and an updated bullpen.\n\nKershaw said this new field could help find tomorrow\u2019s stars. \u201cWho knows, we might find the next Mookie Betts or Freddie Freeman out here on this field. But if we don\u2019t, it will have an impact so much greater than they do beyond baseball,\u201d Kershaw said.\n\nIn addition to improving park access, the Dodger Dreamfields will create a space for young people to play sports, engage in learning opportunities, and access health and educational resources through LADF\u2019s Dodger Dreamteam. LADF seeks to complete 75 Dodger Dreamfields by 2033 in celebration of the Dodgers\u2019 75th anniversary of moving to Los Angeles.\n\nAnthony Martinez, the Regional Vice President of Southern California for Security Benefit, said his company has made a promise to the community. \u201cThe Foundation\u2019s mission to serve local communities to provide healthy activities for its youth reflects many of our same values,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cMuch like the Dodgers Foundation, our founders made a promise to serve the underserved, and that commitment has become part of our DNA as an organization.\u201d\n\nSince 2003, LADF has invested over $20 million to refurbish 63 Dodgers Dreamfields and provide top-level baseball and softball fields. With the completion of fields 64 and 65, over 1.7 million youth and families will have access to these safe spots and points of pride.\n\nKershaw said the Dodgers aim to be more than just a baseball organization. \u201cThe more time I\u2019ve spent in L.A., the more I realize the Dodgers [aren\u2019t] just a baseball team to a lot of families,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cIt\u2019s generational. It\u2019s almost like a part of their families, it\u2019s a part of who they are, it\u2019s a part of what they talk about and it\u2019s just a part of the fabric of their lives.\u201d\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/09/14/gieslers-grand-slam-the-final-stretch-of-the-season/", "response": "```\nGiesler\u2019s Grand Slam: The final stretch of the season\n\nBowden Francis chokes away two no-hitters, Rookie of the Year contenders and the double play going into the weekend.\n\nTampa Bay Rays' pitcher Edwin Uceta's HBP led to a skirmish on the mound.\n\nBy Andrew Giesler\nSeptember 14, 2024 at 9:41 am PDT\n\nBench-clearing skirmish between the Phillies and Rays\n\nOn Tuesday night, Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Edwin Uceta came in to relieve in the bottom of the eighth inning against the Philadelphia Phillies. He was having a rough outing, giving up five runs and a Bryce Harper double before facing Nick Castellanos. Clearly frustrated, Uceta threw a 96-mph sinker that drilled Castellanos in the hip. Immediately, this sparked outrage, especially from Harper, who was on second. Both teams\u2019 benches and dugouts quickly emptied as players hustled toward the pitcher\u2019s mound. No direct punches were thrown, but tensions were flaring.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the game that we play, man... guys throw too hard nowadays,\u201d Harper said in a postgame interview. This was not the first time Harper stormed the mound in his career. In 2017, the former National\u2019s star was hit by a pitch in a similar situation, after which he ran toward the mound and hurled his helmet at Giants pitcher Hunter Strickland before landing and receiving a few serious punches.\n\nCastellanos approached the situation more subtly: \u201cIt\u2019s like my 2 year old throwing a fit because I [took] away his dessert before he\u2019s finished.\u201d\n\nAlthough this incident did not escalate to hands being thrown, it was certainly a case of poor anger management.\n\nBowden Francis\u2019s curse\n\nNo-hitters are rare in baseball, but the Toronto Blue Jays\u2019 Bowden Francis nearly found a no-no twice in the past month. The first came against the Anaheim Angels when Francis pitched eight no-hit innings before Taylor Ward stepped into the box in the top of the ninth inning. On an outside pitch, Ward pulled the ball into the center-left field bleachers for his 23rd homer of the season.\n\nFast forward three starts later, Francis was in the same position against the New York Mets. He clearly missed his spot with the 0-2 fastball, and Francisco Lindor of the Mets ended Francis\u2019 second no-hit opportunity. The Mets scored five more runs in the top of the ninth and won the game 6-2.\n\nIf he had been successful, he would have been the second Blue Jay to throw a no-hitter after Dave Stieb did in 1990. Francis continues to be very hot, with his ERA dropping from 5.64 to 3.5 over the past month. He\u2019s averaging nearly seven innings per start and has consistently struck batters out over that period.\n\nRookie of the Year race\n\nThe NL Rookie of the Year race is close, with San Diego Padres center-fielder Jackson Merrill leading the charge. Pittsburgh Pirates starting pitcher Paul Skenes isn\u2019t far behind, though. The two youngsters have taken the MLB by storm, giving their respective teams immediate impacts and competing with the top talent.\n\nDespite batting seventh in the Padres lineup, Merrill is deadly in the batter\u2019s box, maintaining a batting average of .286 and slugging at .492. He\u2019s also hit 23 home runs and 83 RBIs, and is a huge part of a Padres squad that will make it to October.\n\nSince his professional debut, Skenes has been a force to be reckoned with. The No. 1 pick in the draft has a 10-2 record with a 2.1 ERA. What\u2019s arguably more impressive though, is that he\u2019s struck out 151 batters and has a WHIP of 0.99. However, the Pirates ace could not carry the team to the playoffs, and the Pirates will miss October for the 10th-straight year.\n\nIn the American League, the race is between Colton Cowser of the Baltimore Orioles, Austin Wells of the New York Yankees and teammate Luis Gil. A left-fielder, Cowser\u2019s odds have dropped dramatically over the last month. His numbers are barely above average, batting .243 this season with 109 hits. His issue is that over the past 15 games, he has been batting .216 and has struck out 22 times.\n\nWells has been on Cowser\u2019s heels the entire season and has made himself the favorite. The catcher has 50 RBIs this season and is batting .252, in addition to being one of the top defensive catchers in the league.\n\nStarting pitcher Gill has only recently entered the race. He has very similar stats as Skenes, holding a 13-6 record, 3.18 ERA along with 156 strikeouts. If Gill and Skenes were both able to win Rookie of the Year, this would be the first time that two pitchers had won since Jeremey Hellickson and Craig Kimbrel did so in 2011.\n\nThe double play going into the weekend\n\nThe Mets are in a heated fight with the Atlanta Braves for the final Wild Card position in the NL. If they want any chance to play in October, they need to win this series to increase their one-game lead. Prediction:  Phillies take two of three games.\n\nOn the other side of that coin is the Braves, who are chasing the Mets. They would love to win this series, which would set the stage for a 13-game sprint in the home stretch of the season. Their opponent, the Los Angeles Dodgers, has basically secured a playoff spot, but all eyes will be on Shohei Ohtani to see if he can hit three more home runs and steal two more bases to become the founding member of the 50-50 club. Prediction:  The Dodgers take three of four games.\n\nLast weekend the Dodgers and Red Sox won their series, moving my prediction total to 9-13-2.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/09/13/the-big-10-trends-to-follow-this-football-season/", "response": "```\nThe Big 10 trends to follow this football season\n\nComing off of an exciting victory in Vegas, USC fans were itching to return to the Coliseum for the first home game of the season on September 7. But there\u2019s something arguably even more exhilarating than the game... the pre game. When it comes to game day outfits, it looks like a shift in conference also brought about a shift in confidence. The tailgate cluttered trek to the field has become a bona fide fashion show. So, after solidifying that we are \u2018so back\u2019 on the field, here are The Big Ten Trends that are also winning off of it:\n\n1. These Boots Are Made For Watchin\u2019\n\nKnee high, calf high, cardinal, gold, white \u2014 you name it, there\u2019s a boot for it. The TikTok virality of the \u201ccoastal grandmother\u201d aesthetic has met its match through a country sister, \u201ccoastal cowgirl.\u201d Between bumping Beyonce and Shaboozey\u2019s ever-trending hits, performing the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders \u201cThunderstruck\u201d pom routine in the mirror and, most recently, obsessing over \u201cLove Island\u201d star Rob Rausch\u2019s southern charm and style choices, a resurgence of western wear was downright inevitable. Many fans even went as far as to loop the ear pulls on each side of their boots with tulle and ribbon, another indicator that bows are also here to stay. As a native Texan, it was intriguing to see standard southern football chic make its way to the West Coast. For colleges in the Southeastern Conference, game day boutiques are the norm, complete with ruffled blouses, tiered dresses and flared denim to compliment the quintessential boot. You might as well giddy up and get on it.\n\n2. Jersey Couture\n\nMove over, Snooki. We\u2019ll take the jersey, no shore. In all seriousness, it\u2019s not groundbreaking to see jerseys at a stadium. However, it is noteworthy to see how people are revamping them \u2014 embracing mesh, lace up, oversized and cropped versions, swapping the traditional V-neck out for a baseball style button up or just wearing a cotton ringed tee that resembles the jersey style. Jerseys are guaranteed to be seen out and about for streetwear in the coming months, given that stars such as Julia Fox, Addison Rae and Bella Hadid can\u2019t seem to get enough of them. So, not only are they a staple game day investment, but they are also a versatile layering piece sure to add color to your wardrobe this season.\n\n3. Daring Denim\n\nOf course we know that low rise has made its comeback, but denim is also defeating athleisure this football season. Despite the heatwave in L.A. over the game day weekend, athletic bottoms were not the overwhelming first choice. Instead, everything from micromini denim skirts to longline jorts braved the blazing sun. Denim on denim was definitely a common theme \u2014 many fans paired their denim bottoms of choice with structured indigo corsets or vests, pulling off a monochromatic look. Others forfeited pairing altogether and went straight for a denim dress or overalls. Oh, and, let\u2019s not forget the occasional stray letter from the phrase \u2018MILLERTIME\u2019 in support of Trojans quarterback, Miller Moss, painted across a bare chest with Levi\u2019s on the bottom. Nothing screams football like a beer reference and denim to compliment it.\n\n4. Short & Sweet\n\nBloomers and boxer shorts were a fan favorite. Again, a twist on the typical tennis skirt or running short athleisure vibe, but offering a certain heir of comfort that denim simply cannot achieve. Not to mention, they took on the statement piece role for the outfits and made a perfect pair with any boots. The delicacy of frilly chiffon, lettuce edge hems and lace eyelets made these styles of shorts into the definition of sporty chic. They\u2019re essentially glorified PJs, and that\u2019s a win in everyone\u2019s playbook.\n\n5. Fans... With Fans\n\n\u2018Hot\u2019 wasn\u2019t enough to describe the mental toughness it took to Fight On for a Saturday of Trojan football. Other overheard weather descriptors included: \u2018burning,\u2019 \u2018miserable\u2019 and \u2018a literal oven.\u2019 There were a myriad of knick knacks to help beat the heat. Mini water bottles to spritz, large water bottles to chug, sweat towels hanging from belt loops. But the most eye-catching one of them all was a wave \u2014 or should I say, wind \u2014 of nostalgia: hand folding fans. These proved themselves worthy when many found that their electronic fans had lost battery long before the game\u2019s 8:00 p.m. start time. Besides, waving a fan in front of your face while waiting in line for tailgates is all the drama. Very cutesy. Very demure.\n\n6. Going for Gold\n\nLook, it doesn\u2019t matter what your color analysis tells you, gold looked good on everyone this particular Saturday. Chunky necklaces, jeweled rings, hand chains and Enewton bracelets transitioned from casual wear to straight school spirit. Stacking and layering made gold jewelry en masse particularly exciting. \u201cSC\u201d pendants on earrings and necklaces made their fair share of appearances too. If silver was spotted, it generally was in a mixed metal fashion.\n\n7. Pin It To Win It\n\nSleek and subtle wins the race. Rather than having Tommy Trojan, Traveller or the USC logo emblazoned across a shirt, several game goers opted for spirited, circular pins instead. Their placement ranged anywhere from head to hem, some even integrated two pins of different sizes for extra spunk. It\u2019s the perfect way to root for a team without feeling too on the nose with the rest of your outfit. You\u2019ll have a bigger budget to enhance your closet if you get a bang for your buck with a pin at the bookstore and let your personal style do the rest.\n\n8. Gingham Goals\n\nThere was certainly a picnic blanket vibe, courtesy of the cardinal that goes with our gold. But don\u2019t fret, it\u2019s a good thing. Gingham will always make its cyclical emergence through the trend cycle. Gingham was a staple on the runway circa 2017, with brands such as House of Holland and Carolina Herrera featuring the popular pattern in their spring / summer collections. Many of us probably have a vivid memory of going to school during that time, feeling accomplished after finally retrieving the coveted Brandy Melville gingham dress. Which, by the way, is now so \u2018vintage\u2019 you can find it on Poshmark. Yeah, remember the one you had to throw a jacket over because the spaghetti straps weren\u2019t cutting the three-finger width rule? If you\u2019re lucky, maybe you\u2019ll find it in the depths of your closet and start a major comeback.\n\n9. Throwing Shade\n\nEven before a 41-0 win, Trojan fans were serving major shade. Oval frames still seem to have taken dominance over rectangular frames, a pattern stemming from both \u201890s inspiration and a few Halloweens ago, when Hailey Bieber made Mia Thermopolis of \u201cThe Princess Diaries\u201d a go-to costume for the foreseeable future. Football season brings about the perfect (and most socially acceptable) opportunity to whip out a pair of Pit Vipers. These iconic shades boast a callback to \u201880s retro, oversized eyewear sitting at the perfect intersection of sports performance, lifestyle and your nose.\n\n10. Precious Cargo\n\nWhen the Coliseum gives you lemons, make lemonade... by wearing cargo pants. These bottoms, both in traditional and short styles, served both functional and fashionable purpose. The extra pocket space makes the strict bag policy a little bit more tolerable. However, if you\u2019re a certified bag lover, you might still find yourself wanting to succumb to the pressure of needing your favorite shoulder sidekick. Don\u2019t worry if you have to give in, clear bags have come a long way. The timeless baguette style is available in stadium-approved PVC.\n\nThe next game at the Coliseum falls on Saturday, September 28, which gives you plenty of time to curate your next outfit before the Trojans play Wisconsin. Oh, and, it\u2019s parents\u2019 weekend. So make sure you encourage all of your self-proclaimed \u201ccool\u201d family members to vicariously live the college lifestyle through you and these trends.\n```"}

At the Creative Arts Emmy Awards \u2014 the ceremony where the year\u2019s TV slate receives its \u201cbelow the line\u201d awards, like casting, costumes and stunt work \u2014 on Sunday, \u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d racked up 14 wins out of its 16 nominations, with five more categories still to be decided at the Primetime Emmys on September 15. The series received an impressive 25 total nominations for its debut season.\n\nThe series follows a brewing war in feudal Japan between Lord Yoshii Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada) and his fellow regents as the former ruler\u2019s son comes of age. Caught in the middle of this conflict are the English pilot John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis), whose ship crashlands in Japan, and Toda Mariko (Anna Sawai), a highborn lady who serves as Blackthorne\u2019s translator and is fiercely loyal to Toranaga.\n\nWith its grand scale, feudal time-setting and political drama, \u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d drew comparisons to the legendary HBO show \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d early and often. While the parallel does offer high praise, \u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d has distinctly superb qualities. For one, the show \u2014 co-created by husband-and-wife-duo Rachel Kondo and Justin Marks \u2014 does not hold the viewer\u2019s hand in how much it uses the Japanese language. Unless Blackthorne or another European character appears in a scene, the dialogue takes place entirely in Japanese.\n\nSanada helped bring that spirit of authenticity to the project not just as its star, but also as a producer. \u201cWhen I came to Hollywood, my mission was to show our culture correctly,\u201d Sanada told USA Today. \u201cIf there was a wall between East and West, I want to break it down. So yes, dreams come true.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s legitimately bilingual nature made the character of Mariko particularly essential. Luckily for \u201cSh\u014dgun,\u201d Sawai\u2019s performance blew audiences out of the water, as the former J-Pop star brought a sense of quiet strength and introspection to every scene. Sawai has an excellent chance to win the Emmy for Lead Actress in a Drama Series on Sunday. If she does, episode nine, titled \u201cCrimson Sky,\u201d will be the reason why. If it hasn\u2019t already, that chapter of \u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d should be remembered as one of television acting\u2019s most impressive tours de force of the 2020s.\n\nThe character\u2019s backstory is revealed piece-by-piece throughout the series, but Sawai carries an expression throughout that makes the audience feel as if they know her entire life. If \u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d had been made 20, or even just 10 years ago (James Clavell\u2019s 1975 novel was adapted into a TV miniseries released in 1980), it likely would have featured Jarvis\u2019 Blackthorne in a more prominent role, wandering dangerously into white savior territory. But Kondo and Marks\u2019 adaptation wisely showcases the extent to which Blackthorne cannot control his fortunes.\n\nThe character has to learn Japanese and assimilate to a culture previously unimaginable to him, all the while escaping his Portuguese Catholic adversaries and their allied Japanese lords. From start to finish, Blackthorne is simply not having a good time. But Jarvis ensures the audience has a good time watching him, thanks to his awkward stance and mannerisms, complete with Tom Hardy-esque voice work.\n\nThe quality of performances runs so deep that Jarvis didn\u2019t even receive a nomination for the Supporting Actor in a Drama Series category, where his co-stars Tadanobu Asano and Takehiro Hira are competing. They played Kashigi Yabushige, a scheming under-lord of Toranaga, and Ishido Kazunari, Toranaga\u2019s main rival, respectively. Asano\u2019s performance instills the show with rare humorous touches, as he brazenly flips his loyalties between multiple parties \u2014 one of the show\u2019s most Thronesian qualities.\n\n\u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d will enter Sunday evening\u2019s ceremony as a favorite to win the Outstanding Drama Series award, effectively the Emmy equivalent for Best Picture. FX\u2019s latest and greatest hit enjoyed not only the critical acclaim necessary to vault into that conversation but also genuine water cooler popularity. The premiere tallied over 9 million views within its opening six days, making it Disney\u2019s (who owns FX) biggest debut outside of IP juggernauts Marvel and Star Wars.\n\nDespite exhausting Clavell\u2019s source material, that level of success meant discussion of future seasons was inevitable. And in May, \u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d seasons two and three were greenlit with Sanada, Kondo and Marks all set to return. To catch up ahead of season two, you can watch all 10 episodes of \u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d on Hulu. Or, if you\u2019re really ambitious, binge the series ahead of Sunday\u2019s Emmys, where \u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d could add another handful of trophies to its tally.\n```"}

In fact, it\u2019s so accurate that for the \u201cGood Morning America\u201d crew \u2014 the real coverage has already begun.\n\nOn September 13, at a crisp 3:42 a.m., \u201cGood Morning America\u201d producers Abigail Shalawylo and Florina Ricks ushered a crowd, many being USC students, through the L.A. Live plaza. Coffee swirled in to-go cups while approaching the live audience check-in for the Emmys red carpet special episode. Despite the early hour, the soon-to-be TV extras donned elegant cocktail attire and chatted eagerly about what to expect. Going to school in Hollywood\u2019s backyard certainly has its perks.\n\n\u201cI only got two or three hours of sleep, but that\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d said M.S. journalism student Daniella Lake. \u201cIt\u2019s such a big event and especially because we\u2019re in the media industry, it was a no-brainer to say yes.\u201d\n\nAfter mingling by the box office, students held in sighs of awe while being escorted down the red carpet trimmed with velvet rope. At its end, two large panels covered in greenery and adorned with gold letters spelling out \u201cGMA\u201d stood on either side of a pair of chairs. There sat Robin Roberts, expertly reviewing scripts and receiving touch-ups simultaneously while massive Emmy award statues towered behind her.\n\n\u201cAs someone who grew up watching award shows and wondering, \u2018How do I get to do that?,\u2019 it was thrilling to meet the \u2018GMA\u2019 crew,\u201d said senior journalism major Irene Kim. \u201cComing to the live taping reminded me that my goals as an on-air host are achievable and can be just as fun as I imagined.\u201d\n\nWearing six-inch heels and a silky green, black and gold pantsuit ensemble, Roberts made teasing fan favorites her runway. She gushed over a post-interview dinner invite from Carol Burnett of \u201cPalm Royale\u201d as well as conversations with the casts of \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d and \u201cSh\u014dgun.\u201d She held, well, hugged, an Emmy award, joking about how much heavier they are than they look.\n\nA few student audience members received signs shaped like Emmys (much lighter to carry), and the three tallest were handed additional glittery \u201cGMA\u201d letters as props to hold for live shots with Roberts, Connelly and Will Reeves. Kecia Stewart, floor manager for \u201cGMA,\u201d directed a choir of cheering students through passionate jazz hands behind rolling cameras. There were two things \u201cGMA\u201d could never have enough of: smiles and energy. Both were present as students joined the hosts to shout an enthusiastic, \u201cGood Morning America!\u201d\n\nDuring takes where audience members were not needed, students had a photo-op on the red carpet in front of a Hulu, ABC and Emmy logo-filled backdrop. They also got to witness a quick change from Reeve \u2014 styled by Emmy award-winning TV personality Lilliana Vazquez \u2014 for a show segment that featured him modeling an outfit inspired by Carmy\u2019s character from \u201cThe Bear.\u201d\n\nAfter wrapping with a final goodbye shot close to 6 a.m., students took a group photo with Roberts, Connelly and Reeve. After which, Roberts insisted that each student get their own individual photo with the three of them as a thank you for waking up so early to participate.\n\n\u201cRed carpet specials are always going to be important no matter what. My family and I\u2019s favorite part of award shows is watching the live red carpet coverage,\u201d said junior communication major Connor Wyckoff. \u201cIt\u2019s a behind-the-scenes look into one of the biggest events of the year in real-time, which is something streaming can\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nThe Emmys will be live on ABC at 5 p.m. PST on Sunday and available to stream next-day on Hulu.\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Caleb Kim, April Aguilera, and John Millsap\nSeptember 13, 2024 at 4:42 pm PDT\n\nWith a brand new cafe and an increase in the price for meal swipes at dining halls, USC students react to the changes to on-campus dining. The Moreton Fig restaurant reopened on September 3 with a new name, menu, and store hours. The former upscale restaurant is now Morton Fig Cafe, and they offer coffee, tea, and various pastries and sandwiches in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.\n\nMoreton Fig was founded in 2010 as a collaboration between USC Hospitality and Lark Creek Restaurant Group. For nearly 14 years, it offered a full bar and a formal dining experience geared toward USC faculty. The more casual and study-oriented dining experience offered by the cafe seems to appeal to many students on campus, including Emelie Sarmiento, a freshman studying mechanical engineering.\n\n\u201cI enjoy the coffee and I enjoy the atmosphere. It\u2019s a nice place to chill and study,\u201d Sarmiento said. David Nguyen, a freshman studying business administration, also said he appreciates the cafe\u2019s quieter study atmosphere.\n\n\u201cI think the study environment\u2019s good. The upscale environment is also pretty nice to study in, and it\u2019s really quiet,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it\u2019s gonna be in a couple weeks, but hopefully no one knows about this place.\u201d\n\nWhile Moreton Fig\u2019s rebranding to a more affordable, casual cafe has improved dining ease and accessibility for students, the campus dining halls have done the opposite. Parkside Dining Hall, Everybody\u2019s Kitchen (EVK), and McCarthy Dining Hall have increased their student lunch and dinner prices to $17.39 and $17.59 respectively. This is a $2 increase from $15.39 and $15.59 in the 2023-2024 school year.\n\nPablo Uribe, a sophomore studying business administration, said the price increase may deter students from eating at the dining halls. He also said that one of his closest friends recently stopped eating at the USC dining halls to save money and spent it elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty expensive to eat outside USC,\u201d Uribe said. \u201cNow that USC raised their prices, I think it\u2019s going to be the same, so that will cause more people to go to other places that have more variety and better stuff.\u201d\n\nThe change in price of single meal swipes is also reflected in the increased cost of meal plans for the 2024-2025 school year. Last year, the Cardinal meal plan required for freshmen with a USC housing contract cost $3,645 per semester. This year, that price has spiked to $3,830, a $185 increase. The other meal plan options available to students have also increased similarly in price.\n\nAidan Dougherty, a masters student studying computer science, says USC should be more transparent in their reasons for the price change.\n\n\u201cIf there was a good reason, like the workers were being underpaid and they needed this price increase to up their pay, it would make sense to me,\u201d said Dougherty. \u201cBut if they\u2019re not doing that, what\u2019s the reason they\u2019re increasing the prices?\u201d\n\nDirk de Jong, asst. vice president of USC Hospitality and the USC Hotel, responded to Annenberg Media\u2019s request for a comment.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm that the cost of food, labor, and utilities have risen dramatically since COVID, as all of us have experienced at the grocery store and our favorite off-campus restaurants. USC Hospitality has taken every measure to keep food costs as low as possible without compromising quality,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nNOTE: This story has been updated to include a statement from USC hospitality.\n```"}

Miller won a gold medal in women\u2019s basketball in 1984 and won two NCAA championships during her time at USC. She went on to serve as head of the women\u2019s basketball program at USC from 1993 to 1995 before becoming a commentator at ESPN, TNT and NBA TV. Belasco is an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship at Marshall.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the course is to serve as an introduction to sports as a business and sports as a media property,\u201d said Gordon Stables, director of the School of Journalism. The course includes focus on domains of sports business, broadcasting and platforms, sports in pop culture, and current events in sports. Belasco described assignments where students create name image likeness marketing plans and video projects on past sports controversies.\n\n\u201cWe want students to leave this course knowing that sports is not this monolithic industry where you just have a couple of career paths,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want them to know it is really multifaceted. There are so many different ways to get involved in sports, even if you\u2019re not an athlete or former athlete, both from the business side and the storytelling side.\u201d Stables said the class can serve as an opportunity for students to start separating themselves from sports as a fan and begin to view it from a professional standpoint.\n\n\u201cSports is one of the most important sides of journalism, of media and commerce in our world today, and whether or not you\u2019re interested as a fan, there are professional opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were really happy with the turnout,\u201d Stables said. \u201cWe know sports classes are popular with students, and we\u2019re excited that we think as the course develops and students see the linkages, that there\u2019ll be more opportunities for students.\u201d\n\nBelasco and Miller have brought in former USC football head coach Pete Carroll, footwear brand founders Adam and Ryan Goldston, and journalist Jemele Hill as speakers. Belasco said they also plan to bring in FanDuel CEO, Amy Howe, and Greg Maffei, the CEO of Liberty Media which owns Formula 1. In an Annenberg and Marshall press release published August 26, Belasco said, \u201cNo other university has USC\u2019s access to the power players of sports. Being in L.A., the sports, media and entertainment capital of the world, these leaders will be central to the classroom experience, offering expertise, insights, and hopefully internships and jobs.\u201d\n\nAyonnah Tinsley, a senior majoring in Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation, said hearing from professionals with varied pathways has solidified her decision to work in sports after graduation. \u201cI resonate a lot more with the more untraditional way to get into sports, rather than just taking a regular broadcasting class,\u201d Tinsely said. \u201cSo I just hope to get a lot more unique perspectives on getting into the sports industry.\u201d\n\nStables described the course as a foundation for students to explore more advanced and specific courses in the realm of sports journalism. \u201cWhether or not you\u2019re a sports fan, I think that people should be thinking about the way sports media is informing, whether the way our platforms are evolving, the way advertising structures are going,\u201d Stables said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really important side of culture and commerce, and so it\u2019s of interest to everyone, whether or not you are interested in the games.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Sullivan Barthel)\n\nBy Jayden Higman\nSeptember 13, 2024 at 3:29 pm PDT\n\nOn Friday, September 6, the restaurant Hart House announced the closure of its six locations across Southern California. Founded by actor and comedian Kevin Hart, the chain was known for their completely plant-based menu, creating a fast food option prioritizing sustainability and health. The University Park South location on Figeuroa made its debut a little over a year ago on June 21, 2023. Though the reason for the sudden closing is unknown, all of Hart House\u2019s restaurants closed their doors to the public after September 10.\n\nThough Hart House\u2019s closure went into effect Wednesday morning, the inside of the restaurant seemed to be in good spirits on Tuesday afternoon. R&B music blasted through the speakers while the interior was decorated vibrantly. Online orders were being prepared, drinks were fully stocked, and the facility was clean. Other customers sat outside, enjoying the available shade surrounded by a fountain and palm trees\n\nWhen told of the news, one recent USC graduate, Jamilah Muhammad, put her head in her hands. \u201cI am so heartbroken,\u201d Muhammad said \u201cIt is so hard to get good food in LA. And I\u2019m from Nashville, Tennessee. I know good food, and this is the closest place to my house that I can actually access good tasting, flavorful, actually healthy food.\u201d\n\nHart House built itself around the vegan and vegetarian communities, but had no problem in drawing in customers who prefer meat in their diets. \u201cChick-fil-A doesn\u2019t even stand a chance against Hart House,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cFor me, I stopped going there, because why would I go to Chick-fil-A and get a chicken sandwich when I could go to Hart House and get a chicken sandwich?\u201d\n\nA Hart House manager told Annenberg Media that he had no comment on the restaurant\u2019s closure, but expressed that it was sudden. \u201cUSC has not been very open about their support of local restaurant trains, especially vis-a-vis the village a couple years ago,\u201d said Ian Filkins, a first-year M.B.A. student at USC, when asked about possible reasons for the closure.\n\nEmery Ogah, a master\u2019s student in the Iovine and Young Academy, expressed his appreciation for Hart House\u2019s inclusivity and accessibility as a restaurant. \u201cIt\u2019s a really nice ambiance, but a lot of people bring their food from other restaurants into Hart House rather than buying food at Hart House,\u201d Ogah said. \u201cI think if they start closing the gate, \u2018so people don\u2019t eat here with other food,\u2019 then we\u2019re going to start having a problem.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear who or what will replace Hart House, but it is certain that this restaurant became a piece of the community for some USC students.\n```"}

The protests lasted over three hours on Thursday. It was the first major demonstration since the encampments that took place during the Spring semester.\n\nDemonstrators wore keffiyehs and other face coverings while repeating chants similar to those made during last year\u2019s on-campus protests that led the university to take disciplinary action against a number of students. Many demonstrators also had signs or banners with the words \u201cFree Palestine\u201d and \u201cUSC Funds Genocide\u201d painted on them.\n\nThe walkout turned into a sit-in, where demonstrators spread out and sat down around Tommy Trojan and Traveler to occupy more space. DPS then moved protestors closer to the fountain and formed a wall in an effort to clear space for a fire lane.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really unfortunate because it feels like, over the last year, we\u2019ve kind of forgotten how to talk to one another,\u201d said Max Rubenstein, a sophomore studying international relations who was not part of the demonstration. \u201cI have seen people who refuse to understand where the other side might be coming from.\u201d\n\nMore than an hour after the demonstration began, the walkout began moving through Trousdale Parkway toward the main entrance to campus where a final speech was given, crossing through USC\u2019s all-major career fair. A vigil was held at this entrance last Friday to memorialize the Palestinian lives lost since October 7.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s uncommon to be on college campuses and to witness students standing up for what they believe in,\u201d said Morgan Wybrecht, who was representing Guidepoint at the career fair.\n\nThe walkout was part of the National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) national day of action and was advertised on social media by USC\u2019s SJP chapter in collaboration with USC Graduate Students for Palestine, Jewish Voices for Peace (JVP), Divest From Death and Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation (SCALE).\n\nThe USC SJP posted on Instagram on Wednesday stating that the goal of the demonstration was to, \u201clet the admin know that they can never intimidate their students into being silent about USC\u2019s complicity in genocide and join the student movement across the world demanding divestment, liberation, and return.\u201d\n\nRecent calls of university divestment stem from Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS), a Palestinian led movement for freedom, justice, and equality which began in 2005. According to the BDS movement website, divestment refers to the withdrawal of, \u201cinvestments from the State of Israel and all Israeli and international companies that sustain Israeli apartheid.\u201d\n\nIn preparation for the protest, USC Department of Public Safety (DPS) fenced off Tommy Trojan and placed more than 10 officers around the area to prevent the violation of university policy. An officer car was also parked in the quad to block off the statue.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an exceptional amount of police presence to kind of intimidate students,\u201d a media liaison for USC SJP said. The student requested anonymity out of fear of academic retaliation. \u201c[It\u2019s] absolutely not going to work, and yeah, we just continue to fight for divestment.\u201d\n\nOfficers were seen recording and taking photos of protesters. \u201c[It\u2019s] only for events of this nature,\u201d DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said. \u201cIt\u2019s wise to have a video recording, and I think it\u2019s a benefit from administrators to show how peaceful they were.\u201d\n\nDemonstrators said they viewed the police activity as infringing on their free speech by preventing the use of megaphones and attempting to control the crowd to clear space for students.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve actually gone backwards,\u201d the USC SJP media liaison said. \u201cThere\u2019s been quite a bit of an attack on free speech, and I think that\u2019s a big thing that we\u2019re pushing back on.\u201d\n\nThis was USC SJP\u2019s first demonstration and the largest protest of any organization of the new school year, following the encampments and protests in Alumni Park last year. And, as with the encampment, students were not the only ones in attendance with professors and community members coming to support.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] very inspiring [...] when you have so many youth and students coming out and refusing to go with the lies and risking their careers,\u201d said John Parker, a coordinator for the Harriet Tubman Center of Social Justice.\n\nProtesters march off campus and gather before they go their separate ways after the protest.\n```"}

After falling to No. 1 Pitt in three consecutive sets on Wednesday (31-29, 25-18, 25-16), USC women\u2019s volleyball (4-2) rallied as a unit in a convincing win (25-12, 25-20, 25-19) against the unranked Utah State Aggies (1-5).\n\n\u201cWe had a choice, and I felt like the team responded tonight. And that\u2019s a big statement,\u201d Keller said at the postgame press conference.\n\nThe Trojans were blazing hot from the opening serve, starting the first set up 13-1. They consistently caught onto multiple-point runs and won the set 25-12. A back-and-forth second frame went toward the Trojans 25-20 after an impressive performance from senior setter Mia Tuaniga. The veteran achieved a second-set double-double with 15 assists on 32 attempts, along with 10 digs. She finished the game with a staggering 27 assists on top of 12 digs.\n\nThe Trojans scored six consecutive points to start the third set, and it was all a matter of time from there. They held on strong and sent \u2018SC fans home happily after a 25-19 final set.\n\nIt was truly an all-around team effort in the sweep. Ten separate players achieved kills in the game, contributing to the tally of 37 kills throughout the three sets. The team had an extremely high hitting percentage at .267, and most of these kills were rooted in the transition game.\n\nIn the postgame conference, however, Keller specifically emphasized the importance of staying calm under stress, which he coined as CUS.\n\n\u201cI felt like we were in our zone, in our element, versus pressing,\u201d Keller said. \u201cAt the end of the day, the execution is the execution. We clearly showed that we can do this.\u201d\n\nAnchored by graduate outside hitter Ally Batenhorst \u2014 a transfer from Nebraska \u2014 the Trojans\u2019 main key was coming out with energy as a group and taking control of the game from the first serve.\n\n\u201cI think we came out a little bit more fearless,\u201d Batenhorst said postgame. \u201cIt was a very competitive match yesterday... but I think we [took] what we learned from yesterday\u2019s match and came into this game today with tons of energy and just full of force.\u201d\n\nBatenhorst was a huge asset offensively, with 11 kills and a .320 hitting percentage. She also contributed on the defensive end, with four digs and three blocks.\n\nIn such a momentum-heavy sport like volleyball, jumping out ahead in the first set is vital. The Trojans did precisely this, and were able to stay in control of the entire match from there.\n\nUSC looks ahead to their match against another unranked opponent in the Ohio Wildcats on Friday at Galen Center, with first serve set for 7 p.m.\n```"}

Austen Cooper, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies and comparative literature, said that attending the vigil was important to him because it humanized the lives lost by seeing the victims as more than \u201cjust a statistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for everyone to learn the names and faces of people who have lost their lives so you see these martyrs as human beings and not just numbers,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cLearning these people\u2019s stories will help you understand what\u2019s going on better in Gaza and the West Bank.\u201d\n\nCommunity members also attended the vigil. Linda Baughn, an adjunct instructor at East Los Angeles College, said she came to ground herself after learning about the lives lost during the ongoing conflict.\n\n\u201cThe scale of death is overwhelming and devastating, and it\u2019s impossible to maintain one\u2019s equilibrium when we\u2019re living through a genocide,\u201d Baughn said. \u201cSometimes you need to get together with other people and make some human connections just to make it out okay.\u201d\n\nDivest from Death members and attendees read aloud from poems and stories shared from Gaza. Refaat Alareer, a professor and editor of \u201cGaza Writes Back: Short Stories from Young Writers in Gaza, Palestine,\u201d was killed by an Israeli airstrike in December according to CNN. Attendees shared excerpts of his work.\n\nThe media liaison from Divest from Death said that SCALE, SJP and the Divest from Death Coalition are planning to continue advocating for the university\u2019s divestment from Israel well after the vigil.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be ignored, and we will not be ignored,\u201d the liaison said. \u201cWe want to remind the university that we are still calling for divestment and want them to at least acknowledge the genocide that is happening in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThe Trousdale entrance to campus closed at 6 p.m. on Friday before the start of the vigil. Other entrances around campus remained open. A security ambassador initially told Annenberg Media that the Trousdale gates were set to reopen at 7 p.m., but they would not be accessible to students for another 45 minutes until the Divest from Death organizers had fully cleared the vigil.\n\nDPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said that this specific gate was intentionally closed during the vigil in order to \u201cmaintain the integrity of the campus perimeter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the demonstration were to draw a large crowd and that crowd decided to try and enter campus in mass, the guards at the gate could have been overwhelmed,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cFortunately, they were a modest-sized group that demonstrated peacefully outside of the campus.\u201d\n\nUSC Hillel and Trojans for Israel also hosted a vigil on September 3 recognizing the deaths of six hostages held in captivity by Hamas. The IDF discovered their bodies on September 1. Among the victims was American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was taken hostage on October 7 from a music festival held in Southern Israel. Vigil attendees gathered to recite Kaddish to honor the Jewish lives lost.\n```"}

Whether it was due to busy class schedules or sheer avoidance, some students decided to watch recaps on social media while others watched partially.\n\nAccording to Nielsen research, however, young people drove viewership numbers Tuesday \u2014 53% more viewers aged 18-49 tuned in for Harris\u2019 matchup against Trump than President Joe Biden\u2019s debate against Trump on June 27 \u2014 according to the New York Times.\n\nTrenyce Tong, a senior majoring in art, said they have never watched a presidential debate in its entirety, and Tuesday\u2019s was no exception. Tong said they felt that watching the behavior of the candidates on stage has become the main point of the debates \u2014 not necessarily the policies or plans of either party.\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t a super detailed comprehensive report on their policy because there is so much bickering,\u201d Tong said. \u201cIt is even more like entertainment and just getting the general vibe of the candidates rather than actually learning new super important information.\u201d\n\nThe disputes can be a deterrent, or at times, a source of entertainment for viewers. Catherine He, a junior majoring in computer science, said she disliked how Trump behaved on stage in the clips she saw on X.\n\n\u201cI think [abortion] is a huge thing that Trump has been kind of dismissing, but also, I don\u2019t like his attitude, to be honest,\u201d she said.\n\nAs a first-time voter, He said she primarily learned about the debate through posts on social media, mostly watching \u201creplays and reactions to it.\u201d\n\nLike He, Lucas Damasco, a sophomore majoring in business administration and computer programming, primarily watched the debate through clips on Instagram and TikTok. Damasco was unable to watch the entirety of the debate due to his class schedule, but also decided not to watch the parts he could because of how the debate was going.\n\n\u201cI was in class for one half of it, and then for the second half, I watched a little bit of it,\u201d Damasco said. \u201cThen what I saw, how it was going down, I just wasn\u2019t that interested in tuning in for the rest of the hour just because it was kind of what I expected.\u201d\n\nSimultaneously, at Wallis Annenberg Hall, around 100 students attended the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism debate watch party, exceeding the organizers\u2019 expectations.\n\n\u201cI was so glad to see the students come out and to see that they were engaged in this process, because sometimes that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d said Miki Turner, professor of professional practice of journalism. \u201cFor them to come out and witness that slice of history was just very inspiring.\u201d\n\nWhether or not students watched the debate live, their exposure to political content on social media will likely face an uptick in the coming weeks. This could affect how knowledgeable they become about candidates or whether they will vote at all.\n\nHe said she has started making a plan with her roommate for how they will cast their ballots.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t really know what [voting] literally looks like, but I was talking about it with my roommate,\u201d He said. \u201cShe was like \u2018Oh are you gonna vote,\u2019 I was like \u2018lowkey.\u2019 I don\u2019t know because I really don\u2019t know how to approach the process.\u201d```"}

Annenberg Media captured the altercation in a viral video. \n\n\u201cIt was very stressful and all during finals. I was keeled over. I went home, started feeling worse. [It was] a big red welt, a big bruise that lasted for weeks afterwards. I went to the ER and it was a really long night. The bruise took a while to heal and I still have a scar,\u201d Moreland said.\n\nHis attorney, Thomas Seabaugh, alleged that Moreland\u2019s rights were violated and that he did nothing to warrant the use of a 40 mm \u201cless-lethal\u201d projectile by the LAPD. Annenberg Media received and reviewed a photo of the injury, sent by Seabeaugh.\n\n\u201cBoston and his family feel very lucky that he was hit in the abdomen, because while that must have been very painful and traumatic as it was, if he had been hit in the face or neck it could have been catastrophically worse,\u201d Seabaugh said. \u201cUSC students and faculty can ask themselves whether they think these so-called less-lethal weapons belong on their campus at all.\u201d\n\nThe suit also claims that police used excessive force in shooting the projectile and violated Boston\u2019s rights to free speech and assembly. \u201c[Students] have a right to exercise those rights on a public walkway without being afraid of being hit without warning by a weapon that can severely injure or even kill them,\u201d Seabaugh said.\n\nMoreland is a member of the USC Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) \u2014 one of the many organizations that led Pro-Palestinian protests on campus. \u201cCops shouldn\u2019t be able to get away with that.

Even so, USC professor of Seismology John Vidale said there is no immediate threat inherent in an uptick in earthquake occurrences. \u201cThere have been a number of earthquakes this year around Southern California, more than usual, but we consider that just a coincidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to think the earthquakes these distances from each other are related.\u201d But, he said, the fact that these quakes have been felt across the city highlights the risk that earthquakes pose to the region. Vidale recommended that those living in the state download an earthquake early warning app on mobile phones, such as the  MyShake App , buy emergency supplies and check in with their building to ensure it is up to code.

Dangerously high temperatures hit Los Angeles, prompting officials to warn residents to stay indoors. Extreme weather often strains the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power\u2019s equipment, causing power outages city-wide. Last week, more than 5,000 residents were left without power in the Adams-Normandie, Exposition Park and University Park area.\n\n\u201cI was actually out at dinner with my friends, and then I got a message in the GroupMe for my building saying that the power was out,\u201d said Christopher Whaley, a Viterbi School of Engineering graduate student.\n\nAccording to the LADWP\u2019s website, the utility prioritizes larger outages, so some customers sometimes go without power for more than 24 hours.\n\n\u201cI got back to my apartment at around 2 p.m.. My roommates were cooking and for about an hour, the electricity would go in and out for a couple seconds, and then at around 3, it just went out,\u201d said Grace Love, a junior at Dornsife. \u201cIt came back on for 45 minutes, and then it was out until 10 a.m. the next morning.\u201d\n\nThe power outage inconvenienced many; however, the LADWP plans to prepare for these ongoing extreme weather conditions by properly replacing or upgrading power equipment as needed in order to help prevent outages.\n\n\u201cWhile extreme heat events were once considered emergencies, it is now the new normal and the Department prioritizes this reality in all of its operations,\u201d the DWP website said.\n\nWhen the power goes out, DWP encourages residents to consider seeking shelter at one of the city\u2019s cooling centers. Other tips include keeping a flashlight and batteries on hand, making sure electronics are charged or having an extra portable battery pack, and turning off or unplugging any electronics to assist service restorations.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File)\n\nBy Isaac Vargas\nSeptember 12, 2024 at 3:02 pm PDT\n\nMost mornings Miriam Stefan, a sophomore at the Keck School of Medicine, cruises through USC\u2019s Shrine Parking Structure vying for a coveted EV charging port that hangs from white concrete pillars. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot more crowded,\u201d said Stefan on the parking experience this semester. Stefan is in the process of receiving a discounted permit for driving an EV but admits the process has been \u2018complicated\u2019 thus far.\n\nThis fall, new parking rules will apply to those like Stefan who commute to campus in an electric vehicle. With over a thousand people vying for one of 250 ports across both campuses, changes to the EV program are the result of an increasing demand for electric and parking infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIn 2014 we had one public outlet behind an army barracks building that doesn\u2019t even exist anymore,\u201d said David Donovan, Associate Director of USC Transportation. He has overseen USC\u2019s EV program since its inception a decade ago.\n\nWhat EV drivers need to know about the new parking rules\n\nThe Downey Way parking structure presented some difficulties for the transportation department. Although people had permits to park, they could not find a spot. \u201cWe looked at the numbers. It\u2019s not oversold, we\u2019re not selling daily passes, what is happening?\u201d Donovan said. \u201cIt was the EV charging population.\u201d\n\nEV drivers must now choose a primary location where they want to park, under updated fall 2024 EV charging rules. This is similar to how everyone else purchases a parking permit, which is different from years past that allowed EVers to park in any structure when not charging. EV drivers can apply for a discounted, Cardinal tier parking rate simply for driving an electric vehicle, proof of EV ownership is required. Vehicles may charge at any available port across campuses, but once they are finished, they must return to their designated structure. Exceptions to relocation include USC Village, which also serves as a public-facing retail environment, and HSC\u2019s Valley Lot, which has a large number of available chargers.\n\n\u201cWe have to know where you\u2019re parking just so we can manage our inventory,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cThe EV permit will no longer exist as of next June.\u201d\n\nWhy not just build more charging ports?\n\nMatthew Kahn, provost professor of economics at USC Dornsife, drives an electric vehicle but opts for public transportation to avoid \u2018range anxiety,\u2019 the fear that an EV will run out of battery power before reaching its next destination. \u201cI realize that many of us would be more likely to drive EVs to USC if we could access charging stations,\u201d Khan said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to be at Viterbi Engineering to know that it can be very costly to upgrade old buildings.\u201d\n\nUSC parking garages were constructed long before electric vehicles roamed the streets making them unable to withstand the demands of newer ports. \u201cWe have already maximized where all these chargers can go in terms of the university\u2019s capacity,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cAll of the expansion now and since 2017 has been in new construction.\u201d\n\nNine charging ports were most recently installed in the Downey Parking Structure last year due in part to the construction of the adjacent Ginsburg Hall. Similar additions took place in 2016 with the construction of University Village, USC Shrine and the San Pablo parking structure at HSC.\n\nFor Kahn, centralizing EV operations under a singular structure could help relieve some of the stress behind electric demand and lead to cost advantages as production grows. \u201cIf systems break down, they can have somebody repair it, and they can keep an eye on the demand for electricity,\u201d Kahn said.\n\nAccording to Donovan, the university is working toward electrification initiatives across campus infrastructure but admits it is still \u2018horribly behind\u2019 in terms of its goals. This could change as the city of Los Angeles steps into the world\u2019s limelight and begins to push transportation initiatives in preparation for the 2028 Olympics.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of resources poured into the city of Los Angeles, USC and UCLA,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI think [the 2028 Olympics] is going to be a driver of change in terms of the EV community. It\u2019ll be one of those leap forward moments.\u201d```"}

But right now, USC doesn\u2019t even recognize their existence. The Knights are a Recognized Student Organization \u2014 one of 911 on USC\u2019s campus unable to begin their usual operations this semester because they and other RSOs are still waiting for Campus Activities to officially recognize them.\n\nThe delay is creating mass confusion and uncertainty for clubs that are part of the fabric of the USC community. \u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed to have any Knight involvement at [last Saturday\u2019s football] game until 4 p.m. on Friday,\u201d said Julia Haffie, the president of Trojan Knights.\n\nHaffie said The Knights were eventually granted a one-day pass by the Athletics department to attend the USC football game against Utah State, but the delay and uncertainty they experienced is not unique to them.\n\nRSOs like the Trojan Knights are unable to begin operations for the 2024-25 year because the application process has gotten more complicated this year, and student leaders have received little communication from USC.\n\nApplications for re-recognition were advertised to open on July 1 but Campus Activities, the organization overseeing all RSOs at USC, did not send out the re-recognition forms until Aug. 8. If applications were not turned in by Aug. 16, RSOs could not participate in the first involvement fair. The deadline to participate in the second involvement fair was Aug. 30. The final deadline to receive recognition was Sept. 6.\n\nIf RSOs have not received recognition, they are unable to use campus facilities. Ludus Remedium, one of the comedy troupes on campus, was not allowed to hold auditions in any USC buildings.\n\n\u201cWe had to get 12 members across five different troupes staking out different locations,\u201d said Helen Culpepper, president of Ludus Remedium. \u201cThen getting kicked out of those locations... by Campus Activities employees. When all else failed, we just did them outside during a terrible heatwave.\u201d\n\nLudus Remedium isn\u2019t the only club getting kicked out of campus facilities. The Trojan Boxing Club at USC finally received approval from Campus Activities to hold practices at the USC Village Gym on Wednesday, but the approval came after threats of suspension and slashing practice time from the Recreational Club Council for holding unofficial practices.\n\n\u201cEvery week, [members are] always asking, \u2018Do we have practice this week?,\u2019 and we have to keep telling them no,\u201d said Parker Chang, the president of Trojan Boxing.\n\nThe RSOs are losing more than just access to facilities. Without official recognition, they are also unable to access their club\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s being held up in [USC] Credit Union,\u201d Chang said. \u201cTo withdraw the money, you have to submit paperwork through RCC. With the way things are going, we\u2019re tentative about accepting dues and memberships now.\u201d\n\nIn an email statement to Annenberg Media, USC Campus Activities said its office expected \u201cthe full review to be completed by the end of September,\u201d with 150 student organizations already approved.\n\n\u201cUniversity recognition is required on annual basis to maintain the status of a university Recognized Student Organization. Applications have been processed for those that applied by Aug. 23. This year the trainings are focused on the Student Commitment and the Unifying Values, as well as accessibility, leadership responsibilities, hazing prevention and anti-discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe problem with this new process, student leadership said, is many aspects of the application have become more complicated this year. Culpepper described it as \u201cbureaucratically insane.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to remake our whole constitution to fit their mold,\u201d Haffie said. An RSO\u2019s constitution lays out their organization\u2019s mission, goals and values. The constitution template all RSOs have to use went from nine pages to 14 pages this year.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really looking at every single detail,\u201d Chang said, referring to the many forms RSOs have to submit. \u201cIf there\u2019s a missing signature, missing initial or the constitution wasn\u2019t completely perfect, they won\u2019t accept the application.\u201d\n\nThe RSO officers are also required to complete individual modules according to their roles and other modules on how to run the club. Without them, their application will be delayed or denied.\n\n\u201cSomething was going on with the log-in, so no one could access the modules for a good amount of time, until the last day,\u201d Chang said.\n\nWithout recognition, RSOs are unable to participate in the semesterly involvement fairs. Many clubs, like the Knights, have resorted to self-tabling at the off-campus Village crosswalk. They said this has caused a loss in recruitment for many RSOs.\n\n\u201cA lot of clubs are hurting this semester because people just don\u2019t know they exist,\u201d Chang said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s probably not salvageable during the spring semester.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated to include a comment from USC Campus Activities.\n```"}

Me and the guys have a great bond in the running back room.

It\u2019s just like practice \u2014 just go out there and have fun.\u201d\n\nBeyond the field, the group has made an effort to build chemistry beyond the field, bonding non-football activities but still carrying over their competitive natures. \u201cWe really play video games all the time, so that\u2019s probably the biggest way,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe\u2019re really competitive when it comes to [EA Sports\u2019 College Football 25]. That\u2019s probably the biggest way we bond off the field.\u201d\n\nThis sense of camaraderie and personal growth is aided by Coach Anthony Jones Jr. \u201cHe\u2019s helped us with ball security and blocking, and just trying to be a better person overall,\u201d Joyner said. \u201cCoach Jones helps with a lot \u2014 academics, on and off the field.

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Jarrett Carpenter September 12, 2024 at 11:44 am PDT\n\nTwo propositions on California\u2019s November ballot will impact a pair of large USC demographics, renters and those earning minimum wage. People under 25 make up nearly a third of minimum wage workers in California, according to the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office.\n\nProposition 32, if passed, would raise the statewide minimum wage to $18 by January 2025. Proposition 33 allows cities to control rent on single-family homes and apartments \u2014 including on-campus housing \u2014 by repealing the Costa-Hawkins Act, a law permitting landlords to set initial pricing for housing built after January 1995.\n\nVanessa Ramirez, a sophomore studying biological science at USC, lives in an apartment in the West Adams neighborhood. She said her rent is reasonable for the area but the current rate leaves her little extra money to pay bills and buy food.\n\n\u201cRealistically I\u2019m like, \u2018Why is it so much?\u2019 I practically just need a place to sleep,\u201d Ramirez said.\n\nProposition 32 - An $18 minimum wage\n\nWhile the statewide minimum wage is $16 with annual adjustments for inflation, the hourly minimum wage in Los Angeles County is $17.28. Prop. 32 seeks to round the number up. Supporters of the proposition include the California Democratic Party, labor unions such as Unite Here and anti-poverty activist and entrepreneur, Joseph Sanberg, who spent over $10 million in his efforts to get the measure on the ballot.\n\nGabriel Harris, a sophomore studying architecture, lives in the USC Village and spends between $6,500 to $8,000 a semester on rent. He said he\u2019s currently between jobs, but when he begins his search, he\u2019ll be looking at minimum wage opportunities and supports Prop. 32.\n\n\u201cI mean, an extra $60 a month, of course,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a college student, you try to hold onto any change you have.\u201d\n\nA 20-hour work week at the new rate would yield an additional $57 per month, or nearly $700 more per year before taxes.\n\nIn September 2023, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill guaranteeing a minimum wage of $20 for fast food workers. Ramirez, who left her job at Little Caesar\u2019s to focus on her degree, is skeptical of more wage increases and echoes a driving argument of many Proposition 32 opponents.\n\n\u201cI would like to get paid more,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cBut... why is it that we got a raise, the minimum wage went up, but everything else went up?\u201d\n\nThe opposing parties on Prop. 32 wield dueling studies about the occupational impacts of the proposed measure. Supporters cite a study from UC Berkeley that found \u201cno significant disemployment effects\u201d resulting from 2022\u2032s minimum wage increase to $15, while opponents refer to a survey of West Hollywood businesses in which 24% of employers said they had to lay off workers as a result of this January\u2019s minimum wage ordinance.\n\nProposition 33 - Cities decide rent caps\n\nRent control is not new in California, but since the mid-90s, the Costa-Hawkins law has limited cities\u2019 ability to enforce it. Housing built after January 1995 \u2014 including popular student housing such as Tuscany Apartments, The Lorenzo and University Village \u2014 do not have to adhere to rent ceilings. Prop. 33 would repeal Costa-Hawkins and allow cities to implement rent control.\n\nThe measure comes in response to many LA County residents facing exorbitant annual rent hikes from landlords. Nearly 30% of renters in California spend at least half their monthly income on rent.\n\nOpponents of the measure are primarily realtor groups such as California Apartment Association and California Association of Realtors, who have collectively raised $50 million to combat the measure. They argue that Prop. 33 will exacerbate the housing shortage.\n\n\u201cEven though it might be a little more tiring to find an apartment available, I think generally offering a bigger population of homes is just more important to me,\u201d Harris said.\n\nBrandon Leong, a junior studying electrical engineering, lives in an apartment off-campus and argues that like everything else in the economy, unregulated is better.\n\n\u201cI think that affordable housing will be a natural consequence of just letting the economy do its thing,\u201d Leong said. \u201cBecause if landlords charge too much and people can\u2019t afford it, they are forced to drive down their prices.\u201d\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders endorsed Prop. 33, and though Vice President Kamala Harris has not formally endorsed the measure, she said she supports rent control.\n\n\u201cWe will take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases,\u201d the vice president told supporters at an Atlanta rally.\n```"}

But how does a large university stop producing greenhouse gases?\n\nParticipants of the Arts in Action event created posters to express their environmental and political frustrations in the sustainable art workshop. (Photo by Gabriella Medina)\n\nBy Daniella Lake September 12, 2024 at 10:00 am PDT\n\nFor the last few weeks, banners displaying \u201cClimate Neutral 2025\u2032\u2032 and \u201cZero Waste 2028\u2032\u2032 have been seen all around campus as part of Green Week, the University of Southern California\u2019s annual week-long celebration of the university\u2019s sustainability efforts. These goals are some of the top priorities listed under Assignment: Earth, USC\u2019s sustainability framework. The terms \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d and \u201cclimate neutral\u201d have sometimes been used interchangeably by the university.\n\nIn 2021, President Carol Folt first announced the goal, saying that \u201cUSC [was] setting an aggressive timeline to achieve carbon neutrality in a short amount of time.\u201d Campus officials Zelinda Welch, Director of Energy and Sustainability at USC Facilities and Planning Management, and Michael \u201cMick\u201d Dalrymple, Chief Sustainability Officer, confirmed in interviews with Annenberg Media that the university aims to be \u201cclimate neutral\u201d by 2025. This means the university will reach net-zero emissions for all greenhouse gases, like nitrogen and methane \u2014 not just carbon. Net-zero means the emissions of gases into the atmosphere matches the reduction of gases from the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases play the largest role in rising global temperatures, so a large campus like USC reaching net-zero emissions has a big impact.\n\n\u201cNeutrality\u201d does not equal no emissions\n\nUSC\u2019s goal of climate neutrality by 2025 is ambitious compared to institutions of similar size. The University of California campuses have set target dates of 2045. USC has been transparent about its progress through a public dashboard on the Assignment: Earth website. When looking at the measurements for climate neutrality, the scale showing 43% progress towards this goal may be surprising to some, considering the fast-approaching deadline.\n\nDalrymple, who was chosen as USC\u2019s first-ever chief sustainability officer in 2021, did not shy away from sharing that the university is only halfway to meeting its goal, because the university plans to fast-track the rest of the way to climate neutrality. \u201cWe get as far as we can by 2025 and then we will buy offsets to get to 100 percent,\u201d said Dalrymple. Carbon offsets are actions taken to absorb carbon dioxide. For example, the university could pay a company to plant new trees in a forest or cap abandoned gas wells leaking methane, as a way to balance out USC\u2019s carbon emissions.\n\nSome climate activists have debated the moral implications of offsets, arguing that offsets incentivize institutions to keep polluting because they can turn around and compensate the environment after. But, to Dalrymple, \u201cThe planet doesn\u2019t care where the emissions come from, because it\u2019s a global atmosphere. The planet just cares that we reduce the overall emissions.\u201d\n\nIn 2024, offsets are one of the only realistic ways a campus like USC can become fully climate neutral. \u201cUSC cannot achieve its ambitious goal of climate neutrality by 2025 without utilizing carbon offsets,\u201d said the university\u2019s task force on Carbon Removal and Offsets in a report. Welch and Dalrymple share that offsets are a last resort for the campus, rather than the main method. \u201cThe idea is that over time, our need for offsets will diminish because we continue to make progress,\u201d said Dalrymple.\n\nDalrymple says that the university is working with a carbon credit company, Calyx, to assess the limitations and benefits of USC\u2019s carbon offsets.\n\nBut, what does it take for a campus to no longer produce greenhouse gases?\n\nThe road to decarbonization\n\nTim Carter, president of Second Nature, says that large universities like USC have larger opportunities when it comes to sustainability, but also larger challenges due to their complex infrastructure, which might make it difficult to convert to carbon-free systems. Second Nature is a nonprofit that works with universities like the University of California schools and the University of Chicago on their climate leadership and sustainability efforts.\n\nWelch shares that if the campus wanted to decarbonize its steam system and switch to hot water, that would require the replacement of pipes across campus, a project that would require a lot of manpower and a lot of money. Some of these infrastructure changes also may not make sense if equipment hasn\u2019t reached its end of life, Welch said. Carbon offsets can be done faster and cheaper than taking on these endeavors, which is why the university is using offsets to reach its 2025 neutrality goal.\n\nAccording to Welch, the university has started a decarbonization planning group. The group is conducting an in-depth assessment of the university\u2019s emissions and infrastructure, along with what technology would be best to implement for decarbonization. But, full decarbonization takes time, \u201cyou\u2019re probably looking at something like 15 to 20 years to make that complete transition. You want to do this in a thoughtful manner,\u201d said Welch.\n\nThis may be why the UCs have their carbon neutral goal set in 2045, so they can be fully decarbonized, not just climate neutral through offsets. Carter says that an advantage established universities have is time. USC is the oldest private university in California, and it will likely be around for a while, so we will eventually see the return on investment for these environmentally friendly, yet costly, endeavors.\n\nSome operations just aren\u2019t carbon free yet, like carbon free air travel for sports teams. However, the university could still opt for more climate conscious flight options. This season, USC\u2019s women\u2019s volleyball will use private, chartered flights which can emit 4 to 15 times more emissions per passenger than commercial flights.\n\nAlthough the campus won\u2019t be fully decarbonized by 2025, Welch said, the climate neutral goal builds the kind of momentum needed for such a large infrastructure project.\n\nUSC\u2019s sustainability student community\n\nCarter, who has worked with university campuses across the country, says the most successful campuses he sees are those that mobilize everyone on campus, not just the sustainability office or facilities management. Students at the Sustainability Hub\u2019s one year anniversary last week think that\u2019s important too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an environmental studies major who\u2019s looking for a campus that kind of provides a culture of sustainability where everyone\u2019s on board, everyone feels like they have a place. I think that\u2019s really important to a campus\u201d said Emma Rohrer, an outreach and engagement intern for the Sustainability Hub.\n\nThe Sustainability Hub is the physical space for Assignment: Earth. Its seats are green and its stickers have QR codes leading to maps of campus hydration stations. Even the hub\u2019s business cards are made from seed paper, which once planted, grow into California wildflowers.\n\nDalrymple shares that the hub even has a biophilic design, making the space good for you, mentally and physically. The Hub has become home to multiple groups advocating for sustainability on campus.\n\n\u201cUsing the Hub as a workspace and being in the Student Sustainability Committee have both given me a lot of sense of community and a real place to go on campus,\u201d said Skylar Funk, graduate student co-chair of the committee.\n\nAnother trait of successful campuses, according to Carter, is the integration of sustainability into their overall university mission.\n\n\u201cI think that it really takes more than just the office of sustainability and a few student groups to actually create meaningful change,\u201d said Au Chung, community engagement coordinator of the Arts and Climate Collective at USC.\n\nSome students, like Rohrer, find the university\u2019s sustainability work empowering, \u201cknowing that a campus is so engaged and involved in creating a healthier world for all is really motivating to do my work in environmental studies every day. I think it positively shapes the way people interact with each other.\u201d\n\nAn ever-changing campus\n\nDalrymple says the university is working towards having an electric bus fleet and is currently developing a full plan for the transition, including funding options. According to Welch, USC is also working on a solar master plan, which, similar to the decarbonization plan, is a comprehensive assessment to identify the best ways to install more solar panels around campus.\n\nFunk says he\u2019s proud to go to a school that walks the talk when it comes to sustainability, \u201cthere\u2019s like a real impetus for action on sustainability that I didn\u2019t see at my undergraduate university, that was as liberal and cool and \u2018sustainable,\u2019 but the real action is happening here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019ll take some time, probably years, for the university to no longer need carbon offsets. But we will officially be a climate neutral campus in 2025, a celebration for the university and the environment. Student environmental groups, along with groups like the task force on Carbon Reduction and Offsets, and hired third parties like Calyx, are watching the university\u2019s sustainability moves, helping when and where they can and also holding USC accountable.\n\nUSC Chief Sustainability Officer Mick Dalrymple says, \u201cWe have a long way to go and the easiest stuff is probably done, it only gets harder. But we gotta do it.\u201d\n```"}

Swift, the globally recognized pop star, entered the 2024 political arena after Tuesday night\u2019s debate, taking to Instagram to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris over ex-President Donald Trump and telling her 283 million followers she is supporting Harris \u201cbecause she fights for the rights and the causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve done my research, and I\u2019ve made my choice,\u201d Swift said. \u201cYour research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, several Trojans said they were thrilled to see the singer get involved, while others wondered if it would help Harris at all. Holly Hodges, a senior Film and Television Production major, said she was unsure about Taylor\u2019s political views, though she said it was not difficult to make an educated guess. \u201cI feel like she has a big platform, and for her to be able to outreach to people and use that as encouragement for what she believes in, she\u2019s worked hard for it so that\u2019s good,\u201d Hodges said. \u201c[But] I hope that people take that with a grain of salt and form opinions for themselves.\u201d\n\nMelissa Grimaldo, a junior journalism major, said she has been a Taylor Swift fan for a while, but she was surprised by Swift\u2019s post. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she was going to say or speak about anything going on in the election,\u201d Grimaldo said. \u201cI think it\u2019s what a lot of people wanted. She has a big fan base, and a lot of people follow her. I obviously think it was a good thing that she showed her support for Kamala because I think a lot of people are influenced by her and will be influenced by it.\u201d\n\nSwift\u2019s endorsement came, in part, as a response to social media posts by Trump last month, who used images created by artificial intelligence to make it appear as though Swift had endorsed him. Many Trojans were not familiar with Trump\u2019s post, or some of the attacks directed at Swift by Republican personalities on Wednesday after the endorsement.\n\nDavid Cerna, a junior performance major and a member of USC College Republicans, said he had come across some of the images online, but that he \u201cnever saw any images where [Swift] herself was coming out in support of Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cI did see some images where supposedly some supporters of hers were coming out in support of Donald Trump,\u201d Cerna said. \u201cBut, I never saw any images of her or her saying anything of the sort where she was supporting Donald Trump herself.\u201d\n\nU.S. Sen. JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, publicly attacked Swift Wednesday on Fox News, claiming she\u2019s a \u201cbillionaire celebrity who I think is fundamentally disconnected from the interests and problems of most Americans.\u201d In a post on X after the debate, talk show host Megyn Kelly said, \u201cyou can kiss your sales to the Republican audience goodbye, Taylor. Hope you enjoyed them while you had them...This pair - Taylor and her boyfriend Travis Kelce - are the epitome of elite snobs.\u201d\n\nVance and Kelly\u2019s comments came after X and Tesla owner Elon Musk raised eyebrows Tuesday night with a post in which he promised to give Swift a child and protect her cats with his life.\u201d Swift had signed off her endorsement post as \u201cA Childless Cat Lady.\u201d\n\nCerna said he had heard some of the backlash against Swift, but he said her critics \u201care free to have their opinions on the matter.\u201d \u201cI think that what I\u2019ve heard some of them saying is that it could potentially reinforce the opinion that Kamala Harris is getting these endorsements by the big, elite people and that doesn\u2019t necessarily resonate with the average American voter, but that\u2019s their stance,\u201d Cerna said.\n\nWhile only time will tell if Swift\u2019s endorsement will affect voter opinions, the endorsement appears to have had some impact already. According to political reporter Elena Moore of National Public Radio, NPR announced that all of 11 a.m. ET on Wednesday, there were 306,422 visitors to the vote.gov website referred from the link that Swift shared on Instagram Tuesday night.\n\nAmanda Berenson, a senior cinema studies major and longtime Swiftie, expressed her gratitude for Swift\u2019s awareness of her impact and influence. \u201cGiven that she has a lot of young followers who might be voting for the first time now, I think it was really important for her to speak up,\u201d Berenson said.\n```"}

Originally set to end two days later, the heat warnings have now been extended to September 10. Although students have the opportunity to escape the heat in classrooms throughout the day, other members of the community cannot say the same. The paleteros and fruit vendors that surround the USC campus remain outside in 100-degree weather in an attempt to make ends meet.\n\nRuben, a Los Angeles paletero, and his cart near the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles entrance (Photo courtesy of Katherine Contreras Hernandez)\n\n\u201cSe siente feo, cualquier persona siente muy caliente y desesperado...se ve que es f\u00e1cil pero no, el paletero sufre,\u201d [It feels bad, any person would feel too hot and desperate...it seems easy but it\u2019s not, paleteros (ice cream vendors) suffer] said Rub\u00e9n, a paletero stationed near the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. Rub\u00e9n has been selling paletas in the Los Angeles area for the last ten years. Evading the heat has been no easy feat; he\u2019s moved closer to the museum in search of shade, but it hardly helps in such extreme temperatures.\n\nAlonso Lopez, who sells fresh fruit at the Trousdale North Entrance located at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street, also spoke of ways he tries to stay cool, \u201cEl calor me esta afectando mucho...traemos agua para tomar para que as\u00ed refresquemos el cuerpo,\u201d [The heat is affecting me a lot...we carry drinking water to try and cool down our bodies.] For Lopez, the heatwave is leading to a small uptick in sales, \u201cSiempre me compran ac\u00e1 los alumnos, hasta ahorita estamos bien...de hecho, pasan ac\u00e1 por el calor y quieren fruta...\u201d [The students always buy fruit from me here, up until now we\u2019re doing alright...in fact, they pass by here because of the heat and are wanting fruit.]\n\nHowever, not all vendors share this experience. For Rub\u00e9n, sales have come slowly, \u201cCon el calor la venta baja...compra[n] m\u00e1s cuando est\u00e1 entre y frescura y medio calientito...todo este mes ha bajado mucho y casi no hemos podido hacer dinero,\u201d [With this heat, sales decrease, [people] buy more when it\u2019s between cool and kinda hot...this whole month [sales] have decreased a lot and we haven\u2019t been able to make much money] said Rub\u00e9n.\n\nPedro sets up his paletero cart near Exposition Park Rose Garden hoping to attract customers.

The money isn\u2019t enough.]\n\nPedro notes sales of cold water have increased since the heat wave, but it isn\u2019t enough to make up for the low sales overall. The heat is just one of the issues currently affecting street vendors like Rub\u00e9n and Pedro. \u201cSi uno tuviera sus papeles y sabe algo del ingl\u00e9s, uno agarra un trabajo mejor,\u201d [If one was documented and knew some English, one could get a better job], said Rub\u00e9n. \u201cLa venta de paletas...no es como tener un trabajo seguro,\u201d [Selling paletas...isn\u2019t like having a stable job.]\n\nThe instability of street vending makes it difficult to maintain a living, but for many undocumented residents, access to other job opportunities proves difficult. Rising costs of produce and frequent targeting from police make street vending less than ideal, but is still a promising source of income. Pedro, like many other vendors, has faced other risks while selling in the streets of Los Angeles. \u201cEn las calles tambi\u00e9n se vende pero tambi\u00e9n luego roban...el a\u00f1o pasado $200 nos robaron, mejor me vine para ac\u00e1, aqu\u00ed, al parque,\u201d [Walking on the sidewalks you can also sell, but then sometimes you can get robbed. Last year we had $200 stolen from us.

In hopes of making strides to help street vendors, the city of Los Angeles approved an ordinance on June 28 that reduces the cost of permits from $541 dollars to $27 dollars. \u201cBy acknowledging the financial realities that these vendors face, we are honoring their hard work and dedication,\u201d said Councilmember Curren Price in a press release, the representative for Council District 9, which USC belongs to.\n\nThe city also appears to have settled with street vendors who alleged that the city was violating state law SB946, which legalized street vending across the state. According to the nonprofit public interest law firm, Public Counsel, the lawsuit alleged that restrictions on where street vendors could sell were being placed unfairly, and in response, the city repealed the ban on seven no-vending zones in July 2024.\n\nWhile all of these efforts are a step in the right direction, street vendors continue to struggle to make a livable wage. Other government initiatives that could provide some relief, such as Section 8 housing benefits, aren\u2019t available to undocumented residents in Los Angeles. \u201cEl gobierno ayuda pero necesita uno tener sus papeles en regla pa\u2019 que tenga m\u00e1s oportunidades...ayuda no tengo del gobierno casi...\u201d [The government helps but one needs to have their documentation in order, to have more opportunities, I don\u2019t really have government help] says Rub\u00e9n.\n\nUntil all street vendors have access to proper support, their perseverance is what carries them through. As the heat wave officially comes to a close on September 10, vendors will continue selling through any conditions thrown their way. These conditions will persist, and along with looming climate change dangers, street vendors continue to be some of the most vulnerable in the Latine community. \u201cPero ni modo, aqu\u00ed tenemos que aguantar, echarle ganas, no ag\u00fcitarse...porque si se ag\u00fcita uno pierde...\u201d [But oh well, we have to endure, give it our best, not become disillusioned, because if one becomes disillusioned, we lose...] says Rub\u00e9n.\n\nFor more information on street vendors\u2019 rights visit: https://lastreetvendors.org/vendors/\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Only first names were used in this story at the request of our sources to respect their requests for partial anonymity in connection with previous violence against street vendors.\n```"}

In late June, Governor Gavin Newsom passed an executive order, calling for the clean up and removal of unhoused encampments and delegating the task to city officials and public outreach coordinators.\n\nThe encampment sweeps have continued throughout the summer despite temperatures reaching 90 degrees or above over twenty times in the last three months. On the hottest summer week in Southern California so far, city and sanitation crews continue to clear tents and belongings, performing encampment sanitation, along streets populated with people experiencing homelessness.\n\n\u201cThe city of L.A. does these sweeps every single day across the city,\u201d said Adam Smith, Civil Rights Organizer from the Los Angeles Community Action Network, a non-profit organization focused on providing a voice to people dealing with poverty.\n\nLast Thursday, a LACAN employee filmed an officer in an L.A. parking enforcement vehicle prepping for a sweep along Skid Row in 100 degree heat on the corner of San Julian Street and 6th Street at 2 p.m. Later that same day, Smith said LACAN and their partners at the Legal Aid Foundation of L.A. submitted a letter to the city demanding that sweeps be downgraded to \u201cspot cleanings\u201d during the heatwave over the weekend. City officials complied, he said, but there was no formalized notification system available for unhoused individuals to be made aware of the updated plan.\n\n\u201cI was on San Pedro [Street] and 7th [Street], and like a dozen people had moved their stuff, had dragged all their stuff off 7th Street and San Pedro to get out of the way this week, and no one told them,\u201d Smith said.\n\nIn Newsom\u2019s executive order, the California Department of Transportation is among the government departments that have been delegated to maintain policy directives to carry out encampment sweeps. Caltrans\u2019 public affairs deputy division chief, Christopher Clark, provided a detailed statement to Annenberg Media explaining the task of encampment coordinators.\n\nAccording to Caltrans protocol, city officials will typically notify local outreach groups two weeks in advance of an encampment removal deemed a \u201cthreat to surrounding infrastructure or people,\u201d a 48 hour notice will be posted at the site and on the day of the sweep, belongings are labeled, collected and placed into storage for 60 days.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has made unprecedented investments and provided ample funding for local governments to address the homelessness crisis \u2014 with $27 billion invested since 2019, including $1 billion geared toward local communities,\u201d Clark wrote in an email to Annenberg Media.\n\nWhile he does not fault the outreach workers tasked with conducting the sweeps, Smith questioned the overall sustainability of the state government pouring funding into building shelters for people who have had their encampments cleared.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been a shelter system in Los Angeles, and what we need is a robust housing system,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe need social housing. We need the city to be responsible for actual housing, and not just facilitating shelters.\u201d\n```"}

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nBy Benjamin Gamson September 11, 2024 at 5:08 pm PDT\n\nSeptember 10 marked the first head-to-head match, and first time ever meeting, between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, just 56 days before the election. The 90-minute debate was hosted by ABC and moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The candidates covered a range of issues including the economy, abortion, immigration, the Israel-Hamas war, the Russia-Ukraine war, the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and democracy. Here are some of the key moments from the debate:\n\nHarris and Trump shake hands\nOn June 27, when Trump and then presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden debated they did not shake hands at the offset of the debate nor at the conclusion. Harris crossed the debate stage at the start to shake Trump\u2019s hand and introduce herself. \u201cKamala Harris. Let\u2019s have a good debate,\u201d she said. Trump responded saying \u201cNice to see you. Have fun.\u201d\n\nHarris quick to bring up her middle class upbringing\nIn her first few words of the debate, responding to a question on the economy, Harris said she was \u201craised as a middle class kid\u201d something she brought up throughout the debate as a contrast between her and Trump. Harris brought up her upbringing again while responding to a question about her switch in positions from when she ran for the Democratic nomination in 2020 on fracking, guns, and decriminalizing border crossings. She said that her values have not shifted even though her policy positions have. \u201cI grew up a middle-class kid raised by a hard-working mother who worked and saved and was able to buy our first home when I was a teenager,\u201d said Harris. \u201cThe values I bring to the importance of home ownership knowing not everybody got handed $400 million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times.\u201d\n\nTrump tells Harris he was going to send her a MAGA hat\nTrump said that Harris has no platform, and that she has flip flopped on all her policy positions. \u201cShe\u2019s going to my philosophy now,\u201d said Trump. \u201cIn fact, I was going to send her a MAGA hat. She\u2019s gone to my philosophy. But if she ever got elected, she\u2019d change it.\u201d Trump continued by calling Harris a Marxist and said that \u201ceverybody knows she\u2019s a Marxist.\u201d\n\nHarris invites viewers to attend a Trump rally\nHarris told viewers that if they attended a Trump rally, people would notice that rally goers leave early due to \u201cexhaustion and boredom.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to actually do something really unusual and I\u2019m going to invite you to attend one of Donald Trump\u2019s rallies because it\u2019s a really interesting thing to watch,\u201d said Harris. \u201cYou will see during the course of his rallies he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about windmills cause cancer.\u201d Trump responded about his rallies saying that no one attends her events and accused her of busing people in and paying them to attend. \u201cPeople don\u2019t leave my rallies,\u201d said Trump. \u201cWe have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics.\u201d\n\nModerators clarified some of Trump\u2019s comments\nOn two occasions, moderators fact checked Trump, while he alleged that immigrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, and that a baby could be killed after birth. \u201cIn Springfield, they\u2019re eating the dogs,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThe people that came in. They\u2019re eating the cats. They\u2019re eating -- they\u2019re eating the pets of the people that live there.\u201d David Muir was quick to respond to the claim and said that ABC News reached out to the city manager about the allegations. \u201cHe told us there have been no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community,\u201d said Muir.\n\nOn the topic of abortion, Trump claimed that Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Minnesota Governor Tim Walz supports executing babies after birth. Linsey Davis interjected after Trump\u2019s response to say that \u201cthere is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it\u2019s born.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates failed to clarify abortion positions\nTrump did not answer a question on whether he would veto a federal abortion ban, if such a law was sent to him from Congress. Linsey Davis pressed Trump to clarify his position saying that his running mate J.D. Vance said that Trump would veto a federal abortion ban. Trump said that him and J.D. have never discussed that topic. At the same time, Trump asked Harris if she would allow abortions to continue in the seventh, eighth or ninth month of a pregnancy. She did not respond to that question, instead asking Trump to answer whether he would veto a federal abortion ban, a policy he says he does not support. Harris said that she supports the protections that Roe V. Wade encompassed which allowed abortions until the fetus reaches viability. Trump said that in his mind the abortion issue was over because it was now left up to individual states and voters there, which he said was always his intention.\n\nHarris tries to connect Trump to Project 2025\nHarris attempted to tie Trump to Project 2025, an almost 900 page paper with conservative policies published by the Heritage Foundation, that Democrats argue would define a second Trump term. \u201cI have nothing to do with Project 2025,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s out there. I haven\u2019t read it. I don\u2019t want to read it, purposely. I\u2019m not going to read it. This was a group of people that got together, they came up with some ideas. I guess some good, some bad.\u201d\n```"}

Although Miller might\u2019ve viewed the game as such, his players surely didn\u2019t play like it.\n\nThis game was a similar story to the others; Los Angeles got off to a strong start and blew it. LA led 18-16 after the first quarter, with 14 points in the paint. That was a huge improvement from the last game against the Sun when the Sparks only posted 24 total points in the paint.\n\nAfter the first quarter, the Sparks seemed to make adjustments by limiting turnovers. However, in the second quarter, the Sun captured the momentum, sparking an 8-0 run in the first 80 seconds of the frame.\n\nSparks forward Azur\u00e1 Stevens came through with an impressive defensive game. She had 17 rebounds, including 15 defensive boards and 10 points. Stevens\u2014a six-year veteran of the WNBA\u2014has been vital in providing leadership and defensive coverage on the court.\n\n\u201cI like the matchup against [Brionna Jones],\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI played against her for a few years now and I like to exploit that.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, forward Rickea Jackson continued to show why she deserves to be named to the All-Rookie team, adding 16 points and three assists.\n\nWhile the Sparks\u2019 7-29 record is disastrous, they aren\u2019t necessarily concerned about how they\u2019re perceived but are rather looking ahead to the future. \u201cWho cares about the record?\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe want to walk off the court that last game feeling good about representing the Sparks.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Miller has prided himself on making sure his players overachieve. \u201cThe big catchwords around the team recently are discipline and focus,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let a couple mistakes, a couple bad plays, a couple poor decisions turn into a quarter that gets away from us.\u201d\n\nThe Sparks will play their next game against the Storm Wednesday at 7 p.m. at Crypto.com Arena.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Taylor Fritz @taylor_fritz on Instagram) \n\nBy Robert Westermann September 11, 2024 at  3:48 pm PDT \n\nAmerica was so close, yet so far, from seeing one of its players hoist the trophy in Queens. Now two-time slam winner Jannik Sinner overcame American Taylor Fritz and his home-court advantage at the Billie Jean King Tennis Center, continuing a dominant hard-court year with a straight-sets finals victory. \n\nThe title briefly seemed wide open after Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic\u2019s unexpected early exits, and a handful of Americans used the occasion to make deep runs. Ben Shelton, Frances Tiafoe and Fritz\u2014all of whom were seeded in the top 20 or better\u2014advanced to at least the third round, eliminating top 10-ers Alexander Zverev and Grigor Dimitrov along the way. \n\nFritz and Tiafoe, who had knocked Shelton out in the third round, faced off in a neck-and-neck semifinal match before Tiafoe ran out of gas in the fifth set, allowing Fritz to become the first American man to play in a U.S. Open final since Andy Roddick in 2006. \n\nThat match also marked the first all-American semifinal at a Grand Slam since 2005, when Andre Agassi faced off against Robby Ginepri in Flushing Meadows. \n\nThe women\u2019s side was similar for the Americans, with top-15 seeds Emma Navarro and Jessica Pegula both advancing to the semifinals. Navarro fell to eventual champion Aryna Sabalenka in her semifinal match, and Pegula put up more than a fight in the final, losing 7-5, 7-5. \n\nPegula took down No. 1 Iga Swiatek in the quarterfinals and Navarro bested No. 3-seed American Coco Gauff in three sets, leaving the women\u2019s bracket just as open as the men\u2019s. \n\nThough no Americans ultimately prevented either Sabalenka or Sinner from winning consecutive hard-court slams, the results suggest that the tide may be shifting for the U.S. of A. \n\nAmerican men have had their fair share of deep tournament runs over the years, but the lack of titles is concerning. Fritz is the only American currently in the ATP top 20 to win a Masters 1000 (the most prestigious non-major tournaments) title over the last five years, which shows how difficult it\u2019s been for anyone, not just Americans, to get results. \n\nBut of the three juggernauts of 2000s men\u2019s tennis\u2014 Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer\u2014only one remains, with youngsters Alcaraz and Sinner filling the void. \n\nWorld No. 15 Sebastian Korda didn\u2019t have the U.S. Open he expected, losing in the second round, but he\u2019s improved dramatically over the last year. He recently won the Citi Open in Washington, D.C. and shows a lot of promise. \n\nShelton\u2019s another prodigy who\u2019s shined over the last couple years, reaching the semis at last year\u2019s U.S. Open. He won his second ATP event this year in Houston and possesses a powerful serve that can take him far. \n\nTiafoe, Fritz and Tommy Paul are the \u201cveteran\u201d American players and have all made a semifinal or final appearances at slams. They\u2019ve all proven capable of winning a major tournament, but haven\u2019t broken through just yet, leaving Alcaraz and Sinner as the go-to favorites for the time being. \n\nOn the women\u2019s side, the U.S. Open reaffirmed that American women\u2019s tennis is here to stay after Gauff\u2019s victory in 2023. No. 6-seed Jessica Pegula made a tremendous run to the finals before falling to Sabalenka 7-5, 7-5 and No. 13-seed Emma Navarro continued her career-best year by making the semifinals in Queens. \n\nGauff, however, didn\u2019t meet the high expectations that she set last year, failing to make a single final this season at all tournament levels. \n\nDespite Gauff\u2019s subtle decline, Navarro\u2019s improvement combined with Pegula\u2019s consistency signals that American women will contend for titles both now and for the next several years. \n\nOn the men\u2019s side, however, it\u2019s a bit of a different story. The contrast between the American men\u2019s and women\u2019s sides is that the women always have a legitimate contender at nearly every tournament. Gauff has been a top-three player for a while and merely switched places with Pegula in the most recent rankings. Navarro moved up four slots to No. 8, and Madison Keys stayed in the top 30 despite dealing with a hamstring injury. \n\nOn the men\u2019s side, there hasn\u2019t been anyone who\u2019s consistently been ranked third or higher. Rankings don\u2019t mean everything, but the stark difference between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s successes suggests that having a player ranked third or higher is important. \n\nThose details are crucial during slams because of seeding and matchups, in addition to getting to play on center court more often. \n\nWhile this weekend is cause for celebration, one strong showing doesn\u2019t mean much in the long term. If the men want to catch up with the women, one of the five top-ranked men needs to make a push in the rankings. \n\nFritz moved up to No. 7 in the most recent rankings, but he and his fellow countrymen still have a long way to go before they break through.\n```"}

Wade.\n\n\u201cMy biggest issue is abortion rights, and I felt that Trump\u2019s [performance] was disappointing but not surprising,\u201d said sophomore biochemistry major Naomi Kassahun. \u201cHe also lied and said that you can execute a baby, and he just made it easier for Kamala.\u201d\n\nKassahun, who is from the swing state of Pennsylvania, referred to Trump\u2019s claims that Harris, if elected, would allow for the abortion or \u201cexecution\u201d of newborns after birth. Moderator Linsey Davis of ABC News clarified that Trump\u2019s statements were false, leading to the student crowd\u2019s largest reaction of the night.\n\nEchoing this sentiment, freshman journalism student Loralei Rohrbach said, \u201cRoe v. Wade is very important to me as a woman, and I\u2019m pretty Catholic, but even as a Catholic I\u2019m very pro-choice, and it really upsets me when [Trump] hides under this Christian guise of being pro-life.\u201d\n\nMarcellas Belay, a sophomore studying political science, said she believed Harris succeeded in her performance on abortion rights. \u201cI think Kamala did pretty good on this issue and hitting back against Trump and him appointing Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade,\u201d Belay said.\n\nAbortion was not the only issue important to students, however. Adam Henderson, a freshman majoring in economics, added his support for Harris\u2019 affordable housing plan. \u201cI know that\u2019s an issue,\u201d Henderson said, \u201cespecially in Southern California for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nHenderson said Harris\u2019 proposal to provide first-time home buyers with a $25,000 home credit would be particularly helpful for college students in the current economy.\n\nSenior art major Arjun Bhargava said their most pressing concerns were the climate crisis and the Israel-Hamas war and felt that neither candidate succeeded in addressing these issues. \u201cHarris\u2019 willingness to change her position on fracking shows that she won\u2019t really go against corporate interest, and same thing with their stance on not seriously acknowledging the genocide in Gaza, and not being willing to criticize Israel,\u201d Bhargava said. \u201cThey both seem like they\u2019re, to some extent, willing to be complacent in corporate greed and violence.\u201d\n\nOne simpler but important issue was addressed by Rohrbach, who reflected on the political polarization of the debate and the election in general. \u201cI just think that we can vote differently and believe differently, but if we all believe in the good of America, why can\u2019t we talk?\u201d she asked. \u201cIf we sit down and boil down the issues and what we believe, I think at the end of the day, we\u2019ll find that we\u2019re a lot more alike than we are different.\u201d```"}

Tuesday night\u2019s 6 PM PST debate will be the first and only time Former President Donald Trump and current Vice President Kamala Harris will debate one another in the lead-up to the November 5th General Election. The two candidates will participate in a moderated debate with no public audience and no pre-written notes or material for the first time. Each candidate will have a set time limit to answer questions, provide a rebuttal to their opponent\u2019s statements, and deliver closing remarks. In an effort to maintain decorum, candidate microphones will be muted when the other is speaking.\n\nWith the election looming and an increased pressure to mobilize eligible voters of all demographics, the Latino vote could be a decisive factor for either party. Latinos make up 15% of total eligible voters this year with over 36 million Latinos ready to cast their ballots. Issues on the top of Latinos\u2019 minds range from costs of living to economic growth and stability. Some of the most important issues for Latino voters include inflation and the rising cost of living, jobs and the economy, housing affordability, health care costs, and immigration.\n\nLive Updates:\n7:50 p.m.: As the debate closed out, viewers were left with more questions than answers. Both former President Trump and Vice President Harris frequently dodged questions about policy implementation. Many of these questions pertain directly to the Latino community with topics including clear plans for immigration and citizenship pathways, reproductive rights, healthcare access, and job market opportunities. It is unlikely that either candidate will agree to another debate.\n\n7:45 p.m.: Final remark given during the 2024 Presidential Debate is former President Donald Trump saying \u201cToughest of all is allowing millions of people to come into our country- many of them are criminals and they are destroying our country. The worst president, the worst vice-president in the history of our country [Biden-Harris administration].\u201d\n\n7:22 p.m.: \u201cThis is the guy that took out a full page ad calling on the execution of the Central Park five. Five innocent Black and Latino boys,\u201d said Vice President Kamala Harris, referring to the four full-page ads in local publications Donald Trump paid $85,000 for, asking for the execution of five black and brown boys that were wrongfully accused of raping Trisha Meili.\n\n6:59 p.m.: \u201cI will always give Israel the ability to defend itself...but we must have a two-state solution where Gaza has the opportunity to rebuild itself,\u201d says Harris. In March 2024, 40% of Latinos supported a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war according to a poll run by Axios.\n\n6:52 p.m.: When David Muir asked about Trump\u2019s 2020 election loss, he mentioned that people should never think of an election as being fraudulent and that means the need of two things. \u201cWe need two things: walls/borders and good elections. Our elections are bad and a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they\u2019re trying to get them to vote, they can\u2019t even speak English, they don\u2019t even know what country they are in and these people are trying to get them to vote and that\u2019s why they are allowing them to come into the country.\u201d\n\n6:45 p.m.: As a response to Trump referring to immigrants as criminals, Harris says \u201cI think this is so rich coming from someone who has been prosecuted for national security crimes, economic crimes election interference, has been found liable for sexual assault, and his next big court appearance is in November at his own criminal sentencing.\u201d\n\n6:43 p.m.: Former President Trump continues to refer to immigrants as illegal aliens despite backlash. \u201cNow she [VP Harris] wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens,\u201d says Trump. For context, when former President Donald Trump commented about Vice President Harris wanting \u201cto do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison,\u201d Trump was referring to a 2019 American Civil Liberties Union questionnaire, where Harris supported gender-affirming care for everyone, including those in immigration detention and prison. \u201cIt is important that transgender individuals who rely on the state for care receive the treatment they need, which includes access to treatment associated with gender transition,\u201d said Vice President Harris.\n\n6:35 p.m.: \u201cDo you know that crime in Venezuela and all over the world is way down. You want to know why? Because they gave all the criminals to her [Kamala Harris]. We have a new form of crime and it\u2019s called \u201cmigrant crime\u201d and it\u2019s happening at levels never thought possible\u201d. Studies suggest that immigrants residing in the U.S. commit less crime than native-born citizens and that the increase in illegal immigration does not equal to an increase in domestic violent crime.\n\n6:33 p.m.: Former President Trump said \u201cWe\u2019ll end up being Venezuela on steroids,\u201d if Vice President Kamala Harris were to win the election, most likely referring to the uproar from Venezuelan citizens following an election experts believe to have been stolen. A sentiment that aligns with Trump\u2019s view of the 2020 presidential election despite evidence that these claims have no merit. Former President Trump mentioned that following the Biden administration, a new type of crime which he referred to as \u201cmigrant crime\u201d has been \u201chappening at levels never thought possible\u201d, according to Trump.\n\n6:31 p.m: David Muir asked Kamala about being tasked to getting to the root cause of migration from Central America by the Biden Administration. During the Biden Administration, illegal border crossings were at a record high. In June, when Biden enacted tough asylum restrictions those numbers dropped. Muir questioned Kamala on the reasoning of waiting six months for the Biden Administration to act on those restrictions Harris replied, \u201cCongress came up with a border security bill which I supported. That bill would put 1500 more border agents on the border to help border agents work overtime and allow us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. That bill would allow us to prosecute transnational criminal organizations for trafficking in guns, drugs, and human beings.\u201d Harris then explains that Donald Trump got on the phone with Congress and killed the bill.\n\n6:30 p.m.: \u201cI\u2019m the only person on this stage that has prosecuted transnational criminals. The United States Congress came up with a security bill that I supported which would have put 1500 more agents to secure the border. I know there are so many families watching that have been personally affected by the surge of fentanyl,\u201d said Harris when asked about Immigration. Notably, on every occasion Vice President Harris has been asked about immigration, she has turned the conversation into a rebuttal against Trump.\n\n6:23 p.m.: Trump mentioned how the Biden Administration was unable to secure the student loan forgiveness promise. 67% of Hispanic and Latino graduates left college with educational debt in 2024.\n\n6:15 p.m.: \u201cMany of these people coming in are criminals... they have and she [VP Harris] has destroyed our country with policies... Immigration is the worst thing that has happened to our economy.\u201d - Trump on immigrants\n```"}

(Photo by Alexandra Donovan)\n\nBy Alexandra Donovan\nSeptember 10, 2024 at 4:36 pm PDT\n\nOn Monday night USC Panhellenic kicked off its series of wellness events with a journaling event in honor of National Suicide Prevention Month. Inside the Alpha Chi Omega Sorority tables are lined up with bouquets of pink flowers, matching pink notebooks and printed copies of the poem \u201cHow to Live\u201d by Charles Harper Webb. The event was led by Emily Chertow, 28, the founder of @journalingclasses, who hosts guided workshops that focus on using writing to practice mindfulness and self care.\n\n\u201cToday we are honoring our loved ones that we\u2019ve lost to suicide and [honoring] suicide prevention week,\u201d Chertow said. Chertow lost a loved one to suicide said she is still currently dealing with grief. \u201cBut when we come together, when we write together, when we talk about what\u2019s in our hearts, our minds and brains it takes the percentage of suicides and makes it smaller and smaller,\u201d Chertow said.\n\nChertow was in the same shoes of these college women just a few years ago when she graduated from Penn State with a degree in Journalism and later a degree in publishing at Columbia University in New York City, where she currently lives. This has made her want to mentor and become like an older sister to the students.\n\nThe focus of this workshop was gratitude and intention setting with a printed prompt sheet. After an initial intention, the group set a collective intention and Chertow burnt Palo Santo, a plant known for cleansing energy. Then she opened the session by saying, \u201cCollege is fucking hard. You\u2019re showing up on a Monday to give yourself self care in a community setting and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nAttendees were guided through a series of prompts such as state of being prompt that helped the group label their current feeling or experiences with a specific emotion. Stephanie Moren, a sophomore studying communications, said initially the event was a chance to meet new friends since she just transferred to USC, but she was also intrigued by the idea of journaling as it has become a popular wellness trend on social media. When Stephanie started writing she realized journaling was much more than that.\n\n\u201cIt made me so emotional because I saw how other girls felt exactly how I felt which is why this event left me with such peace of mind knowing that I\u2019m not alone,\u201d Moreno said.\n\nAfter completing this activity Chertow read the poem \u201cHow to Live\u201d out loud to the group, prompting the room to reflect on how they live their lives and what\u2019s most important to them. Cliona Philp, a sophomore studying philosophy, politics and law said the prompts allowed her to organize her thoughts onto paper.\n\n\u201cBy writing my thoughts down and expelling them from my head it makes them quieter and more manageable,\u201d Philp said.\n\nThis is the feeling Chertow tries to facilitate in her classes. When she walked around the room she said, \u201cget out of the head and drop into the heart.\u201d\n\n@Journalingclasses are built off three pillars: Chertow\u2019s passion for advocating for mental health, her passion for human connection and her passion for pen to paper. Chertow manages her anxiety and depression on a daily basis and she believes journaling and talking about hardships in a community setting can make this easier.\n\n\u201cWhen we come together and write together we heal together,\u201d Chertow said.\n\nShe is hosting a series of upcoming wellness workshops, that include virtual options, such as \u201cFeed Your Inner Child,\u201d \u201cMindful Morning: Cold Plunge + Journaling Experience,\u201d \u201cSomatic Body Painting and Mindfulness Journaling Workshop\u201d and even a flower bouquet making workshop.\n\nIf you are having thoughts of suicide, or call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.\n```"}

USC opens the season with six straight home games. The Trojans\u2019 first game will be against the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga on November 4. The Trojans then play Idaho State on November 7 followed by a date with the University of Texas at Arlington on November 13. USC\u2019s next home game is with former Pac-12 opponent Cal on November 17, as part of a recently announced  home-and-home series between the two schools . Following the Pac-12\u2032s collapse last year, the Golden Bears found a new home in the ACC along with Stanford. The Golden Bears will come to Los Angeles this season before the Trojans make the return trip up to Berkeley during the 2025-26 season. Last year, the Trojans beat the Bears at Galen Center 82-74 in January before losing the rematch 83-77 in overtime at Haas Pavilion a month later. Following the matchup with Cal, USC will host San Jos\u00e9 State on November 20 and Grambling on November 24 to close out the homestand. The Trojans then take part in the Acrisure Classic in Palm Desert over Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday. USC will play WCC power Saint Mary\u2019s on November 28 and, depending on the results of that game and the game between New Mexico and former Pac-12 member Arizona State (now in the Big 12), the Trojans will take on either the Lobos or the Sun Devils the next day. The Trojans\u2019 final three non-conference matchups will be in Los Angeles on their home court. USC will host Montana State, Cal State Northridge and Southern \u2014 USC\u2019s final non-conference opponent \u2014 between mid and late December. With USC now in the Big Ten and having to play its road conference games further away from home, it appears the Trojans opted to not play any non-conference games outside of California, with nine of those games being home games. In addition, USC faces three and possibly four teams that won their conference tournaments last year (Grambling, Saint Mary\u2019s, Montana State and possibly New Mexico). This makes for a tough, yet manageable schedule for the Trojans to start their campaign, especially with teams like Saint Mary\u2019s and New Mexico, who both made the NCAA Tournament from competitive basketball conferences in the WCC and Mountain West respectively. While USC knows which Big Ten opponents it will play and where, the conference has still yet to announce the dates for the Trojans\u2019 first 20 conference games as a Big Ten member. Last season, USC went 15-18 to finish tied for ninth in the Pac-12 conference standings with a 8-12 conference mark, despite starting the season ranked No. 21 in the preseason Associated Press poll. The Trojans advanced to the second round of the Pac-12 tournament before falling to Arizona to end the season. After the season ended, former head coach Andy Enfield left for SMU, prompting athletic director Jen Cohen to hire Musselman away from Arkansas. This ultimately triggered most of the roster to depart the team, causing Musselman to bring in 16 new players. Senior forward Harrison Hornery and senior walk-on guard JD Plough were the only two players not to graduate, transfer or declare for the NBA Draft after the 2023-24 campaign ended. With a new-look roster under a brand new coaching staff, USC will debut as Big Ten members when it plays host to UT Chattanooga on November 4.\n```"}

The series ended a tough stretch for the Dodgers who will now start on what should be an easy road to October. Three of their past four matchups were against playoff teams, two of which are set to receive No. 1 seeds in the playoffs. LA is scheduled to play three games against the Chicago Cubs and the Miami Marlins, and six against the Colorado Rockies. The San Diego Padres and the Atlanta Braves, both Wild-Card teams, are also mixed in. With the way that LA is playing lately, they should have no issues with these teams.\n\nDespite their hot streak, the Dodgers dropped Game 1 in a low-scoring 3-1 affair. Shohei Ohtani hit a home run, which was LA\u2019s sole run. Dodgers starter Landon Knack pitched a great game, striking out eight batters in six innings. LA came out swinging in Game 2, recording eight hits in a 7-2 victory. The outfielders were spectacular for the Dodgers, and right-fielder Mookie Betts and left-fielder Andy Pages each hit a homer. Center-fielder Tommy Edman also knocked in two RBIs. The Dodgers sent out seven different pitchers who combined for seven strikeouts, making it a bullpen day for the squad.\n\nLos Angeles closed out the series in a 4-0 Game 3 win. Ohtani had himself a game, tallying two hits and his 46th home run this season. He\u2019s now tied his single-season record and is closer to his first 50 home-run season. Third-baseman Max Muncy put the icing on the cake for LA when he blasted one in the bottom of the eighth inning. Jack Flaherty, one of the only consistent starters for the Dodgers, had another strong showing, pitching seven innings and throwing six strikeouts. Michael Kopech and Evan Phillips added strikeouts of their own, contributing to the Dodgers\u2019 12th shutout of the season.\n\nThough the Dodgers continue to rack up wins, they can\u2019t escape the injury bug. Starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto is set to return and start against the Cubs this Tuesday. Yamamoto was sidelined earlier this season after a tricep injury. What was a day-to-day injury escalated quickly, and he has not pitched in the MLB since June. The Dodgers will want to use its stint of weaker opponents to rest their top players so they are ready to play in October. There are also many notable names on the injured list, including left-fielder Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, relief pitchers Brusdar Graterol and Joe Kelly, and starting pitchers Tyler Glasnow, Gavin Stone, and Clayton Kershaw. Despite injuries, the Dodgers look to keep things rolling this week against the Cubs.\n```"}

This unassuming, church-like building, which now serves as a multi-faith cultural arts center, was the oldest synagogue building in Los Angeles. But on September 5, it became the center of attention for a different crowd: dedicated Rex Orange County fans.\n\nDespite Los Angeles being in the midst of a heatwave, fans wrapped around the block in anticipation of a surprise album release show \u2014 a performance that had only been announced last week. The small venue, which typically hosts a range of community events, was transformed for the night into a concert hall, offering fans an up-close-and-personal experience with the artist.\n\nEnglish artist Alexander O\u2019Connor, better known as Rex Orange County, has been a staple of the alternative indie music scene since 2017, with four critically acclaimed albums and several sold-out world tours to his name. This night, however, marked a significant moment in his career: a return to the spotlight following a challenging and controversial chapter.\n\nIn 2022, O\u2019Connor faced six charges of sexual assault by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), leading to the abrupt cancellation of his tour at the time. Later that year, an investigation by CPS led to the charges being dismissed. Now in 2024, his latest album, \u201cThe Alexander Technique,\u201d represents a hopeful comeback.\n\nThe title references a form of therapy for poor posture, and in a way, reflects the once-fallen O\u2019Connor\u2019s attempt to rectify his standing with the music world. The new record serves as Rex Orange County\u2019s re-introduction as the truest version of himself: Alexander.\n\nFor the fewer than 400 lucky fans who managed to secure a $35 ticket \u2014 a steal compared to the doubled prices of his upcoming theatre tour \u2014 the Pico Union Project offered a special opportunity to witness an intimate performance. Though typically outfitted with pews, the night\u2019s event was standing room only, heightening the intimacy and excitement.\n\nInside, the ambiance was both mellow and reverent. The stained glass windows, centered pipe organ and moody lighting created a setting that felt almost spiritual \u2014 an apt comparison for what would unfold later in the evening.\n\nRex Orange County performs to a group of 400 fans at his exclusive album release concert (Photo by Mika Panahon)\n\nWhen Rex Orange County and his band took the stage at around 8:20 pm, the audience quickly forgot their discomfort from the heat. The show kicked off with songs from the new album, which was publicly released later that night. Rex Orange County opened with \u201cThe Table,\u201d a gentle guitar-driven single that set the tone for the evening. Next came \u201cPure,\u201d an upbeat number that carried the energy forward, before launching into \u201cTHE SHADE,\u201d a fan-favorite from his previous album \u201cWho Cares?,\u201d which had the entire crowd singing along word for word.\n\nIn a move that hinted at the emotional journey of the new album, the 26-year-old then slowed things down with \u201cNew Years,\u201d a raw and honest track that highlighted his signature introspective lyricism. The performance continued with two more well-loved tracks: \u201cHappiness\u201d and \u201cUntitled.\u201d Both were throwbacks to his days as an independent artist on platforms like SoundCloud, when he was first discovered by rapper Tyler, the Creator.\n\nIt was these early songs, and his collaborations on Tyler\u2019s album \u201cFlower Boy\u201d, that helped launch him into the spotlight. As the clock struck 9:00 pm, \u201cThe Alexander Technique\u201d officially dropped. Rex took a moment to thank his fans for their unwavering support, acknowledging the irony that they couldn\u2019t listen to the album right away.\n\nTo make up for it, he continued the performance with three more tracks from the new release: \u201cGuitar Song,\u201d the second single off the album, \u201c2008,\u201d a more upbeat tune featuring a fuller band and \u201cLook Me in the Eyes,\u201d an emotional piano-driven track that brought the crowd back down to a more reflective mood.\n\nThe night came to a close with a final burst of nostalgia. Rex played two beloved throwbacks, the dreamlike love song, \u201cAMAZING,\u201d and, what his fans consider to be his magnum opus, \u201cPluto Projector.\u201d The crowd, however, wasn\u2019t ready to leave. Chanting for an encore, they were rewarded with one last performance of another throwback, \u201cLoving is Easy,\u201d sending fans home with a sense of bittersweet fulfillment.\n\nFor Rex Orange County fans, loving isn\u2019t always easy. Though the night marked a triumphant return for the artist, it was not without its complexities. The artist\u2019s past controversy still lingers, and while the charges were dropped and he maintains his innocence, uncertainty remains. Yet, for many in the room, it was clear that Rex is back.\n```"}

Sparks guard Rickea Jackson was on fire, scoring 23 points this game and putting the team on her back, further proving her place in the WNBA.\n\n\u201cI know Connecticut isn\u2019t going to let me do what I want so I know I have to hit them first, go at them first,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBut we just have to put together four quarters.\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s skill was on display in this game, she made big shots against a defensive efficient team. In the second quarter, she executed a spin move into a fake jump and got three defenders in the air. From there, she scored with ease. Not too long after that, she hit a nasty fadeaway right over Dijonai Carrington.\n\nAlthough the Sun are known for their defending, Jackson was up for the challenge Sunday night. Forward Dearica Hamby and guard Odyssey Sims each had 10 points to aid Jackson on the offensive end. Hamby also added seven rebounds and three assists.\n\nIt was a competitive battle until the fourth quarter when the Sparks lost their 7-point lead and couldn\u2019t get the offense going. They only scored 9 points while the Sun tallied 24 in the final frame. Connecticut forwards Brionna Jones and Alyssa Thomas were huge in the win. Jones had 21 points, nine rebounds and three assists while Thomas had 12 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds.\n\nSun guard Marina Mabrey hit a 3-pointer to give the Sun a lead with 6:26 in the fourth, and the Sparks couldn\u2019t consistently score down the stretch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played good enough basketball to be in games and around games, we haven\u2019t always been able to finish games,\u201d said head coach Curt Miller.\n\nFinishing games has been a problem for the Sparks while it\u2019s been a strong suit for the Sun. Even though the Sparks lost, their future is promising. They have a young team, including two top-5 picks from the 2024 draft. Additionally, with the loss, Los Angeles has guaranteed itself a top-3 pick in the 2025 draft regardless of the lottery results, with a 44.2% chance for the first pick.\n\nOn the bright side, The Sparks had a good game at the 3-point, shooting 80%.\n\n\u201cA lot of good things, but there\u2019s no moral victories in this league,\u201d Miller said.\n\nThe Sparks will play Connecticut again on Tuesday and will hope to finally come away with a win. LA hasn\u2019t won a game against the Sun since Aug. 28, 2020. The battle will begin on Tuesday at 7 p.m. at Crypto.com Arena.\n```"}

The Los Angeles Rams started the 2024-25 season the same way their season ended last year, with a loss to the Detroit Lions at Ford Field. After both teams went three plays and out on their opening drives, the Rams got the first points of the game on their second drive after a 41-yard field goal attempt from rookie kicker Joshua Karty. The kick capped off a 13-play, 67-yard drive and the Rams entered the second quarter up 3-0 over the Lions.\n\nOn the next drive, the LA defense was able to keep Detroit out of the endzone again, as the Lions settled for a 25-yard field goal attempt to tie the game at three apiece. The Rams were able to keep Detroit from scoring a touchdown after the Lions drove the ball inside Los Angeles\u2019 10-yard line.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 next drive ended without points when quarterback Matthew Stafford, who finished the game with 317 passing yards, failed to connect with wide receiver Cooper Kupp on fourth down with 6:36 remaining in the half. Immediately after the change of possession, quarterback Jared Goff found wide receiver Jameson Williams over the middle for a 36-yard completion. The Rams allowed Detroit to advance the ball to LA\u2019s one-yard line and with 1:57 remaining in the half, and running back Jahmyr Gibbs scored a rushing touchdown to give the Lions a 10-3 lead.\n\nWith less than a minute remaining in the half and two timeouts, the Rams had a chance to score a touchdown and tie the game going into halftime, but came up empty on their final drive of the half, with Stafford throwing his lone interception of the game to Detroit\u2019s Kirby Joseph.\n\nFacing a seven-point deficit, the Rams opened the second half on defense. After both teams opened the second half going three plays and out, the Rams saw their deficit grow on Detroit\u2019s second drive of the third quarter. Goff connected with Williams again for big yardage, this time a 52-yard touchdown that extended Detroit\u2019s lead to 14.\n\nFollowing the Lions\u2019 touchdown, the Rams responded by scoring 17 straight points. With 3:33 remaining in the third quarter, running back Kyren Williams scored a two-yard touchdown to finish a 70-yard drive that took 11 plays. Following the score, the Rams\u2019 defense forced another three-and-out and LA\u2019s offense made the score 13-17 after a 26-yard field goal from Karty.\n\nAs the Lions were moving the ball downfield on the next drive, safety John Johnson III intercepted Goff to give the Rams the ball back with 9:09 left in the fourth quarter. Los Angeles capitalized on the turnover with a 10-play, 80-yard drive that ended with Stafford finding Kupp for a nine-yard touchdown with 4:30 remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nAfter back-to-back punts from the Lions and Rams, Detroit got the ball back with two minutes remaining in the game. Los Angeles was unable to keep Detroit out of field goal range as kicker Jake Bates made a 32-yard field goal to tie the game at 20.\n\nIn overtime, Los Angeles gave up an eight-play, 70-yard touchdown drive that ended with running back David Montgomery scoring a one-yard touchdown to give the Lions a 26-20 victory.\n\nLos Angeles travels to Arizona next week to play the Cardinals for the Rams\u2019 first divisional game. To add insult to injury, the Rams will be without wide receiver Puka Nacua for at least the next four games after he was placed on the injured reserve list with a torn PCL.\n```"}

Yep \u2013 it\u2019s been 13 years since Trojan defense has pinned its opponent scoreless, but that shiny stat isn\u2019t the only reason why the 2024 Trojans are not to be counted out.\n\nWhile Utah State isn\u2019t the most prestigious opponent on USC\u2019s schedule \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s predicted to be the Trojans\u2019 easiest win \u2014 the significance of Saturday\u2019s game lies beyond who occupied the visiting locker room. There\u2019s been a lot of doubt surrounding Trojan football. Don\u2019t misunderstand, last Sunday\u2019s 27-20 win against then-No. 13 LSU in Las Vegas\u2019 Allegiant Stadium was a hopeful glimpse into a potentially great season. But many Trojan fans needed a little more proof of the team\u2019s potential before raising their hopes to the likes of Texas or Georgia fans.\n\nAsk, and ye shall receive. USC more than covered the spread of -28.5 points on Saturday, scoring 27 in just the first half. In addition to the new coaching staff, schemes and team philosophy, the Trojans have the making of an elite program. There were 61,000 fans who came to the Coliseum on Saturday, fans who got to see a Trojan hype video that can only be compared to a Hollywood movie \u2013 fitting, considering the Hollywood sign sits just beyond the horizon of the Coliseum walls.\n\nI understand it\u2019s a scary time. The Trojans\u2019 first Big Ten matchup is just around the corner against Michigan on September 21, and USC\u2019s first two games are not necessarily indicative of a successful season. Trust issues are to be expected, especially with last year\u2019s 6-0 start and 1-6 finish to the season. But the Trojans have spent the offseason and past two games proving this isn\u2019t a season like any other.\n\nComing out on top against a top-15 team and a charity match reveals a lot more than one might think. LSU at the time of kickoff last Sunday was ranked No. 13 and USC No. 23 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll, but aside from the pressure of facing a top-15 team, USC showed America a new font of Trojan football, one that\u2019s defensively powerful and offensively flexible. Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week and redshirt junior quarterback Miller Moss threw 28-36 for 378 yards, passing to 10 different receivers.\n\nDoubters persisted, though. Sure, Sunday was a great win against a great team, but it really could have gone either way, right? USC showed potential on both sides of the ball, but potential doesn\u2019t promise anything. Not only did the Trojans have limited rest time for Saturday\u2019s game against the Aggies, including one fewer day to review film, but there were concerns that a lingering LSU hangover would interfere with USC\u2019s ability to capitalize on offensive transitions.\n\nAfter all, a Utah State matchup could carry more indications about this team regarding the Trojans possibly playing down to their opponents. If, God forbid, the Aggies infiltrated Trojan territory and left with a win, any pride from last Sunday\u2019s win would have been erased. That was certainly not out of the question, especially after a wild day in college football saw USC rival Notre Dame fall to Northern Illinois.\n\nAs redshirt senior defensive end Jamil Muhammad mentioned in Saturday\u2019s postgame press conference, the game isn\u2019t just how you react to failure but also how you handle success. If the Trojans fumbled perhaps their easiest win of the season, not only would doubters give their two cents faster than you can say \u201cFight On!\u201d, but it would have a lot to say about USC\u2019s inability to handle \u201csuccess.\u201d\n\nFortunately, that wasn\u2019t the case. Saturday was a game of complementary football, a phrase used by at least three players in the postgame press conference. Moss got the job done. He didn\u2019t have any extraordinary plays, but he was efficient and utilized his tight ends. Redshirt junior tight end Lake McRee had four receptions, freshman tight end Walker Lyons grabbed three and redshirt freshman backup tight end Kade Eldridge had one of his own.\n\nDespite the unlit floodlights surrounding the field, Trojan defense shined through. Utah State\u2019s offense averaged 30+ points per game last season, but USC ensured the red zone was foreign territory for the Aggies. A 52-yard missed field goal attempt was the closest they would come to scoring. If the 544 total offensive yards \u2014 including 103 rushing yards from redshirt senior running back Woody Marks \u2014 and seven tackles each from senior linebackers Eric Gentry and Easton Mascarenas-Arnold weren\u2019t enough to believe in USC\u2019s effective complementary play, perhaps the roster\u2019s depth signaled hope.\n\nThe Coliseum torch had trouble igniting, but thankfully the fire on the field never escaped the Trojans, even when backups were primarily on the field. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Jayden Maiava made his USC debut in the third quarter, closing out the game going 8-for-11 and dipping his toes in the end zone for a touchdown. Maiava proved his readiness on the field. Even if there\u2019s trouble in the passing lanes, he\u2019s not afraid to run the ball if need be.\n\nThe presence of second and third-string players finishing off a shutout win is just a glimpse into USC\u2019s stacked roster. While it may be a while until the backups hit the turf again \u2014 the Trojans are unlikely to have as big of a blowout again to give the backups a chance to play \u2014 they provide a backbone for the starters.\n\nIf you\u2019re still skeptical about the Trojans\u2019 potential to deliver upsets and clean sweeps, don\u2019t be surprised if USC makes a victorious entrance to the Big Ten in Ann Arbor on September 21.\n```"}

(Photo by Shantala Muruganujan)\n\nBy Terence Holton September 08, 2024 at 1:58 pm PDT\n\nIn USC\u2019s first home game in its inaugural Big Ten season, the No. 13 Trojans left no doubt about their winning capabilities by beating Utah State 48-0, shutting out their first opponent since 2011.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good visualization of our defense and how much work we put in,\u201d senior linebacker Easton Mascarenas-Arnold said. \u201cWe know what we got to do and I think we did a good job of execution today.\u201d\n\nThe first quarter was filled with explosive runs from redshirt senior running back Woody Marks and redshirt freshman Quinten Joyner as the duo combined for over 140 yards by the end of the quarter. Joyner punched in the first touchdown for the Trojans right after a powerful run where he bounced off multiple would-be tacklers to put USC up 10-0.\n\nMarks answered his fellow tailback\u2019s score, grabbing his third touchdown of the season on a two-yard run, putting USC up 17-0 two minutes into the second quarter.\n\n\u201cWe only need a little bit of a hole and [the offensive line] gave it to us all night,\u201d Marks said. \u201cI applaud them for that, for giving us the chance to hit the holes and make space, so hats off to the O-line.\u201d\n\nThe defensive onslaught continued throughout the first half. With the Trojans up by three scores, their next three defensive possessions resulted in a turnover on downs, a punt, and an interception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of good things, I thought we made some improvements today in terms of our communication, especially in pass coverage,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said. \u201cThat was a big emphasis point, so proud of the guys for making some of the adjustments and corrections that we needed to do.\u201d\n\nJunior defensive end Anthony Lucas and redshirt senior defensive end Jamil Muhammed led the charge upfront, putting pressure on Utah State\u2019s junior quarterback Bryson Barnes.\n\nOne drive later, Mascarenas-Arnold intercepted a tipped pass late in the second quarter, leading to a touchdown for sophomore receiver Makai Lemon to put the Trojans up 27-0 to end the half.\n\nDespite a strong showing in the first half, USC wide receivers dropped two touchdowns, leaving the offense with much to desire.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of stuff in the first half we left out there and we got to continue to climb,\u201d redshirt junior quarterback Miller Moss said. \u201cThe offensive line played their butts off and I think that kinda showed the balance we have offensively, really proud of those guys and how they played up front, but skill players, myself included, have to clean some stuff up.\u201d\n\nAfter a delayed second-half kickoff due to a power outage, the first-half trends continued; USC\u2019s stifling defense held strong, forcing a turnover on downs, while on offense, the run game continued to punish the Aggies as Joyner waltzed in for his second touchdown of the night, putting the Trojans past the 30-point threshold.\n\nBy the middle of the third quarter, the Trojans began to clear out the bench, with redshirt sophomore quarterback Jayden Maiava seeing his first snaps as a Trojan. On his first passing attempt, Maiava fumbled the snap but made a miraculous throw downfield to earn his first yards in a cardinal and gold jersey.\n\nMaiava continued to amaze in his first drive with the Trojans, as he made a Caleb Williams-esque escape out of the pocket on third down, and scrambled for a seven-yard touchdown to put the Trojans up 41-0 with 14 minutes to play.\n\n\u201cI had the biggest smile on my face,\u201d Maiava said. \u201cGrowing up, I\u2019ve always watched USC football and just being able to be in the shoes that I used to watch is definitely electrifying.\u201d\n\nRedshirt freshman running back A\u2019Marion Peterson notched his first touchdown of the season to cap off the Trojans\u2019 dominant showing, finishing off the Aggies, 48-0.\n\nNext up is a well-deserved bye week for USC before the Trojans head to the Big House to take on the reigning national champions, Michigan on September 21.\n```"}

With the win over the Tigers in the Modelo Vegas Kickoff Classic, the Trojans jumped 10 spots in the Associated Press Top 25, soaring to No. 13 after clocking in at No. 23 in the AP\u2019s preseason poll.\n\nIn addition to USC moving up in the polls and earning one of its biggest victories under head coach Lincoln Riley, redshirt junior quarterback Miller Moss earned the Big Ten\u2019s Offensive Player of the Week award for his standout performance against the Tigers. Moss went 27-for-36 and threw for 378 yards with a touchdown, connecting with 10 different receivers in the process.\n\nWhile Moss should continue to take advantage of the depth in USC\u2019s receiver room, he should also not be afraid to feed the hot hand should he have one against Utah State. The run game, however, was not as effective as Moss\u2019s lethal passing attack. Redshirt senior running back Woody Marks accounted for two rushing touchdowns, including the game-winning score with eight seconds remaining on the clock.\n\nThe Trojans need to get the running backs more involved so the offense can have a more balanced attack against the Aggies. While Moss was busy torching the LSU defense, the USC defense debuted its new scheme under first-year coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn. While the Trojans did allow LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier to throw for 304 yards and two touchdowns, they limited the Tigers to only 117 rushing yards.\n\nDefensively, redshirt sophomore safety Kamari Ramsey and senior linebacker Eric Gentry, who combined for 16 tackles against LSU, will play crucial roles in stopping Utah State\u2019s offense. While the run-game defense limited the Tigers\u2019 ability to carry the ball, the USC secondary struggled to bring down LSU\u2019s receivers.\n\nPlaying the Aggies gives the Trojans an opportunity to fix the mistakes from the LSU game, especially with a daunting challenge at Michigan two weeks away. USC currently holds a 6-0 record against upcoming opponent Utah State, with every game taking place at the Coliseum.\n\nThe Trojans last played the Aggies in 2016, when they beat USU 45-7 on September 16 in the second game of the season. The Aggies won their first game at home in Logan, Utah 36-14 over FCS team Robert Morris to also start their season 1-0.\n\nDespite the win over RMU, Utah State is operating under interim head coach Nate Dreiling after former head coach Blake Anderson was fired in July for \u201cactions [that] violated both his employment agreement and university policy.\u201d\n\nWith an injury to USU quarterback Spencer Petras, former Utah quarterback Bryson Barnes \u2014 who helped Utah beat USC 34-32 last season at the Coliseum \u2014 could get the start in Week 2 for the Aggies after coming in for Petras against RMU last week.\n\nThe Trojans will make their Big Ten Network debut when they kick off their second game of the season in the Coliseum on Saturday at 8 p.m. against the Aggies.\n```"}

These athletes, distinguishable by their white uniforms and cardinal and gold pom poms, are not just there to smile and wave. They are hard-working individuals with years of dance experience and technical training, serving as ambassadors for the University of Southern California.\n\nThe USC Song Leaders have been around since 1967, performing at all football games and Trojan sporting events, along with other alumni, charitable, university and special events throughout the calendar year. Annenberg Media spoke to the athletes and staff within the Song program and discussed the hard work that goes into being a USC Song Leader.\n\n\u201cIt does take a lot of training and experience of many different dance styles and technical training,\u201d Danielle B., a sophomore involved with the group, said. \u201cPersonally, I was a competitive dancer for about 10 years, and that\u2019s what really helped me get to where I am today.\u201d\n\nBecoming a USC Song Leader is no easy feat. It involves a rigorous audition process where typically 40+ students try out. Each year, only a select few \u2014 usually 10-14 \u2014 are chosen. This year, the team comprises 11 talented and experienced dancers, a testament to the high standards of the Song Leaders.\n\n\u201cI think some people think that we audition for this team just by watching a couple of videos of past teams, and we decided that this is something we just want to do,\u201d Phoebe S., a sophomore Song Leader, said. \u201cBut all of us have had training for years and years before this.\u201d\n\nUSC Song Leaders don\u2019t just perform at events, they live and breathe their roles. They take part in over 15 hours of rehearsal each week including team studio rehearsals and independent rehearsals. Game days include three-hour band rehearsals and rallies, all of which can take up to 12 hours. Their dedication is evident in the time they invest in full games, rallies and special performances, showcasing the depth of their commitment to this program.\n\nSong Leaders arrived on campus 10 days before the start of the semester for an extensive boot camp from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily to prepare for a year\u2019s worth of events. The group learns over 35 dances in a year, coming up with a new halftime routine for every home football game.\n\nAudrea Harris (left) is the Song Advisor while Cheryl Azurin (right) is the Song Coach (Photo by Alexis Guzman).\n\nA wide variety of choreographers within the professional dance industry come in to work with the Song Leaders \u2014 many who are former NFL and NBA dancers.

With a little over 20 games left for most teams, the typical Wild-Card sprint is nonexistent this year. According to ESPN analytics, each of the NL\u2019s top teams has over a 97% chance of clinching their division. These teams\u2013the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Milwaukee Brewers\u2013have been dominant all year and have proven why they are at the top of the National League.\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks and the San Diego Padres are the two Wild-Card leaders, and both are part of a superior NL West. Both teams soared to the top of the standings after the All-Star break, and have stayed at the top ever since. The Atlanta Braves aren\u2019t far behind, though. With the New York Mets only a half-game back of the Braves, Atlanta is the only team with a chance of not making it to October.\n\nThe AL\u2019s top squads have similarly shown they are legitimate contenders. The Baltimore Orioles, the Cleveland Guardians and the Houston Astros each have a 99% chance of making the playoffs. The New York Yankees are basically part of this group, too. New York holds the top Wild Card spot by 5.5 games and is neck and neck with the Orioles to get the first-round bye. The other two teams that are fighting for a Wild Card position are the Kansas City Royals and the Minnesota Twins. With a four-and-a-half game cushion, it is unlikely that both of these teams won\u2019t play in October.\n\nThe White Sox start a new losing streak\nThe Chicago White Sox have had an abysmal season, recording just 31 wins on the year. With bases loaded this past week against the Orioles, three Sox players ran toward a pop-up in shallow left field that should have gotten the team out of the inning. Instead, Jacob Amaya, who originally called for the ball, bailed out while third baseman Miguel Vargas and outfielder Andrew Benintendi ran straight into each other, giving up three runs. Unfortunately for White Sox fans, the team\u2019s 12-game losing streak is only their third-worst of the season. Even worse, they are a long way from the Detroit Tigers\u2019 2003 season, the worst in baseball history with a 43-119 record. Chicago will have to go unconscious to not set the new record and win 12 of their final 22 games.\n\nWho will win the Cy Young?\nThe best players in the league always find a way to separate themselves. This year is no different, where the two Cy Young finalists have proven themselves time and time again as to why they are the best in their respective divisions. The NL\u2019s favorite is Braves left-hander Chris Sale. Sale leads the league in ERA at 2.46 and is tied for first in wins with 16. His most jaw-dropping stat is the 206 strikeouts he\u2019s thrown in 160 innings pitched. Anytime Sale is in the lineup, the Braves are put at an immediate advantage. Sale will likely compete in his fourth postseason and attempt to win a second World Series.\n\nTarik Skubal is the AL\u2019s clear Cy Young winner. The southpaw leads most categories, including ERA (2.51) and strikeouts (201). He is tied for first in wins with Sale and has an insane WHIP of 0.93. He is far and away the best pitcher in the American League but still lags behind Sale in most statistics.\n\nThe double play going into the weekend\nThe White Sox are playing for pride at this point. Their next opponent is the Boston Red Sox, a team that is unlikely to make the playoffs. Chicago will want to focus its energy on matchups against lower-level teams before having to play Cleveland and San Diego. Prediction:  The Red Sox take all three games of the series.\n\nThe LA Dodgers have been scorching the league lately. The timing is perfect, too, as they need all the momentum they can get for a deep playoff run. The Guardians are at a rough spot in the season, sitting at .500 in their past 20 games. The matchup will be a battle between two of the league\u2019s top-hitting lineups and even has the potential to be a World Series Finals preview. Prediction:  The Dodgers take two of three games.\n\nLast weekend the Diamondbacks and Royals lost their series, moving my prediction total to 7-13-2.\n```"}

Now 11, he\u2019s reading at an eighth-grade level \u2013 three years ahead of where he ought to be. While reading still isn\u2019t his favorite subject, he now enjoys it, especially comic books because of their relatability \u2014 \u201dWe all go through our own stuff sometimes,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Vantzelfden was homeschooled by a tutor, Sara Aguilera. After schools opened up again, the now fifth-grader went back in person but continued studying with Aguilera. \u201cIt\u2019s just so exciting to see him be excited about books,\u201d Aguilera said.\n\nVantzelfden\u2019s case is a standout. The numbers show that kids, especially post-pandemic, are falling behind when it comes to learning to read and write. A 2022 test called the \u201cSmarter Balanced Assessment System\u201d sought to measure how many students could read at grade level in California. It showed scores dropping by an average of 4% since the 2018-19 school year, according to EdSource. Third graders saw the sharpest drop, from 48.5% to 42.1%.\n\nTim Shanahan, former president of the International Literacy Association, said this generation of students will continue to struggle with lower literacy levels, and that these issues will impact other aspects of their adult lives. \u201cIt matters in terms of their future education, you know, how many of them will go in for higher education,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cIt matters in terms of social participation, whether they\u2019re going to vote, whether they\u2019re going to keep up on civic issues.\u201d\n\nVantzelfden\u2019s story shows change is possible. At 2, he was taken in by his great-uncle and aunt, Michael Vantzelfden and Julie Balten, in Mariposa, California. Kash\u2019s parents had drug problems. \u201cWe\u2019ve been raising him ever since,\u201d Michael Vantzelfden said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d\n\nFamily dynamics can be complicated. According to Michael, Kash thought his uncle and aunt had been forced to take him in because he broke a plate. Because of that, he said Kash was always afraid to disappoint them or make a mistake. \u201cWe found that we could not help him with homework. We could not be his teachers,\u201d Michael said.\n\nThe pandemic, he said, made things more problematic when Kash wouldn\u2019t let them help him on the Zoom calls. Seeing his struggles, the Vantzelfdens put an ad on Craigslist and hired Aguilera. She was initially just a tutor for Kash, but he still struggled with Zoom classes. Seeing this, Michael Vantzelfden created his own learning academy, just for Kash. \u201cRelatively quickly [we] gave up public school, hired her [as a] full time teacher, and opened my own school in California, Palm Elementary,\u201d he said. \u201cI was the principal and I had one employee, and that was Sara.\u201d\n\nIn March 2020, as the pandemic was just taking hold, Aguilera founded the LA Literacy Academy. Her approach is to encourage children to read and write, one kid at a time. Each one-on-one session is 55 minutes. \u201cThose years of online learning had a huge impact on that generation of students. So we\u2019ve been playing catch up since,\u201d Aguilera said.\n\nIncreasing the amount of learning and improving the quality of education can play a pivotal role in bridging the educational gaps formed during the pandemic. Individual tutoring is one step toward helping kids. Other paths, Shanahan said, can include \u201cprograms during the school day that intensify the amount of instruction\u201d and summer programs. Michael Vantzlefden added that advocating for your child is just as imperative for learning as getting additional schooling. \u201cKnock on every door you can. Talk to anybody you can. Talk to professional teachers, talk to psychologists,\u201d he said. \u201cYou better believe you need help. Whether you think you do or not, you need help and your child can absorb all the help you can find for them.\u201d\n\nThroughout the pandemic Aguilera worked with Kash, focusing on his reading and writing skills. The most rewarding part about working with the kids is seeing them succeed, Aguilera said. \u201cIt\u2019s the progress, but you don\u2019t see it every day. You know, we\u2019re just dropping seeds and then you look back,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just very exciting to know that he\u2019s doing very well in school. And since I know where he started, the progress was huge.\u201d\n\nNow, Kash is excelling in school and allows the Vantzelfdens to help him with homework. He struggles with dysgraphia, a learning disability that can affect the ability to write, so he receives IEP assistance. IEP, or individualized education programs, help students who need extra support. \u201cThe whole thing has been a miracle you know, I think it\u2019s hard enough just for most kids to learn but what Kash went through, I can get kind of choked up about it,\u201d Michael Vantzelfden said. \u201cTo raise a kid, and especially to raise a kid who had a rough start, it takes a lot of help.\u201d\n\nKash is in the 90th percentile in reading and math. On his most recent report card, he got five As. His favorite subjects are math and art. \u201cI like math because I like to think that I\u2019m pretty good at it. And art,\u201d Kash said. \u201cI like to be creative.\u201d\n\nHe enjoys reading for fun and finished the entire Harry Potter series.

Despite shooting two-under-par better than Scottie Scheffler, Collin Morikawa could not catch up with the world No. 1 at this weekend\u2019s TOUR Championship. The 10-under starting score for the top-ranked golfer gave Scheffler too much of a head start.\n\nThe argument for why the PGA gives golfers different starting scores makes sense from a bird\u2019s eye view, especially for Scheffler and Xander Schauffele, who took a combined three majors this year. The scoring advantage is fair in that it rewards those who perform well across the entire season, but does it ultimately ruin the Championship because it\u2019s exactly that\u2014an advantage?\n\nWe accept certain advantages across the sports world as just. For instance, playing four out of seven games in a playoff series at home is a typical advantage that fans perceive a high-seeded team as earning fairly. Some advantages can be mitigated or evened out, but others cannot. One thing\u2019s clear, though: the PGA\u2019s scoring advantage is of the former and should be taken away or adapted before next year\u2019s playoffs.\n\nGolf is defined by its four major tournaments, and by the conclusion of every season, the large majority of fans only remember who won each major. The Tour playoffs might be the \u201cchampionship\u201d series, but they don\u2019t have anywhere near the same importance and hype as the majors, at least in terms of \u201cnormie\u201d fans tuning in. By the time the playoffs begin, the golfer of the year\u2014in the eyes of the public\u2014is basically already decided because of the majors, giving the playoffs even less meaning.\n\nNot to mention golfers have less of an incentive to treat the majors and the playoffs equally. While the PGA has increased its purses over the years to try and compete with the LIV Tour and make tournaments more enticing for its golfers, the average fan only cares about the same four tournaments every year. Sure, watching the world\u2019s top golfers go at it for three-straight weekends is fun for an intense golf fan, but nothing matches the majors\u2019 pure exhilaration.\n\nThe difference in popularity between the majors and what is supposed to be the championship is exactly why the powers that be must take the playoff scoring advantage away. In majors, anybody can have a solid weekend and hoist the trophy on Sunday. That mentality is exactly why those events are appealing to fans because nobody truly knows who will be in contention that weekend. Wyndham Clark came out of nowhere last year at the U.S. Open. Tiger Woods was not supposed to win the 2019 Masters. The list goes on and on.\n\nThere\u2019s also the viewership to take into account. Some fans may not want to keep track of a three-week playoff series, and it\u2019s easier for them to follow majors because they\u2019re nearly guaranteed to be only four days long. If the PGA removed starting scores, it would give the playoffs a similar feel as the majors. That, combined with the gigantic purse, might provide the playoffs with the intensity it needs to drive attention.\n\nThe PGA needs to get rid of its playoff format also because there have been so many cases of golfers getting cut despite a strong showing. Compared to the majors, which all have a field of 156 golfers (except for the Masters with about 100), the Tour playoffs feature an initial field of 70, from which 50 make the cut, before going down to an eventual field of 30. The drastic difference in field size eliminates so many golf fans\u2019 favorite players.\n\nA simple counterargument is that the playoff format makes sense because golfers advance through rounds based on their performances just like the NBA, NFL and NHL, where teams advance by winning games. But again: if the PGA wants to make its playoffs anything like the majors, the fans have to find it exciting. And with the championship\u2019s relatively small field, the two sets of events will never be on the same level.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Scheffler didn\u2019t deserve his two-shot lead over Schauffele at East Lake this weekend. He\u2019s been the most consistent golfer all year and played his way into that position. The issue is that many assumed he was going to win because if you give the world\u2019s No. 1 player a lead before play even begins, well, where\u2019s the jeopardy that we watch sports for? Scheffler\u2019s dominance could be an anomaly, and keeping the current playoff format does set up well for a non-favorite\u2019s comeback story. But if the PGA wants to make its playoffs anything like a major tournament, they should reconsider the format so that every golfer heads into the final weekend with the same odds.\n```"}

He has since traveled across the country for dozens of speaking engagements, discussing his decision to leave and the history and direction of U.S. foreign policy in Israel.\n\nIn his 11 years working in the role, Paul was often in charge of approving arms transfers to foreign allies. While most transactions involved verifying a country\u2019s human rights record before providing security assistance, investigations into credible allegations against Israel were typically delayed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that [U.S. officials] don\u2019t know, it\u2019s that they haven\u2019t been asking their lawyers, \u2018have there been violations of international humanitarian law using U.S. weapons?\u2019 Paul said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know formally, and they don\u2019t want to know formally, because that would then compel certain actions.\u201d\n\nPaul added it is untrue that Israel would be left \u201cdefenseless\u201d if the U.S. stopped supplying military aid. \u201cWhat it would do is force them to make some hard choices about where the priority actually is,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIs the priority continuing to rain down as many munitions as you possibly can on Gaza, or is it retaining that strategic stockpile in order to defend yourself against the more significant threat of Hezbollah in the north?\u201d\n\nPaul noted that the issue of the U.S.\u2019s role in Gaza has become one of heightened domestic importance. \u201cWhen you see people having job offers recanted, when you see certain forms of speech being shut down, peaceful forms of speech being shut down, there are now genuine domestic questions about civil rights, about freedom of speech, about freedom of association.\u201d\n\nAllison Hartnett, an assistant professor of political science and international relations and Middle East studies, said she faced some pushback when organizing the event. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that this [event] has been popular ... It\u2019s down to individual professors and institutes to bring in speakers that they find compelling, and the amount of support varies,\u201d she noted.\n\nHartnett added that given the tense political climate surrounding the war in Gaza, event organizers prioritized creating a space for civil dialogue amongst a small audience. \u201cI think in an ideal world, it would have been a bigger event,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we\u2019re living in a moment where everyone\u2019s concerned about things like doxxing ... It takes a bit of bravery in this moment to have these types of conversations.\u201d\n\nSaim Hasan, a sophomore computer engineering major, called the discussion \u201cinsightful.\u201d \u201cIt was a perspective that I just wasn\u2019t exposed to before,\u201d Hasan said. \u201cIt sounds like to me that there is a lot of policy in place that should be preventing a lot of these international humanitarian law violations, but what it really boils down to is ... a system that allows for what\u2019s happened to take place.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Annenberg Media after the event, Paul noted how unlike when dealing with other world conflicts in his career, there was little discussion of the long term consequences of \u201c[opening] the taps\u201d on weapons to Israel following Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks.\n\n\u201cI think confronted by the scale of the harm and the inability to do anything whatsoever within the system to shift it, resignation was really the only option,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout a month ago, I went back and I reread the resignation statement I put out when I left, and I think, unfortunately, it still stands. Nothing in the broader context has changed.\u201d\n\nWhile policy within the State Department may remain largely the same since his departure, Paul said he has \u201ca lot of confidence\u201d in today\u2019s youth. \u201cI think that they are less willing to compromise on their values than previous generations,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, they are more willing to listen and to ask questions about their own place in the world ... there\u2019s an incredible amount of talent and passion and energy in today\u2019s students, and I think it\u2019s going to make a difference.\u201d```"}

Los Angeles had a slow start, only scoring 12 points in the first quarter. The team simply couldn\u2019t heat up and didn\u2019t score more than 20 points in each quarter. The loss followed a victory against one of the WNBA\u2019s top teams, the New York Liberty.\n\nThe Dream are looking to steal the eighth playoff spot from the Sky, so winning against the Sparks helped them do that. The Dream came with vengeance to secure the win, because the same day, the Chicago Sky lost their game against the Minnesota Lynx. As for the Sparks, the playoffs seem miles away.\n\nThe Sparks were getting looks all game, but their shots just wouldn\u2019t fall. They shot a measly 37.1% while the Dream shot 45.7%. Their shooting wasn\u2019t the only factor in their loss. They got outrebounded, especially on the offensive end. The Dream had 13 offensive rebounds and the Sparks had seven.\n\nA highlight from the game was Center Li Yueru\u2019s performance, as she posted 14 points and three rebounds. Yueru, a fan favorite, saw more playing time after head coach Curt Miller said that forward Azura Stevens was feeling under the weather. Yueru\u2019s increase in playing time paid off. She did all she could to put a stop to center Tina Charles\u2019 dominant 23-point game. Charles scored 14 of her points in the first quarter. Yueru\u2019s physicality helped put a stop to her shots.\n\n\u201cI tried to be stronger with Tina because she\u2019s a superstar,\u201d Yueru said. \u201cI tried to learn more about how to defend her and how to not let her get rebounds.\u201d\n\nGuard Rickea Jackson had a slow offensive start, but she did put up 13 points for the Sparks, making this the 10th consecutive game in which she recorded double digits. During the game, Jackson eclipsed 400 career points as a rookie. She\u2019s one of only three Sparks rookies to ever do so.\n\n\u201cRickea has put herself in discussion for awards,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt should be mentioned that she is a rising potential star in this league.\u201d\n\nMiller also gave kudos to forward Dearica Hamby for her award potential. \u201cWe can list on one hand people that have improved by nine points or more from one season to another,\u201d Miller said, referring to Hamby.\n\nThe Sparks have some impressive individual talent, but they haven\u2019t been able to put it all together for wins. They\u2019ll look to get it together in their next game against Indiana Fever. LA is 1-1 against the Fever, so it\u2019ll aim to break the tie.

(Photo courtesy of the Los Angeles Dodgers @dodgers)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler\nSeptember 03, 2024 at 2:33 pm PDT\n\nThe LA Dodgers came out on top against the Arizona Diamondbacks in an NL West battle. Both teams showed off electric offenses, tallying 67 runs throughout the series. The Dodgers took Games 1, 2 and 4, which moved them six games ahead of the Diamondbacks for first place in the division.\n\nLA has had issues with good teams in the past, but beating the Diamondbacks the way they did shows that they\u2019re a different team now. They split a series against the Milwaukee Brewers earlier this year, and they have yet to win a series against either the San Diego Padres or the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nThe turnaround the Dodgers have had\u2013beating the Baltimore Orioles and then dominating the Diamondbacks\u2013reassures analysts and fans alike that LA can contend with the top teams in the league. Arizona and San Diego were at one point on the heels of Los Angeles when they were at a weak point in the season, but now the Dodgers find themselves with an extended first-place lead.\n\nAdditionally, both of the trailing teams have fallen back as a result of the Dodgers\u2019 success. The Dodgers have won 20 of 26 games since their last series loss to the Phillies in early August. That streak is likely to continue with the Anaheim Angels next on the calendar.\n\nThe Dodgers bullpen was put to work throughout the four games against Arizona. In Game 1, LA burned through eight pitchers throughout their 10-9 victory. The Diamondbacks nearly came back in the ninth inning when they scored four runs, but Anthony Banda closed out the game and secured the victory for LA.\n\nShohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman and Will Smith all hit home runs, showing the constant firepower that the Dodgers have. The Dodgers continued to fire away in Game 2 as Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freeman hit back-to-back-to-back home runs to start the game.\n\nThe team\u2019s hero was pinch hitter Tommy Edman who hit a two-run single in the top of the ninth inning to give the Dodgers an 8-6 lead. The only hiccup of the series was in Game 3 when LA got lit up for 14 runs.\n\nYoung starting pitcher Justin Wrobleski\u2019s inexperience showed as he allowed ten earned runs on 99 pitches. Wrobleski was likely kept in the game because he needed more experience while also providing much-needed rest for LA\u2019s bullpen.\n\nThe Dodgers\u2019 offense was dormant, only scoring three runs with no homers. The fourth and final game of the series was a show of the Dodgers superstars, as the team dominated the Diamondbacks 11-6.\n\nFreeman hit two home runs and also tallied five RBIs. Ohtani also stole two bases, moving him closer to becoming the founding member of the 50-50 club.\n\nThe Dodgers now look ahead toward the two-game Freeway Series against the Angels.\n```"}

(Photo / Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nSeptember 01, 2024 at 11:58 pm PDT\n\nFaced with the bright lights of Las Vegas, No. 23 USC entered Sunday with many things to prove. The Trojans (1-0) fielded a new starting quarterback, a new defensive coordinator and a changed roster, all while debuting in a new conference. And unlike many other ranked teams, USC didn\u2019t schedule a Group of Five or FCS team in Week 1 but rather bet on itself against an SEC juggernaut.\n\nBut when it was all said and done, the Trojans (1-0) knew that a win against No. 13 LSU (0-1) to begin the new campaign would send a commanding message concerning the lingering question marks surrounding the team.\n\nIn front of an Allegiant Stadium-record-breaking sea of 63,969 spectators, the Trojans not only showed their worth as a new Big Ten program but as a legitimate opponent against one of the nation\u2019s finest. Scoring with eight seconds to go, USC\u2019s 27-20 advantage put the Tigers to rest.\n\n\u201cWe worked really hard throughout the offseason to build an identity of a tough team, of a team that really cares about each other,\u201d said redshirt junior quarterback Miller Moss. \u201cOur identity really shone through throughout the latter part of that game.\u201d\n\nMoss not only flashed his own talented traits but spread the wealth among the team\u2019s plethora of star-studded pass-catchers. Moss dealt throws to 10 different players, with four eclipsing 50 yards. The gunslinger completed 75% of his throws, totaling 378 yards.\n\nOne wideout in particular \u2014 redshirt junior Kyron Hudson \u2014 showed the duality between flashiness and hard-nosed, clutch football. Hudson reeled in an inconceivable one-handed grab in the second quarter, while later putting the Trojans in position to win by picking up a crucial first down with only 13 ticks remaining. Hudson led the team with 83 receiving yards on five catches.\n\n\u201cFootball is football, and we\u2019re the USC Trojans, and we\u2019re gonna come ready to play every single game, whoever it is,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cWe prepared and the outcome came our way.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s lone passing touchdown reminded fans of the connection between Moss and sophomore wide receiver Ja\u2019Kobi Lane present in the 2024 Holiday Bowl. The two converted for a 28-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter, giving the Trojans needed momentum down the stretch.\n\nOn the other side of the football, USC\u2019s run defense \u2014 once considered lackluster and full of gaping holes \u2014 held firm against LSU and its polarizing offensive line unit. Senior linebacker Eric Gentry co-led the Trojans with five tackles but especially made his presence felt in the Tiger backfield, where he notched two tackles for loss.\n\nThe win wasn\u2019t all gravy, though. USC squandered multiple red-zone opportunities, including redshirt senior kicker Michael Lantz missing a 29-yard field goal try as the first half expired. The Trojans also had trouble limiting Tigers fifth-year senior wide receiver Kyren Lacy right from kickoff. Redshirt junior quarterback Garrett Nussmeier found the toe-tapping Lacy to match USC\u2019s opening touchdown in the second quarter, and would target him 10 times for 94 yards.\n\n\u201cWe had some missed opportunities as a football team that we felt like for a while we were outplaying a little bit more than what the scoreboard looked like,\u201d said head coach Lincoln Riley. \u201cWhen there was adversity, we didn\u2019t panic.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 run game wasn\u2019t its strong suit, but it ultimately won them the game. Mississippi State transfer redshirt senior running back Woody Marks scored USC\u2019s first and final touchdowns and eliminated any potential plan for a last-second field goal prayer. Marks\u2019 13-yard go-ahead touchdown run \u2014 as the clock nearly reached zero \u2014 silenced the swarm of purple that populated a portion of Allegiant Stadium.\n\nLSU controlled the ball for six more minutes than USC, but the Trojans showed that playing cerebrally could outweigh time of possession. This was present on the first drive of the game, as although the Tigers converted a fourth-down try in USC territory, they failed to convert on a later attempt on the Trojans\u2019 3-yard line and surrendered possession.\n\nRiley moves to a perfect 3-0 in season openers as USC\u2019s leader, while LSU head coach Brian Kelly suffers his third straight season-starting loss.\n\nNext, the Trojans will face Utah State (1-0) to commence play at home. Although playing a less stacked team than LSU, Moss and company will want to stay on track before Big Ten play begins. USC will host the Aggies on Saturday at 8 p.m. at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum with expectations to stay red-hot.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson\nSeptember 01, 2024 at 3:46 pm PDT\n\nA new college football season is officially underway and USC football is already in need of an upset. The Big Ten Trojans are preparing for their first game of the season against the LSU Tigers, taking their talents to Las Vegas for a Sunday night affair at Allegiant Stadium. The lone college football game on Sunday, this matchup is the third ranked-on-ranked game of Week 1, with the Trojans coming in at No. 23 in the preseason Associated Press Top 25 poll while the Tigers are ranked No. 13.\n\nWith USC coming in as both the ranked and betting underdogs, it will be a tall task for the Trojans to come out for a win \u2014 the higher-ranked team took home the win in the previous two top-25 affairs of the sport\u2019s opening weekend. Still, multiple upsets have already taken place throughout the college football season. No. 10 Florida State fell in its Week 0 matchup, while Vanderbilt upset Virginia Tech and Texas A&M \u2014 the betting favorite despite a lower ranking \u2014 fell to Notre Dame.\n\nThe Trojans will look to achieve the first true ranked-on-ranked upset of the season with a new-look team. The biggest storyline is the fact both teams have new defensive coordinators and both are replacing Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks with redshirt junior signal callers; Miller Moss takes over the Trojan reins and Garrett Nussmeier will now man the Tiger offense.\n\nIn front of a nationally televised audience, both squads will have the chance to debut their revamped rosters, but the world has already had a chance to see the new quarterbacks. Both Moss and Nussmeier showed out in their team\u2019s bowl games at the end of last season, taking home MVP honors in the final game of the season for both programs.\n\nThe bowl games were the first career starts for both slingers, but it was Moss who had the better debut. The new USC starter put up six touchdown passes off of 372 yards and Nussmeier put up three scores and 395 yards. One game is too small of a sample size to determine how good one player truly is \u2014 especially since the opponent has to be taken into account \u2014 but the Trojans seem to have the edge at the position, especially with head coach Lincoln Riley at the helm.\n\nThe defensive side is a different story. While each team\u2019s quarterbacks won a Heisman, and therefore somewhat comparable, there was a much larger gap in between both programs\u2019 defensive units. The pair of defenses were putrid in 2023, but LSU only gave up 28.0 points per game compared to USC\u2019s whopping 34.4. Now each squad\u2019s new defensive coordinators \u2014 D\u2019Anton Lynn for the Trojans and Blake Baker for the Tigers \u2014 will get to show off how much better their defensive units are for 2024.\n\nRiley and USC recently released the squad\u2019s opening-day depth chart, giving a snapshot on who the main contributors might be. The positions of interest, similar to last season, are in the trenches for the Trojans, the offensive and defensive lines. Of note, junior defensive tackle Bear Alexander did not win a starting position outright despite notching 47 tackles last season, tied for the most among returning defensive lineman. Alexander is listed as an \u201cOR\u201d with Wyoming transfer and redshirt senior defensive tackle Gavin Meyer, meaning one of those two will get the starting spot come Sunday.\n\nAlexander was USC\u2019s highest-rated transfer in the 2023 recruiting cycle and despite a relatively strong first season with the Trojans was not able to create separation in fall camp between him and Meyer. While Meyer had a productive career before coming to USC, Alexander has the higher ceiling and will need to produce against a strong LSU offensive line if the Trojans hope to win.\n\nOn the offensive side of the line, USC featured a mix of experience in its opening depth chart. A redshirt freshman or true sophomore will man two of the five spots and redshirt juniors or redshirt seniors occupy the other three slots. Redshirt freshman Elijah Paige will protect Moss\u2019 blind side at left tackle, making it that much more important that he grew throughout his redshirt year. In 2023, Paige was sent to the scout team midway through the season when the coaching staff was frustrated that his progression had stalled.\n\n\u201cHe came back Week 10 or 11 and he was a different player,\u201d offensive line coach Josh Henson said at the team\u2019s in-house media day. \u201cDown there on the scout team, the defensive lines are trying to beat up on every play ... You have two choices: You can take it or you can fight and get better and grow. And he chose to grow.\u201d\n\nIf the offensive line struggles, the Tigers have junior linebacker Harold Perkins Jr., a man with 13 career sacks, at their disposal to wreak havoc. The Trojans have a tough task ahead of them, but with how many unknowns exist between these two things, anything is possible. USC will kick off its season in Allegiant Stadium on Sunday at 4:30 p.m.\n```"}

The brothers were biking in Salem County, New Jersey, on Thursday night, when a drunk driver struck them both, killing them on the eve of their sister\u2019s wedding. Johnny was 31 years old and Matthew was 29.\n\nMatthew spent the bulk of his hockey career in the minors while \u201cJohnny Hockey\u201d led a storied one \u2014 battling doubt and adversity \u2014 with the Calgary Flames and Columbus Blue Jackets after playing collegiately at Boston College, where he earned the Johnny Manziel-inspired nickname.\n\nJohnny\u2019s draft journey was incredible. Originally overlooked because of his 5-foot-6, 137-pound frame, The elder Gaudreau\u2019s first mission was to prove the scoffing scouts wrong. Calgary took a chance on the smallest player in the 2011 draft, picking Gaudreau with the No. 104 selection. But at 17 years old and still a boy among men, he would have to earn his NHL status.\n\nGaudreau grabbed attention by winning the 2011 USHL title with the Dubuque Fighting Saints before joining Boston College. Gaudreau would soon etch his name in BC history by not only helping the Eagles win a national title in 2012 as a newcomer, but averaging a whopping two points per game just two seasons later to take home the 2014 Hobey Baker award as the top college hockey player.\n\nThe Flames didn\u2019t take long to notice his impact and offered Gaudreau his contract the same day he accepted the Hobey Baker. The rest is history.\n\nWhile Gaudreau\u2019s Flames never received deep-playoff glory, the hard-nosed, dazzling left wing made a name for himself with multiple point-per-game seasons and highlight-level offensive production. Gaudreau\u2019s final season with Calgary in 2021-22 put other teams on notice, as the then-28-year-old notched 115 points with 40 goals and 75 assists. His point total only trailed Oilers forward Connor McDavid, confirming Gaudreau\u2019s legitimacy as a scoring forward in the league.\n\nGaudreau would look to build off his success, potentially with a new team, as he became a free agent following the Flames\u2019 second-round playoff loss. To the dismay of Flames fans, Gaudreau chose Columbus as his new home in free agency. His time in Ohio only spanned two seasons and it was primarily during a transition phase for the Blue Jackets, but he was expected to be a mentor for young, up-and-coming players like 2023 No. 3 overall pick Adam Fantilli.\n\nGaudreau joined a historically unsuccessful Columbus bunch hoping to help change the culture. While he won\u2019t be around to continue his leadership on the ice, the Blue Jackets will carry his torch and play in honor of Johnny Hockey.\n\nA seven-time All-Star, Gaudreau proved his worth despite falling far on draft night. His combination of an infectious spirit, cerebral playmaking and shiftiness made him a unique talent with the ability to impact games and get the crowd on its feet.\n\nGaudreau will be remembered as a player who gave it all on the ice. As a shorter player, he was scrappy, creating chances in occasionally unconventional ways. And he won\u2019t be forgotten, not just as a hockey player.

Rising sophomore Maribel \u201cMary\u201d Flores will be among the 25 players called to represent La Selecci\u00f3n at the event.\n\nThe USC forward will help lead Mexico\u2019s attack against Cameroon in the first match of the group stage on August 31. Flores trained with the team until August 19 before heading to Colombia for the tournament. The rising star is no stranger to major tournaments, having worn the Mexico team jersey on the international stage before. Flores previously helped the squad to a U20 CONCACAF Championship in 2023. She also represented El Tri at the 2022 U17 World Cup and the 2022 U17 CONCACAF Tournament where she scored eight goals and had seven assists.\n\nFlores has thrived as a Woman of Troy, netting six goals and five assists as the 2023 Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, earning All-American second team status and leading all freshmen in the conference for scoring. Her 17 total points placed her 11th overall in the league, and her contributions helped the team to the second round of the NCAA tournament, finishing third in the conference behind UCLA and Stanford. Her skills and determination will transfer from the Pac-12 to the Big Ten conference as USC makes the move for the upcoming season.\n\nThe California native from Fullerton made local news when she chose to decommit from Stanford, the school she originally signed with in 2021, to join USC for her freshman season as she continued participating with the Mexican national team. Although she has the skill set and talent to successfully play at the professional level, Flores chose to pursue a college career rather than a professional one straight out of high school.\n\n\u201cI have always had in the back of my head, what would it be like if I just went pro right now and didn\u2019t finish school,\u201d Flores said in a recent interview with The Daily Trojan. \u201cBut my family [and] everyone I talked to is like, \u2018You have to finish school,\u2019 and I think I\u2019m starting to see the bigger picture now. So I will be finishing school because nobody can take away my education.\u201d\n\nWith increasing support and attention towards women\u2019s sports in recent years and the exponential success of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League and La Liga MX Femenil, many young players are forgoing the traditional collegiate path and signing contracts with pro teams. Local NWSL club Angel City F.C. made headlines with record breaking signings of Alyssa Thompson, Gisele Thompson, Casey Phair and Kennedy Fuller who all joined prior to their high school graduations.\n\nFlores will be one of four collegiate athletes on the U20 team, playing alongside three collegiate rivals from UCLA as they work to advance to the knockout stage and beyond. The rest of the squad is composed of players from Liga MX Femenil clubs including Pachuca, Atlas and Club Am\u00e9rica. Flores\u2019s call up gives her the opportunity to showcase the skills she\u2019s built both at USC and on the national level. Her selection is also part of a new shift in the Mexico national team-one that has begun to encompass more Mexican-American players.\n```"}

LA\u2019s offense and defense were both on fire, yet the Dodgers sneaked by one of the AL\u2019s top squads. As Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani nears history as the first player to achieve 45 home runs and 45 steals in a season, the team became the first to reach the 80-win mark. Los Angeles has been on fire lately, winning 14 of their last 19 and mounting a four-game lead over the Arizona Diamondbacks and the San Diego Padres.\n\nThe Orioles were hot at the beginning of the season, but have since simmered. They\u2019ve beaten the teams they\u2019re supposed to, but struggle against the league\u2019s big dogs. The series against the Dodgers was no different. Los Angeles put Jack Flaherty on the bump in Game 1, and he continued his streak of solid pitching with five strikeouts through six innings pitched. However, the Orioles managed to overcome Flaherty, and the Dodgers fell 3-2.\n\nOn Ohtani\u2019s bobblehead night, it was fitting that he hit a 390-foot bomb in his opening at-bat in Game 2. The Dodgers took the lead in the third after a Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez home run and cruised to a 6-4 victory. Game 3 was much of the same. Los Angeles took advantage of a fatigued Orioles starter Cade Povich and jumped to a 5-0 lead by the end of the fourth inning. From there, the Dodgers\u2019 bullpen was able to hold it down. LA reliever Blake Treinen struck out three out of four batters he faced, two of which looking. The Dodgers won the game 6-3, taking the series against a solid AL opponent.\n\nLA is finding its groove at the perfect time. The rest of the season features a mix of opponents who are all across the league standings, giving LA time to rest their starters but also giving them enough of a challenge. The Dodgers\u2019 upcoming series against the Diamondbacks could repeat itself in the first round of the playoffs. Arizona has been scorching hot after the All-Star break, going 27-10. They are now in a top wildcard spot and are not far behind the Dodgers for first in the NL West. Los Angeles is also scheduled to play another dominant NL West team in the San Diego Padres. The Padres are 26-11 since the All-Star break and have quickly become one of the top-hitting teams in the league. The matchup will be an end-of-season test for the Dodgers that will help them prepare for what they will see in October. LA will also play six games against the Colorado Rockies, one of the league\u2019s worst teams. The mix of teams at the end of their schedule should allow the Dodgers to keep their momentum going while adequately preparing them for the matchups they will see this postseason.\n```"}

(Photo/Instagram @LA_Sparks)\n\nBy Mia Nu\u00f1ez August 30, 2024 at 5:02 pm PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 Head coach Curt Miller believed that the Sparks\u2019 key to success against the New York Liberty was having a fighting spirit in them, which they fully accomplished. The Sparks (7-24) were coming off of a seven-game losing streak including a disappointing loss to the Dallas Wings in which they blew a 19-point lead. Because of LA\u2019s woes, the first-place Liberty (26-6) were the favorite to win on Wednesday. Defying the odds, the Sparks won 94-88.\n\nAt practice on Tuesday, Sparks rookie guard Rickea Jackson said that \u201cGoing after [the Liberty] and not being scared of a challenge\u201d was an emphasis for the whole team. An emerging star, Jackson backed her word by scoring 15 points in the first half. The Sparks wanted to redeem themselves after a 35-point loss from their last head-to-head game against the Liberty.\n\n\u201cWe turned them over on the first two possessions of the game and that really set the tone,\u201d Miller said postgame. Those two turnovers piled into 20 total turnovers and were a leading factor in LA\u2019s win. The Sparks scored 29 points off takeaways, giving them the edge against the Liberty for most of the game.\n\nJackson and forward Dearica Hamby combined for 40 points in the Sparks\u2019 victory. But it wasn\u2019t an easy effort for the Sparks because they lost their 9-point lead heading into the end of the fourth quarter. This wasn\u2019t a new occurrence, as the Sparks have struggled with closing out games all season, including against Dallas, as LA lacked the fight that Miller mentioned, but showed it against the Liberty.\n\nJackson started the job and guard Rae Burell finished it. Burell sealed the deal for the Sparks in the fourth quarter when she scored 11 of her 18 points. She was locked in, shooting from the paint, beyond the arc and drawing fouls.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy that my team was able to put me in great positions to get those shots,\u201d Burrell said humbly about her performance.\n\nThe Sparks have been able to beat some of the best teams in the WNBA like the Liberty and the Aces, but haven\u2019t won a game against other struggling teams like the Mystics and Dream.\n\n\u201cDown the stretch, we emphasized that we\u2019ve got to close this game,\u201d Hamby said.\u201dWe\u2019ve got to get stops.\u201d\n\nThe Sparks\u2019 future appears bright as they appear to be incrementally building chemistry. LA looks to keep up its momentum against the Atlanta Dream. In their last matchup, the Dream won 87-74, so the Sparks are seeking redemption and chasing their first win against them this season. Tipoff will be Sunday at 4 p.m. at Crypto.com Arena.\n```"}

One of the most underrated parts of his game, however, is his ability to steal bases, already tallying 42 on the year. Last month, Ohtani joined the 40-40 club and is showing no signs of slowing down. With 29 games remaining in the season, Ohtani will likely become the founding member of the 45-45 club. With 42 steals and 42 home runs, it is only a matter of time before he makes history and joins a club that\u2019s literally his own.\n\nThough Ohtani\u2019s the easy choice for NL MVP, he\u2019s only second in the league in both statistics. Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees has already hit 51 home runs and is likely going to reach the 60 mark for the second time in his career. Cincinnati Reds\u2019 shortstop Elly De La Cruz leads the league in steals with 61, which is especially impressive given that his batting is right at the league\u2019s average.\n\nThe Kansas City Royals are back after a long down period\n\nThe Kansas City Royals have not been the same since their World Series victory in 2015, but the squad has a chance to change things this year. The difference for the Royals has been their hitting, with shortstop Bobby Witt leading the way. They are in the top six for hits, runs and batting average, which has made up for any lapses on the mound. The team is solid on the bump, with Seth Lugo and Cole Ragans holding it down as the teams\u2019 ace starters. Despite giving up greater-than-average hits, the team can lock in defensively, giving up the eighth-least amount of runs. They also give up the second least amount of homers, allowing them to stay in games.\n\nThe Royals are now only one game back from the Cleveland Guardians in the AL Central division. If Kansas City finds a way to surpass Cleveland, they will become the first team to win their division after losing 100 games the year prior. The issue for the Royals is that with a very tough rest of the schedule, it is unlikely that the Royals will win the division, but likely will receive a Wild Card bid.\n\nDanny Jansen plays for both teams in a single game\n\nCatcher Danny Jansen set history last weekend when he became the first player to play for both teams in one game. After a game between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Boston Red Sox was postponed this past June, Jansen was traded from Toronto to Boston. When that game finally resumed this week, Jansen flipped teams and was catching for the Red Sox in an at-bat that he was pinch-hit for. The oddity was a first in baseball history, as Jansen showed up on the scorecard for both teams.\n\nThe double play going into the weekend\n\nOhtani and the Dodgers are barely holding on to their three-game lead in the NL West. What quickly became the top division in baseball is now a fight for first place between LA, the San Diego Padres and the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Dodgers will travel to Phoenix to battle in a four-game series, which could decide who gets a first-round bye. Prediction: The Diamondbacks take three of four games.\n\nThe Royals still have work to do to overtake the Guardians for first place in the AL Central. For now, the team\u2019s main goal should be securing a second-place position in the Wild Card race. The Houston Astros should provide the Royals with a solid first challenge as they tackle the backend of their schedule. Prediction: The Royals and Astros each take two games.\n\nLast weekend the Yankees and Mariners both won their series, moving my prediction total to 7-11-2.\n```"}

(Photo by Elijah Patterson / Annenberg Media File Photo)\n\nBy Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier August 28, 2024 at 6:57 pm PDT\n\nUSC women\u2019s volleyball will take the court on Friday and Saturday for back-to-back matches against the Pepperdine Waves in Malibu for their first matches as Big Ten Conference members. Last season, the Trojans went 19-13 and made it to the second round of the NCAA tournament.\n\nSince the Trojans are in a new conference, head coach Brad Keller has adapted certain aspects of how the Trojans practice and play. Keller, though, was lucky to have more players around this offseason compared to last year, making the transition easier.\n\n\u201cWe kinda just reconstructed our entire system, we play a very different style of volleyball then we did last year,\u201d Keller said. \u201cIt took a lot of time to do that, but right now I like that product of what you see out there at this moment in time.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s reconstructed system will go up against a Pepperdine squad that went 19-9 with a 15-1 mark in WCC play last season. The Waves clinched their conference\u2019s automatic berth in the NCAA tournament, but fell in the first round to Dayton in Pullman, Washington.\n\nBecause Pepperdine has appeared in four of the last five NCAAs under head coach Scott Wong, Keller knows that the Trojans will have their hands full this weekend against the Waves.\n\n\u201cScott Wong and [his] staff at Pepperdine, they do an amazing job every single year,\u201d Keller said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why they\u2019re making the tournament, there\u2019s a reason why they keep winning their conference, there\u2019s a reason that this is happening, so that team is going to be an NCAA tournament team, and maybe a deep run team, so we\u2019re aware of that and excited for the opportunity.\u201d\n\nDespite the challenge that Pepperdine poses to USC, senior setter Mia Tuaniga is confident in her teammates\u2019 abilities to step up and contribute to the team\u2019s success this year.\n\n\u201cI think the team is different in the way that we have more people stepping into different roles and more people coming into leadership spaces, which I think is great,\u201d Tuaniga said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to grow as a program, we\u2019re starting to grow as individuals, which is really nice.\u201d\n\nGraduate outside hitter Ally Batenhorst, who transferred from Nebraska after three seasons with the Cornhuskers, understands the Big Ten and hopes to help her teammates adjust to playing the conference opponents she\u2019s already familiar with.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole different conference and it\u2019s the best volleyball conference in the nation,\u201d Batenhorst said of the Big Ten\u2019s volleyball reputation. \u201cAnd it\u2019s gonna be a lot of different teams and I think just being able to experience those games and experience that type of pressure is gonna really help me lead the team.\u201d\n\nAs USC is preparing for its first matches as a Big Ten member, Keller praised the experience his staff has working for Big Ten programs. This has helped make the transition smoother, as technical coordinator Virgina Pham and associate head coaches Tyler Hildebrand and Spencer McLachlin know the midwest-based conference and its footprint quite well with regards to travel and hotels.\n\nPham spent two years as the director of operations at Penn State, while Hildebrand was at Nebraska prior to joining the Trojans and McLachlin brought his talents over from Indiana. Hildebrand and McLachlin have already been true to their roots in recruiting; Batenhorst is a prime example, coming over from Nebraska, along with graduate outside hitter Grae Gosnell, making the move to USC after four years at Indiana.\n\nRegardless of how this opening weekend goes for USC, Keller knows that playing Pepperdine will help the coaches gauge the Trojans\u2019 progress as they prepare to compete in their new conference.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, whether you win or lose the first match, it\u2019s a long season,\u201d Keller said. \u201cSo being able to figure out where we actually are and where we need to get to and how to get there, kind of a roadmap, a first test is going to be really valuable for us.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans kick off their season on Friday with a 6 p.m. start time at Pepperdine, following that up with a rematch against the Waves the following night at the same time.\n```"}

(AP/Aurelien Morissard) \n\nBy Robert Westermann August 28, 2024 at  6:33 pm PDT\n\nNot more than five days after taking the crown at the Cincinnati Open, Jannik Sinner found himself embroiled in a doping scandal and subsequently parted ways with his trainer and physiotherapist. The timing couldn\u2019t have been worse for the 2024 Australian Open champion, as the U.S. Open began Monday with Sinner among the favorites. Given his dominant performance at Cincinnati earlier this month, he likely would\u2019ve been the favorite. Now, instead of riding the momentum into the final major of the year, he\u2019ll have to play with a scandal in the back of his mind and new coaches by his side.\n\nBut Sinner, now 23, should be old enough to deal with being the center of attention on his own. Throughout his six years on the ATP tour, he\u2019s never been a player known to rely heavily on his coach\u2019s box for encouragement or tactical advice. He plays with a certain stoicism. Sinner\u2019s only moment of celebration in the Cincinnati semifinal against Alexander Zverev was right after match point, when he let out all the emotions pent up from the three-hour, eight-minute battle. The match proved that even with a hip injury\u2014seemingly more serious than initially evaluated\u2014Sinner can and will fight to the very end.\n\nThe similarities between the two are there; hitting winners out of nowhere, having the stamina to play for hours upon hours and surviving rallies that seem to go on forever. Sinner\u2019s energy and playstyle aren\u2019t vastly different from that of fellow youngster Carlos Alcaraz, but unlike his Spanish competitor, Sinner doesn\u2019t show much emotion. Sinner, though, appears to borrow one characteristic in particular from 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic: nobody knows what\u2019s going on inside his head. Djokovic is the type of player that seems invincible on an emotional level. There may be the occasional argument against the umpire or dispute with a line judge, but whether he\u2019s winning or losing, Djokovic almost never gives his opponent the mental edge. Sinner is developing into a player with the same sort of positive arrogance, which he\u2019ll need more than ever in Flushing Meadow.\n\nThe doping scandal itself, however, shows how important it is for athletes to be able to handle themselves while in the public eye. The media surrounds much of their coverage on the most famous athletes because they\u2019re who fans want to see the most. It makes sense from a viewership perspective, but for athletes who haven\u2019t handled that type of attention before, it can be overwhelming and devastating for their careers if they don\u2019t learn how to manage it. Sinner\u2019s fellow Italian and track superstar Marcell Jacobs is a prominent example of this from the last four years. At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Jacobs shocked the field when he took gold in the men\u2019s 100-meter final. As a result, he became a sensation, gaining access to red carpets and featuring in sports documentaries. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with that type of fame and luxury, and Jacobs earned it the hard way. Since then, however, he hasn\u2019t been the same. The more he has opened up his life to the world, the less success he\u2019s had, and the reigning gold medalist failed to reach the podium this summer in Paris. The 29-year-old has perhaps aged out of peak performance, but there\u2019s no arguing that the media attention had something to do with the decline in performance.\n\nIn America, numerous athletes have gone down a similar path. Johnny \u201cFootball\u201d Manziel was going to become the face of the NFL, but external influences and his inability to focus on developing his game got the better of him. Though the reasons behind these athletes\u2019 declines differ, the pressure of being a big name in sports can weigh heavily on an athlete. For Sinner, the popularity won\u2019t be too much for him to handle anytime soon, but instances like the one last week can\u2019t happen too often if he wants to keep a level head. Any unnecessary attention from the media is the last thing he needs when he\u2019s still at a developing point in his career. If Sinner wants to be amongst the greats, his focus needs to rest solely on his game. 2024 is just the beginning for him, and with the way he\u2019s matured over the last few years, fans shouldn\u2019t have to worry about Sinner disappearing anytime soon.\n```"}

(Photo via X/@NHLRussell)  By   Kasey Kazliner August 25, 2024 at  7:36 pm PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Goaltending was never a question mark during the Los Angeles Kings\u2019 Jonathan Quick era, but nearly a year and a half since his departure, the position has been far from a source of certainty. The Kings received All-Star level play from veteran Cam Talbot during the first half of the 2023-24 campaign, but after backup Pheonix Copley suffered a season-ending ACL injury, Talbot was forced to carry the bulk of weight in the crease and encountered an inconsistent spell. Newly acquired backstop Darcy Kuemper and journeyman David Rittich are set to split time in 2024-25, but general manager Rob Blake knew that he would need to look beyond the upcoming season and find a sustainable, long-term option. Thus, he drafted OHL standout  Carter George  in the second round of the 2024 draft and previously built up Los Angeles\u2019 netminder pool through other means. But another young goaltender\u2014Erik Portillo\u2014has risen through the organization\u2019s goaltender ranks, earning him a three-year contract extension to further prove his worth.\n\nPortillo thrived with the AHL affiliate Ontario Reign last season, boasting a 24-11-3 record with a 2.5 goals-against average, a .918 save percentage and two shutouts. Portillo also led the Reign to five playoff victories in which he recorded an outstanding 2.16 goals-against average. The Swedish native first arrived in North America after he was selected by the Buffalo Sabres in the third round of the 2019 draft. He then went on to play for the University of Michigan in 2020-21 and later indicated that he wouldn\u2019t sign with the Sabres, forcing Buffalo to trade him. On the same day that Los Angeles dealt Quick away, the team acquired Portillo in exchange for a 2023 third-round pick.\n\nPortillo\u2019s towering 6-foot-6, 225-pound frame allows him to operate differently than smaller goaltenders. He often keeps a lowered posture to make saves, and in conjunction with his size, he can shed angles without any issue. Erik Portillo ( #GoKingsGo ) makes another big save on the breakaway to keep  @umichhockey  within one of Quinnipiac. #MFrozenFour   pic.twitter.com/70KZ9KZu3d \u2014 EP Rinkside (@EPRinkside)  April 7, 2023\n\nPortillo has a confident demeanor in the crease, almost daring opposing skaters to take shots as he generally stays within the painted area. Because of this trait, he rarely finds himself out of position and can swiftly navigate to the puck by moving easily between the posts. He hardly shows fatigue\u2014even in vulnerable moments\u2014when he gives up a goal or makes a mistake. His wide frame can sometimes hurt his game, as he sometimes misses saves on his pads or through the five-hole. He will also want to improve his awareness following initial shots, which will allow him to prevent rebound chances from finding their way in.\n\nSet to turn 24 in September, Portillo brings experience to the Kings\u2019 prospect pool after spending three seasons at Michigan and adding an AHL campaign to his resume. His biggest tests will be remaining consistent and handling the hefty workload that comes with being a professional. The first year of Portillo\u2019s new deal will carry two-way stipulations. The prospect will likely be the Reign\u2019s starting option in 2024-25, but if he can keep up his stellar figures, he might receive full-time NHL status sooner than expected.\n\nAmid a new era of Kings goaltending, the team is searching for a consistent option to anchor the net. Whether it be Portillo or another up-and-comer that takes the reins, Blake and company will have their eyes on Los Angeles\u2019 prospect pool this season, which consists of multiple promising netminders auditioning to take the role. Portillo\u2019s professional career is just beginning, and if he can continue his upward trajectory, the Kings will greatly benefit from the tall, composed backstop\u2019s progress.\n```"}

In June, a USC student was arrested for fatally stabbing a man who was breaking into a car on Greek Row. Ivan Gallegos, the student, returned home following the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s decision not to charge him in connection with Xavier Cerf\u2019s death. On June 17, Gallegos and two of his friends confronted Cerf, who was inside Gallegos\u2019 roommate\u2019s car. According to the DA, Cerf told Gallegos that he was armed with a gun and reached for his hip. Gallegos stabbed Cerf four times, and Cerf later died from his injuries in an alley off Greek Row. Gallegos was arrested on the night of June 17 and booked on murder charges. DA George Gasc\u00f3n said on June 24 that he believed Gallegos\u2019s actions \u201cwere driven by a genuine fear for his life and for the lives of others\u201d and announced that he would not press charges against Gallegos. Following Gallegos\u2019s arrest, his family started several GoFundMe fundraisers to pay for his $2 million bail. The fundraisers accumulated a combined $10,000 but were removed each time by the platform. Yema Jones, Xavier Cerf\u2019s mother, started a separate GoFundMe to return his remains to his home in Texas and raised $5,600 before the fundraiser ended.\n\nAdministration rolls out discipline against students involved in spring protests\nDPS officers walk past the USC Divest From Death encampment as protesters chant, May 1, 2024. USC\u2019s Office of Community Expectations (OCE) disciplined students this summer who were arrested on April 24 in connection with the occupation of Alumni Park. In interviews with Annenberg Media, students involved in the disciplinary process and the faculty advising them described their interactions with administrators. The occupation was organized by the USC Divest from Death Coalition and included a list demands like a \u201ccomplete academic boycott of Israel,\u201d \u201cfull amnesty\u201d for students involved in pro-Palestinian activism and the \u201cprotect[ion] of free speech on campus.\u201d LAPD arrested 48 students at the occupation, and USC placed at least 29 on interim suspension. According to the Coalition, more than 75 students now face discipline. The students who were suspended in May still remain on suspension and are not allowed on campus, a spokesperson for the Coalition said. Most of the students who were suspended chose a full administrative review process over a \u201cproposed resolution\u201d from OCE. Those processes are \u201cat or near completion,\u201d according to a USC spokesperson. Some disciplined students have been required to write \u201cremorseful\u201d essays, and others who worked as residential assistants who received free housing are unclear about the status of their jobs. Several students are worried because they have been advised by their legal counsel that the essays could be used as evidence in a criminal case brought by the LAPD. One student was told that the LAPD had up to a year to bring charges for criminal trespassing.\n\nPopular stores and restaurants close, others open\nThe entrance of Yoboseyo Superette, a new boba shop and Asian market in the USC Village owned by the same couple as Cafe Dulce. The storefronts of the USC Village continued to shuffle during the summer months. Stout, a burger pub, and Pizza Please, the Village\u2019s only pizza joint, closed after short tenures \u2014 less than two years of serving customers. Also gone is Workshop Salon + Boutique, a spot for haircuts and blowouts; the space was converted into storage for the neighboring Target. Meanwhile, the units previously occupied by Honeybird, a Southern-style breakfast and lunch eatery, and the Sammiche Shoppe remain vacant. Some empty spaces have been filled, though. The international beauty giant Sephora opened a Village location on July 26, moving into a unit that had been uninhabited since 2019 (its previous tenants had sued USC after moving out). Yoboseyo Superette, an Asian market with an original location in Little Tokyo, moved into the village as a \u201csister concept\u201d to Cafe Dulce on July 20. The store serves specialty boba drinks and snacks and is located next to the USC Roski Eye Institute. Students may also mourn the loss of Study Hall, a sports bar and restaurant that permanently closed just before its tenth anniversary. Its space on the corner of Hoover Street and West 29th Street has already been filled by Roadside Taco, a Mexican restaurant.\n\nTrojan Olympic performance\nJunior midfielder Croix Bethune (7) goes for the ball during USC's Nov. 5 match against UCLA. Trojan athletes won a combined total of 15 medals at the 2024 Summer Olympics. USC saw 65 athletes compete in Paris, which was more than any other U.S. university, but the Trojans came in fourth place for medals among American universities \u2014 it was beaten by Texas, California and Stanford. USC athletes earned seven gold medals and took silver in two events. Still, the 15-medal total is the lowest Summer Games showing from the Trojans this century. Standout athletes included Rai Benjamin, a USC track and field star who won two gold medals for Team USA, along with TeeTee Terry, Aaron Brown and Andre de Grasse, who are also track and field athletes who carried their teams to gold victories. Anni Espar, who played women\u2019s water polo for Spain, and Croix Bethune, an American women\u2019s soccer player, also won gold for their countries. If USC were its own country, it would have placed sixteenth at the Olympics. You can also read Annenberg Media\u2019s profiles of the Trojans who competed in water polo, track and field, swim and dive, and other teams including volleyball and rowing.\n\nShake-ups in the university\u2019s top administration\nStacy Giwa, USC's new interim senior vice president of human relations. Although President Folt\u2019s time at USC will continue, other senior administrators have left the university. Folt announced on June 14 that Felicia Washington, the university\u2019s first senior vice president of human resources, would leave at the end of August. Washington\u2019s appointment in 2019 was significant. Under her tenure, she united several offices \u2014 the Office for Equity, Equal Opportunity, and Title IX, the Office of Professionalism and Ethics and the Office of Culture, Ethics and Compliance \u2014 into a larger human resources department. She also was responsible for implementing \u201cTyndall-related requirements,\u201d according to Folt\u2019s announcement. Washington will lead human relations at the University of Pennsylvania. Stacy Giwa, the vice president of culture, ethics and compliance will start the role of interim vice president on October 1. Washington\u2019s departure follows Provost Guzman\u2019s May 29 announcement that Amber Miller would step down as dean of Dornsife College to lead the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. Miller, an experimental astrophysicist, was the longest-serving dean of Dornsife since the 1950s and led the college through \u201csome of the most challenging times in the university\u2019s history,\u201d according to USC Dornsife. Moh El-Naggar, a physicist and Dornsife professor, filled Miller\u2019s spot as interim dean on June 15. Kedra Ishop, the vice president for enrollment management, left her position on August 15 to join the College Board in a higher education role. In her previous role, Ishop managed university admissions, registrar\u2019s offices and financial aid. She was also an adjunct associate professor in the Rossier School of Education. Ishop\u2019s tenure was notable for offering USC\u2019s Affordability Initiative, which awards free tuition to first-year undergraduate students whose families make $80,000 or less each year. Timothy Brunold, USC\u2019s former dean of admission, now serves as interim vice president for enrollment management.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of the New York Yankees)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler\nAugust 23, 2024 at 9:50 am PDT\n\nMariners fire manager Servais\n\nThe Seattle Mariners have been tumbling down the AL West leaderboard since June. Despite a 10-game advantage, they\u2019ve gone 12-18 since the All-Star break and are now five games behind a hot Houston Astros team. They are a top pitching squad in the league, but the team can\u2019t find ways to keep up offensively. They have the worst batting average and the fewest hits in the league, in addition to striking out more often than the rest of the league. Their struggles in the batter\u2019s box level out any defensive advantage the team has.\n\nIn an attempt to change things up, the front office fired manager Scott Servais during his ninth season with the program. His temporary replacement is Dan Wilson, who has been in the organization\u2019s minor league system for 13 years. Although it is more likely an issue with the team itself instead of the manager, fans hope that Wilson can light a spark in the team and push them toward an unlikely playoff appearance.\n\nStarting pitchers may see longer on-field stints\n\nThe MLB recently discussed a new rule that would require starters to stay in the game longer which has caused mixed reviews. Some think it\u2019s important to keep the role of starting pitcher alive, but the six-inning rule is not the way to do it. Starting pitchers\u2019 roles have started to diminish in recent years, with relievers taking over earlier and teams going to the bullpen more often. Kansas City Royals starter Seth Lugo said that most starters want to be relieved early on in games, but it just doesn\u2019t work out like that most times.\n\nTo combat this, the rule that the league proposed would require starting pitches to throw a mandatory six innings. The only exceptions to the rule are if a pitcher throws more than 100 pitches, lets up four runs in an inning or gets injured. This proposal is yet another attempt by the league to make the game of baseball more appealing to viewers. Higher pitch counts result in more fatigue, allowing batters to hit the ball more often. For players, though, the potential new rule may put too much strain on starters\u2019 arms.\n\nThe new pitch clock is one rule that affects a pitcher\u2019s arm, decreasing the time of rest and increasing the activation time of the muscles. The reduced pitch clock has resulted in more Tommy John injuries. Another rule is the sticky-stuff rule. The MLB cracked down on pitchers using illegal substances, which forced most pitchers to change their style in the middle of the season, putting even more strain on the arm.\n\nJudge continues to chase 60 home runs\n\nAL MVP frontrunner Aaron Judge is chasing history yet again. Earlier this month, Judge became the quickest player to hit 300 home runs, and looks to become the third player to hit more than 60 home runs in consecutive years. If Judge were to achieve these feats, the Yankee would cement himself as one of the greatest hitters of all time beside fellow 60 home-run hitters Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire. Judge separates himself from Sosa and McGwire in the fact that the latter two had steroid allegations throughout their entire career, especially during their peak seasons. Sosa was not officially caught doing illegal substances, but his build and power raised many eyebrows. McGwire eventually came clean about his steroid usage.\n\nThere is a lot of ball left to play, but given how Judge is already at 48 home runs with 24 games left to play, he\u2019s well on his way. The double play going into the weekend\n\nJudge and the New York Yankees have a home series scheduled against the Colorado Rockies. The key for Judge throughout these games will be to pass the 50-home run marker and move closer to history. With a tough finish to the season, it is imperative that Judge can move forward now.\n\nPrediction: The Yankees will sweep the Rockies.\n\nWith Wilson now at the helm, the Mariners need to start winning if they want any hope of a playoff bid. As a team that historically chokes toward the ends of the season, it is a very big stretch for the Mariners to play in October. A home series win against the San Francisco Giants, however, would do wonders and give the team momentum heading into an easy stretch of their schedule.\n\nPrediction: The Mariners win two of three.\n\nLast weekend the Reds and Guardians both lost their series, moving my prediction total to 5-11-2.\n```"}

(Photo by Wesley Chen)\n\nBy Daniel Palmore August 22, 2024 at 4:03 pm PDT\n\nThroughout USC\u2019s disappointing outing in the 2023 season, miscues defined a majority of the Trojans\u2019 struggles, especially on the defensive side of the ball. The defense allowing big plays because of blown coverages was the main reason why the unit surrendered a staggering 35 points per game, second to last in the Pac-12 a season ago. To fix this glaring issue, USC fired defensive coordinator Alex Grinch during the season and hired the former defensive coordinator for the UCLA Bruins, D\u2019Anton Lynn. In his one and only season as UCLA\u2019s defensive coordinator, the Bruins allowed the fewest yards per game in the Pac-12 with 299 and the fewest points, allowing just 18 per game.\n\nSo far in practice, USC\u2019s defenders have noticed the differences in playing defense under Lynn and the former defensive coaching staff. \u201cNot having to overthink or worry about doing your assignment is the biggest thing,\u201d senior linebacker Eric Gentry said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s way more straightforward this year, more NFL style.\u201d\n\nIf USC\u2019s defense is going to improve in the Trojans\u2019 inaugural season in the Big Ten, Gentry is a player that will be relied upon heavily. Gentry\u2019s durability will be critical for the Trojans as his numbers from last season were down across the board compared to his 2022 season after appearing in only eight games in the regular season. Gentry\u2019s unique physical traits make him one of the most versatile players on the Trojans\u2019 defense. Standing at 6-foot-6, Gentry has a 7-foot-1 wingspan which makes it difficult for opposing quarterbacks to fit passes into areas he is covering.\n\nGentry believes the new player-coach dynamic for USC will be able to help him maximize his potential this season. \u201cIt\u2019s an open book for both of us,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cCoaches listen to what the players have to say and players completely understand what the coaches have to say.\u201d\n\nHeading into this season, the Trojans have also been building up their on-field chemistry by spending more time with each other away from practice. Redshirt sophomore safety Kamari Ramsey makes it a priority to build a strong rapport with his teammates outside of the game of football. \u201cNot everything\u2019s about football, it\u2019s just a game,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just been spending time with each other, going to each other\u2019s houses and just doing things outside of football that don\u2019t relate to football.\u201d\n\nRamsey, who played his first two seasons of college football at UCLA, followed Lynn to USC to help bolster the Trojans\u2019 secondary. Last season for the Bruins, Ramsey recorded 40 total tackles, four pass breakups and one interception in 11 games. The former Bruin believes a critical piece to his improvement this upcoming season will be more trust in himself and his abilities to master Lynn\u2019s defensive scheme. \u201cLast year, I caught myself hesitating sometimes,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cPlays I knew I could make I didn\u2019t make so I kind of left a few of plays on the table, but this year I\u2019m trusting myself.\u201d\n\nAlong with Ramsey, other players followed Lynn to USC, including redshirt senior cornerback John Humphrey. Last season, Humphrey was tied for second on the Bruins\u2019 defense in interceptions and notched two forced fumbles. Humphrey also had three pass breakups and 22 solo tackles. It was a big offseason for Humphrey, who had a \u201clittle procedure\u201d that caused him to miss the majority of spring camp, according to head coach Lincoln Riley. Humphrey has recovered, slotting in as a consistent participant in fall camp and is ready for the beginning of the season. \u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty good and I\u2019m just trusting the process,\u201d Humphrey said. \u201cMy mind was always still in the game. It was about knocking off the rust for me, and I still am until game one.\u201d\n\nWith kickoff less than two weeks away, the Trojans\u2019 confidence in their new scheme and coaching staff should give USC fans reason to be optimistic about the season. No. 13 LSU will be a big test for the Trojans on September 1 and a great opportunity for USC to showcase its new scheme and stronger chemistry.\n```"}

(Photo by Wesley Chen)\n\nBy Harrison Fuller August 22, 2024 at 3:57 pm PDT\n\nCaleb Williams is gone to the NFL. Is this the end of an era? Many posed the same question when Keyshawn Johnson left. They did the same when Reggie Bush and Matt Leinart departed. From the John McKay-led Trojans in the 1960s, to the current team led by Lincoln Riley, USC has always been a team that is likely to be at the top of the college football rankings. The storied program has had 16 undefeated seasons and nine perfect seasons in its history while its 70% winning percentage is seventh all-time in the FBS. USC has ruled the west.\n\nHistorically, fans believed that nothing could get in the way of the Trojan legacy in college football. But new concerns have risen as the Trojans enter the Big Ten conference in 2024. Analysts have speculated that USC\u2019s play in the trenches and their linebacking corp will hold them back in the Big Ten.\n\nDespite the criticism, Trojan head coach Lincoln Riley still has his eyes on the prize. \u201cOur goal has been to come here and win national championships. That\u2019s been the goal,\u201d Riley said in an interview with CBS Sports analyst Adam Breneman. \u201cTo do that you have to be good enough to beat everybody, including Big Ten teams and anybody else.\u201d\n\nThe earliest, and possibly biggest test for the Trojans this season, is when they head to Ann Arbor in Week 3 to face the reigning national champion, Michigan. Both teams have come up in conversations about who has lost the most assets heading into next season. USC lost its Heisman trophy-winning quarterback, along with two solid pass catchers from last year in Tahj Washington and Brenden Rice. Michigan, compared to USC, lost much more since last year. The Wolverines lost the most valuable asset a team can lose \u2014 their head coach Jim Harbaugh, who left for the Los Angeles Chargers\u2019 job. Not only is Harbaugh gone, but so is Michigan\u2019s quarterback JJ McCarthy, their leading rusher Blake Corum and five key players from their defense.\n\nThis matchup will be a true evaluation of whether the Trojans can bounce back from losing a star player. It\u2019s a good thing USC has already proven to be very good at that. When Reggie Bush left for the NFL after his illustrious career at USC, the feeling with Trojan fans was that USC was done for. Not only were they losing their Heisman-winning running back, but they were also losing their Heisman-winning quarterback, Matt Leinart.\n\nAfter going 12-1 in 2005 with their only loss coming to Texas in the Rose Bowl, the Trojans rebounded to heights no one could have predicted. Led by quarterback John David Booty, they went 11-2 and bested Michigan in the Rose Bowl. But they didn\u2019t just win one Rose Bowl after Bush and Leinart left \u2014 they won the next three between 2007 and 2009.\n\nAlthough they might seem similar at first sight, the 2006 USC team and this squad going into next year do have one stark difference; defense. The teams of the early 2000s were known not only for their explosive offenses but also their tough, reliable defenses. Players like Troy Polamalu, Brian Cushing, and Rey Maualuga anchored those defenses and helped keep the Trojans atop the defensive rankings in college football.\n\nThe 2023 Trojans, on the other hand, finished near the bottom of the FBS in yards allowed and total defense. Even with their electric offense led by Caleb Williams, the defense hindered the team as a whole\u2019s success and the Trojans finished the season with an 8-5 record, and being left out of the final AP Top-25 poll.\n\nSo even though both the 2006 team and the 2024 team suffered major losses from the year prior and were looking to rebound, defensive play will be a major factor in if the Trojans want to improve as a whole in 2024.\n\nBut even though the times look rough right now, I think USC will still be USC, finding ways to beat the odds and win.\n\nThe Birth of a Dynasty\n\nIn the 1950s, USC couldn\u2019t find any stability in the coaching realm, having three different coaches throughout the decade. They wanted to get back to the dynasty they had in the 1930s, where they won two national championships. To do this, they looked to an unknown assistant coach by the name of John McKay.\n\nMcKay came into the 1960 season with fairly high expectations, as the Trojans accumulated an 8-2 record the year before under head coach Don Clark. But McKay\u2019s first season couldn\u2019t have gone much worse than it did. The first-year head coach\u2019s team lost embarrassingly to conference rivals like Washington and Oregon State, suffering shutout losses to both.\n\nYear two wasn\u2019t much better. The Trojans eked out a 4-5-1 record that included a 0-0 tie against Washington. But year three is when the McKay-led Trojans turned the corner and never looked back. They went an astounding 11-0 and won their first national championship since 1932.\n\nMcKay went on to coach at USC for 16 seasons, producing three more national championships and USC\u2019s first two Heisman winners, Mike Garrett and O.J. Simpson. Then, finally, in 1976, McKay handed the reins to John Robinson as McKay left to become the first head coach of the NFL\u2019s newest expansion team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nRobinson continued the dynasty, adding another national championship to USC\u2019s trophy case, along with two more Heisman winners, Charles White and Marcus Allen. But those two would be USC\u2019s last Heisman winners for a very long time. The Trojans would have to wait until 2002 to see another one of their own hoist up the prestigious award.\n\nThe Pete Carroll Era\n\nIn 2000, USC hired Pete Carroll to be its head coach after the three-year disaster that was the Paul Hackett regime. Carroll had been a coach in the NFL for some time, but had never found lasting success at the professional level.\n\n\u201cMy style of football ... I have always taught an aggressive, attacking style,\u201d Carroll said in his opening press conference after being hired in December 2000.\n\nAnd attack Carroll did. In his second season coaching the Trojans, Carroll led them to an 11-1 season and an Orange Bowl victory. Not only that, but his quarterback, Carson Palmer, won the Heisman.\n\nEven though a season with a single loss doesn\u2019t seem like there is much room for improvement, Carroll and USC did one better in 2003. The Trojans bested Michigan in the Rose Bowl and took home the national championship for the first time since the John Robinson era.\n\nCarroll continued this dominant era, accumulating another national championship the very next year in 2004. Even with all of his success as a coach, Carroll did have some heartbreak. In the 2005 Rose Bowl, the No. 1-ranked Trojans faced No. 2-ranked Texas. It was Leinart and Bush versus Vince Young, the three Heisman finalists that season.\n\nEven before the game started, the crowd knew it would be one for the ages. Although USC fans were excited to see if Bush and Leinart could lead the Trojans to the promised land as one last ride before they were off to the NFL, there was a looming sense of sadness knowing that dynamic duo put on cardinal and gold ever again.\n\nLeinart and Bush were some of the most exciting players college football had ever seen up to that point. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know what kind of play was going to come next ... Anything is possible with [Leinart and Bush],\u201d said JaBari Brown, a director of undergraduate advisement at USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.\n\nBut that night in Pasadena, not everything was possible for the Trojans. Texas\u2019 Young dashed to the corner of the endzone for a touchdown with 20 seconds left to win the natty for the Longhorns.\n\nTrojan fans couldn\u2019t even imagine what 2006 was going to be like without a national championship, without Leinart and without Bush. But even after all those losses, Carroll kept the Trojans on top. The Trojans did not have a season with under nine wins for the rest of the Carroll regime.\n\nCarroll had such an extraordinary resum\u00e9 while at USC, that he caught the attention of the NFL. He went on to leave USC for the Seattle Seahawks in 2010 just as the NCAA laid down sanctions on the Trojans that left the program crippled for the start of the 2010s.\n\nSince then, the Trojans have had five different head coaches and haven\u2019t had a star to the same caliber of Bush. Until a transfer by the name of Caleb Williams came into town in 2022.\n\nThe Current Era: Questions About the Big Ten\n\nTypically, USC\u2019s dynasties have had both a Heisman winner and a team that performed well. Unlike almost any other time in history, the 2022 USC team had a Heisman winner in Williams, but failed to finish in the top-5 teams in the Associated Press Top 25 Poll. The only other time this has happened for the Trojans was when Marcus Allen won the Heisman trophy in 1981, but the Trojans finished the season ranked No. 14 in the poll.\n\nNow, USC\u2019s Heisman winner is gone and they\u2019re coming off an 8-5 season in 2023. Not only that, they will move out of the Pac-12 into the Big Ten, known for its tough teams like Michigan and Ohio State.\n\nAnalysts have questioned whether the Trojans can keep up with the Big Ten\u2019s \u201ccorn-fed boys,\u201d as former NFL wide receiver, USC alum and now Fox Sports personality Keyshawn Johnson puts it.\n\nIn the 2024 NFL Draft, the Big Ten produced a far majority of offensive lineman compared to the Pac-12. But historically, USC has been a school that has produced high quality NFL lineman, including Bruce Matthews, Anthony Mu\u00f1oz and Tyron Smith.\n\nIf the Trojans can summon the legacies of these past greats, they should be able to keep up with the Michigans and the Iowas when it comes to the trenches next season.\n\nUSC will definitely have an adjustment period with its move to a new conference, but Big Ten play won\u2019t be all that different from what they already experienced in the Pac-12. In the final AP Top 25 rankings of the 2023 season, the Pac-12 and the Big Ten were represented equally, both putting three rankings into the rankings.\n\nBut USC will be joined by some of its former Pac-12 opponents in the Big Ten this year. Oregon, Washington and UCLA are coming along with them, as the Huskies and the Bruins are on the schedule this year.\n\nSo, really, USC has already gotten a taste of what some of its Big Ten competition will look like. With that being said, Big Ten powerhouses like Michigan and Penn State are on USC\u2019s schedule this year.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, the Trojans have all they need to put up a fight against their new conference foes for years to come.\n```"}

His replacement, D\u2019Anton Lynn \u2014 poached from crosstown rival UCLA \u2014 promised a new, more normal approach for the upcoming season. When asked of his top priorities defensively, Lynn simply said \u201cstopping the run and affecting the quarterback.\u201d That may seem like a boring answer, but it marks a shift from the Grinch era, who focused more on forcing turnovers than working on the fundamentals.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t look at takeaways defensively as being the extra,\u201d Grinch told reporters ahead of the 2022 season, his first with USC. \u201cWe look at that as the sole purpose why we take the field.\u201d That worked, to an extent, in his first year with the Trojans. Grinch\u2019s group forced the ninth-most turnovers in the FBS. It only resulted in the No. 94 scoring defense, but it gave the Trojan offense good field position on route to an 11-3 record and NY6 Bowl berth. There was room to grow, but also a potential proof of concept.\n\nIn 2023, however, the wheels fell off. Turnover production regressed, with USC generating the 27th-fewest turnovers in college football. That drop in turnovers coincided with a jump in points allowed \u2014 to more than 34, the thirteenth most in the country. The Trojans dropped to an 8-5 record.\n\nWhile his goals were not the most specific, Lynn did give some indications as to what his defense would look like. Lynn comes from the dual-Harbaugh tree of defensive coordinating. In 2021, Jim Harbaugh\u2019s Michigan poached safeties coach Mike MacDonald from John Harbaugh\u2019s Baltimore Ravens to run the Wolverines\u2019 defense. The next year, MacDonald returned to the Ravens, but Michigan kept a similar system in place with new DC Jesse Minter who had also worked under John Harbaugh already. The system has been highly successful. Michigan made the playoffs in MacDonald\u2019s one year with the team and won the national championship under Minter, who has since followed Jim Harbaugh to the Los Angeles Chargers. MacDonald\u2019s system worked well enough in Baltimore that he became Pete Carroll\u2019s successor as head coach of the Seattle Seahawks. Lynn has already shown that his version of the system is successful, elevating UCLA\u2019s defense from 42nd worst to 14th best.\n\n\u201cThe scheme has enough flexibility in it that, in my opinion, when I watch people who come from this scheme, it looks like we all run different schemes,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cWhen I watched Michigan last year, it doesn\u2019t look like UCLA. When I watch some Baltimore stuff, that looks different than Michigan and I\u2019m sure Seattle\u2019s stuff is gonna look real different. So everyone kind of has their own twist on it.\u201d\n\nWhat does that scheme entail? Lynn discussed his desire to throw the kitchen sink at the quarterback. \u201cWe\u2019d like to blitz. We play aggressive, we call the game aggressive,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to do it no matter what.\u201d New defensive backs coach Doug Belk sounded excited at that prospect. \u201cIt all starts with the quarterback and as much as we can affect the quarterback on a down in and down [out] basis,\u201d Belk said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s blitzes and disguises or playing coverage, that gives us in the secondary a greater chance to be successful.\u201d\n\nAlthough blitzing takes players out of coverage, Belk expressed that the trade-offs \u2014 that the ball has to come out sooner and the offense\u2019s route tree is therefore less diverse \u2014 more than made up for that negative.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the scheme that\u2019s changing. Only defensive line coach Shaun Nua returned from last year\u2019s staff, serving as co-interim defensive coordinator after Grinch\u2019s firing. The new-look Trojan defensive staff has a wide range of experience. New linebackers coach Matt Entz went 60-11 as the head coach at North Dakota State in the FCS, winning two national championships in four years. Belk was the defensive coordinator at Houston for three years before coming to USC. Defensive line coach Eric Henderson held the same position with the Rams, also serving as the run game coordinator.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an information guy. I want information from as many places as I can get it. Whether that\u2019s a former head coach like Entz or whether that\u2019s a [graduate assistant],\u201d Lynn said. \u201cI think good ideas come from everywhere and if you want to grow as a coach, you can\u2019t block yourself off the ideas from other people\u201d\n\nBelk echoed the value of the experience in the defensive coaching room. \u201cBeing able to learn from a bunch of veteran guys like coach Entz, who\u2019s been a coordinator and a head coach, coach [Henderson] who\u2019s been in the NFL for a long time, coach Nua, who\u2019s been at a lot of different college stops and, ultimately, coach Lynn,\u201d Belk said. \u201cIt\u2019s helping me grow as it\u2019s helping our players grow.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s room for USC\u2019s defense to improve on last year\u2019s performance. It will face a tough first challenge, though, when the Trojans open the season against No. 13 LSU in Las Vegas on September 1.\n```"}

With just two months left in the regular season, Los Angeles is still trying to figure out their ever-changing pitching rotation. River Ryan, who made his big league debut earlier this year, is out for the season and will undergo Tommy John surgery. The young star let up very few runs, primarily by forcing ground and fly outs with his dynamic arsenal. Tyler Glasnow joins Ryan on the injured list with elbow tendinitis and would like to avoid visiting Tommy John for the second time in his major league career. Yoshinobu Yamamoto has been out since June and is yet to play in a minor-league rehab game. His high speed fastballs and devastating breaking balls was a backbone for the Dodgers, and he quickly garnered six wins early in the season. The Padres and the Arizona Diamondbacks are two of the other teams that make up the dominant NL West, and they are clearly visible in the Dodgers\u2019 mirror. The pressure is on LA to keep winning games, but by playing their stars night after night, the team has been riddled with injuries. Game 1 was a high-scoring affair, as Los Angeles came out on top 7-6. Kevin Kiermaier, who was traded to the Dodgers just before the deadline earlier this season, had a solid performance with four RBIs and his first home run in the blue and white. The Cardinals got the best of the Dodgers in Game 2, falling 5-2. Los Angeles was outhit 11-4, and managed just seven bases in the game. LA\u2019s Shohei Ohtani hit a home run, which was one of the few bright spots for the Dodgers. LA first-baseman Freddie Freeman left the game early after bruising his finger on a ground ball, but luckily his X-rays showed no fracture and he won\u2019t be out long. The Dodgers\u2019 pitching held down a 2-1 win in Game 3. LA starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw had been disappointing up until Sunday, but he\u2019s now headed in the right direction after two combined great starts.  His six-inning, 70-pitch display showed that he is both on a pitch cap and a strict-inning cap. Ohtani also added another homer on top of his Game 2 bomb, moving his season total to 39. Dodger fans still dream of a truly healthy squad. If all the stars align correctly, the team may be at full strength come October. As far as pitchers go, reliever Blake Treinen is working his way through a rehab stint in Double-A. He faced three batters this past Saturday, striking out all of them. Another reliever, Brusdar Graterol, is set to throw a bullpen session soon. After returning to the Major Leagues earlier this month, he quickly reinjured himself with a hamstring strain. Starting pitchers Glasnow and Yamamoto will return at an undisclosed time later this season, which will fill any gaps left in the starting rotation. There are numerous position players who are returning soon as well. Shortstop Tommy Edman will be activated from the IL within the next few days. The former Cardinal will provide great depth in the field and be another powerful hitter. Third-baseman Max Muncy will join the squad very soon as well. His oblique injury, which put him on the 60-day IL, has since been dealt with and he hopes to jump back into the lineup. Muncy has been a threat in the batters box every year for LA. The added support to Ohtani and Freeman will easily make LA\u2019s lineup the best in the league. Known for his playoff performances as a Dodger, Chris Taylor is still going through his rehab assignment for a groin injury last month. Although he struggled early this season, he is still a great asset to the team when it comes to postseason time. The Dodgers now face a top-pitching squad in the  Seattle Mariners.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of the Los Angeles Dodgers @dodgers)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler\nAugust 17, 2024 at 5:15 am PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 The LA Dodgers\u2019 explosive offense got back on track against the Brewers with Mookie Betts back in the lineup. The versatile Betts has played all over the field for the Dodgers this season, which has come in handy with all the team\u2019s injuries. Betts didn\u2019t need much time to get used to the batter\u2019s box, either, hitting a two-run homer in his second at-bat in the series.\n\nThe only difference between pre-and post-injury Betts is his position in the batting order. Normally the Dodgers\u2019 lead-off hitter, Betts has taken a back seat to DH Shohei Ohtani. Also a speed demon, Ohtani has the third most steals in the league at 35 and has only been caught four times.\n\nWith third-baseman Max Muncy returning soon, the batting order will quickly become the deepest in the MLB. With their newly-added depth, the Dodgers showed off on both sides of the ball in a 5-2 Game 1 victory. Clayton Kershaw was the star in Game 1, reinstating confidence in Dodger fans after he was spotty in his first couple of starts back from injury. He finished with six strikeouts, one run and three hits, nearly making it six innings. The Dodgers did well clearing the bases, leaving only four players on.\n\nGame 2 was a 7-2 no-doubter. Will Smith, Ohtani and Gavin Lux all hit home runs, while the team recorded 13 hits and 28 bases. Gavin Stone and Landon Knack held it down on the mound, and the two pitchers threw for a combined eight strikeouts on six hits.\n\nThe Dodgers struggled offensively in Game 3. The 5-4 loss was rare, with no Dodgers hitting any home runs. The bright spot in the loss was pitcher Walker Buehler, who returned from the injury list and threw three-and-a-third innings. He struggled during his first appearance in nearly two months, walking four and giving up four runs, though only one was earned.\n\nGame 4 was a near-repeat of Game 3, where the Dodgers could not hit a home run despite ten hits. Starting pitcher Jack Flaherty continued to do well in a 6-4 loss, striking out seven batters in five innings. Second-baseman Lux is also showing promise, going two-for-three with a walk.\n\nAs the fourth quarter of the season begins, the NL West has defined itself as the best in the MLB. The 71-51 Dodgers are being hunted down by the Arizona Diamondbacks and San Diego Padres, who have both won nine of their last ten games. All three teams have been blistering hot since the All-Star break: LA going 15-10, Arizona 20-5 and San Diego 19-4. San Diego has the most manageable schedule going into October, with the Dodgers having a tough stretch before ending with six games against the Rockies. The Diamondbacks also have a very tough road ahead and finish the season against the Padres. Each team has its work cut out before the playoffs, but the Dodgers\u2019 two-game cushion should be enough to keep the top spot.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of the Cleveland Guardians @cleguardians)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler August 16, 2024 at 5:37 am PDT\n\nPaths for Wild Card hopeful teams\n\nThe MLB playoff race is going to come down to the wire. Several top teams have separated themselves from the pack, but Wild Cards in both divisions are up for grabs entering the final quarter of the season. The Cleveland Guardians, Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee Brewers have all essentially punched their ticket into the postseason. Each team has decisive control over their respective divisions, with the Brewers holding the biggest lead at eight-and-a-half games.\n\nDespite Milwaukee\u2019s advantage in the standings, they\u2019ll likely meet their match come playoff time. The Phillies are solid on either side of the diamond. With Zach Wheeler in the Cy Young race and a batting lineup of Kyle Schwarber, Trea Turner, Bryce Harper and Alec Bohm, Phillies fans should not be worried about their team.\n\nThe Guardians have a four-and-a-half-game lead over the Minnesota Twins in the AL Central, which should last the rest of the season. The only issues they might stumble into are facing the Houston Astros, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees and Brewers. Their above-average pitching and solid hitting squad, however, should be able to get the job done and move the team into October.\n\nThe Kansas City Royals are in a tough position as they round the corner. Their two-game lead over the Boston Red Sox is in jeopardy for various reasons, the biggest being that they will face the league-leading Guardians seven different times. They\u2019ll then face the Yankees, Phillies and the Astros down the stretch. Their route to October is not impossible, but the team will have to play lights out to make it to the postseason.\n\nThe New York Mets are fading fast after a surprisingly good couple of months. Following the All-Star break, the Mets were on fire before getting extinguished by the Seattle Mariners. The rest of their schedule is no walk in the park either. They\u2019ll play the Baltimore Orioles, San Diego Padres, Atlanta Braves and Brewers, not to mention the seven games scheduled against the Phillies. Long story short, the Mets are an unlikely playoff team as they fight from two games back.\n\nMVP picks basically solidified\n\nThe MVP race normally involves a handful of players in each division, but with a quarter of the season left, there are two clear winners in each division. Designated hitter Shohei Ohtani has lived up to the hype. Ohtani leads the NL in home runs and OPS, and his power is something that catches all fans\u2019 eye. He consistently blasts balls over 400 feet and has a mind-boggling slugging of .617. Ohtani would be the first DH to win the MVP, all while doing rehab for his arm so he can pitch next year.\n\nAaron Judge is the AL\u2019s representative. The Yankee center-fielder became the fastest player to reach 300 career home runs this past Wednesday, and he shows no signs of slowing down. With a quarter of a season to go, he will likely hit 50 home runs again this season. Judge often puts New York on his back and is making a push for his first ring this year.\n\nSkenes comes back to Earth\n\nRookie Paul Skenes quickly became one of the league\u2019s best pitchers. However, his numbers have been rather average as of late. His ERA has risen to 2.25 and his strikeout rate has slowed dramatically. After the All-Star break, Skenes dropped a game against the St. Louis Cardinals and then underperformed against the Astros. His next two performances could have been better, but he failed to go longer than six innings in both and got shelled for a combined eleven hits and six runs.\n\nSkenes\u2019 biggest issue is that in his past five games, he has only pitched four balls at a velocity greater than 100 MPH. For a starter who relies on the heat as much as he does\u2013throwing a fastball 38.1% of the time)\u2013he must keep his velocity and spin rate up.\n\nThe double play going into the weekend\n\nThe Royals need to beat borderline teams to keep their Wild Card lead. The bats need to stay rolling, but they will be in the back of their pitching rotation this week against the Cincinnati Reds. Prediction: The Reds win two out of three games.\n\nThe week\u2019s best series will be between the Guardians and the Brewers. Neither team has much on the line, but this will likely be an early look at an October matchup. Prediction: The Guardians win two games and take the series.\n\nLast weekend, the Dodgers and Cubs swept their series, improving my prediction total to 5-9-2.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/08/15/ashley-pater-looks-to-lead-usc-in-pursuit-of-five-peat/", "response": "```\nAshley Pater has always been ambitious, especially when it comes to beach volleyball. She started her volleyball career indoors when she was eight, but also sampled a variety of other sports. Pater started playing beach volleyball with her older sister Brooke, her first partner, at age 10. She transitioned completely to beach volleyball when she was 12, where her father, Todd, took notice of her passion for the sand.\n\n\u201cWhen she decided to go full beach, by the time she was probably 12, I knew there was something different about her as a person and athlete, and definitely her love for the sport,\u201d Todd said. \u201cSo she just kinda dove all in.\u201d\n\nPater had always grown up with sports, especially since both of her parents grew up playing sports; her mom Lorraine grew up playing volleyball, while Todd played college football at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. Pater gives a lot of credit to her parents for their unwavering dedication to her as she went all-in on beach volleyball.\n\n\u201cThey have been super, super supportive,\u201d Pater said. \u201cOur parents drove and flew us across the country just to let us play against the best of the best players, and I feel like that\u2019s really, really helped because Florida has great, great competition, but California, Texas... I mean, there\u2019s a lot of studs around the country, and I think getting to play against the best has really helped improve my game a lot.\u201d\n\nAs Pater got older, she started playing with Jordan Bolware, a future Florida State commit, from 2019 to 2021, with whom she would go on to win five 14U national beach volleyball titles. In 2021, the two would split up. Since they were both built more for defense, they wanted to start playing with taller partners who could play at the net while they patrolled the backcourt.\n\nAll of the work that Pater put in for beach volleyball would eventually go on to pay off, as she was recruited and accepted an offer to play for USC under head coach Dain Blanton.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just your perfect kind of student-athlete that you can have,\u201d Blanton said. \u201cShe takes care of business, she\u2019s professional, she shows up on time, she\u2019s gonna work as hard as she can, she\u2019s trying to maximize her abilities, she\u2019s trying to reach her potential. The effort she puts out there is awesome and she leads not only verbally, but she leads by example, by going out there and making it happen every time.\u201d\n\nOne thing that Pater believes helped her prepare to play at USC was graduating high school a year early, but then taking a gap year that allowed her to train and prepare by practicing and playing in professional tournaments. Pater gives Brooke a lot of credit for helping her organize an online schedule that not only allowed Pater to finish high school early, but also graduate alongside her older sister.\n\n\u201cI trained with a lot of really high-level adults here in Florida during the gap year and they\u2019ve already experienced college and playing professionally and international tournaments, so just being around their mindset and their skills, it really helped me excel and have a really good focus and vision for what I wanted to do going into college,\u201d Pater said.\n\nOnce she got to USC, Pater quickly showed off her competitive nature, but it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing. At times, Pater faced an uphill battle and struggled at times, especially being a part of a dynasty program in college beach volleyball.\n\n\u201cI would say at USC, one of the biggest challenges was trusting the process,\u201d Pater said. \u201cI know it\u2019s easy to say, but everyone\u2019s such a grinder and works so hard. Like having the fear of not starting, it\u2019s really, really tough and I think during fall, it was a really big mental rollercoaster.\u201d\n\nBlanton recalls how, despite the early adversity that Pater faced, she responded to it, especially under the guidance of Blanton and his coaching staff.\n\n\u201cWell she wanted success very quickly, right? And when she had some stumbles and defeats, she took it a little heavier than she needed to, but that\u2019s the sign of a champion. She didn\u2019t just say \u2018oh, it\u2019s a loss.\u2019 She took it really heavy,\u201d Blanton said. \u201cAnd you saw by the end of the year that she was starting at the No. 4 spot and just was a tremendous, tremendous asset in terms of us winning the 2024 championship.\u201d\n\nThroughout the year, Pater played primarily with three different partners. Pater\u2019s first partner was Ainsley Radell, a grad transfer from Cal, followed by Madison White, who just completed her sophomore year with USC. Pater\u2019s third and final partner was Grace Seits, a graduate student who had spent the previous four years at LSU. Pater played with Seits for the final three weeks of the season, and together, the two of them helped USC win both the Pac-12 Championship and the national championship from the No. 4 Court. Pater also made the All-Pac-12 Freshman Team.\n\n\u201cWith Ashley being a freshman, we knew she could handle herself and we knew how tenacious of a player she was, but to put her with a steadying force, a fifth-year grad student like Grace Seits who was very focused, who\u2019s all about business, I thought it was a very good complement to one another,\u201d Blanton said of his decision to pair Pater with Seits.\n\nSeits recalls meeting Pater during a beach tournament that she was working at, one Pater competed in, and was excited to get the chance to play with her.\n\n\u201cWhen I met her, it was honestly super refreshing to see, as a freshman, somebody who really did care so much about this sport and was willing to work her butt off no matter what, and honestly handled the craziness of college athletics so well at such a young age,\u201d Seits said. \u201cSo, I kinda knew from that fact that she was gonna be something special as a freshman, miles ahead of where I was when I was a freshman.\u201d\n\nSeits said that she really got to know Pater during a trip to Huntsville for an AVCA Tournament in early November. While the two were not partnered together, Seits said that it allowed her to really get to know her teammate\u2019s hilarious and fun off-the-court personality. The trip helped the two grow close and form a tight bond, which would serve them well in tough scenarios on the court during the final stretch of the season. This was most notable in the Pac-12 tournament, when the pair lost to rival UCLA duo of Jaden Whitmarsh and Tessa Van Winkle in the semifinals. After helping each other calm down and reset, Pater and Seits beat Stanford in the contender\u2019s bracket to set up a rematch in the championship dual, where, this time, the Trojans prevailed over the Bruins, with Pater and Seits winning the rematch over Whitmarsh and Van Winkle.\n\nThe momentum from the Pac-12 Championship would carry into Gulf Shores for the national championship, where the duo went 3-0 in the matches they completed and helped USC hoist its seventh beach volleyball trophy by getting another win over Whitmarsh and Van Winkle in a hard fought battle over UCLA in the final.\n\n\u201cRight after the match, I just happened to be standing right there when she gets interviewed on TV, she\u2019s able to come up and give me a big hug, and it was just a very special moment,\u201d Todd said of witnessing his daughter\u2019s success at Gulf Shores. \u201cYou almost felt like the last eight years of her life came down to that moment, and it was just so much relief to see her have success and everything that she\u2019s worked hard for. So that was a pretty cool hug.\u201d\n\nOutside of volleyball, Pater enjoys hanging out with her friends, working out, and is a big fan of Suits and South Park. She also said that she finds house flipping fascinating, which is why she decided to major in real estate. She is also pursuing an accounting minor after enjoying an accounting class she took during her first year at USC.\n\nAfter graduating from USC in 2027, Pater plans to pursue a professional career in beach volleyball, playing both in the U.S. and abroad. She also hopes to qualify for the 2032 Olympics in Brisbane, Australia. Right now, her focus is on continuing to improve her game for the 2025 season with USC, as the Trojans will try to pull off a five-peat. She has spent the summer playing in AVP tournaments with Sarah Wood, a 2026 uncommitted beach volleyball recruit. The pair recently had a runner-up finish in Denver and placed third in Waupaca.\n\nAs Pater prepares to lead a very underclassmen-heavy team next spring while USC transitions from the Pac-12 to the MPSF \u2014 the Big Ten does not have beach volleyball \u2014 Seits only sees the sky as the limit for her final collegiate volleyball partner.\n\n\u201cI think that her ceiling is so incredibly high and the whole USC team is fully prepared to keep running this program to greatness and the potential for more national championships is so high,\u201d Seits said.\n\nPater will be back with the Trojans next February when the beach volleyball team takes to the sand to kick off its 2025 season in an effort to win its fifth straight national championship.\n```"}

Throughout his speech, he presented himself as one of them: a Midwesterner from a small town, a public employee and a community member.\n\n\u201cI happen to be the first union member on a presidential ticket since Ronald Reagan,\u201d Walz said. \u201cBut rest assured, I won\u2019t lose my way.\u201d\n\nAFSCME President Lee Saunders endorsed the Harris-Walz ticket last week, commending Walz as a former member of the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, both of whom also endorsed Walz the same day.\n\n\u201cFor his first stop, he\u2019s picking the green, mean machine: AFSCME,\u201d Saunders said in his opening remarks. \u201cHe understands us because he is one of us \u2014 a union brother.\u201d\n\nToday, Walz emphasized the wins he has made for public workers in Minnesota over his tenure as governor. These include a free meals program for students, banning captive audience meetings where employers can dissuade unionization and increasing paid sick leave, among others.\n\n\u201cToday, Minnesota\u2019s one of the best states for workers in the country,\u201d Walz said. \u201c[Harris\u2019s] vision is to take those worker protections to every state in the union.\u201d\n\nAFSCME represents about 1.3 million workers in the public sector, making it the largest trade union of government employees in the country. Its members span from police officers and firefighters to sanitation workers and those who paint the Golden Gate.\n\nOne of those members is Vanessa Satterthweite, a psychiatric nurse from Warren, Ohio. Satterthweite said she\u2019s hoping Walz will implement nationwide benefits for hospital personnel similar to the ones Minnesota nurses receive.\n\n\u201cWages, I believe, need to go up for our nurses. Maybe that\u2019ll bring more [personnel] back, because staffing is absolutely horrendous,\u201d Satterthweite said. \u201cCOVID took them away ... Kamala and Governor Walz, maybe they\u2019ll bring more back to us.\u201d\n\nShe also said Walz\u2019s presence as a family man and attitude towards workers swayed her vote.\n\n\u201cThank you for believing in workers. Thank you for believing in family,\u201d she said.\n\nThe energy was high throughout the early afternoon, with many AFSCME members in strong support of Walz for vice president. That came to the governor\u2019s advantage as he spoke to issues of social security and the minimum wage from a collective perspective, to the tune of local talent and soul music.\n\nWalz continued his us-versus-them attitude when criticizing former President Donald Trump and Ohio Senator J.D. Vance\u2019s stances on workers\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cThe only thing those two guys know about working people is how to work to take advantage of them,\u201d Walz said. \u201cAs president, he cut overtime from millions of workers and opposed raising the minimum wage,\u201d Walz said, referencing a Trump administration rule that made about 8.2 million workers ineligible for overtime pay.\n\nBoth Walz and Vance were chosen with hopes that they could win the organized labor vote for their tickets in November. Vance\u2019s memoir \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d describes his childhood growing up in a working-class, union family in Ohio. But as a senator, Vance has voted on the side of businesses or abstained voting at all, a fact Walz used to criticize Vance.\n\nWalz, who joined the National Guard at 17 and served for 24 years, also used the speech as an opportunity to respond to Vance\u2019s criticism of his military record. Last week, Vance accused Walz of avoiding deployment to Iraq in 2005, calling it \u201cstolen valor garbage.\u201d\n\nIn response, Walz said he was \u201cdamn proud\u201d of his military service.\n\n\u201cTo anyone brave enough to put on that uniform for our great country, including my opponent, I just have a few simple words: thank you for your service and sacrifice,\u201d Walz said.\n\nSince announcing his run for vice president, Walz and Harris have gained the endorsement of almost every major union in the country, including that of electrical workers (IBEW), service employees (SEIU), auto workers (UAW), operating engineers (IUOE) and his fellow educators (NEA). Only the International Brotherhood of Teamsters has not endorsed either presidential ticket.\n\nWith momentum building after Walz\u2019s resonance with government workers today, union members are now planning large-scale voter mobilization efforts. Latonya Reeves, a Minnesota representative for the Democratic National Convention, said she feels personally motivated to get the vote out for Walz by speaking to those who are on the fence about voting.\n\n\u201cWe have a governor that truly wants to see the middle class and the worker\u2019s class succeed,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cWe do Black political action ... we\u2019re working with marginalized communities to help them understand, \u2018This is who the choices are, which one\u2019s going to be the better [choice] for your community?\u2019\u201d\n\nWalz ended on a quote he said Harris shares with him frequently; \u201cWhen we fight,\u201d Walz said to a crowd cheering back to him, \u201cwe win.\u201d\n\nAfter speaking at AFSCME today, Walz headlined a campaign fundraiser in Newport Beach. He is also traveling to Denver and the East Coast later this week to speak at other fundraising events for the Harris-Walz ticket.\n```"}

(Photo by Justin Susan)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson August 13, 2024 at 1:09 pm PDT\n\nUSC continued its historic run at the Summer Olympics, taking home seven gold medals to continue its stretch of winning at least one gold medal at every Summer Games since 1912. Still, it was a somewhat disappointing showing, at least to the standard the Trojans have set across the past couple editions of the Games.\n\nUSC sent 66 athletes to the Olympics and while only 65 competed \u2014 incoming freshman Ashley Erasmus suffered an injury during training and was unable to shot put \u2014 this was still more than any other U.S. university. Yet, the Trojans brought home the fourth-most medals of any U.S. university, trailing Stanford, Texas and California. Stanford ran away with the hardware, totaling 39 medals across 59 athletes at the Games.\n\nThe 15 total medals is only underwhelming because it is the lowest total the Trojans have won at a Summer Games this century. The previous low was 19 at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The lack of winning is despite the fact USC sent the second-most athletes it has ever sent to the Games, only behind the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, held in 2021, when 67 athletes with USC ties competed at the Games and won 21 total medals.\n\nBut when the Trojans won, they won big. If USC was its own sovereign country, its 15 total medals would rank No. 16 among all other countries, but the Trojans\u2019 seven gold medals would put them at No. 14.\n\nRai Benjamin of USC track and field was the big winner, taking home two gold medals for Team USA from the 400m hurdles and the men\u2019s 4x400m relay, where Benjamin ran the anchor leg and helped secure Team USA an Olympic-record time of 2:54.43. The relay domination did not stop there, as Aaron Brown and Andre de Grasse helped Canada win gold in the 4x100m relay while TeeTee Terry was on the women\u2019s 4x100m relay that won gold for the U.S.\n\nThe Trojans also notched three bronze medals in relays courtesy of Great Britain, two from Nicole Yeargin and one from Yemi John. Anni Espar of women\u2019s water polo for Spain and Croix Bethune of women\u2019s soccer for the U.S. both helped their team take home the Olympic title.\n\nThe Trojans only took silver in two events, one coming from Anna Cockrell in the women\u2019s 400m hurdles and the other from Tilly Kearns with Australia\u2019s women\u2019s water polo team. USC\u2019s other bronze medals \u2014 to go along with its relay bronze medals \u2014 all came from Team USA. Micah Christenson took third place for indoor volleyball while Hannes Daube and Marko Vavic matched that for men\u2019s water polo.\n\nDespite the comparatively low medal count, the Trojans were moments away from more Olympic honors. Likely the most controversial of the bunch, Kendall Ellis was removed from Team USA\u2019s women\u2019s 4x400m relay that won gold just moments before the race started, according to multiple reports. Ellis won the 400m dash at the U.S. Olympic Team Trials, but was omitted from the final race at the Games because of inconsistencies at the 400m, according to ESPN.\n\nWhile she did make it to the individual 400m dash semifinals, Ellis only qualified after the repechage round. Every second matters in relays like these, but Team USA won the relay by four seconds and Ellis\u2019 inclusion likely would not have changed that. This is particularly true given that Alexis Holmes, who ran the anchor leg, showed that one can improve on their 400m time at the Games, as Holmes ran a 50.35-second time in the individual 400m qualifying round, but ran her leg of the relay in a blazing 48.78-second mark.\n\nTerry was also .05 seconds off of a second medal in the 100m final and Jasmine Jones fell .14-seconds short of bronze in the 400m hurdles. Similarly, Krystof Chmielewski, competing in the 200m butterfly, and Kate Miller, in the 10m synchronized diving, both finished fourth in their event finals, while Kasia Wilk-Wasick was .13 seconds out of podium position in the 50m freestyle.\n\nThen, three women\u2019 water polo players with Team USA fell in the bronze medal match to the Netherlands after the Dutch scored a goal with one second left to take the game, 11-10. While Team USA did lose their semifinals game by one goal in a shootout to Australia, it did come as a surprise that the U.S. did not come home with a medal in women\u2019s water polo.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to call 15 Olympic medals a disappointment, but the way the Trojans have performed throughout the history of the Summer Games have created incredibly high expectations. USC is still set up for success in the future at the Games for years to come, particularly in swimming and diving as the Trojans will have seven Olympians on campus to compete for the Division I team.\n\nThe Summer Games will go back on a four-year hiatus, but will return to Los Angeles in 2028, where the Trojans aim to add onto their 341 total medals. USC\u2019s ties with the Games will go beyond just the athletes in 2028; the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will host track and field events along with the Opening Ceremony. This is the third Games that the Coliseum will host the Opening Ceremony, joining the 1932 and 1984 Games.\n```"}

Expand LA extended Pittsburgh's losing streak to 7 games. (Photo courtesy of the Los Angeles Dodgers @dodgers)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler August 12, 2024 at 6:15 pm PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES - The Los Angeles Dodgers brought out the brooms after sweeping the Pittsburgh Pirates this weekend. Offensively, LA scored a whopping 19 runs in the series. The front three for the Dodgers\u2013Shohei Ohtani, Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez and Freddie Freeman\u2013were on fire, each hitting a home run and accounting for eight total RBIs. The spark in hitting comes at a great time as leadoff hitter Mookie Betts is still on the injured list, though he\u2019s expected to return this week.\n\nThe Dodgers exploded for nine runs in a four-run Game 1 victory. Freeman got off to a quick start, hitting a home run in the first inning, his first since returning from a family emergency. Ohtani then kept it going with a 448-foot blast to straight-away center field in the bottom of the third. Starting pitcher Jack Flaherty threw a solid game, striking out ten in five-and-two-thirds innings. Flaherty\u2019s potential is getting better and better after every game he plays.\n\nLA\u2019s Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez hit his 26th home run of the season in Game 2 and led the Dodgers in a three-for-four day. The Dodgers had no problem dealing with Pittsburgh\u2019s rookie sensation Paul Skenes, recording six hits and four runs during his six innings pitched. The series\u2019 final game went to extra innings before Hern\u00e1ndez hit a walk-off single in the gap between first and second base. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s walk-off capped another solid performance for the Home Run Derby champion as he garnered three RBIs in a two-for-five day.\n\nIn the bullpen, LA starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow again proved he is the only Dodger with the ability to go deep into games. He pitched seven innings while managing to stay under 100 pitches. The weekend wasn\u2019t completely a highlight reel, though, as the Dodgers suffered yet another injury. Rookie right-hander River Ryan left Game 2 early due to forearm tightness, but it later turned out he has a sprained UCL. Manager Dave Roberts confirmed the next day that Ryan won\u2019t return this season. Ryan\u2019s injury marks the fourth Dodger currently on the IL due to an elbow injury.\n\nThe Dodgers\u2019 bullpen has gone through the wringer this season and has started 17 different pitchers, the most of any big league team. Though Ryan had to end his stellar rookie year earlier than expected, the Dodgers are expecting Walker Buehler to return this week against Milwaukee. Buehler\u2019s been out with a hip injury since mid-June and reenters the bullpen when the Dodgers need him to recreate the 212-strikeout season he had in 2021.\n\nThe Dodgers are returning players in other positions as well. Power-hitting third-baseman Max Muncy will return from an oblique injury in the Dodgers\u2019 next homestand against the Seattle Mariners. Shortstop Tommy Edman should also be in the lineup against the Mariners and would mark the first time he will have seen the field since the Dodgers traded for him in July. Edman\u2019s ability to play short will allow Betts to return his normal position in the outfield.\n\nThe Dodgers head to Milwaukee for a four-game series against the Brewers.\n```"}

Through this, students came together to destigmatize topics like transgender mental health, undocumented mental health, and suicide through the lens of solutions journalism, culminating in a zine. It\u2019s available through this article and will be available physically on campus and through community partners when the school year has begun.\n\nSolutions journalism is journalism that goes beyond reporting on the issue at hand. It centers solutions to the problem as a necessary part of the story that works to help readers become accurately informed. It\u2019s not about championing one solution as the holy grail, instead, its purpose is to draw attention to alternatives that may go unseen. When exposed, these alternatives may allow the public to make more informed decisions when calling for change.\n\nThe Solutions Journalism Network focuses on just that and is extremely invested in helping student journalists develop the skills necessary to publish strong solutions journalism work. Through the Student Media Challenge focused on youth mental health, D\u00edmelo contributors received guidance on how to cover sensitive topics tactfully and obtained feedback on how to best incorporate solutions journalism in their articles.\n\nThe Solutions Journalism Network also provided contributors an opportunity to attend the Associated Collegiate Press Spring College Media Conference to inform others on aspects of Latine mental health. Focusing on Latine mental health is especially important at an institution like USC, located in the middle of South Central which is approximately 78% Hispanic.\n\nUnder the guidance of D\u00edmelo advisors Amara Aguilar and Allan Lopez, and Myriam-Fernanda Alcala Delgado as Managing Editor, six contributors explored how the Latine diaspora is impacted by poor mental health.\n\nMonica Esquivel introduces the USC community to Venus, a queer Afro-Latina musician who is one of USC\u2019s very own. Esquivel helps readers understand how Venus uses music as a form of healing and therapy and how the music she produces represents her unapologetically. She also hones in on the importance of having spaces, especially for Black trans and queer members of the USC community.\n\nMyriam-Fernanda Alcala Delgado walks readers through their own experience with mental health and what speaking with their family about it looked like. Their article allows readers a glimpse into what being diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder has meant for them and their journey in building a healthy support system.\n\nAlexa Hernandez Diaz pulls the curtain back on the mental health of undocumented students at USC by sharing the stories of four students. Hailing from different countries of origin, all four deliver powerful testimonies on how pursuing higher education becomes a battle when undocumented. This, along with other anxiety-inducing struggles, plays an unignorable role in their lives.\n\nAccalia Rositani reminds us that our circumstances must be acknowledged when addressing mental health by bringing us to Boyle Heights, where the community struggles against landlords. By bringing readers into a Collectivo Poder Comunitario meeting, we gain insight into residents\u2019 struggles and their solidarity against unfair practices.\n\nMateo Jim\u00e9nez writes on his experience of being gay in a community full of machismo, and how that has impacted his relationship with his grandma while on the road of discovery. He writes about what healing has looked like and aids readers in envisioning what change can look like when we\u2019re willing to have difficult conversations.\n\nI had the opportunity to write about the Latina suicide epidemic, a silent struggle that has been going on in the Latine community for decades. Disproportionate amounts of Latinas have struggled with suicidal ideation due to cultural family dynamics and a severe lack of resources, something seen as close as thirty minutes away from USC.\n\nWhile all of these topics can seem off limits due to the stigma surrounding mental health in the Latine community, the aim is to make these articles as accessible as possible. For this reason, the articles are presented via a zine focused on making readers more aware of issues and encouraging them to take care of themselves simultaneously. With the help of Nova Blanco-Rico, Audrey Schreck, and Carlee Nixson, the zine reflects how mental health doesn\u2019t have to be intimidating.\n\nThe pages are full of color and include resources, a space to journal, and a character inspired by Dr. Simi. A beloved icon in Mexico due to his friendly appearance, Dr. Simi is the mascot of Farmacias Similares, a pharmaceutical company providing quality medicine at a lower cost. The character in our zine is similarly friendly, and as opposed to only taking into account our physical health, the character and our zine make mental health a priority.\n\nAccess to the zine is available here, and limited copies will be available physically on campus and through community partners at the beginning of the school year. While reading it, we invite you to allow yourself the space to learn, grow, and heal. Check out our zine through this QR code or link! https://issuu.com/uscdimelo/docs/completed_zine\n```"}

USC has one of the richest histories of any American university at the Summer Olympics. The Trojans are sending 66 to the 2024 Games in Paris, more than any other U.S. university. Heading into these Games, USC has had 512 Olympians in its history \u2014 adding 33 first-time Olympians to the tally this year to put the total at 545 \u2014 and 326 medals across the history of the Games, again more than any U.S. university. If USC was its own country, the Trojans would be tied for the 12th-most medals in the Summer Olympics of any competing country. With 153 gold medals, USC would rank No. 11 in that category of any country.\n\nWater polo is not one of the Trojans\u2019 most well-represented sports \u2014 that would go to swimming and track and field \u2014 but USC is still sending 14 water polo athletes to the 2024 edition of the Olympics. Seven of the players are men, tying a program record for most male water polo athletes the Trojans have sent to the Games, which was originally set in 1956.\n\nHere are the athletes headed to Paris for water polo who competed at USC. Annenberg Media will update this story with the athletes\u2019 results at the Games.\n\nWomen\u2019s Water Polo\n\nTilly Kearns\nCountry: Australia\nYears at USC: 2019-present\nResults: Earned a silver medal in the Olympic Tournament\nCurrie: Kearns is a rising redshirt senior at USC, but has missed the 2021 and 2024 seasons with the Trojans to train for the Olympics.

Erasmus has a strong track record for South Africa, first winning a discus throw championship at the 2020 South African U16 Championships. Erasmus\u2019 personal record for shot put is 18.17m, which would already put her atop USC\u2019s all-time record list, while her 53.10m mark for discus would put her at No. 8 on the list in that event. The Trojans have not had a shot put or discus thrower in the Olympics since the 1972 Rome Games. While USC has had female discus throwers at the Games, it has never had a female shot put Olympian before Erasmus. The Trojans did have a discus thrower and shot putter exactly 100 years ago at the 1924 Paris Olympics.

She claimed gold in both the 400m hurdles and 4x400m relay at the 2016 IAAF World U20 Championship in Poland. Cockrell\u2019s worldwide spotlight continued when she represented her Trojan family and nation for Team USA at the Tokyo Games. The Charlotte, North Carolina native finished seventh in the Women\u2019s 400m hurdles but left the Games empty-handed and broken-hearted after judges disqualified her for a controversial lane violation.

Originally from Spain, Ibarzabal went to the University of Portland for her undergraduate track career. Her fastest time with the Pilots was better than her quickest time for the Trojans, but she did qualify for the Pac-12 Championships in her lone season at USC. Track and field is in Ibarzabal\u2019s blood as her mother, Patricia Padorno, competed and earned All-American honors in the mile at Kentucky.\n\nHalle Hazzard\nCountry: Grenada\nYears at USC: 2021-2022\nEvent(s): 100m\nResults: Did not advance past heat stage\n\nDespite not competing with the Trojans, Hazzard did earn a graduate degree at USC in specialized journalism. Hazzard competed collegiately at Virginia with a pair of All-American honors to her name. She went to the NCAA Championships in 2021, finishing No. 16 in the 4x100m relay.

Just as with the Trojans, Benjamin won his two Tokyo medals in the 400m hurdles and the 4x400m relay. Benjamin continued his dominance of the 400m hurdles at the U.S. circuit, winning the past five U.S. titles in that event. While he won silver as hurdler in his Olympic debut, Benjamin looks to better his performance as he heads into these Games. While Benjamin started off his international career by competing for Antigua \u2014 the country where his parents Winston and Jeanette are natives of \u2014 he switched over and started competing with the U.S. in 2018.\n\nAndre de Grasse\nCountry: Canada\nYears at USC: 2015\nEvent(s): 4x100m relay, 200m, 100m\nResults: Won gold in relay, made it to semifinals of both 200m and 100m\n\nAndre de Grasse previously competed in the 2016 Rio and 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but is now representing Canada as a six-time medalist and flag bearer.

He transferred to USC as a junior from Coffeyville Community College in Kansas, but forewent his final year of collegiate eligibility to accept a multi-million dollar contract with Puma. De Grasse made an impact during his short time as a Trojan, winning a Pac-12 Championship for the men\u2019s 100m with a time of 9.97 seconds. De Grasse competed in the Rio Olympics after leaving USC in 2015 and medaled bronze in the men\u2019s 100m and 4x100m relay to go along with a silver in the 200m. Aside from setting the then-national record for the relay (37.64 seconds), he became the first Canadian athlete to medal in all three sprint events. De Grasse continued to break national records when he claimed gold in the Tokyo Olympics for men\u2019s 200m, the only Canadian athlete to do so since 1966.\n\nMichael Norman\nCountry: USA\nYears at USC: 2017-2018\nEvent(s): 400m\nResults: Made it to finals, but finished eighth in 400m\n\nA gold medal winner at the Tokyo Games with fellow Trojan Rai Benjamin, the speedy Norman is looking for a medal in a"}

Johansson, recognized as one of Europe\u2019s top young distance freestylers, made waves by setting Swedish national records at the 2017 World Championships. During his career at USC, Johansson became a two-time Pac-12 finalist and earned an NCAA title during the 2015 season in the 400y freestyle relay. Despite battling overtraining syndrome and recovering from a bacterial infection that forced him to be put on a ventilator, Johansson\u2019s Olympic ambitions remained strong. In 2021, he competed in the Tokyo Games, finishing 10th in the 800m freestyle and achieving a personal best. Continuing his academic and athletic journey at the University of Alabama for the 2022-2023 school year \u2014 when he was a graduate swimmer \u2014 Johansson now returns to the Olympic stage in Paris, competing in the 400, 800 and 1500-meter freestyle events.\n\nArtem Selin\nCountry: Germany\nYears at USC: 2022-present\nResults: Did not advance past heat stages of 50m freestyle\nJohnson: One of the current Trojans on this list, Selin just wrapped up his junior year at USC. He currently ranks in the top 10 on the all-time USC rankings in the 50y and 100y freestyle, rearing up for his first Olympics. Selin is competing for Germany, but is a dual national with Russia. It was an easy choice for Selin to swim for Germany, as Russia\u2019s flag is banned at the Olympics due to the country\u2019s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Russian athletes are still allowed to take part in the Games, but are considered \u201cIndividual Neutral Athletes.\u201d While he has not yet taken home a title, Selin has competed in the NCAA Championships all three of his seasons with the Trojans. He had his best individual finish this past season, clocking in at No. 24 in the 50y freestyle, while participating in USC\u2019s 400y medley relay that finished No. 22 at the NCAAs.\n\nNikola Miljenic\nCountry: Croatia\nYears at USC: 2019-2022\nResults: Finished No. 33 in the 100m freestyle\nJohnson: One of the few Trojans with Big Ten experience \u2014 spending his freshman year at Indiana \u2014 Miljenic enters his second Olympic Games with Croatia. He competed in three events at the Tokyo Olympics, putting up a solid effort in the 50m freestyle and finishing No. 19 in that race. While at USC, Miljenic was a two-time captain and two-time All-American, making it to three NCAA Championships across his four years with the Trojans. In his final chance at an NCAA title, Miljenic qualified in three relays and three solo events. While he did not earn a medal, Miljenic\u2019s best finish came in the 400y freestyle relay, where he helped the Trojans finish No. 15 in the nation in that event.\n\nMoritz Wesemann\nCountry: Germany\nYears at USC: Incoming freshman\nResults: Made it to the 3m springboard finals, but finished twelfth\nJohnson: The second German on this list, Wesemann is an incoming diver to USC. He competes in the 3-meter springboard competition and will look to help the Trojans\u2019 diving team, a program with only five men on the roster this past season. USC already has an All-American diver in rising senior Shangfei Wang \u2014 the Trojans\u2019 first All-American in diving since 2020 and only the seventh since 2010 \u2014 and now adds an Olympian to the diving fold. Wesemann qualified for a quota spot after winning the 3-meter springboard event at the 2023 European Championships.\n\nOf the six Trojan women competing at the Olympics for swim and dive, three are returning to USC.

Across her four years at USC, she won five Pac-12 titles, four of them coming just this past season. She won all of her relay titles in 2024 and she won the 50y freestyle both in 2022 and 2024. At the 2021 Olympics, Delgado finished tied for 25th in the 50m freestyle and 31st in the 100m freestyle. Her father, Felipe, was similarly an Olympic athlete, competing for Ecuador in the 1996 and 2000 Olympic Games. Delgado\u2019s USC career is not yet over, as she\u2019ll return to compete with the Trojans for a fifth year with a second Olympics under her cap.\n\nMinna Abraham\nCountry: Hungary\nYears at USC: 2023-present\nResults: Made it to semifinals of 200m freestyle, but failed to advance\nJohnson: Abraham just finished up an outstanding freshman year with the Trojans and is only continuing that with a trip to the Olympics. Just turning 18 back in March, Abraham was the Pac-12 Freshman of the Year after taking home two individual Pac-12 titles and helping the Trojans secure three Pac-12 relay championships. Abraham competed in the NCAA Championships, earning first team All-American honors in five different events. For her efforts, Abraham co-won the \u201cNewcomer of the Year Award from a Female Team\u201d with women\u2019s basketball\u2019s JuJu Watkins at USC Athletics\u2019 yearly Tommy Award. The Budapest native will be representing her home country in the 200m freestyle after taking home a silver medal in the European Championships.\n\nLouise Hansson\nCountry: Sweden\nYears at USC: 2016-2020\nResults: Finished eighth in 100m butterfly final, helped Sweden to fifth-place finish in 4x100m freestyle relay\nSullivan: A two-year team captain and decorated NCAA champion, Louise Hansson returns for her third Olympic Games representing Sweden. The swimmer totaled 10 conference titles \u2014 eight individual events and two relays \u2014 in her four years as a Trojan, winning three individual titles overall in the 100-yard butterfly twice and the 200-yard butterfly once. Hansson graduated USC in 2020 as that year\u2019s Pac-12 Women\u2019s Swimmer of the Year. The All-American from Helsingborg won three gold medals in the 100-yard backstroke and the 4x50 and 4x100 medley relays at the 2021 FINA World Swimming Championships, medaling in four additional events. At the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, Hansson helped Sweden finish fifth in the 4x100 and 4x200 freestyle relays. She had similar success in the Tokyo Games, finishing fifth in the individual 100-meter butterfly and fifth in the 4x100 medley relay. She\u2019s traveled to each of the Games alongside her younger sister, Sophie, also an Olympian for Sweden. Sophie swam collegiately at NC State rather than joining her sister with the Trojans. Both sisters swim under their father Lars-Olaf Hansson, the head coach at their swim club Helsingborgs SS.\n\nKasia Wilk-Wasick\nCountry: Poland\nYears at USC: 2012-2016\nResults: Made it to the 50m freestyle finals, but finished .13 seconds off of a medal; did not advance past heat stage of 4x100m freestyle relay\nJohnson: A 12-time All-American and one-time NCAA champion, Wilk-Wasick is one of the most experienced Olympic swimmers out of USC. Wilk-Wasick \u2014 whose last name was just Wilk when she swam for USC between 2012 and 2016 \u2014 is entering her fifth Games with the Polish national team. Merely a 16-year-old at her first Olympics, the now 32-year-old even retired after the 2016 Games but came back to the sport in 2019. She had her best finish at the 2020 Olympics, getting fifth in the 50m freestyle. She competed in various relays across her first three games \u2014 winning an NCAA Championship in the 400y freestyle relay in 2015 \u2014 but only competed in the one event her last time around at the Olympics. Wilk-Wasick is the lone Trojan who\u2019s competing in her fifth Olympic Games this year.\n\nLaticia-Leigh Transom\nCountry: New Zealand\nYears at USC: 2019-2022\nResults: Made it to finals of 4x200m freestyle relay, finishing eighth\nMuruganujan: New Zealand native Transom has established an impressive career in competitive swimming with standout performances at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games and the 2017 Commonwealth Youth Games in The Bahamas. This past April, Transom secured multiple gold medals at the 2024 Apollo Games in New Zealand. Transom\u2019s collegiate swimming journey began in 2019 as a freshman spring semester enrollee, helping the Trojans set a school record at the NCAA Championships in the 800y freestyle relay \u2013\u2013 just during her first season. In her sophomore and season, she claimed Pac-12 titles in the 100y freestyle and the 200y freestyle. USC\u2019s first-ever New Zealand swimmer at the Olympics, Transom continued swimming at the University of Hawaii for the 2022-2023 school year, where she set records in 50y freestyle, 100y freestyle and 200y backstroke. Now, she is set to compete at the Paris Olympics, where she will race in the 4x200m freestyle relay.\n\nNoelani Day\nCountry: Tonga\nYears at USC: N/A-2024\nResults: Finished third in her 50m freestyle heat, but did not advance\nJohnson: Day has one of the most interesting stories out of USC\u2019s Olympians, as she did not compete with the Trojans\u2019 Division I team in her time at USC. While she did swim with the school\u2019s club team, she chose not to join the USC team because she wanted to focus on her education and family. The Tongan will compete in her second Olympics, swimming in the 50m freestyle and finishing at No. 63. She will compete in the same event in these Games, as a recent college graduate. The heats for her event start on August 3.\n\nKate Miller\nCountry: Canada\nYears at USC: Incoming freshman\nResults: Finished fourth in the 10m synchro event, one spot off of podium position\nEdelman: 19-year-old Kate Miller will be competing in her first Olympic Games for Team Canada. The incoming Trojan made her debut last year at the World Aquatics Championship, where she placed eighth in the women\u2019s 10m synchro event with teammate Caeli McKay. Miller began diving 13 years ago after an inspiring visit to the Walter Baker Pool in Ottawa with her mother where she saw a lifeguard perform a flip off the diving board. While she played other sports like soccer, she ultimately chose to continue in diving due to the training versatility and opportunity to learn new dives. Her most recent wins include a silver from the 2024 World Aquatics Diving World Cup in Berlin, Germany with a score of 282.72 and a silver from the Super Final in Xi\u2019an, China with a score of 296.10. The duo qualified for the Paris 2024 Olympics at the 2024 World Aquatics Championships in February, placing sixth in the 10m synchro event with a score of 287.34.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson, Campbell Donovan, Nick Charles Currie, Terence Holton, Paulena Edelman, Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier, and Desirae Ridley\n\nAugust 11, 2024, at 7:41 pm PDT\n\nThis is a part of a series from Annenberg Media, highlighting the Olympians that USC is sending to Paris this year. USC has one of the richest histories of any American university at the Summer Olympics. The Trojans are sending 66 to the 2024 Games in Paris, more than any other U.S. university. Heading into these Games, USC has had 512 Olympians in its history \u2014 adding 33 first-time Olympians to the tally this year to put the total at 545 \u2014 and 326 medals across the history of the Games, again more than any U.S. university. If USC was its own country, the Trojans would be tied for the 12th-most medals in the Summer Olympics of any competing country. With 153 gold medals, USC would rank No. 11 in that category of any country.\n\nWhile USC has a rich history in both swim and dive and then track and field at the Games, former and current Trojans have still populated in other Olympic sports. Six athletes who competed at USC will participate in beach volleyball, while the Trojans have a rowing delegation of four to go along with three women\u2019s soccer players. USC has a single athlete for both women\u2019s basketball and indoor volleyball.\n\nAnnenberg Media will update this story with the athletes\u2019 results at the Games.\n\nBeach and Indoor Volleyball\n\nSophie Bukovec\nCountry: Canada\nYears at USC: 2015-2017\nResults: Went winless in pool play\n\nBukovec transferred to USC after her sophomore year, spending her first two years of college playing indoors at McMaster University \u2014 located in Ontario, Canada \u2014 and Long Beach State. In her first year at USC, she was named an AVCA All-American. Her partnership with Alexa Strange with the Trojans proved incredibly successful, as the duo went on to become the third-winningest pair in school history. In 2016, Bukovec was named a Pac-12 first-team All-American. She was part of USC\u2019s title-winning teams in 2016 and 2017. This is Bukovec\u2019s first Olympic Games. She qualified for the Olympics with her partner Heather Bansley after winning the NORCECA Tlaxcala.\n\nTina Graudina\nCountry: Latvia\nYears at USC: 2018-2022\nResults: Fell in quarterfinals of Olympic Tournament\n\nIn Graudina\u2019s four years at USC, she racked up a 122-9 individual record and was a four-time AVCA All-American. She won Pac-12 Pair of the Year three times with three different partners and was named the Pac-12 Player of the Year three times. The Latvian is one of the 10 winningest women\u2019s beach volleyball players in NCAA history. In 2020, Graudina became the first NCAA beach volleyball player to make the Olympics. She finished fourth with partner Anastasija Samoilova and was named top scorer of the tournament. Graudina will again partner with Samoilova. Graudina was also named as Latvia\u2019s flag bearer for the opening ceremonies.\n\nKelly Cheng and Sara Hughes\nCountry: USA\nYears at USC: 2014-2017\nResults: Fell in quarterfinals of Olympic Tournament\n\nThe story of Cheng and Hughes goes all the way back to their times at USC, meaning their stories cannot be told separately. The duo both started all four of their years with the Trojans and won three national championships, two NCAA and one AVCA. At USC, the pair went 147-4 with a 103-match win streak thrown in there. While Cheng competed in the Tokyo Olympics without Hughes, the former Trojans are back together to compete in this edition of the Games. They came into the Olympics ranked as the No. 6 pair in the world according to the International Federation of Volleyball. Across pro events, Cheng and Hughes have 13 victories as a pair and will look to carry over that success in the Olympics. Cheng\u2019s husband, Jordan, will act as the co-head coach for the duo.\n\nAndy Benesh\nCountry: USA\nYears at USC: 2014-2017\nResults: Fell in quarterfinals of Olympic Tournament\n\nAndy Benesh is set to make his Olympics debut after a standout indoor career as part of the USC men\u2019s volleyball team. At USC, he was a four-year starter at middle blocker for the Trojans from 2014 to 2017 and a team captain during his senior season. During his time as a Trojan, Benesh totaled 658 kills and had a .415 hitting percentage. He also had 346 total blocks at USC, and was a two-time AVCA All-American honorable mention in 2015 and 2017, while making the MPSF All-Conference second team during his senior year. Benesh has been playing professional beach volleyball since 2018, competing with UCLA indoor volleyball alum Mile Partain. After qualifying for Paris back in May, Benesh and Partain are now the youngest duo in the history of Olympic beach volleyball since its debut in 1996.\n\nIzac Carracher\nCountry: Australia\nYears at USC: 2019\nResults: Eliminated in pool play of Olympic Tournament\n\nIn his freshman year in 2019, Carracher was an outside hitter for USC and played in five matches after playing for the Sydney Warriors, an Australian Volleyball League team, in high school. But after his lone year with the Trojans, Carracher traveled back to Australia to attend the University of Sydney and met his partner Mark Nicolaidis, who is also making his Olympic debut during these Games. The duo became partners in 2022, winning gold at their first international competition at the Gold Coast Beach Pro Tour Futures event. They later placed ninth at the 2022 World Championships in Rome. Carracher and Nicolaidis are Australia\u2019s second-youngest pair to compete in the Olympic Games.\n\nMicah Christenson\nCountry: USA\nYears at USC: 2012-2015\nResults: Won a bronze medal with Team USA\n\nThe lone former Trojan competing in indoor volleyball, Christenson is once again joining Team USA as a setter, playing in his third Olympics. The 2015 graduate was the starting setter for his four years at USC and a co-captain for three. During his junior year at age 20, he joined the U.S. men\u2019s national team, making him the youngest starting setter to compete for the team. While at USC, he also earned the 2012 National Newcomer of the Year title after helping his team qualify for the NCAA Championship match. Christenson had such a stellar career that he won the first-ever Off The Block Lloy Ball Award, given to the best collegiate setter across the country. Christenson has had a long and successful career since he started playing in 2005 at Asics Quicksilver. He led his high school volleyball team to a State Championship title in 2011 and won a bronze medal at his first Olympic Games in 2016.\n\nWomen\u2019s Rowing\n\nChloe Brew\nCountry: Great Britain\nYears at USC: 2015-2019\nResults: Finished No. 6 in B Final for Coxless Pair\n\nBrew feels right at home in the Olympic Village. Not only is her father also an Olympian \u2014 a swimmer for Great Britain in Seoul at the 1988 Games \u2014 but she is returning to the British rowing team for her second Olympic showcase. Throughout her Trojan career and at the Tokyo Games, she has competed with the women\u2019s 8+ boat. But, in Paris, she will be competing in the women\u2019s coxless pairs. During her time at USC, Brew led the Women of Troy to placements at the NCAA Championships in 2016 and 2018. She studied Law, History, and Culture as an undergraduate while earning various titles, like All-American honors her senior year. Since graduating, Brew has focused on her professional athletic career, competing in nearly eight international contests for Great Britain.\n\nNikoline Laidlaw\nCountry: Denmark\nYears at USC: 2016-2018\nResults: Eliminated in repechage round of women\u2019s eight\n\nBefore finding herself competing as a Dane, Laidlaw tried out twice for the U23 Great Britain rowing team during her time at USC after being born in Scotland. But, in true \u201cFight On\u201d spirit, Laidlaw\u2019s teammates at USC put her in contact with the Danish coaches. As Laidlaw was eligible with dual citizenship, she qualified and was selected for the Danish rowing team. Since then, she has competed with Denmark\u2019s women\u2019s Varsity 8. Paris 2024 is her Olympic inauguration. At USC, Laidlaw was a Pac-12 All-Academic Honorable Mention, along with guiding the team to the NCAA Championships her senior year after transferring over from UConn for her junior year. As an undergraduate, she studied environmental studies with the aspiration of becoming a marine biologist. She has competed with the Danish team now since 2017, notably placing first in the 2018 European Rowing Championships and the 2022 World Rowing Championships.\n\nAstrid Steensberg\nCountry: Denmark\nYears at USC: 2016-2020\nResults: Finished No. 2 in B Final for women\u2019s four event\n\nSteensberg was a superstar for the Trojans, but it didn\u2019t stop there, as she has become a pivotal part for the Danish rowing time. She has competed with the Danes since the 2014 World Rowing Junior Championships. Since then, she has competed in over 20 international championships and just shy of 70 events within these tournaments. In Paris, she\u2019ll be competing in the Women\u2019s Four. Her stardom helped her succeed as a Trojan, as well. She rowed for the Varsity 8 for her entire collegiate career, being named a Pac-12 All-Academic Second Team member by her junior year. During her sophomore year, she was part of the pack that took the Trojans to the NCAA Championships and placed No. 12 overall nationally. After studying health and human sciences at USC, she continued her collegiate rowing career and received her master\u2019s from the University of Copenhagen.\n\nCaroline Munch\nCountry: Denmark\nYears at USC: 2022-present\nResults: Eliminated in repechage round of women\u2019s eight\n\nCompeting with fellow Trojan Nikoline Laidlaw, Munch is no longer listed on the roster, but did compete at USC for one year. A Bj\u00e6verskov, Denmark native, Munch rowed for USC\u2019s Varsity Eight boat at the NCAA Championships as merely a freshman in 2023. A first-time Olympian, Munch competed in 14 regattas with USC. Danish rowers are well represented for the Trojans, as Munch is one of three USC rowers who are competing for Denmark. She and Laidlaw are in the same boat at the Games and while they did not compete at USC together, the duo still has that Trojan connection.\n\nRadka Novotnikova\nCountry: Czech Republic\nYears at USC: 2015-2019\nResults: Finished No. 4 in women\u2019s pair B Finals\n\nNovotnikova started rowing on the Varsity 8 boat for the Trojans as merely a freshman, even making it to the NCAA Championships that season. While she was never able to take home an NCAA title in her career with USC, she was named to the Pac-12 All-Conference Team and earned All-American honors as a junior. Now Novotnikova enters her first Olympics, competing for her birthplace in the Czech Republic. She is participating in pairs rowing with Pavlina Flamikova, another first-time Olympian. The duo went to the A Final at the 2024 European Rowing Championships, finishing fourth in the event to get them ready for the Games.\n\nWomen\u2019s soccer and basketball\n\nCroix Bethune\nCountry: USA\nYears at USC: 2019-2022\nResults: Won a gold medal with Team USA\n\nBethune spent four years with the Trojans between 2019 and 2022, but did not wrap up her collegiate career with USC. The midfielder transferred away to Georgia to reunite with former USC head coach Keidane McAlpine, who took over the Bulldogs\u2019 program in 2021. Bethune was one of the Trojans\u2019 best players when she was with the team, earning Pac-12 Midfielder of the Year in her final two seasons at USC. That success continued with the Bulldogs, as Bethune was named the SEC Tournament MVP this past fall. Georgia made it to the NCAA tournament, winning its first two games, but fell to Clemson in the third round despite Bethune notching a goal to put her squad ahead in the 84th minute. A native of Alpharetta, Georgia, Bethune was drafted by the NWSL\u2019s Washington Spirit this past January. She was named an alternate to the U.S. women\u2019s national team, but got the call to the active roster to open up group play in the Olympics.\n\nSimi Awujo\nCountry: Canada\nYears at USC: 2021-present\nResults: Fell in Olympic Tournament quarterfinals\n\nAwujo will be making her second major tournament appearance for team Canada and first Olympics appearance after playing in the 2023 World Cup. The midfielder is entering her fourth year at USC after starting 15 of 18 games for the Trojans last season. Last year with USC, Awujo registered two assists and was named to the Pac-12 First Team, playing 1,250 minutes. Awujo earned her call up to the Canadian national team in 2022, despite having eligibility to play with Nigeria, the United States, and Canada. Awujo was named the women\u2019s 2022 Canada Soccer Young Player of the Year and registered her first goal in international play during a 5-0 win against Australia in December 2023.\n\nNicole Payne\nCountry: Nigeria\nYears at USC: 2022\nResults: Went winless in pool play\n\nPayne will be making her first Olympic appearance after three years with the Nigerian national team. The defender was born in Birmingham, Alabama, but her parents are both Nigerian, allowing her to play for the African country. Payne only played one year with the Trojans after playing three years with West Virginia, registering three goals in 16 appearances for the Trojans in 2022. Professionally, Payne plays for the Portland Thorns of the NWSL and was recently signed permanently to Portland after being on loan from Paris Saint-Germain of the Division 1 F\u00e9minine in France. Payne was signed by Paris Saint-Germain in 2023 directly following her career with the Trojans.\n\nAmy Okonkwo\nCountry: Nigeria\nYears at USC: 2014-2015\nResults: Became first Olympic team from Africa to make quarterfinals, but did not advance further\n\nEven though Okonkwo did not finish her collegiate career at USC, it is where it started. The forward played 27 games with the Trojans her freshman year before transferring to TCU and playing there for three years. As a horn frog, Okonkwo won BIG 12 Sixth Player of the Year in 2018. After leaving TCU, the California native competed in the 2020 Olympics and 2021 Afrobasket with the Nigerian team. She notched eight points across three games at the Tokyo Games, but Nigeria did not tally a win to continue its winless streak dating to the 2004 Athens Olympics. Okonkwo has been playing overseas in Spain and France since competing in the 2020 Olympics.\n```"}

The punishments for current students include official warnings on their student records and mandated essays that must be \u201cremorseful,\u201d said Le\u00f3n Prieto, a junior studying neuroscience. Prieto was arrested in April when the Los Angeles Police Department shut down an encampment that lasted less than 12 hours.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t come to understand why we were there in the first place,\u201d said Prieto, who uses they/them pronouns. \u201cI kept telling [OCE] that I was there for my community and that LAPD was endangering the students but I could tell they already had the decisions made.\u201d\n\nAnnenberg Media has conducted interviews all summer with a handful of students going through this process, and with faculty members advising those students. Over the last few months, they detailed the tone of disciplinary hearings, evidence presented and their communication with administrators.\n\nWhen asked about the disciplinary outcomes, a USC spokesperson would only say that most cases \u201care at or near completion.\u201d The spokesperson declined to comment specifically on individuals, citing privacy, and instead issued a statement: \u201cWe take any violation of university policies seriously, and carefully evaluate each matter based on its particular facts and circumstances. We have made extraordinary efforts to complete our investigations and internal disciplinary processes as quickly as possible ... [W]e encourage students to contact the Office for Community Expectations directly if they have any questions. We have prepared additional FAQs about what students can expect when engaging with the university\u2019s disciplinary process.\u201d\n\nOrganized by the USC Divest from Death Coalition, students first began occupying Alumni Park at about 7 a.m. on April 24, one of the first occupations in support of Gaza on a West Coast college campus before the movement spread across the country and attracted international attention. The Coalition said it would continue its occupation until its demands were met. These demands included a \u201ccomplete academic boycott of Israel,\u201d to \u201cprotect free speech on campus\u201d and \u201cfull amnesty\u201d for those participating in pro-Palestinian activism.\n\nThe students said they were motivated by university administrators\u2019 decision not to allow valedictorian Asna Tabassum to speak at commencement over what USC called \u201csubstantial\u201d threats to security. LAPD arrested 93 people at the April occupation, including nearly 50 students. That evening, students re-occupied another part of campus, and eventually re-built the encampment at Alumni Park. LAPD officers in riot gear cleared that occupation in the early hours of May 5, and USC placed at least 29 students on an interim suspension.\n\nOne faculty member who was at the encampment on May 5 now faces disciplinary hearings by the Office of Professionalism and Ethics, said Tara McPherson, a cinema and media studies professor. McPherson is also a member of Faculty for Justice in Palestine who has advised students throughout the OCE process.\n\nUSC also canceled the main commencement ceremony, closed all but three entrances to campus and instituted bag and ID checks. Fences went up around major routes throughout campus, blocking most green spaces. Alumni Park remained fenced off Wednesday. The university announced Wednesday that all campus entrances would open August 15.\n\nA spokesperson for the USC Divest from Death Coalition said all 51 students who were arrested in April face disciplinary action from OCE. In total, the Coalition said more than 75 students \u2014 including those who were later placed on interim suspension \u2014 face discipline.\n\nThose suspended in May, about 30 students, remain on suspension and are still not allowed on campus, the spokesperson said. Their hearings began in July and are ongoing, most meeting with OCE between one to three times.\n\nThe spokesperson, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they fear retaliation and possible policy violations, said there has been no word on when disciplinary outcomes might be announced or whether those on suspension will be allowed back onto campus in the fall.\n\nOne student arrested in April was placed on a two-semester probation, and despite having graduated in May, their diploma is still being withheld. At least two students who work as resident assistants and received free housing through the position have not had \u201cany real clarity about potential outcomes\u201d regarding their job security, said Tara McPherson, a cinema and media studies professor.\n\nMcPherson is also a member of Faculty for Justice in Palestine who has advised students throughout the OCE process. Both McPherson and Prieto confirmed that one student was told by OCE that the matter would be determined by the Office of Residential Education, while Residential Education told another that OCE would make the final decision.\n\nPrieto said students have the option to appeal their disciplinary outcomes, but they worry that it would likely result in an unchanged or more severe outcome.\n\nThe disciplinary outcomes still technically fall in line with President Carol Folt\u2019s promise to Coalition negotiators that no students would face academic consequences for participating in the protests.\n\nSince April, dozens of faculty have signed open letters to Folt and Provost Andrew Guzman supporting students\u2019 freedom of speech and questioning the OCE process. On May 4, 29 professors from the Gould School of Law signed an open letter to the administration defending free speech on campus.\n\nIn early May, a coalition of faculty staged a rally and sit-in in front of USC administrators\u2019 offices in Bovard Auditorium. On August 1, more than 180 faculty and staff signed a letter posted on the Divest from Death Coalition Instagram expressing concern about and demanding clarity into the OCE process. The letter also condemns the deployment of LAPD on campus, current campus security measures and the \u201cmilitarization\u201d of campus.\n\nSome students and faculty involved in the disciplinary process said they feel that OCE did not completely address their concerns despite a lengthy hearing process over the summer.\n\n\u201cUniversity procedures can happen in much more opaque and nebulous ways than legal procedures,\u201d McPherson said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a standard of evidence ... they\u2019re much more subjective, and that\u2019s a real cause for concern.\u201d\n\nIn May, the arrested students were notified by email of their \u201cpossible violation(s) of the USC Student Handbook\u201d when they \u201crefused to follow multiple university administrator instructions to leave Alumni Park, which had been reserved for another event.\u201d According to the email obtained by Annenberg Media, OCE named seven sections of the handbook, including disorderly conduct, unauthorized entry/access and free expression.\n\nStudents were given until May 24 to accept a \u201cproposed resolution\u201d from OCE. That resolution asked students to take responsibility for failing to comply with administrators, and to receive a formal warning on their student record. Those who were suspended after LAPD cleared the encampment in May received similar notifications.\n\nNo arrests were made that morning. If students declined OCE\u2019s proposed resolution, they were offered a full administrative review process. Most students opted for a full review, including Prieto.\n\nIn their first meeting with OCE, Prieto was told the consequences could range from nothing to expulsion, they said. Then, on July 22, arrested students were notified that OCE had received \u201cnew information.\u201d They were emailed a log of video timestamps with notes describing a KTLA live broadcast of the student arrests and were invited to a follow-up hearing.\n\nThose notes state the time law enforcement issued dispersal orders, describe the process as \u201cnot tense, not hostile and relatively peaceful\u201d and that students were \u201cpeacefully turning themselves over to officers.\u201d Several students told reporters at the time that they did not hear officers giving dispersal orders in the chaotic situation.\n\nPrieto said the first discipline \u2014 the warning, the essay and a statement attesting to reading the student handbook \u2014 came on July 25 at one of these follow-ups. Prieto was instructed at their secondary disciplinary hearing on August 2 that students must be \u201cremorseful\u201d and write about \u201cwhat they\u2019ve learned.\u201d\n\nOCE has requested similar essays in the past from students who were arrested on suspicion of other crimes. But Prieto and their peers are concerned about the essay prompt, and said they have been advised by legal counsel that their papers could be used in a criminal case by LAPD.\n\nPrieto said they were told by OCE that if the university was subpoenaed, they would have to share students\u2019 essays with law enforcement \u2014 and that if LAPD asked OCE not to tell students that their essays were being used in criminal proceedings, OCE would have to comply.\n\nThe university did not specifically comment on whether they would work with law enforcement if asked to hand over evidence for criminal proceedings.\n\nAs for any charges, Prieto was told at a June hearing in criminal court that LAPD had up to a year to charge students for trespassing.\n\nStudents and faculty said they feel the disciplinary outcomes reflect a lack of understanding by the university of their protest cause.\n\nReflecting on the process, Prieto said they feel removed from the USC community. \u201cI don\u2019t really see USC the same,\u201d Prieto said. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like I belong here, or am respected here as a student. But also, I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\n\nMany faculty remain disappointed in senior administration. \u201cTo have the university not see that students were doing really profound forms of learning in the space, it\u2019s disappointing,\u201d said McPherson. \u201cWe all know that [Folt] never went to the encampment, nor the provost to meet with the students ... Despite it being a two-minute walk, so many of the students feel the administration is out of touch with students\u2019 moral and ethical commitments, and are disappointed that there was not an attempt by the senior administration to talk to the students in an open and transparent way.\u201d\n\nAfter the arrests and once the second encampment was established, Folt met with the encampment organizers twice, both times at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and not at the site of the protests. Divest from Death representatives said at the time they were not satisfied by either of the discussions.\n\nFolt later said at an Academic Senate meeting that she regretted never visiting the encampment.\n\nLooking forward, McPherson said she is motivated by her students. \u201cI\u2019ve had amazing students throughout my career, but young people today have a clear-eyed understanding of the gap between the promises of democracy and what our world is delivering.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Freddie Freeman)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler\nAugust 09, 2024 at 5:42 am PDT\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers dropped two games against the Philadelphia Phillies as their pitching woes continue. With the additions of Tyler Glasnow and Clayton Kershaw, LA looked rock solid in hopes of protecting their NL West lead. The teams\u2019 aces, though, are one of the problems as they still struggle to go deep in many games. Kershaw and Gavin Stone only made it through four-and-two-thirds innings before being pulled in Games 2 and 3, while the only win saw Glasnow go six innings.\n\nLA\u2019s issue right now is that Kershaw is not performing like he used to. With Father Time against him, the 16-year Dodger is showing cracks that the opposition has been exposing. His four-seam fastball is not fast enough to fool any batters, and other pitches do not have enough movement to force a swing. After another surgery this past season, Kershaw needs to find his groove or think about hanging up the cleats on a Hall-of-Fame career.\n\nIn his first return to the mound, Brusdar Graterol threw eight pitches before being escorted off the field. The promising return of a powerful relief pitcher spelled great things for the Dodgers, but yet another injury to the lineup keeps holding the team back. Manager Dave Roberts reported that Graterol has a grade 1 hamstring strain, meaning he will likely return to the lineup later this season.\n\nThe only victory for LA in the series was during Game 1 when Freddie Freeman made his emotional return to the lineup after his son was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome. He was awarded a standing ovation from the fans and opposition alike during his first at-bat of the game and hit a single later in the third inning of the game. The Dodgers put up four runs during the third and rode the wave to a 5-3 win.\n\nThe Phillies came out swinging during Game 2, recording 14 hits in a 6-2 LA loss. Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez tallied his 25th home run of the season, but it was not enough as Philadelphia ran away with the game in the top of the ninth inning. Phillies second-baseman Edmundo Sosa and designated hitter Kyle Schwarber smashed back-to-back home runs, thoroughly putting the game out of reach for the Dodgers.\n\nGame 3 was another slugfest for the Phillies as they scored nine unanswered runs to take the series. Schwarber had a career night, going four-for-four with three homers and seven RBIs. LA was destroyed once again in hitting, giving up 23 total bases compared to their nine. The Dodgers also left seven runners on base, an anomaly for a high-scoring squad.\n\nThe motto, \u201cObjects in the mirror are closer than they appear,\u201d is a statement LA needs to take to heart. As the Dodgers keep dropping games, a blistering-hot San Diego Padres squad is flying toward the top of the NL West. The Padres are 13-3 in their past 16 games, while the Dodgers are a meager 8-8. What was initially a stable lead has quickly become a race that the Dodgers could very well lose. With its talented roster, LA cannot afford to be first-round exits, or worse, miss the playoffs entirely due to a lapse in focus late in the season.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of the San Francisco Giants and Blake Snell @sfgiants and @snellzilla4)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler August 09, 2024 at 5:37 am PDT\n\nThe White Sox win before setting MLB record\nThe Chicago White Sox won a game for the first time since July. The longest losing streak in modern-day MLB is 23 games, set by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1961. The White Sox nearly got there, but after 21 losses they finally beat the Oakland A\u2019s. The White Sox\u2019s issue is that they have just 360 total runs this season\u2014nearly 60 behind the next-worst Miami Marlins. The squad\u2019s struggles in the batters box are not limited to runs. The team is also the worst in all of the main hitting categories: batting average, on-base percentage and slugging. In an attempt to change the team\u2019s dynamic, the office fired manager Pedro Grifol, hoping they could turn the team around and avoid the lowest record of all time.\n\nPadres begin to look like a new team\nThe San Diego Padres are 13-3 since the All-Star break and are showing no signs of slowing down. Everything has seemed to click at once, and with more crucial signings over the last month, the team has found what it needs for a deep postseason run. No team has been scoring better than the Padres at 5.81 runs per game since the break. Padres who are expected to hit bombs have been doing so: Manny Machado, Jurickson Profar, Luis Arraez and Xander Bogaerts since his return. Donovan Solano has been an instrumental part of their explosive offense. The third baseman is batting .314 with a .789 OPS and .424 slugging. For a player that typically plays behind Machado, San Diego has numerous options to optimize the already booming lineup. The Padres also signed closer Tanner Scott from the Marlins. Since the trade at the end of the deadline, Scott has closed out three games with four strikeouts, giving up just two hits. The team briefly struck the injury plague but hopes to have starters Yu Darvish and Joe Musgrove in the lineup soon. Once they return, the Padres\u2019 chances at a deep postseason run will look even better.\n\nSnell on fire since returning to the lineup\nAfter a Cy Young winning season, Blake Snell looked shaky after joining the San Francisco Giants this year. He lost his first three games in a row and was later sidelined due to a groin injury. Snell was out for the entire month of June, but upon return, he began to show that same dominance on the mound he had last year. Snell\u2019s success started against the Twins when he threw eight strikeouts on 80 pitches. Two starts later, Snell battled the Colorado Rockies, throwing for six innings and striking out 15 batters. Snell kept the momentum going against the Cincinnati Reds, throwing a complete game no-hitter, retiring 11 and walking three. This is the 18th solo no-no in San Francisco Giants history and the first of Snell\u2019s growingly historic career. His next start came against the Washington Nationals, where he rose to the occasion and threw eight more punchouts, giving up four hits in six innings. Snell has been an animal on the mound since his return, with a 1.15 ERA and 49 strikeouts in six starts. Although it will be hard for the Giants to jump into a Wild Card spot, Snell\u2019s dominance certainly puts the squad in a better position to do so.\n\nThe double play going into the weekend\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers face the Pirates at Dodger Stadium this weekend. MLB\u2019s best rookie Paul Skenes is set to pitch against the dangerous Dodgers lineup in Game 2. When Skenes threw against LA earlier this year, he gave up six hits and three runs on eight strikeouts. Prediction: The Dodgers will have no problem with Skenes and the Pirates, and will take all three games. The next matchup to pay attention to is the White Sox-Cubs Crosstown Classic. The series will not have much of an impact on the playoffs, but bragging rights are still at stake. The Cubs are five games back from a Wild Card bid and would have to jump four good teams, something that\u2019s extremely unlikely. The White Sox are playing for pride at this point, as they are 36.5 games back from an AL bid. Prediction: The Cubs win two out of three. Last weekend, the Phillies lost their three-game series and the Diamondbacks won theirs, moving my prediction total to 3-9-2.\n```"}

While staples like Trader Joe\u2019s and Cafe Dulce are thriving, other campus-adjacent retailers, like Pizza Please and Honeybird, shut their doors for good recently. Here\u2019s everything Trojans will miss when they return to USC, and some new stores they can look forward to.\n\nWhat\u2019s New:\nAsian market Yoboseyo Superette opened under the same ownership as Dulce\nFans of Dulce\u2019s popular matcha lattes will be excited to hear that a new shop, with the same husband-and-wife co-owners as the cafe, is now serving teas and boba in the Village. Yoboseyo Superette opened on July 20, and offers specialty drinks and Asian-inspired snacks and goods. Nearly all of the products are made by other small businesses.\n\n\u201cThis is a new sister concept [to Dulce] called Yoboseyo, we started about a year and a half ago in Little Tokyo,\u201d General Manager Sam Hong said. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty successful, at least with the community. They love that there\u2019s this mini-mart aspect of it, that they can get Korean goods and other Asian makers and so forth.\u201d\n\nYoboseyo is currently open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., though Hong says the shop plans to extend its hours to late nights once the fall semester starts.\n\nSome of the goods that Yoboseyo Superette offers in its mini-market section. (Photo by Sophie Sullivan)\n\nSephora opened in a long vacant storefront\nMega makeup retailer Sephora opened its doors in the Village on July 26. A brunch spot called The Butcher, The Baker, The Cappucino Maker (BBCM) formerly occupied the space, but closed in 2019 and sued USC for promissory fraud, misrepresentation and breach of contract alongside Rance\u2019s Chicago Pizza. The two restaurants alleged that USC promised them students would be able to use dining dollars to pay for meals, justifying the above market rent prices. They also claimed that the university didn\u2019t disclose that there would be a dining hall in the village. This storefront sat empty until now.\n\nSimply Nail Bar expanded\nMore availability opened up last week at Simply Nail Bar after their expansion. The salon, which provides manicures and pedicures, waxing, eyelash extensions and other beauty services, is \u201cjust waiting for more people to sign up for appointments\u201d according to a receptionist. New barbers and an esthetician joined the store, and students can book with them through their website.\n\nSheikh, an athletic clothing and shoe store, opened\nOn April 24, Sheikh joined the USC Village. The brand is a retailer for big names like Vans and Nike, and sells primarily shoes, athletic clothing and jerseys. Store manager Sandra Velasquez said the location has an open house coming up and hopes to partner with USC for cultural events.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just waiting for all of you guys to come back to school, we can\u2019t wait to see new faces,\u201d Velasquez said. \u201cWe want to provide the best service that we can and obviously the coolest shoes that we got.\u201d\n\nThe interior of Sheikh, a shoe and athletic clothing retailer that opened in the USC Village in April. (Photo by Sophie Sullivan)\n\nWhat\u2019s gone:\nStudy Hall closed, Roadside Taco opened in its place\nStudy Hall wasn\u2019t in the Village, but its legacy as a favorite Trojan hangout makes its closure on the eve of its 10 year anniversary just as relevant to returning students. The sports bar and eatery, located on the busy corner of Hoover and West 29th across from Greek Row, permanently shut its doors this summer. It was quickly replaced in early July by Roadside Taco, a Mexican restaurant with another location in Studio City, and will open for business on August 15.\n\nStudy Hall first opened in September 2014, and had a brief closing scare in late 2019. It ultimately survived after students created a petition to keep it in business. The site is located just two blocks from the Village.\n\nStout Burgers and Beers closed after a short tenure\nStout Burgers and Beers, a classic pub-style American restaurant, shut its doors this summer after a short stint in the village. A representative from Stout confirmed that all locations besides the restaurant in Hollywood are closing. Previously, the space was occupied by a Wahlburgers location, a burger chain created by the Wahlberg family (Ronnie Wahlberg of New Kids on the Block, actor Mark Wahlberg), which closed three years ago. It is unclear what will replace it.\n\nHoneybird location still empty\nHoneybird, a restaurant serving Southern-inspired breakfast and lunch in the Village, closed in March after six years at the location. \u201cIt is with a heavy heart that we announce that we will be closing our USC Village location,\u201d the restaurant wrote in a statement on their website. \u201cWe have been fortunate enough to have operated since the inception of the Village but unfortunately, as the years have gone by we have seen less and less business which ultimately has led us to make the difficult decision of closing this location.\u201d The storefront remains empty as of August.\n\nWorkshop Salon + Boutique closed, now Target storage\nWorkshop Salon + Boutique, which opened in 2019, left the USC Village in June, citing rising costs as the reason they didn\u2019t renew their lease. \u201cWhen it came time to renew our lease, we decided not to,\u201d the salon wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cThe cost of supplies, utilities, products and wages have increased tremendously. In order to continue business, we would need to raise our prices significantly, which ultimately we decided against.\u201d Target is now using the space as storage ahead of the back-to-school rush.\n\nPizza Please becomes second pizza joint to shut down in same space\nAccording to employees at the neighboring restaurant City Taco, Pizza Please closed just last week. The restaurant opened a year and a half ago, and was the only eatery in the village to offer pizza. The storefront was previously occupied by Rance\u2019s Chicago Pizza, which closed in 2019 and subsequently sued USC for $5 million alongside BBCM.\n\nThe Sammiche Shoppe\u2019s storefront remains vacant\nL.A. food blogger @30daysoftakeout reported in October 2023 that The Sammiche Shop was shutting its doors after a year of business in the Village, writing that the closure was \u201cunfortunately due to lack of business and staffing issues.\u201d The shop opened in September after its Inglewood location catered an event for USC\u2019s Sol Price School of Public Policy, according to the Daily Trojan. The storefront remains empty, though employees at neighboring restaurant Il Giardino said they think it will become a burger restaurant, as their chefs saw fryer equipment being moved in this summer.\n```"}

(Photo by Sareen Habeshian)\n\nBy Hali Mecklin August 07, 2024 at 3:01 pm PDT\n\nOver the summer, Annenberg Media met weekly with Dr. Van Orman, USC\u2019s Chief Health Officer, to chat about student health and safety. She shared her biggest areas of concern, what patterns she sees and what resources USC has to keep Trojans healthy. We\u2019ve compiled a list of the five topics that came up the most in conversation with Van Orman, and what resources USC has to go along with each potential concern. Here\u2019s what students should be aware of, so move-in stress can be limited to landlords and class schedules, not health and well-being.\n\n1. COVID-19\n\nYes, COVID-19 is still a concern in the latter half of 2024. Earlier in the summer, we reported that the FLiRT variant was causing a significant spike nationwide, specifically in the L.A. area. Over a month later, this is still true, and numbers are still steadily increasing. According to L.A. County wastewater data, the average number of daily cases last week was 413; When we last reported on COVID-19 in late June, the daily average was 154.\n\n\u201cUnlike other respiratory viruses that we know follow certain patterns, we\u2019re still learning COVID\u2019s pattern,\u201d Van Orman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet what the seasonality of it is going to be, but we have seen over the last four or five years, these periods where we have increased activity [are] usually related to the emergence of a new variant.\u201d\n\nVan Orman predicts a USC-specific spike related to move-in, much like what we\u2019ve seen in previous years. She recommends those who are immunocompromised get last year\u2019s booster vaccine if they haven\u2019t already, and for other populations to wait until the newest booster to come out, which will likely be more effective against newer variants. If students do come down with COVID, she said to isolate and mask up.\n\n2. Air quality\n\nFrom frequent fires to city smog, L.A. isn\u2019t known for having the cleanest air\u2014our baseline is in the yellow zone, or moderately poor. Even beyond the city, Trojans in California have most likely experienced some form of bad air quality due to an accelerated wildfire season, including the ongoing Park Fire, the fourth largest blaze in the state\u2019s history.\n\nVan Orman warns that people with preexisting health conditions can be affected even by low levels of poor air quality, and everyone is impacted when conditions worsen. USC\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Study is a well-known ongoing project looking into the long-term impact of poor air quality on children\u2019s respiratory health, involving over 12,000 subjects in Southern California. It has found links to increased respiratory infections, asthma and lung damage, and its findings led to changes in state and federal air quality guidelines.\n\n\u201cWhen we do have periods of poor air quality, [pay attention] and modify your activity,\u201d Van Orman recommended. That includes \u201cstaying indoors, avoiding strenuous activities during periods of low air quality, looking for places that are air conditioned\u201d and using an N95 mask if you have to be outdoors.\n\n3. Extreme heat\n\nYou\u2019ve likely seen it on the news this summer\u2014the U.S. is experiencing extreme heat waves. Across the nation, advisories warn against spending prolonged periods outside, and some regions reached their highest temperatures ever in recent months. July 22 was Earth\u2019s hottest day on record, according to NASA.\n\nWhile Los Angeles doesn\u2019t get as hot as some parts of inland California, heat-related illness is still a risk, especially in the latter summer months and early fall.\n\n\u201cIn young adults, the dangerous parts of heat tend to be when people are engaging in strenuous exercise during heat warning periods,\u201d Van Orman said. \u201cStay hydrated, really avoid physical activity between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., take heat warnings seriously. Because even if you\u2019re the healthiest, fittest person, you can be overcome by heat exhaustion, and more seriously by heat stroke.\u201d\n\nVan Orman also recommends students remember that it takes roughly two weeks to acclimate to a hotter climate, and to take things easy for those first 14 days back in L.A.\n\n4. Mental health\n\nThe beginning of the school year is undeniably a stressful time for students. Whether it\u2019s returning Trojans struggling with new classes or freshmen trying to adjust to the second biggest city in the U.S., all USC students should be aware of the resources available to them through the school.\n\n\u201cI encourage people to take a look around the resources we have. Everything from just an online chat, where you can get a little bit of support, to our \u2018Let\u2019s talk [sessions],\u2019 which are really just drop-ins to have a casual conversation, to a single session to talk to a therapist about a concern you might be having, to actually kind of going through the process and getting started with full mental health [programs],\u201d Van Orman said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of ways to enter and options, and so don\u2019t hesitate to look at those and think about which one might be right for you.\u201d\n\nVan Orman also emphasized that USC\u2019s mental health programs typically don\u2019t have a long wait time, and students can secure telehealth or in person appointments in less than a week. USC\u2019s counseling and mental health services are listed on their website. The school also has a 24/7 crisis intervention text and phone line: Students text TROJAN to 741741 or call (213) 740-9355.\n\n5. CARE-SC\n\nThis year, USC\u2019s Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention program has a new name. Formerly RSVP, the program\u2019s acronym is now CARE-SC, standing for Confidential Advocacy, Resources and Education Support Center. The program still offers the same resources to students who have experienced relationship violence and sexual assault, but changed its name after focus groups revealed that students didn\u2019t know what it was.\n\nVan Orman pointed to CARE-SC\u2019s 24/7 advocates as a unique resource for those seeking harm-based support.\n\n\u201cAny student who has experienced gender or power based harm can reach out to us at the same number, 213-740-WELL, and be connected to an advocate that can assist them with truly confidential resources and support while they understand their options for reporting, for talking to law enforcement, for talking to campus, to getting medical care.\u201d\n\nThese resources are available to all students at no cost.

The 2024 Masters champion stood atop the podium bearing a gold medal after Saturday\u2019s final round of Olympic golf. An extension of the now concluded major season, the Olympics made for an exciting and competitive four days of golf. It also made Scheffler the outright golfer of the year, despite a career year for two-time major champion Xander Schauffele.\n\nScheffler stood at 10 under par at the end of Friday\u2019s round, while leaders Jon Rahm and Schauffele topped the leaderboard at 14 under par. Following solid performances during the first three rounds, it looked like 2021 Olympic gold medalist Schauffele would defend his title. But like Scheffler\u2019s been doing all year, he mounted yet another comeback, carding six birdies throughout the final nine holes.\n\nAfter The Open at Royal Troon, Schauffele and Scheffler were neck-and-neck for the \u201cgolfer of the year\u201d title. Scheffler has a clear case, winning six major events on the PGA Tour. But there\u2019s also an easy argument for Schauffele, who won his first major title at the PGA Championship in May and earned his second at Troon last month. Both golfers have double-digit, top-10 finishes, which is at least five more than the next best player. They\u2019re also ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in scoring average.\n\nEven though Bryson DeChambeau won the U.S. Open, no other golfer has been in the same realm as Schauffele and Scheffler this season. Scheffler, 28, and Schauffele, 30, aren\u2019t going away anytime soon, either. Schauffele seems to be as confident as ever after winning his first major, and any previous pressure on him has been reduced or is gone entirely. Scheffler, on the other hand, has always looked calm and collected since he turned pro in 2018. His win at the 2022 Masters began what has been an ongoing period of dominance, where he has been in contention at tournaments week-in and week-out.\n\nSchauffele and Scheffler\u2019s success, however, is taking place during a rough period for golf. The discussions surrounding a LIV-PGA Tour merger have distracted players like Rory McIlroy and Patrick Cantlay, who have been on the PGA Tour\u2019s player advisory council. Though McIlroy has since left the council, it clearly affected his playing ability and caused the majority of his interactions with the media to be focused on a potential merger, rather than his game. Cantlay doesn\u2019t look to be as impacted as McIlroy, but the world No. 8 has still yet to win a major tournament.\n\nWhile being on the advisory council isn\u2019t likely the entire reason why these golfers have struggled, the tiniest of distractions can cause a player\u2019s game to crumble. On the flip side, the careers of current LIV golfers have largely tanked. Rahm hasn\u2019t made any noise at a major since winning the 2023 Masters. His decision to move over to LIV was more surprising than other golfers given the timing, and it\u2019s no coincidence that he\u2019s now unable to perform at majors since he made the switch. Dustin Johnson, the 2020 Masters champion, experienced a similar downward trend, failing to make the cut at this year\u2019s Masters and U.S. Open.\n\nNow that the three playoff tournaments are the only remaining significant events this year, the focus will start to shift to if and when a merger will happen. The two tours announced that an agreement was in progress back in June 2023, but only rumors and speculation have surfaced since then. PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan hosted LIV chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan in June, but not much came out of it. Golfers like McIlroy have been vocal about the merger, saying that it\u2019d be best for the sport if the tours united as one. Not only would an agreement dissipate all the unnecessary drama and distraction, but golf fans would finally get to see the game\u2019s best golfers competing against one another every weekend instead of four times a year.\n\nThe former is important, but the latter is what ultimately would keep the game afloat. The last thing the PGA Tour wants to do is indirectly get rid of its fanbase. The creation of LIV was not the PGA\u2019s fault, but its lack of fight when trying to keep its players was disappointing, especially when they know which players the fans watch the most. Money won those players over, despite the PGA enforcing a policy prohibiting LIV golfers from returning if they flipped. Both of these combined make it all the more difficult for a merger to occur, and not much progress has been made over the last year.\n\nThe talks between the PGA and LIV won\u2019t resume until at least after the Tour Championship, and given how little movement there\u2019s been of late, there may not be any news for the near future. Whether a merger is necessary for the game to continue the success it\u2019s had or not, golf fans are becoming restless for an answer.\n```"}

(Photo by Micah Chow)\n\nBy Riley Sager August 05, 2024 at 6:41 pm PDT\n\nTeam USA is heading to the Olympics quarterfinals after a 104-83 blowout against Puerto Rico on Saturday at Pierre Mauroy Stadium in Lille, France. Head coach Steve Kerr assembled a new starting lineup for each of the team\u2019s three matchups last week against Serbia, South Sudan and Puerto Rico, reflecting the Americans\u2019 dominance and adaptability with foreign competition.\n\nKerr benched Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum in last Sunday\u2019s game against Serbia, a strong defensive and sophisticated offensive team. Against South Sudan \u2014 a much younger and faster-paced team \u2014 Kerr left Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid on the bench and adjusted the starting lineup from one of power and size to one better suited for South Sudan, which included Tatum and Los Angeles Lakers forward Anthony Davis.\n\n\u201c[South Sudan] is the fastest team in the tournament we were going to play and we wanted to match up,\u201d Kerr said on Wednesday via The Athletic. \u201cThe defense was fantastic tonight. The defensive effort was the key to the whole thing.\u201d\n\nTeam USA\u2019s adjusted lineup and fast-paced defense proved beneficial, and the team pulled off a strong victory against the South Sudanese. It was a stark contrast from the teams\u2019 showcase game on July 20, when USA pulled off a narrow 101-100 victory against the same team.\n\nKerr adjusted the starting lineup once again for Saturday\u2019s game against Puerto Rico, his fifth opening lineup in the past seven games. Player flexibility and comfortability shined on the court and displayed Team USA as a well-balanced team with six players scoring in double-digits, something the team has accomplished in each game of group play.\n\n\u201cWe got two different units that play two different ways, but we\u2019re all on the same page,\u201d Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant said on the court after Saturday\u2019s game.\n\nIt\u2019s been a week of record-breaking for the \u201cSlim Reaper,\u201d whose four boards against Puerto Rico surpassed Carmelo Anthony\u2019s record for Team USA, as Durant now has 126 career rebounds. Durant is also just six points away from tying four-time gold medalist Lisa Leslie\u2019s all-time scoring record of 488 points.\n\nPuerto Rico claimed the first quarter with an early 11-0 run, propelling them to an eight-point lead by 2:12. A timeout from Kerr and a jumper from Minnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards stopped the bleeding, but USA continued playing catchup for the rest of the period.\n\nThe U.S. trailed by four at the end of the first, but a replaced starting lineup and a new on-court dynamic left the Americans with continuous unanswered baskets. A collective effort from the bench players created an 8-0 run that secured a game-lasting lead for Team USA.\n\n\u201cI think our talent took over in the second quarter and we started to wear them down,\u201d Kerr said on Saturday via NBA.com. \u201cOur defense kicked in and we had a great quarter in which we opened up the game.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. closed out the quarter with an assertive 18-2 run, outscoring Puerto Rico 39-16 in the period. The Americans demonstrated balance on both sides of the court, shooting 54% from the field and limiting Puerto Rico to just 29%.\n\nThis chokehold didn\u2019t stop at halftime, though. Team USA pinned Puerto Rico to a mere 14 points in the third quarter, and despite shooting 1/10 from the 3PT, the team maintained its comfortable lead throughout the fourth.\n\nEdwards finished his 17 minutes of play with 26 points and Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James made his impact across the score sheet with 10 pts, six rebounds and eight assists. Team USA capitalized on Puerto Rico\u2019s defensive transition struggles, forcing 16 turnovers and scoring 22 fast break points.\n\n\u201c[The U.S.] play to their strengths,\u201d Oklahoma City Thunder and Team Canada guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said to NBC correspondent Mike Tirico on Saturday. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously very talented, very deep. You almost have to make no mistakes and play a perfect game when you play against them.\u201d\n\nTeam USA finished group play 3-0 in Group C with a plus-64 point differential. The only two other undefeated teams, Germany and Canada, earned point differentials of plus-47 and plus-20.\n\nThe \u201cwin or go home\u201d series begins Tuesday. Team USA will play Brazil in the quarterfinals at Bercy Arena in Paris, France at 12:30 p.m PST.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen almost everybody, but we haven\u2019t seen Brazil, and that\u2019s our focus,\u201d Kerr said on Saturday via fiba.com. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta be ready, they made 18 threes yesterday and they are the best offensive rebounding team in the tournament, so we have to be ready.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Jack Flaherty @dodgers @jflare)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler August 05, 2024 at 5:44 pm PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 Following their first losing month since April 2018, the Los Angeles Dodgers started August with a series win against the Oakland Athletics. LA lost four of its last five games coming into the series, and were most recently swept by the San Diego Padres in two games. The Padres effectively used the trade deadline to temporarily propel themselves into a Wild Card position, and a win over the Dodgers further solidified their position.\n\nLike the Padres, the Dodgers also effectively used the trade period and managed to snag Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Kevin Kiermaier. His first starts for the blue and white were not what the Dodgers were hoping for, though: five total at-bats with three strikeouts and a walk. LA paired Jack Flaherty and Michael Kopech, two of their newest members, with Kiermaier. Flaherty got the start on Saturday and tossed seven strikeouts in six innings. Kopech also made an appearance, throwing a 15-pitch inning and earning a strikeout of his own.\n\nThe Dodgers lost Game 1 despite solid performances from both Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez. Ohtani had three RBIs and a homer, and Home Run Derby winner Hern\u00e1ndez matched with a home run and two RBIs of his own. Dodger fans finally watched the pitchers and hitters put together a complete game for the first time this season in Game 2. Both Flaherty and Kopech held down the mound so well that typical third-baseman Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez pitched in the ninth inning. Teoscar and Enrique each went three-for-four with two runs and a walk as the team combined for 14 hits in a blowout victory.\n\nThe Dodgers offense slowed in Game 3, recording a combined six hits and nine bases in a low-scoring win. The game\u2019s deciding run was a third-inning single from Cavan Biggio that scored Jason Heyward, but it was ultimately the bullpen that secured the game, pitching four scoreless innings with six strikeouts and one hit.\n\nLA\u2019s starting rotation is starting to become clear since Flaherty was added to the roster. Now off the injured list, Tyler Glasnow and Clayton Kershaw hold up the front end, while Gavin Stone, Flaherty and rookie River Ryan anchor the lineup. Kershaw\u2019s post-injury performances are somewhat of a concern for LA, as he allowed 12 hits in seven-and-two-thirds innings, while also letting up nine runs. The Dodgers need Kershaw to get back into a groove to get through the latter part of their schedule.\n\nStone was on fire throughout May and June, tallying seven wins and an ERA of 1.97. Since then, Stone has lost three games, the most recent being Game 1 against the A\u2019s. His ERA jumped throughout that period, finishing at 6.37 over his four starts in July. Ryan has pitched just three games so far this season, but could be a star based on a small sample size. He threw eight Ks in his second start against Houston, where he recorded the first win of his career.\n\nThe combination of young pitchers such as Ryan, Stone and Flaherty as well as veteran pitchers in Kershaw and Glasnow makes for a deadly rotation that can only improve when Walker Buehler, Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Bobby Miller return from the injured list. The Dodgers look to keep their momentum going against the struggling Philadelphia Phillies.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/08/05/a-south-la-hospital-and-its-patients-battle-an-uncertain-future/", "response": "```\nA South L.A. hospital and its patients battle an uncertain future\n\nThe loss of MLK Community Hospital could leave thousands of publicly insured residents without sufficient medical attention.\n\nMercedes Kaufman was not planning on giving birth at Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital. The Hawthorne resident had hoped for a water birth, but her midwives recommended MLKCH after Kaufman experienced complications with her blood pressure in 2022. She was pleasantly surprised with her experience.\n\n\u201cI did have reservations with going to a hospital ... because of all the stories of Black women not really being protected in these type of spaces in hospitals,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I felt secure being [at MLK].\u201d\n\nAfter the comprehensive care and kind treatment Kaufman said she received in the maternity ward, she said she would \u201cdefinitely\u201d go back to MLKCH if she were to give birth again. But by this time next year, that might not be possible.\n\nMLK Community Hospital, a 131-bed hospital that primarily serves publicly insured patients like Kaufman, is running out of funds. To assist, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a motion on Jan. 24 to invest $20 million in MLKCH over the next four years. But even with $8 million infused immediately, the hospital has a little under a year left if their funding situation does not change.\n\nLocated just north of Compton in Willowbrook, MLKCH is a safety-net provider for underserved South Los Angeles communities like South Central, Carson and Inglewood. MLK Community Healthcare\u2019s 2023 Community Health Needs Assessment said that more than 90% of South L.A. residents are Hispanic or African American, and almost 96% of patients in 2022 were covered by Medi-Cal, Medicare or were uninsured.\n\nBecause the hospital mainly relies on Medicaid reimbursement \u2014 which is notoriously low in California \u2014 it has continued to take massive fiscal losses. Medi-Cal reimbursement has been unable to offset the costs of \u201cessential services such as emergency care and maternity deliveries,\u201d according to MLK Community Healthcare.\n\nKaufman is not the only mother concerned about what MLKCH closing could mean for her future. San Pedro resident Angelica Brightmon was taken to MLKCH when her water broke unexpectedly. Similar to Kaufman, Brightmon expressed that despite initially not wanting to give birth at this community hospital, she would choose MLKCH again if she were to have another baby.\n\nBrightmon was not previously aware of the hospital\u2019s precarious funding situation. Her reaction was shock and overall confusion.\n\n\u201cNo way. Oh my god,\u201d Brightmon said. \u201cI did not know that that was an issue ... I did not hear about that.\u201d\n\nMLKCH\u2019s maternity care is trusted among many women of color in the South L.A. area, especially during a pattern of California hospitals closing their maternity wards. The hospital was awarded the international Baby-Friendly designation by Baby-Friendly USA, and it has been placed on the Cal Hospital Compare Maternity Honor Roll since 2019, noted for its low C-section rates.\n\nKaufman noted that she had a sense of \u201creassurance\u201d going into MLKCH because several family members and other people told her that they had positive experiences. She also said that \u201cfeeling heard\u201d as a Black woman in a medical setting is an important factor for her.\n\n\u201cIt was just good to see a lot of people that look like me in those spaces,\u201d said Kaufman, referring to her clinicians at MLKCH. \u201cBecause that doesn\u2019t happen a lot. Or sometimes, at all. So it was really good.\u201d\n\nWhen Kaufman saw an Instagram post about MLKCH being in danger of closing down, she said she was upset \u2014 and unsure of her future plans.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of hospitals on this side of town,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cIf I have a baby again, where am I gonna have my baby at? It sucks.\u201d\n\nMLKCH is an accessible care provider for low-income Medi-Cal patients, but it is also a pillar of trust for its South L.A. communities. Toni Vargas, an associate supervising attorney at the Health Consumer Center of the Neighborhood Legal Services of L.A. County (NLSLA), provides free medical-related legal aid for L.A. residents. She said that MLKCH\u2019s position within Los Angeles cannot be glossed over.\n\n\u201cThis very special neighborhood doesn\u2019t travel far, and it doesn\u2019t trust well. And people don\u2019t lightly enter into that community because of the environment,\u201d Vargas said. \u201c[MLKCH] still sustains and retains the only trusted place people in this immediate community will go.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its bustling maternity ward, MLKCH\u2019s emergency room is known for being one of the busiest in the country. The emergency department receives more than 100,000 visits a year, which is nearly double industry performance standards and triple the number estimated when MLKCH first opened, according to MLK Community Healthcare\u2019s 2023 Community Health Needs Assessment.\n\nClinicians in the emergency room have had to adapt to the high patient volume. Tiffany Hsia, an ER technician at MLKCH, said the night shift is \u201cpretty minimally staffed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe only have 21 beds in the emergency room,\u201d Hsia said. \u201cWe\u2019ve accommodated by setting up extra little lobby treatment areas and having a discharge lounge trying to get patients seen as quickly as possible. ... We just make do with what we have.\u201d\n\nMLKCH\u2019s emergency room is a vital source of care for low-income patients. Factors like long work hours and access to transportation can prevent low-income, working class and/or unhoused people from seeking treatment early on until they are left with no other option. Many patients, Hsia said, come to the ER as a form of primary care \u2014 especially with a shortage of nearly 500 primary care doctors in South L.A. \u2014 or as an ultimate last resort for treatment.\n\n\u201cA lot of patients don\u2019t know about urgent care or have primary care doctors. They\u2019re not aware because they don\u2019t have the education,\u201d Hsia said.\n\nThe loss of MLKCH would likely see worsened health outcomes and increased premature deaths as an immediate effect, according to Lavonna Lewis, a professor and the vice dean of diversity, equity and inclusion at USC\u2019s Sol Price School of Public Policy.\n\n\u201cPeople will die prematurely because they couldn\u2019t get the care that they needed, and there will be additional costs to our healthcare system,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over and over again that early intervention is better for both the patient and the system because we save money.\u201d\n\nLewis also said the absence of MLKCH would also probably increase the patient volume of nearby hospitals.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to quit being sick,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just going to have to find other places to go.\u201d\n\nThe nearest hospital to MLKCH is the St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood, about three miles away. St. Francis, however, is a trauma hospital, which means that an influx of regular emergency patients on top of their trauma patients would pose a burden to the facility and its clinicians \u2014 especially when MLKCH\u2019s emergency room alone currently sees over 100,000 patients a year.\n\nAn increase in emergency department saturation at surrounding hospitals could be the start of a vicious cycle, according to Adam Blackstone, the senior vice president of communications and event management at the Hospital Association of Southern California, which MLKCH is a member hospital of.\n\n\u201cIt could lead to delaying care or not getting care,\u201d Blackstone said. \u201cIt has a ripple effect to the nearest hospital, and so on and so forth. So it\u2019s not like it just happens in one area. It has a profound impact across the system.\u201d\n\nMLKCH\u2019s struggle with funds reflects a continued national trend of urban safety-net hospital closures. Philadelphia\u2019s Hahnemann University Hospital and Washington, D.C.\u2019s Providence Hospital, for instance, closed their inpatient services in 2019 after experiencing similar fiscal losses. Like MLKCH, Hahnemann and Providence served a primarily low-income and Black and brown patient population.\n\nLewis said safety net facilities like these are critical because they are designed to serve historically underserved patients in the United States.\n\n\u201cIn a healthcare system that relies on the market, what happens with those folks for whom it is not profitable to provide care for them?\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we get the safety net, to catch people who fall through the gaps that are caused by the market-based mindset.\u201d\n\nAs MLKCH is projected to lose another $13 million for 2024, the future of the hospital \u2014 and its patients \u2014 is unclear. Dylan Sublett, president of the MLK Community Health Foundation, told Capital & Main that the hospital has until June 2025 if nothing changes.\n\nIf it does close and she has another pregnancy, Kaufman said she would likely try going to a midwives facility again, though she is uncertain if her blood pressure complications would return. Brightmon said she would look into a different hospital she initially considered, but believes that nothing could compare to MLKCH\u2019s care and hospitality.\n\nFor Hsia, the towering possibility of losing her job has been \u201cscary\u201d \u2014 but she is more worried about MLKCH\u2019s patients.\n\n\u201c[I] can always find another job because hospitals are always gonna exist. For me, I think it\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Hsia said. \u201cBut I think [MLKCH] is more important for the actual community. It\u2019d be very devastating to see.\u201d\n```"}

Head coach Eric Musselman spoke about integrating NBA style playbooks, managing roster changes, injuries and the excitement of gearing up for the Trojans\u2019 inaugural season in the Big Ten. USC officially joined its new conference August 2.\n\nThe team worked out Thursday morning, trying to manage an injury-plagued roster. After practice, Musselman reported that graduate guard Clark Slajchert (ankle), sophomore guard Kevin Patton Jr. (hip), graduate forward Matt Knowling (sports hernia), sophomore guard Wesley Yates III (foot) and freshman forward Jalen Shelley (ankle) are all currently unable to practice. In addition, Rashaun Agee (ankle) and Desmond Claude (elbow) are now both able to practice but missed time earlier in the summer due to injury recovery.\n\nMusselman described Thursday\u2019s practice as a six out of 10 in terms of energy and intensity during the post-practice press conference. \u201cThe core eight guys are exhausted because of all the reps,\u201d Musselman said. \u201cBut I think that come October, it\u2019ll be even higher intensity, more body movement, more player movement and more vocalization. It\u2019s hard when you only got nine guys, someone\u2019s going twice every time.\u201d\n\nMusselman is no stranger to operating with an NBA-style playbook. Since 2019, he has had at least one player selected in each NBA Draft, the third-best active streak among NCAA coaches. \u201cAvailability is key. The more you talk to NBA executives and coaches, one thing that has come up in recent drafts that they emphasize is about being available,\u201d Musselman said. \u201cPro sports is changing everything day by day, and players being available is something that every franchise wants.\u201d\n\nWith the new-look Trojans acquiring 11 players through the transfer portal from multiple programs, Musselman wants to carve the word versatility into the team culture. On this note, he had high praise for graduate guard Saint Thomas, a transfer from Northern Colorado, who has proven to be a versatile asset on the team. \u201c[Versatility] is what the roster was recruited for. We knew that [Thomas] was a high-assist guy,\u201d Musselman said. \u201cI found out that he can play pick-and-roll very well, and I think we have a lot of guys that can play three positions.\u201d\n\nThomas, who started his collegiate career at Loyola Chicago, wants to help establish a strong foundation and culture for the Trojans and he also plans to look out for all his new teammates. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s jealousy or selfishness in that locker room, and like my teammates, I want the best for the guy sitting next to me as well as success for myself,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cSo I think that\u2019s how everyone\u2019s mindset is, and I think everybody just wants to get to the Dance, I think that\u2019s our goal.\u201d\n\nMusselman assumed his position as the head coach in April and immediately went to work on the recruitment side, bringing in key players under his wings. Graduate forward Josh Cohen is a transfer from UMass who initially committed to Musselman at Arkansas before flipping to USC following Musselman\u2019s departure from the Razorbacks. \u201cI was the first guy to commit to him, but we had [senior forward Harrison Hornery] too on the team, so it was pretty fun to watch everybody commit,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThere are a lot more opportunities here in L.A., and being here for the summer, playing against NBA guys during pick up, I realized it has been a really cool experience and environment. It\u2019s nothing like I\u2019ve ever been a part of.\u201d\n\nGraduate guard Chibuzo Agbo, who had prior stops at Boise State and Texas Tech, also spoke about what he saw in Musselman and why he wanted to play for him. \u201cI came from a winning program. Things I noticed from winning coaches to winning places, is that they set the standard for you every day,\u201d Agbo said. \u201cCoach [Musselman] knows that we\u2019re not going to be upset as soon as practice starts. He\u2019s not going to let that happen.\u201d\n\nHornery, a rising senior guard and the lone scholarship player from last year\u2019s USC team to remain after Andy Enfield departed for SMU, spoke about why he decided to stay at USC, despite seeing all of his teammates, except for graduate walk-on guard JD Plough, depart the program. \u201cObviously, when Andy left and right before I went home to Australia, the start of summer gave me time to reflect with my family and to just talk about it. Leaving was never a question,\u201d Hornery said. \u201cI met with Coach Muss right before I left, and it gave me a positive feeling to keep going. It\u2019s been a good change, they\u2019re both different coaches but that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\n\nHornery\u2019s decision to stay has come to help benefit all of his new teammates both on and off the court, as graduate forward Terrance Williams, a graduate transfer from Michigan, recalled about Hornery. \u201cHarry definitely helped a lot. When I first committed, we were texting in the group chat about where should we live, and things of that nature,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd Harry looked out for me and looked out for us on the little things like that.\u201d\n\nClaude, a junior guard who transferred from Xavier, echoed Williams\u2019 statement, especially since he went through a similar situation the previous year when he was still with the Musketeers. \u201cI would say Harry was definitely a big part of everybody getting comfortable,\u201d Claude said. \u201cI was in a situation last year where I was the only returner and we had 14 new guys, so I know the pressure that it has on him to be a leader and more vocal. Even him having to do a lot of extra things just for us, so you know he\u2019s taking on that challenge. We all appreciate his help. You know he\u2019s funny too, this one.\u201d\n\nThe team has bonded well, or at least it looks like. The Trojans have been active on social media this summer, showing team-building activities like dodgeball. With all of USC\u2019s teams officially incorporated into the Big Ten Conference on Friday and summer practices complete, the men\u2019s basketball squad will look to prime themselves under Musselman as it continues to get closer to the start of its first season in the new conference, when the Trojans\u2019 first game tips off in early November.\n```"}

(Photo/@USMNT on Instagram).\n\nBy Jack Hallinan August 02, 2024 at 9:12 am PDT\n\nIt always hurts more when you know a medal was within reach. The US men\u2019s Olympic soccer team\u2014mostly a U-23 squad with three \u201coverage\u201d players allowed to compete\u2014fell 4-0 to Morocco in the quarterfinals Friday, preventing the stars and stripes from reaching a medal game.\n\nThis US team had a legitimate (i.e. not wishful) chance to make history. The US men\u2019s soccer program has never won an Olympic medal since the sport was added to the Games in 1992. In fact, until 2024, the US had missed as many Olympics as they had qualified for. Paris 2024 was the U-23 team\u2019s first Olympic appearance since 2008 and the team\u2019s best-ever finish was fourth place in the 2000 Sydney Games.\n\nThat tournament was so long ago that NBC color commentator Tim Howard served as Brad Friedel\u2019s backup, having not yet won the starting job for the national team he\u2019d go on to make 121 appearances for.\n\nTeam USA entered its knockout match against Morocco brimming with confidence. The team shrugged off a 3-0 loss to hosts France\u2014whose best U-23 team could probably make a World Cup quarterfinal, after all\u2014and slapped New Zealand and Guinea 4-1 and 3-0, respectively, in the latter two group games.\n\nDjordje Mihailovic, one of the overage stars brought in, had justified his inclusion with two goals (one penalty) and an assist. Right winger Kevin Paredes, who started 15 matches for Wolfsburg in 2023-24, also collected a pair of goals and an assist.\n\nThe attack was humming. Surely Morocco, even with Achraf Hakimi, couldn\u2019t stop that? Wrong. Dead wrong.\n\nThe Atlas Lions (does any country have a cooler national team nickname than Morocco? Maybe the Nigerian Super Eagles) outclassed the US up and down the pitch. In the first half, they dominated possession and played through the US centrally, while restricting the Americans to counterattacks and wing play exclusively.\n\nWith Hakimi pushing high and wide, US left back John Tolkin was tortured, having to choose between tracking the Moroccan right back down the touchline or tucking inside to mark Ilias Akhomach, formerly of Barcelona\u2019s La Masia.\n\nThe penalty against US right back Nathan Harriel may have been controversial to some (though not I), but Morocco\u2019s halftime lead nonetheless reflected their superior play; The US didn\u2019t have a shot on target in the first half, while Morocco created four.\n\nTactical wizards will be able to point out the areas where the US lost the match more precisely than I, but I think it really comes down to intensity and precision. Morocco had it; The US didn\u2019t.\n\nAmerican captain Tanner Tessman looked entirely off the pace at the Parc des Princes after making the US tick in their previous wins. It might have been a long season catching up with him, but these days, every top-level footballer plays long seasons.\n\nWith the Olympics following a thoroughly disappointing Copa Am\u00e9rica for the US men\u2019s national team, head coach Marko Mitrovi\u0107's team had an opportunity to restore confidence in the program\u2019s direction. Make it to the semifinals, and you have a chance to play for a medal. And with a strong showing, some of these younger players, be it Tessman or Paredes or even the slightly older Mihailovic, might\u2019ve found themselves fast-tracked into a prominent role for the senior team with momentum.\n\nInstead, this group leaves Paris with a 2-2 record, having conceded more goals (eight) than they scored (seven). Unlike this year\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica team, the US Olympic squad was not a complete disaster, so I suppose I should hand them that. Some of these players, Tessman and Paredes almost certainly among them, will have long futures with the USMNT.\n\nBut from a player-for-player perspective, Morocco was beatable. And in the knockout stages of international tournaments, the US doesn\u2019t play that many obviously beatable opponents. The Netherlands, at the 2022 World Cup, were not obviously beatable. Neither would Colombia have been in the Copa, had the US advanced in Panama\u2019s place.\n\nThe US has to take these opportunities when they arise. And in Paris, take it, they did not.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/08/02/gieslers-grand-slam-dodgers-have-positive-trade-period/", "response": "```\nDodgers win the trade deadline with key moves\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are second in the NL, but recovering from a hard-hitting injury bug. Pitching has been a weak spot for this powerful squad, but with Clayton Kershaw, Tyler Glasnow and Joe Kelly making their return, things are only looking up as the team regains its bullpen depth.\n\nThe Dodgers\u2019 first acquisition was starter Jack Flaherty. Previously of the Detroit Tigers, Flaherty has 133 strikeouts on 106 innings pitched this season. He joins a growing roster of elite starters in Los Angeles and will likely make his first start during the team\u2019s series against the Oakland Athletics this weekend.\n\nLA also traded for the Toronto Blue Jays\u2019 Kevin Kiemaier. The center fielder has struggled at the plate this year, but adds significant veteran experience to a young team. The Dodgers don\u2019t have issues scoring runs with their firepower offense, and adding center-field depth and having Home Run Derby winner Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez in left field makes for an even strong roster.\n\nLeague-bottom White Sox make few changes\n\nThe 27-83 Chicago White Sox are far and away the worst team in baseball. Their 16-game losing streak has them on pace to reach the New York Mets\u2019 infamous 1962 season, known as the worst of all time.\n\nThe White Sox were expected to acquire a handful of players around the deadline in an attempt to reverse their fortunes, but the front office decided against it. On the flip side, the White Sox retained Garrett Crochet and Luis Robert, players sought after by other teams.\n\nA solid trade period for the White Sox would have set them up for a long-term rebuild, but they now have to wait until the offseason to do so. The Dodgers were one of the teams that had several conversations with the White Sox. LA were assessing Chicago\u2019s Crochet, infielder Tommy Edman and pitcher Michael Kopech.\n\nCrochet would provided great value to the Dodgers pitching squad, but forced LA\u2019s hand when he demanded a contract extension. The Dodgers chose to focus their efforts elsewhere, and received Edman and Kopech for two prospects who likely won\u2019t mature for at least a few seasons.\n\nChicago easily could have pushed for a better deal, but the White Sox instead left themselves with an incomplete roster.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s James McCann literally endures baseball\u2019s toughness\n\nOn Monday, Baltimore Orioles catcher James McCann was drilled in the face with a 95-mile-per-hour fastball from Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Yariel Rodr\u00edguez. In a bases-loaded situation, the unintentional pitch left blood from rushing out of McCann\u2019s nose. Clearly broken, McCann only needed a towel and a cup of water before putting his helmet back on and taking his lead at first.\n\nHe proceeded to catch the rest of the game and even hit a single to right field in the fifth inning. The McCann incident brings up the ongoing issue about when athletes should and shouldn\u2019t be allowed to play in games.\n\nThe Baltimore-Blue Jays matchup was both squads\u2019 second of the day, and even though McCann sat for Game 3 the following day, in most other sports, McCann would be sidelined for at least a week after a direct blow to the head. He returned in Game 4 against Toronto this past Wednesday, which should ring bells when considering players\u2019 safety in baseball.\n\nThe double play going into the weekend\n\nThe Seattle Mariners play a home series against a powerful Philadelphia Phillies squad this weekend. The Mariners sit at a tipping point in their season, but a strong series can quickly turn things around. If their up-and-down stretch continues, though, the Houston Astros will soon pass them and Seattle can say goodbye to playing in October.\n\nPrediction: The Phillies win two out of three games.\n\nThe second big series this week sees the Arizona Diamondbacks heading to Pittsburgh. No Wild Card position is safe in the NL this season, and both the D-Backs and Pirates are still in the race. This series has big Wild Card implications for two playoff hopefuls.\n\nPrediction: Arizona will take two out of three games and move into Wild Card position.\n\nLast weekend, both the Phillies and Dodgers lost their three-game series, dropping my prediction total to 2-8-2.\n```"}

(Photo by WESLEY CHEN)\n\nBy Charlotte Calm\u00e8s July 31, 2024 at 5:40 pm PDT\n\nAfter withdrawing his bid for reelection on July 21, President Joe Biden addressed Americans live from the Oval Office on July 24 to explain his historic decision and outline what lies ahead as he prepares to conclude his nearly 50-year political career. In a roughly eleven-minute-long speech, the president reinforced the stakes of the upcoming election, saying that his decision to \u201cpass the torch\u201d was a matter of protecting the future of American democracy.\n\n\u201cI revere this office, but I love my country more,\u201d Biden said, claiming that the defense of democracy is \u201cmore important than any title.\u201d The president urged Americans to join together in the months ahead, stating that \u201cwe are a great nation, because we are a good people.\u201d The president raised the question, \u201cDoes character in public life still matter?\u201d \u2013 highlighting the importance of upholding shared values as the nation moves towards selecting its next leader. This decision, he suggested, will shape whether the country moves toward \u201chope\u201d and \u201cunity,\u201d or \u201chate\u201d and \u201cdivision.\u201d\n\nWhile the president did not directly mention former president Donald Trump, he praised Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he endorsed to succeed him as the Democratic nominee on Sunday afternoon shortly after announcing he would be stepping away from his reelection campaign. \u201cShe\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s tough, she\u2019s capable,\u201d Biden said. \u201cShe\u2019s been an incredible partner to me and leader for our country.\u201d\n\nWithin 24 hours of Harris\u2019 official campaign launch, the vice president raised over $81 million, setting a new record for the largest single-day fundraising total in presidential campaign history, according to the Harris team. By the evening of July 22, an Associated Press survey indicated that Harris had garnered the support of more than the 1,976 delegates required to secure the Democratic nomination in the initial round of voting.\n\nWhile Biden had consistently lagged behind Trump in the national polling average throughout the year, the latest general election polls compiled by FiveThirtyEight indicate a tight race. As of July 29, the polls show Harris and Trump separated by just one to three percentage points across various polling organizations.\n\nBiden also touted his own achievements during his term, such as strengthening the economy following the onset of the pandemic, expanding access to healthcare and appointing the first Black woman confirmed to the Supreme Court. Despite the president claiming that his leadership and accomplishments \u201cmerited a second term,\u201d he said that \u201cnothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\u201d even if it meant setting aside \u201cpersonal ambition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the best way to unite our nation,\u201d the president explained. In abandoning his reelection bid, Biden became the first sitting president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 to forgo his party\u2019s nomination for a second term. The decision signifies the end of Biden\u2019s 54 years in public service, encompassing nearly three decades in the U.S. Senate and three terms in the White House.\n\nWhile Trump deemed the president\u2019s speech \u201cbarely understandable\u201d and \u201csooo bad,\u201d others offered strong support for the president. CNN political commentator Van Jones said \u201cthe words aren\u2019t as clear, but the love is as clear,\u201d and NBC News\u2019 Kristen Welker described the speech as the kind \u201cthat will be replayed for decades to come.\u201d\n\nIn the months ahead, Biden assured Americans that he would continue prioritizing key aspects of his presidency, including fostering economic growth, safeguarding personal and civil rights and addressing the climate crisis. The president also pledged to ensure the country remains \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201csecure,\u201d outlining that he will remain focused on easing geopolitical tensions and creating peace in regions like the Middle East.\n\nWhile Biden said he would remain committed to his presidential duties until January 20, he explained that the nation\u2019s future will be determined by the American public, as \u201ckings and dictators do not rule, the people do,\u201d he said. The president emphasized that the decisions Americans make now will \u201cdetermine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come,\u201d and added that voters must be the ones to choose \u201cbetween moving forward or backward.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistory is in your hands,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe power is in your hands.

Last Friday, the 2024 Paris Olympics held open ceremonies along the River Seine, officially beginning the 30th Summer Olympic Games across France. For France, it is its sixth time hosting the Olympic Games, most recently hosting the 1992 Winter Olympics. In women\u2019s basketball at Paris, a record number of active WNBA players are participating in the summer games. Led by the United States with a full roster of 12 WNBA players, Australia boasts the second most with six active players and Canada is not far behind with four. The U.S. women\u2019s national team is searching for its eighth straight gold medal performance in the Olympics, holding the streak since its bronze finish in 1992. Among 11 WNBA teams in the Paris Olympics, the Sparks are tied for second with four competing players.

For Hamby, the trip to Paris checks off another season goal that the 30-year-old forward had entering her ninth WNBA season. However, international basketball and 3-on-3 competition are nothing new for Hamby. In 2023, Hamby led Team USA to a gold medal in the FIBA 3x3 Women\u2019s AmeriCup with a buzzer-beating shot to defeat Brazil in the final. Hamby provided the spark all tournament long, earning MVP honors at the AmeriCup, averaging six points and seven rebounds per game. Hamby appeared for Team Springfield in April at the FIBA 3x3 Women\u2019s Series in Springfield, Massachusetts, finishing in fourth place. Additionally, Hamby played for the 2022 USA World Cup Qualifying team, aiding the team to a 2-0 record over Belgium and Puerto Rico. In two games, Hamby averaged 9.5 points and 4.5 rebounds. Originally, Hamby\u2019s teammate and rookie center Cameron Brink was in line to compete with the USA 3x3 National Team in Paris. But Brink suffered a torn ACL on June 18, opening a roster spot on the 3x3 Olympic team. A week later, Hamby was named to the squad. Hamby will team up with former WNBA player Cierra Burdick, Atlanta Dream\u2019s Rhyne Howard and TCU\u2019s Hailey Van Lith.\n\nResults:\nPool Play\nGame 1: 17-13 loss vs. Germany - 4 PTS / 7 REBS\nGame 2: 20-17 loss vs. Azerbaijan - 7 PTS / 5 REBS\nGame 3: 17-15 loss vs. Australia - 4 PTS / 6 REBS\nGame 4: 17-11 win vs. Spain - 3 PTS / 1 REB\nGame 5: 14-13 win vs. France - 4 PTS / 4 REBS\nGame 6: 18-17 win vs. Canada - 3 PTS / 2 REBS\nGame 7: 21-13 win vs. China - 9 PTS / 5 REBS\nKnockout Stage\nSemifinals: 18-16 loss vs. Spain - 5 PTS / 7 REBS\nBronze Medal Match: 16-13 win vs. Canada - 3 PTS / 6 REBS\n\nA #Bronze at the #PARIS2024 for #Sparks Dearica Hamby and #TeamUSA in 3x3 Basketball. #USA defeats #Canada, 16-13 for. #Hamby becomes first #Spark at the #Paris2024Olympics to win a medal.

The 25-year-old center has been around the Chinese national team since 2018, with hefty experience on the international stage. Debuting at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Yueru and China finished in fifth place. In four games, Yueru led the team in scoring, averaging 15 points per game, grabbing eight rebounds and shooting an efficient 78% from the field. In 2022, Yueru helped lead China to a silver medal performance at the FIBA Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia. In the gold medal game against the United States, Yueru recorded a double-double, scoring 19 points and grabbing 12 rebounds in an 83-61 loss. Heading to Paris, Yueru will lead the charge alongside forwards Li Meng and Huang Sijing. China is searching for its third Olympic medal, with its last medal performance, a silver, arriving in the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.\n\nResults:\nGroup Stage\nGame 1: 90-89 loss vs. Spain - 31 PTS / 15 REBS / 1 BLK\nGame 2: 81-59 loss vs. Serbia - 8 PTS / 11 REBS / 1 AST\nGame 3: 80-58 win vs. Puerto Rico - 14 PTS / 7 REBS\nKnockout Stage\nEliminated: Finished 9th place, 1-2 Record\n\nStephanie Talbot\nCountry: Australia\nPosition: Guard/Forward\nEvent: 5-on-5 Basketball\nTalbot is a veteran of the Olympic Games. The 2024 Paris Olympics is her third appearance in the Summer Games for the Opals. The 29-year-old made her Olympic debut for the Australian national team at the 2016 Rio De Janeiro Summer Games. Talbot competed in two FIBA World Cups and two Olympic games with the national team. In 2022, Talbot helped piece together a bronze medal finish for Australia. En route to an All-Tournament Team, Talbot averaged 8.5 points, 5.3 assists, seven rebounds and 1.5 steals at the 2022 FIBA World Cup. Australia struggled at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, finishing with a 1-3 record and placing eighth in the standings. Talbot didn\u2019t see much action in the four games, registering seven minutes per game off the bench. The Opals will hope for different results in the 2024 Paris Olympics in search of their sixth Olympic medal.\n\nResults:\nGroup Stage\nGame 1: 75-62 loss vs. Nigeria - 3 PTS / 12 REBS / 10 ASTS\nGame 2: 70-65 win vs. Canada - 11 PTS / 6 ASTS / 9 REBS\nGame 3: 79-72 win vs. France - 7 PTS / 6 REBS / 5 ASTS\nKnockout Stage\nQuarterfinals: 85-67 win vs. Serbia - 5PTS / 8 REBS / 2 ASTS\nSemifinals: 85-64 loss vs. United States - 2 PTS / 3 REBS\nBronze Medal Match: 85-81 vs. Belgium - 6 PTS / 7 REBS / 4 ASTS\n\nKia Nurse\nCountry: Canada\nPosition: Guard\nEvent: 5-on-5 Basketball\nNurse is a proven leader for the Canadian national team, making her third Olympic appearance. The 28-year-old has been instrumental to Canada\u2019s success, with several gold medals to show for her efforts on the international stage. In 2015, Nurse put together an unforgettable year on the Canadian national team, winning gold at the Pan American Games and FIBA AmeriCup. At the Pan American Games in Toronto, Nurse led Canada to its first-ever gold medal in the tournament. She led the team in scoring with 13.6 points per game and dropped 33 versus the United States in the gold medal game. Just a month later, Nurse led Canada to another gold medal, securing their first in 20 years at the AmeriCup. In her Olympic debut at the Rio 2016 Olympic games, Nurse led the team in total playing time (2:33:20) and scoring (66 points). Again, at the Tokyo 2020 Games, she led the team in scoring while averaging 36 minutes a game. Canada recently finished fourth place in the 2022 FIBA Women\u2019s Basketball World Cup, its best result in the tournament since 1986. Nurse was second on the team in scoring, with 11 points per game.\n\nResults:\nGroup Stage\nGame 1: 75-54 loss vs. France - 11 PTS / 1 REB / 3 TO\nGame 2: 70-65 loss vs. Australia - 12 PTS / 2 REBS\nGame 3: 79-70 loss vs. Nigeria - 0 PTS / 1 ASTS / 2 REBS\nKnockout Stage\nEliminated: Finished 11th place, 0-3 Record\n```"}

PlayerFest is an experience for all Dodgers Dreamteam participants, their families, and coaches to come to Dodger Stadium and experience loads of amenities. Dodgers Dreamteam is a youth development program run by the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation. The event offered vital resources and assistance to families involved in the Dodgers Dreamteam program, where 59% of families have an income below $40,000. Some of the resources that were available included food items from the L.A. Regional Food Bank, Dodger Dogs from Papa Cantella\u2019s, Water from Dasani, UCLA Health screenings and eye exams from Vision to Learn. Attendees took part in activities like baseball and softball instruction via the Dodgers Training Academy or coach recruitment opportunities from the Positive Coaching Alliance. The event also featured activations from the L.A. Department of Water and Power, L.A. Public Library, Los Angeles Football Club, L.A. Kings, Los Angeles Lakers, PlayLA, SoCal Gas and USC College Advising Corps. Nichol Whiteman, CEO of the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation said the LADF has created the event over time. \u201cWe\u2019ve built something really special over the last 11 years that is really based on education, health care, homelessness, and social justice...

The 2024 Team USA is one of the most condensed groups of basketball talent America has to offer. Perhaps most comparable to the 1992 Dream Team or the 2008 Redeem Team \u2014 two other iterations of Team USA\u2019s Olympic squad \u2014 this group of All-Stars and champions is a showcase of NBA talent. Led by Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, who also served as assistant coach to Gregg Popovich in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Team USA has arguably their most star-studded roster since the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2012 London Olympics. Kerr\u2019s starting lineup consisted of Celtics guard Jrue Holiday, Suns guard Devin Booker, Lakers forward LeBron James, Warriors guard Stephen Curry and 76ers center Joel Embiid. Aside from helping his team secure their first win in the Olympics with 23 points, bench player and Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant\u2019s first-half shooting was impeccable. Durant, the 14-time All-Star, dropped 20 points on 100% from the field in the first half, something he has never done in his NBA career. His offensive performance also set a record for the most 20-point Olympic Games in U.S. men\u2019s basketball history, as Durant is already the all-time leading scorer for Team USA Durant\u2019s absence from the team\u2019s last Olympics warmup due to a leg injury left fans questioning his availability for Sunday\u2019s game, but worry dissipated with every swoosh of his 8-for-9 shooting from the field and his five makes in as many chances from the 3-point line. \u201cI\u2019m sitting here thinking about what KD just did [tonight],\u201d three-time NBA Champion and 2024 Paris Olympics analyst Dwyane Wade said via  X  on Sunday. \u201cI just watch[ed] one of the greatest basketball moments in my life time. Living Legend!\u201d Durant wasn\u2019t the only star shining on the court, though. USA\u2019s first points on the board were put up by the team\u2019s most seasoned vet, James, in typical \u201cKing James\u201d fashion: a Serbian turnover by Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic translated into a slam dunk for the Los Angeles Laker. Three layups from Serbia\u2019s guard Aleska Avramovic in the first three minutes gave the team an early lead, but the Americans answered with a 9-0 run halfway through the quarter. Durant\u2019s 3-point jumper with 45 seconds remaining in the first quarter claimed back the lead for Team USA. The Serbians remained in the rearview mirror, and the Americans\u2019 second-half momentum closed the door for a Serbian comeback. Despite the collective 15 NBA Championships and decades of experience between the 12 players, this is the first Olympic appearance for nearly half of them. The Olympics abide by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) rules, so while Olympic basketball isn\u2019t too foreign from the NBA, there are a few adjustments for Team USA players. Aside from a formatting difference of 10-minute quarters versus the NBA\u2019s 12-minute frames, a few other rule changes include the legality of goaltending, five personal fouls for disqualification (versus six in the NBA) and a closer 3-point line. The Games always call for a few adjustments \u2014 between new coaches, teammates and regulations \u2014 but if Team USA\u2019s undefeated showcase games and Sunday\u2019s performance against Serbia reveal anything, it\u2019s that the Americans are going for gold. \u201cA lot of these other teams have been playing together since they were kids, and we get together for a couple weeks [before the Games start], so we had to build that camaraderie and that trust pretty quickly,\u201d Durant said to NBC correspondent Mike Tirico on Sunday. \u201cBut you see it out there, everyone\u2019s playing for one another...it\u2019s just the pinnacle of basketball when you do that.\u201d Team USA will face South Sudan on Wednesday, July 31 at 12 p.m. PST and 9 p.m. local Paris time.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nBy Aditya Thiyag July 29, 2024 at 2:18 pm PDT\n\nDespite the increased number of animated projects coming out within the last 20 years and animation\u2019s skyrocketing profitability, animators are still working to have critics and the general public recognize animation as a legitimate art form and not solely children\u2019s entertainment. There have been three animated films nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards \u2013 Disney\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d in 1991 and Pixar\u2019s \u201cUp\u201d and \u201cToy Story 3\u2032\u2032 nearly 20 years later. Since the creation of the \u201cBest Animated Feature\u201d award at the Oscars, 15 out of the 23 films that have won in the category were produced by Disney or Pixar, with both studios having 31 combined nominations for the award.\n\nWith Disney owning Pixar since before their two Best Picture nominations \u2013 and both being large brand names in kids entertainment \u2013 the animation industry has largely been reduced to a genre for kids rather than an artistic medium for creatives to experiment across genres. Simon Burdick, an animator at Rockstar Games and USC alum, said that the perception of animation being childish can be traced back to how animation was initially used in Hollywood: to create shorts to show in theaters prior to live action features.\n\n\u201cThis kind of set the stage for audiences to say, \u2018oh, this is something I don\u2019t take seriously. This is something stupid and silly and kids like it\u2019,\u201d Burdick said. \u201cAnd that immediately created this infantilization of hand-drawn media in America.\u201d\n\nBurdick said that this has affected the way people perceive the work that he and his contemporaries do, and it was something that he was conscious of when he started studying art and animation history. \u201cI spent a lot of time really studying art from da Vinci and Michelangelo, sketching sculptures, and learning about real anatomy, because that\u2019s what all of the great animators do,\u201d Burdick said. \u201cRichard Williams, the creator of \u2018Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\u2019, did a fully pencil drawn short with adult themes and really intense art called \u2018Prologue.\u2019 Even if people don\u2019t see Roger Rabbit as high art, it\u2019s impossible to dismiss \u2018Prologue\u2019 as kids\u2019 entertainment, and that motivated me to really hone my craft.\u201d\n\nAnimation\u2019s ability to tell complex stories in an alternative manner to live action filmmaking is something that creatives in the film industry have built their entire careers off of. Alex Bulkley is the co-founder of SHADOWMACHINE, an animation and production studio that produced animated television series like \u201cRobot Chicken\u201d and \u201cBoJack Horseman.\u201d Most recently, Bulkley won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2023 for his work on \u201cGuillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio.\u201d\n\nWhen receiving the award, del Toro said that animation was cinema and not a genre for kids, a sentiment that Bulkley echoed when he emphasized animation\u2019s role as a medium. \u201cHistorically, there\u2019s an opinion that live-action as a medium carries more sophistication in its storytelling potential than animation, and I think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Bulkley said. \u201cIf you were to say a painting is more powerful than a photograph, or vice versa, I think that\u2019s a false debate. At the end of the day, both are artistic expressions and the chosen media for an artist.\u201d\n\nBulkley said that this idea of animation being a medium is even more apparent when looking at the variety of different animation formats creatives have utilized to best tell their stories. \u201cCG animation and stop-motion animation provide a lot of lighting and textures and camera moves, which creates more of a cinematic effect,\u201d Bulkley said. \u201cIn 2D, you have the opportunity for performance in close-ups, because of how nuanced the expressions can be with the pantomime slumps and expressions to show surprise or happiness. Those are all tools within each of the animated formats that really provide vastly different experiences across films.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the role of screenwriters, directors and other creatives in the filmmaking process is something that Bulkley said remains relatively consistent across animated and live-action films. Despite the difference in filmmaking media, he said critics should consider the similar roles when nominating films for award shows. \u201cThe director of photography is doing the exact same thing in an animated film as they are in live-action films, but instead of shooting on one set at a time they have several animated backdrops to work with,\u201d Bulkley said. \u201cFrom wardrobe to editing and screenplays, all of the artists work just as hard for animated features. I think that the reason these films are not nominated is because of the preexisting optic of animated films being for children, which, again, isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nHowever, the most important difference in the production of animated and live-action films lies in the time it takes to make the film. Mitchell Block is a documentary filmmaker and a member of the Academy Award committee that determines films selected for the Best Animated Feature award. He said that animation takes significantly longer to produce compared to live-action films. \u201cMy newest documentary film is 15 minutes long, and I shot it in one day. But if it was an animated film, I would be lucky to be able to create a minute or two a day,\u201d Block said. \u201cThe process is inherently slow because everything in the frame is created. Just the simple process of some character walking through a location requires multiple drawings, and so it takes longer, and costs more money.\u201d\n\nBlock also said the expensive production of animated films and its slower pace affects the number of animated films being produced and financed, and, in turn, the number of serious animated films that are nominated at award shows. \u201cUltimately, the film industry is a business first, and it\u2019s not really practical to make indie movies for Sundance that are animated because animation is expensive,\u201d Block said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that there isn\u2019t interest at the creative end to make intelligent, thoughtful, animated movies. The problem is that those kinds of films have a hard time at both the box office and streaming platforms compared to the commercialized, children\u2019s animated films. So less of them are financed.\u201d\n\nIn spite of the hurdles faced by the animation industry on a commercial and critical level, Bulkley said that he has experienced a cultural shift in the way the public perceives animation. He said that he sees the financial barrier as the last hurdle that animation needs to overcome in order to make Hollywood recognize independent animation as true art like they did with \u201cGuillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio.\u201d \u201cIt can be a hard ask to have a lot of the studios and the financiers take a big risk in financing animated projects, but Netflix took that risk with us on \u2018Pinocchio\u2019 and it paid off commercially and critically,\u201d Bulkley said. \u201cAudiences are beginning to see the value of animation and the creatives have seen it for a while, and I think studios will start doing the same after seeing our success. I predict that we\u2019re going to see a lot more animation in the years to come, and that will hopefully mean that more animation is recognized because of the unique stories that are being told.\u201d```"}

The red-hot Dodgers looked to roll into Minute Maid Park and continue the momentum they\u2019d built after the All-Star break, but the Astros came out strong and took Game 1. The Dodgers thought reinforcements on the mound\u2014such as reliever Joe Kelly\u2014would put themselves at a significant advantage. The Astros, however, had other plans. The Astros are known for being aggressive at the plate, and they lead the league in batting average at .264. And despite their willingness to swing and see what happens, the Astros also stay away from strike outs and are among the top ten in at-bats this season\u2014a deadly combo.\n\nGame 1 gave the Astros a chance to show their hitting power against one of the stronger pitching lineups in the league, and went on to a dominant 5-0 win. The story of Game 1 was total bases: LA found just seven while Houston found 20. Astros starter Framber Valdez made the Dodgers\u2019 lineup look weak, tallying 10 strikeouts in six-and-a-third innings.\n\nThe Dodgers finally put wood on the ball in Game 2, but ultimately could not keep up with Houston. Third baseman Alex Bregman hit a walk-off home run to win the game, yet another instance of the Dodgers giving away a lead. After starting the game up 5-0, Houston whittled the lead to two going into the bottom of the eighth. Bregman then hit a 1-0 sinker over the famous left-field train tracks, ending the game in disappointing fashion for the Dodgers.\n\nRookie starting pitcher River Ryan gave the Dodgers their series highlight, leading LA to a Game 3 win. In his second start for the white and blue, Ryan struck out eight Houston batters. The Dodgers\u2019 got going offensively too, hitting three home runs. LA secured the win in the eighth inning when Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez smashed a home run and Cavan Biggio scored Gavin Lux.\n\nThough the Astros aren\u2019t in the same form they have had in years past, this series was a test of the Dodgers\u2019 depth as two of their top hitters were absent from the lineup. Two-time Silver Slugger winner Mookie Betts was out due to a hand fracture he suffered in mid-June. He recently got clearance to start swinging again and plans on starting tee progressions soon. The Dodgers aren\u2019t the same without their lead-off hitter, as Betts provides the team\u2019s deadly offense with even more firepower. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts commented that Betts will be out a little longer before he\u2019s put back in the lineup, but his progress is promising.\n\nFirst baseman Freddie Freeman was the other Dodger who didn\u2019t take the field this series. The typical three-hitter had to travel back to LA after he found out his son was taken to the hospital. His absence from the team showed the league and fans alike that both his and Betts\u2019 absences leave a gaping hole in the Dodgers lineup.\n\nThe Dodgers head to San Diego to face the Padres this week, with an opportunity for Dodger fans to see how returning pitchers Tyler Glasnow and Claytown Kershaw have recovered from their injuries.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/07/26/dodgers-beat-rival-giants-in-third-straight-series-win/", "response": "```\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers flipped the script Thursday night, taking down the San Francisco Giants and continuing the hot streak they started after the All-Star break. After the Dodgers activated reliever Joe Kelly and starters Tyler Glasnow and Clayton Kershaw, their series against the Giants got a whole lot easier. The trio\u2019s absence limited the Dodgers, as they lacked power on the mound and an inability to control the game defensively. Kershaw had a shoulder surgery back in November, which took him out the first half of the season. Kelly and Glasnow were both put on the injured list earlier this year due to a shoulder strain and back tightness, respectively. Kelly and Glasnow are pitchers who thrive on speed, mixing in pitches that maintain velocity but dip and dive just before reaching the batter. Their style of pitching often results in strength-for-strength matchups against batters who love the heat. Kelly, who returned earlier this week against the Boston Red Sox, has been utilized situationally. The Dodgers have kept him on a short leash to protect his arm, and he\u2019s been pitching against a few batters at a time. Glasnow, on the other hand, started Game 3 against San Francisco, the Dodgers\u2019 only loss in the series. Though Glasnow was carded for the loss, he was not the sole reason for it. He finished with four strikeouts on two walks and four hits, signaling that his injury did not set him back too far. The two runs against Glasnow\u2013one being a home run\u2013were in a long 32-pitch inning, something he hasn\u2019t experienced for a good while due to his absence. Future Hall of Famer Kershaw is another pitcher who returned for the Dodgers. His latest injury is yet another added to the long list of ailments that have kept him off the bump. The southpaw spent time on the IL for his bicep, elbow and shoulder and rode the pine through four separate back problems. Despite his numerous injuries, Kershaw continues to look like a top pitcher in the league. In his most recent start during Game 4 against the Giants, Kershaw threw six strikeouts in four innings and 72 pitches. The high pitch count coming off shoulder surgery is ultimately why he was pulled so early, but the 36 year old is showing promise for another postseason. The series\u2019 first game saw Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez lift the Dodgers to victory on a three-hit, three-RBI night. Game 2 was an offensive show, where seven of LA\u2019s ten hitters touched base. Evan Phillips\u2019s also tallied his 15th save of the season. Game 3 was an eighth-inning disaster for LA, as they gave up six runs, putting the game well out of reach even for a hot Dodgers hitting squad. In Game 4, Dodgers shortstop Nick Ahmed hit the game-deciding home run in the bottom of the eighth inning. The former Giant, filling in for an injured Miguel Rojas, is three for seven this year with two RBIs and has a strong case to be in the lineup more often. The Dodgers look to keep their hot streak going as they head to Houston and face American League rival Astros.\n```"}

The Pittsburgh Pirates rookie has a fastball that consistently reaches triple-digits. That, coupled with offspeed movement that fools even the best hitters, has him in a position to hit 100 strikeouts in his next start. His accomplishments this year have been something out of this world.\n\nSkenes, who has had six wins so far this season, took a loss for the first time since May 25, 2023. His 8.1 inning, four hits and eight strikeout night was not enough to beat the St. Louis Cardinals on Tuesday. His last defeat was against the Arkansas Razorbacks in the 2023 SEC tournament, where Skenes gave up five runs in one inning.\n\nDespite Skenes\u2019 excellence, the Pirates are barely staying afloat. Their 53-50 record puts them half a game back in the Wild Card race behind the Cardinals and the New York Mets. The Pirates\u2019 offense, which ranks among the worst in the league in nearly all categories, is the team\u2019s biggest issue. Skenes can only do so much for the borderline-playoff franchise as they look to squeeze into the playoffs for the first time since 2015.\n\nDodgers finally get reinforcements\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are the second-best team in the National League, but have yet to reach their full potential. After losing six of seven games last week, LA came out of the break firing, sweeping the Red Sox and winning three out of four against the rival San Francisco Giants. The injury bug, which flew around through LA\u2019s pitchers like the plague, is going away and the team can finally show how good they really are.\n\nThe Dodgers, however, have survived the lack of depth at the bump and are finally seeing some of their pitchers return from the injured list. The first starter to return is Tyler Glasnow, whose four hit, four strikeout return was not what LA envisioned. While Glasnow struggled, his return alongside veteran Clayton Kershaw will be a gamechanger for the Dodgers. Kershaw\u2019s start saw the southpaw erupt with six strikeouts in four innings, showing that his shoulder will not be an issue going forward.\n\nOne issue the Dodgers may run into is the amount of cash they\u2019re burning through. Yoshinobu Yamamoto recently signed a 12-year $325 million contract with the Dodgers and is sitting on the 60-day injury list while other starters such as Dustin May, Emmet Sheehan and Tony Gonsolin all have long-term elbow surgeries that will prevent them from seeing the field for the foreseeable future. Additionally, All-Star Shohei Ohtani is still recovering from an elbow injury. LA will not be at full strength until next season, but it easily has the talent to make a deep playoff run if the offense keeps the bats rolling.\n\nSiri and Soto take their time rounding bases after Home Run\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays split their series with the New York Yankees, but the spotlight was on Rays center-fielder Jose Siri and Yankees right-fielder Juan Soto. During the seventh inning of Game 3, Siri blasted a ball 433 feet to the right-center bleachers, which was watched by everyone\u2013including Siri. He watched the ball soar out of the playing field before giving his bat a solid chuck about halfway down the first baseline and only then starting his jog. His run around the bases looked more like a Sunday stroll, as Siri took a break at third base and then slowed down to a walk before rounding the corner and heading to home plate.\n\nThe Bronx fans took little liking to his behavior, as the boos rained down after an over-theatrical performance occurred on a home run that put his team up 5-0. The next day, Soto responded in the bottom of the seventh with a 425-foot bomb of his own. Like Siri, Soto also took his time, high-fiving his first-base coach before pointing at the crowd and then celebrating with his third-base coach. The whole event took about 40 seconds\u2013ten seconds longer than Siri.\n\nSoto said it was unrelated when asked about it in a postgame press conference. \u201cI don\u2019t know what [Siri] was doing. For me, hot weather, tough day, try to save the hammies,\u201d Soto said.\n\nThe double play going into the weekend\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians will play an away series at Citizens Bank Park against the Philadelphia Phillies. The Guardians, currently atop the American League leaderboard, are fighting midseason woes. They have only won five games in their previous four series, and will attempt to round the corner. The top team in the NL is also going through a slump, losing their last three series. The Phillies looked invincible in the series sweep against LA, but have struggled ever since.\n\nPrediction: The Phillies take the first two games.\n\nA fun rivalry ever since their scandal in 2017, the series between the Houston Astros and the Dodgers is certain to be a good one. Although LA will not have their now-healthy starters available, it will be interesting to see how Gavin Stone, Justin Wrobleski and recent addition River Ryan adjust to the increased rest period.\n\nPrediction: The Dodgers take the latter two games and extend their hot streak.\n\nLast weekend, the Mariners lost their three-game series and the Dodgers won theirs, improving my prediction total to 2-6-2.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of The Open and Xander Schauffele @theopen @xanderschauffele)\n\nBy Robert Westermann July 24, 2024 at 6:11 am PDT\n\nIn years prior, Xander Schauffele was known as \u201cthe best golfer to never have won a major.\u201d Now, not only can critics no longer use that phrase with Schauffele, but he\u2019s also cemented an outstanding year for himself while the rest of the PGA Tour cowers in Scottie Scheffler\u2019s shadow. After winning his first major at this year\u2019s PGA Championship in May, Schauffele finally broke into golf\u2019s elite club and got the proverbial monkey off his back. At Valhalla Golf Club, Bryson DeChambeau had both the crowd and momentum on his side, and if he had forced a playoff, Schauffele\u2019s chances would\u2019ve been slim. At the Open, however, Schauffele won by running away from the field on the final day. He scored a fourth-round best 65 and carded six birdies from holes six to 16.\n\nEverything seems to be going Schauffele\u2019s way at the moment, largely because he\u2019s been so solid from tee to green. He hasn\u2019t missed a cut all year and extended his streak of consecutive made cuts to 52, dating back to the 2022 Masters. With 12 top-10 finishes this season, he\u2019s given himself a chance at every signature event. Though it isn\u2019t all-encompassing, an easier way of defining his success might be to say that he\u2019s second in nearly every statistical category behind world No. 1 Scheffler.\n\nWhile the Tour playoffs are still to come, Scheffler and Schauffele have already defined the season. Scheffler and Schauffele have dominated, winning three of four majors and appearing on the leaderboard at nearly all of the signature events. They\u2019re both on the United States\u2019 Olympics roster, alongside world No. 5 Wyndham Clark and world No. 8 Patrick Cantlay. DeChambeau won the U.S. Open, but since he\u2019s only allowed to play in majors due to his participation on the LIV Tour, he hasn\u2019t gotten the same regular exposure that Schauffele and Scheffler have and he can\u2019t be put into the same category.\n\nThe pair\u2019s success certainly has a lot to do with their level of play, but it also coincides with other golfers\u2019 disappearance. Rory McIlroy came as close as he possibly could to winning the U.S. Open, and then realized that maybe a lengthy break from golf wasn\u2019t the best choice after not making the cut at the Open. He even said that after his first 22 holes that he began to think more about the vacation he\u2019s going to take than the golf he was playing. Clark\u2019s another golfer that faded after winning his first major at last year\u2019s U.S. Open. He started the year off strong with a win at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and two runner-up finishes at the Arnold Palmer and The Players, but missed the cut at the Masters, the PGA and the Open. He\u2019s currently ranked No. 5 according to the Official World Golf Ranking, but he hasn\u2019t lived up to expectations so far this year.\n\n2023 BMW Championship and TOUR Championship winner Viktor Hovland has also had a down year. Hovland has yet to win a tournament this season, and his best finish was third at the PGA. Similar to Clark, Hovland missed the cut at the Masters and the Open, and doesn\u2019t look like the player he was in 2023. With those three golfers rarely finding themselves in contention, Schauffele and Scheffler have capitalized and done what others haven\u2019t: won. That isn\u2019t the entire reason why they\u2019ve been successful though.\n\nSince Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson signed deals with LIV in 2021, other top players have done the same. DeChambeau, 2022 Masters champion Jon Rahm and five-time major winner Brooks Koepka followed suit and signed lucrative contracts with the league. Those absences from the PGA Tour have allowed for others to take their place, but when those players aren\u2019t performing it leaves even more room for someone to dominate. Scheffler and Schauffele have done just that.\n\nThere are still several remaining opportunities for golfers to make leaderboard appearances, but now that the majors are over any other win won\u2019t have the same meaning. While players other than Schauffele and Scheffler have proven capable of winning, the rest of the season will be a mere preview of who can do some damage in 2025 and if they have any chance at catching up with the top two.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Sophie Sullivan and Laurie Carrillo\nJuly 23, 2024 at 5:12 pm PDT\n\nFor months, young voters say they have lacked optimism in President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection. So have dozens of Democrats in Congress, celebrities, staffers and politicians. Those calls turned into action on Sunday. In a statement posted on the social platform X, Biden announced he would \u201cstand down\u201d and end his campaign for a second presidency \u2014 shortly before announcing his full endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nIn just days, that decision has \u201cenergized\u201d voters in Generation Z, Trojan Democrats President Sara Xiao Stienecker, a senior studying political science, said. \u201cVice President Harris has become a candidate that a lot of young people feel very excited to rally behind,\u201d Xiao Stienecker said.\n\nMuch of the newfound energy comes from the support towards Biden that many young voters lost because of his policy choices or decisions with the war in Gaza, she said. \u201cFor a while, it\u2019s been kind of a worry with Biden as a nominee,\u201d Ruby Bierman, an incoming freshman majoring in communications, said.\n\nBierman said the first thing she felt after learning Biden had dropped out was \u201cpanic.\u201d \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t really believe it at first. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people saying that\u2019s what he should do, drop out for the party to make it better in the election,\u201d Bierman said.\n\nBut hearing Biden and other Democratic leaders\u2019 support for Kamala Harris was comforting, especially since she\u2019s from Kansas, a solid red state. \u201cSeeing him able to step down, seeing Kamala able to step up, it is very encouraging to the younger people in my community,\u201d Bierman said. \u201cI support [Harris] wholeheartedly.\u201d\n\nThe Trojan Democrats Executive Board also announced their endorsement of Harris on Monday. Both Bierman and Xiao Stienecker see Harris being the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee as encouragement to get more young voters out to the polls \u2014 especially those who may have been hesitant about Biden.\n\nAlready, the Harris campaign has taken on a branding geared towards young voters, embracing summer social media trends like Charli XCX\u2019s album \u201cbrat.\u201d Xiao Stienecker said that, plus Harris\u2019s ability to capitalize off Biden administration accomplishments for college-age students, gives Harris an advantage heading into the next months of campaigning.\n\n\u201cIt seems like they\u2019re interested in keeping the election \u2018trendy,\u2019\u201d Xiao Stienecker said. That makes all the difference to first-time voters like Bierman. \u201cTo finally have the chance to vote, and having the chance to choose who\u2019s leading the country that you\u2019re living in is very exciting,\u201d Bierman said. \u201cWe could make up the difference between who loses and who wins.\u201d\n\nNext, both Bierman and Xiao Stienecker said, Gen Z must use their vote to make a difference. \u201cActivism doesn\u2019t just stop at protesting. It also involves your vote and voting for people who you think are going to support your policies,\u201d Xiao Stienecker said.\u201dVice President Harris will pay a lot of attention to the youth vote by putting in place policies that affect student voters ... Now they see how influential we, as young voters, can be as a voting bloc.\u201d\n\nAs an incoming freshman, Bierman\u2019s introduction to a new environment where most students can vote is both exciting and daunting. Those emotions are deepened in an election year with political unrest. \u201cI always kind of knew that going into my college years, it was going to be the start of another election, [and the] start of a new presidency ... There\u2019s always kind of a worry that sits in the back of your head that something could happen,\u201d Bierman said.\n\nBut with Harris as the presumptive on her first-ever ballot this November, Bierman is optimistic. \u201cI\u2019m more hopeful than I was before to see maybe a Democrat win in the November election,\u201d Bierman said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very hopeful to see the first female president, the first Black woman as president.\u201d\n```"}

The team\u2019s visit to the White House has become an annual tradition, capturing their fourth consecutive National Collegiate beach volley championship this past season. Finishing with an overall record of 37-5, the Trojans defeated crosstown rival the UCLA Bruins in a three-set sweep, winning their record sixth title in eight years.\n\nHowever, this year\u2019s celebration at the White House had its improvements. In previous years, members of the college teams were honored on the front lawn, yet this year\u2019s champions had an opportunity to tour the inside of the White House.

Harris expressed her condolences that Biden couldn\u2019t attend this event due to his COVID diagnosis while welcoming the athletes to the White House.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of our president and Dr. Biden, I am honored to welcome all of you to the White House to celebrate the achievements of these great athletes,\u201d Harris said. \u201cEvery one of them is a national champion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI say to our athletes: Congratulations, again, on all you have accomplished, and good luck on all that is to come,\u201d she continued. \u201cWherever you all go from here, you will always\u2014and know this\u2014you always be champions and we will always be so proud of you.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s Trojan representatives were twins Audrey and Nicole Nourse.

I knew a couple of people from high school that were there, and we got to see the men\u2019s and women\u2019s indoor volleyball team, who I know a lot of us know,\u201d Maple said. \u201cIt was definitely a lot of positivity and I think a lot of excitement.\u201d\n\nThe moment was a reunion \u2014 and a real celebration \u2014 between the team\u2019s recent graduates, current roster and recurring staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2014 our sport ends right when all school ends,\u201d Maple said. \u201cNot that you don\u2019t get celebrated, but ... you win, school finishes and then everybody\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nAmong the championship crowd were soon-to-be 2024 Olympians on their way to compete in Paris this summer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool with it being an Olympic year, too, that [the White House was] able to find a way to still to congratulate and represent a lot of NCAA sports. And I know a lot of the athletes that were actually there were going to Paris,\u201d Maple said.\n\nWhile Maple and other recent graduates are moving on to new paths, the memories forged from the White House experiences live forever.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just something that nobody can kind of take away from you, and you\u2019ll be able to keep the rest of your life knowing that you were able to go there for such a special thing and get recognized by somebody of such higher superiority,\u201d Maple said.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of the Los Angeles Dodgers @dodgers)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler July 22, 2024 at 4:29 pm PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 Home Run Derby champion Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez was instrumental in the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 (59-41) sweep of the Boston Red Sox (53-45) this weekend. The Dodgers were looking to reverse a rough spell after losing six of their past seven, including a sweep by National League rival Philadelphia Phillies (63-36). The red-hot Red Sox, on the other hand, had won their past four series. Boston was hoping that LA\u2019s pitching troubles would continue, but offensively, the Dodgers proved too much to handle.\n\nA common occurrence for the Dodgers\u2014both offensively and defensively\u2014is that when it rains, it pours. The versatile batting lineup is lethal, led by Shohei Ohtani, Will Smith, Hern\u00e1ndez and Freddie Freeman. This series proved that, as the Dodgers made up for what they lacked on the bump.\n\nThe first bomb of the series for the Dodgers was Freeman, who hit a grand slam during the eighth inning into the Sox bullpen, giving LA the 4-1 win. The 371-foot home run was the seventh grand slam of his career and the sixth this season for the squad.\n\nGame 2 was won through Gavin Lux and Kike Hern\u00e1ndez, both of whom were able to knock it out of the playing field. It ultimately came down to Smith, though, who hit a walk-off single to win the game for the Dodgers in the 11th inning. LA blew through their bullpen this game, with seven pitchers throwing 190 total pitches.\n\nThe Dodgers showed their hitting depth in Game 3. Freeman started the Dodgers scoring in the first inning with a 417-foot homer, and (Teoscar) Hern\u00e1ndez hit another in the third. Lux hit his second homer of the series in the fourth, and Austin Barnes and Ohtani hit one in the fifth. Jason Heyward also hit one in his first game back.\n\nOhtani\u2019s home run, which traveled 473 feet, really had heads turning. Only two feet shy of Giancarlo Stanton\u2019s shot in 2015, the no-doubter nearly left the ballpark entirely\u2014a feat few have accomplished at Dodger Stadium. His seventh blast of 450 feet or more this season pushed the Dodgers well into the lead for the most home runs in the NL with 138.\n\nLooking ahead, the Dodgers now find themselves in a great spot, especially since two of their top pitchers will return this week. Tyler Glasnow, who\u2019s had back tightness and has been out since July 9, will make his return against the San Francisco Giants. With only two poor starts this season, LA will rely on Glasnow to get it done as the team looks toward the home stretch of the regular season.\n\nThe second thrower on his way back is none other than long-time franchise ace Clayton Kershaw. The 36-year-old veteran hasn\u2019t pitched more than 132 innings since 2019, but the club will hope he shows why he is still one of the greatest of all time.\n\nWith the support of top-tier pitchers returning to the lineup, the Dodgers are in a solid position heading into their next series against the rival Giants.\n```"}

This year, five former USC players are taking the floor, representing the Trojans on five different NBA Summer League teams, a record in the program\u2019s history.\n\nWhat does this mean for USC basketball? How are these former Trojans adjusting to the big stage? Annenberg Media\u2019s Sam Yang was on the ground at Thomas and Mack Center at UNLV to take a deep dive into the Trojan summer league experience.\n\nThe NBA 2K25 Summer League draws all 30 teams to Las Vegas for a 10-day showdown. Rookies, sophomores, G-League players, overseas players and other pros vie for roster spots in the upcoming NBA season in front of coaches, scouts and fans.\n\nFor the first time in program history, five former USC Trojans suited up to play in the summer league. Boogie Ellis, an All-Pac-12 star guard, is on the roster for the Sacramento Kings; Isaiah Collier, a first-round pick, is playing for the Utah Jazz; DJ Rodman, a graduate transfer, is with the Los Angeles Clippers; Drew Peterson, a second-year G-league pro, continues to represent the Boston Celtics; and of course, Bronny James, the 55th pick of the 2024 NBA draft, joined the Los Angeles Lakers team in Vegas.\n\nThe last time USC had such a presence in the NBA Summer League in Vegas was in 2019, when four Trojans\u2014Kevin Porter Jr., Chimeze Metu, Jordan McLaughlin, and Bennie Boatwright\u2014took part before the COVID-19 hiatus in 2020.\n\nAfter going undrafted in the 2024 NBA Draft following back-to-back All-Pac-12 honors out of USC, Boogie Ellis landed a roster spot on the Sacramento Kings. Ellis is coming off an 11-point performance versus the Memphis Grizzlies, going 3-for-5 from the 3-point line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great. I am happy to be in Vegas,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI am just going in with a positive mindset and taking advantage of my opportunities. The Kings have one of the best fanbases and show much love.\u201d\n\nEllis had a stellar performance against Team China on July 6, including some impressive defensive flashes. Ellis also scored 17 points against the San Antonio Spurs in front of Stephon Castle, the No. 4 overall pick in this year\u2019s draft. He is contributing 11.2 points off the bench thus far in the Summer League.\n\nEllis finds himself comfortably playing at the pro level with little culture shock. He is impressed by the faster pace and wider spacing that allows him to run the game efficiently.\n\n\u201cThere are many high IQ players, and it\u2019s certainly physical,\u201d Ellis said. \u201c(My time at USC) made me someone who\u2019s experienced, and it\u2019s always great being able to adapt to any situation and contribute right away. Everyone knows I can score the ball, so now I can bring in my value on the defensive end and make everything work on the floor.\u201d\n\nEllis attributes USC\u2019s record presence in the NBA Summer League to the culture the team has created.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great when you have multiple players on the same team with the opportunity to play at the highest level,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows that everyone who enters the program can play at the highest level after their time there.\u201d\n\nIf Ellis lands a contract with the Sacramento Kings, he will have the opportunity to play alongside DeMar DeRozan and Jordan McLaughlin, both Trojan alumni.\n\n\u201cThis excites me because we might have the most Trojans on one NBA team,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cIt would be a blessing. These are the vets I can ask questions to, mentor me and help me see things I can do, especially Jordan, who made his name after being undrafted.\u201d\n\nAfter playing for the Minnesota Timberwolves for three years, McLaughlin recently signed with Sacramento. Sitting courtside to catch the Kings play at Thomas and Mack Center, he gave his flowers to USC basketball.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great moment,\u201d the former USC guard said. \u201cIt just shows you how far the program has grown since I have left. Me, Chimeze (Metu), DeAnthony (Melton]), and now these guys coming out here ... [USC] is not a bad spot to go play at.\u201d\n\nIn the same arena, Isaiah Collier took the court 24 hours later as the Utah Jazz, who drafted the 6-foot-5 player with the No. 29 pick, played against Ellis and the Kings. Ellis and Collier expressed excitement about potentially sizing each other up during the game. The moment did come as the former backcourt duo at Galen Center locked each other up for a few possessions, including a full-court press by Ellis. Ellis would finish with five points, while Collier finished with nine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d Collier said postgame. \u201cWe have a history [of USC players in the NBA], and it\u2019s good to see everyone competing at the highest level. I am happy for us all.\u201d\n\nFormer Trojans Boogie Ellis and Isaiah Collier play against each other as members of the Sacramento Kings and Utah Jazz, respectively.\n\nCollier has averaged 11.5 points per game and 4.5 assists per game after averaging 16.3 points in his lone season with USC.\n\n\u201cI am just happy to be here,\u201d Collier said. \u201cThere were some adjustments that I had to make, such as learning the terminology and reading the floor. I know I can do a lot: kick corners and finish at the rim. I just have to pay attention to every little detail, but I know I am athletic enough to have high output day by day.\u201d\n\nBoth Ellis and Collier commented on the potential of their former USC teammate, Bronny James.\n\n\u201cWe are gradually all working our way to the NBA just like everyone else,\u201d Collier said. \u201cWe are grinding it out every day and not worrying about one performance on a single night. There are going to be good and bad games. But we will be just fine at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nJames \u2014 one of the most high-profile college players this year and son of LeBron James \u2014 was drafted No. 55 overall by the Lakers. His Summer League journey brought skepticism and criticism, and many questioned his fit and ability to play in the NBA after he went 0-for-15 from 3-point range in the first four games. James has since bounced back and had back-to-back double-digit games against the Atlanta Hawks and the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n\u201cBronny is a great player. He shoots the ball well and is a great defensive guy with the athleticism of a pro,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cAs long as he continues to put shots up, and as soon as he gets more comfortable, he will show the world what he\u2019s made of. He\u2019s Bronny James.\u201d\n\nAnother former USC player also voiced his support for James. Drew Peterson \u2014 a one-year pro with the Boston Celtics \u2014 thinks James\u2019s growth is only a matter of time.\n\n\u201cI have been watching USC games this past season, and Bronny is an all-around type of player with a defensive instinct. He is really athletic, so I am excited to see him improve and develop,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cObviously, he is very young and will get his chance and make the most of it.\u201d\n\nDrew Peterson, a member of the reigning NBA champion Boston Celtics, contests a shot of Bronny James in a Summer League game.\n\nPeterson has had quite a year as a basketball player. After going undrafted in 2023, he signed with the Miami Heat and then the Boston Celtics on a two-way contract. Peterson spent most of his time at the G-League\u2019s Maine Celtics and was with Boston when the Celtics won the NBA Finals in June.\n\n\u201cIt has been surreal for the past few months,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cI am very fortunate to be a part of a great organization. It\u2019s a different game at this level, but I have learned a lot through this process. I am looking forward to continuing this success.\u201d\n\nPeterson was a big part of USC\u2019s basketball roster from 2020 to 2023, averaging 12.0 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 3.4 assists per game.\n\n\u201cMy time at USC has been awesome,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cHaving a pipeline from the program and the development of players is meaningful. It\u2019s great to see guys funnel through the basketball program and get shots at this level.\u201d\n\nRodman is another key USC player in the Summer League, playing for the Los Angeles Clippers. Although he does not see much play time, he thoroughly enjoys himself at practice, posting late-night workouts on Instagram and captioning, \u201cI love this for real.\u201d\n\nOn July 14, he registered three rebounds and one assist in only two and a half minutes of playtime against the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nDJ Rodman only played one year at USC after transferring as a graduate from Washington State, but found a spot on a Summer League roster.\n\nLooking ahead, Peterson, Ellis and McLaughlin also discussed USC\u2019s prospects in the Big 10.\n\n\u201cIt will be a transition for them, but Musselman knows what he is doing and has a plan. Super excited for these guys,\u201d McLaughlin said.\n\n\u201cThey have a great coach and a couple of guys from San Diego,\u201d Ellis, a San Diego native, said. \u201cAs long as they put in the work in the weight room and bring that physicality, they can get after it. I am excited to see what they do.\u201d\n\nPeterson, an Illinois native, had high expectations.\n\n\u201cIt will be a big first year across the board for all USC programs to compete with new teams,\u201d he said. \u201cCoach Musselman brought in many transfer players, and I am sure he\u2019s got everything in order. Playing big schools like Michigan and Ohio State will be exciting, especially basketball and football, and I will surely follow it.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the players in Vegas, former Trojan Zach Brooker, a teammate of all five players at one point in his three-year career at USC, also touched on USC\u2019s pedigree in the Summer League.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of the program, the school and the hardworking people behind it,\u201d Brooker said. \u201cThe opportunity to play at USC shows who they are and where they can go to perform at the next level. It\u2019s an honor to play along with them at one time.\u201d\n\nBrooker thinks training and coaching prepare these players for league-level play.\n\n\u201cWe train like a pro, so when it works out, we are ready. We prepare for these moments,\u201d Brooker said. \u201cBoogie has the chance to be a starting point guard, and Isaiah can get downhill, pushing the pace with electric play. I am not worried about Bronny \u2013 he has been dealing with pressure his whole life and will be fine. Drew has an incredibly high IQ and took his G-League team to the G-League finals. He impacts basketball in a winning way, and I believe he\u2019s sticking around. DJ stays ready, has always been counted out, and has that grinding mentality.\u201d\n\nThe NBA 2K25 Summer League is underway and continues until July 22. Each of the five Trojans will have a handful of games left to play. They might each be heading into their pursuit of basketball journey in different ways, but the Fight On spirit stays the same, as almost every player quoted that slogan in their interviews. With this level of appreciation for the program, this degree of support for each other and this sense of pride in being a forever Trojan, the impact on these players is evident. It will surely be meaningful for Trojan sports for a long time to come.\n```"}

Unanimously approved by Angel City FC\u2019s board of directors, the shift in ownership made the club worth a record-breaking $250 million. On top of the purchase, Bay and Iger are funding another $50 million for the club.

The 2021 National Women\u2019s Soccer League season became the inaugural season for Angel City, which played at BMO Stadium as its home arena. In the three years since becoming a club, Angel City FC has had mixed results, with the club\u2019s first playoff appearance last season. Headcoached by United Kingdom native Becki Tweed, the club is still in a rebuilding phase in 2024, finding itself at the bottom of the table this season. Yet, the club\u2019s inconsistent success thus far has not affected its ability to fill the stands.\n\nIn Bay\u2019s eyes, Angel City FC has been able to nurture an open and caring community that connects fans with players. \u201cWe know sports don\u2019t just reflect culture; they help shape it, and we believe that this team in this city, with this community and fan base, is helping to shape culture by advancing excellence and driving equity for athletes,\u201d Bay said. The fans\u2019 passion is present at every game, with the  Rebellion99  leading group chants with drums and horns that ring around the stadium. In the club\u2019s inception, it was the ownership\u2019s mission to fill BMO stadium consistently. And three years later, the club has been atop the NWSL in average game attendance,  ranking first in 2024 with an average of 19,499 fans per game.  \u201c[Fans] come into the stadium and feel a real sense of community, a real sense of belonging,\u201d Bay said.\n\nThe historic purchase by Bay and Iger emphasizes the growing interest in women\u2019s sports over the past few years. In a year of WNBA rookie phenoms Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, women\u2019s sports\u2019 visibility has never been more critical. According to Nielsen, this year\u2019s Women\u2019s College Basketball National Championship of Iowa versus South Carolina totaled 18.9 million viewers, peaking at 24.1 million in the final minutes. In a potentially record-breaking year for women\u2019s sports,  Deloitte  projects that elite women\u2019s sports will surpass $1 billion in revenue, with an annual forecast revenue of $1.28 billion in 2024. The possible revenue growth in women\u2019s sports would be a 300% increase from Deloitte\u2019s projections back in 2021.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just a one-year phenomenon. I think we\u2019ve been seeing the interest in women\u2019s sports grow over a period of time,\u201d Bay said. \u201cThere\u2019s an excitement about being part of the community that comes out to support women\u2019s sports.\u201d Visibility into women\u2019s sports is only starting, as the National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL) and the WNBA have inked record-breaking broadcast deals with multiple networks in the past year. \u201cI think fans are in awe of the excellence, the athleticism, the competitive drive, and the savvy that they see on the court, on the field, on the pitch, or, now even on the rink. \" Bay said.\n\nIn November 2023, the NWSL announced a four-year deal worth $240 million, $60 million per year, in media rights with CBS, ESPN, Prime Video, and Scripps Sports starting this year. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the WNBA, in partnership with the NBA and their new multi-year TV deal, tripled the value of its media rights to $200 million per year over the next 11 seasons, beginning in 2025. \u201cWe think there are no limits to the growth of this team and certainly to the growth of this sport.\u201d\n\nBay walks into the new endeavor with no prior ownership experience, but she plans to leverage her other careers to help guide the process. In her career, Bay has created a well-rounded portfolio spanning the world of journalism. She has been a lead anchor for NBC, ABC, and CNN, most notably hosting NBA Inside Stuff with former NBA player Ahmad Rashad from 1991 to 1998. \u201cThe draw of sports is the human stories, and I think that\u2019s been the through line of certainly my interest as a fan, but also my professional interests and expertise,\u201d Bay said.\n\nUpon her promotion to Dean of USC Annenberg, Bay was a senior editor and strategic advisor for the Huffington Post. In 2017, Bay became the USC Annenberg dean, promoting her from her role as school director from 2014 to 2017. \u201cI know that I can use that expertise to help support the growth of this team,\u201d Bay said. \u201cBeing control owner of this team, and being able to leverage expertise and passion to help support its growth is very much in alignment with my role as the dean of Annenberg School, where I leverage the expertise and wisdom of our faculty and staff to support students to support scholarship and to support our engagement with our industries of practice.\u201d\n\nWhile Bay\u2019s mindset is adjusting to a new occupation, inspiring future generations of women\u2019s soccer players and athletes is also a focus. \u201cThe women\u2019s game here in the US is best in class,\u201d Bay said. \u201cIt certainly means something to young girls and women who know they have an opportunity to play for a best-in-class league at a best-in-class team.\u201d\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/07/19/gieslers-grand-slam-hernandez-wins-the-dodgers-their-first-derby/", "response": "```\nTeoscar Hern\u00e1ndez wins Home Run Derby\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers outfielder Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez won the Home Run Derby on Monday, tallying 14 home runs in the final round and beating out Bobby Witt Jr. of the Kansas City Royals. Hern\u00e1ndez became the first Dodger to win a Home Run Derby despite being the team\u2019s 12th participant. The former Toronto Blue Jay has 19 home runs to his name this season, good for 14th in the league and second on the Dodgers behind Shohei Ohtani\u2019s 29. Ohtani\u2013who didn\u2019t participate for load management purposes\u2013gave advice to his teammate in hopes that he would be able to win for LA.\n\n\u201c[Ohtani] said to hit the ball to left-center, to not pull it,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said in his post-Derby conference. \u201cIt\u2019s far but [Ohtani] said, \u2018It\u2019s better for you.\u2019\u201d Ohtani wasn\u2019t the only person rooting for Hern\u00e1ndez. Former Blue Jay teammate Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was also in his corner throughout the night, dawning Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s old No. 37 jersey.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the biggest surprises of tonight,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said.\n\nThe Dodgers will lean on Hern\u00e1ndez as a clean-up hitter to climb back after losing six out of their last seven. Numerous injuries have made it difficult for LA to keep first place in the NL West division ahead of the Arizona Diamondbacks and San Diego Padres.\n\nAnother brouhaha between the Yankees and Orioles\n\nTensions are likely to flare when two AL East foes face one another. A long overdue incident occurred between the New York Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles. With the Orioles at an 0-2 count in the bottom of the ninth inning, the last thing that Yankees closer Clay Holmes was trying to do was throw a 97-mph sinker right at the skull of Baltimore\u2019s Heston Kjerstad. But as rain came down and New York led 4-1, both parties were aware that the errant pitch was unintentional, yet it didn\u2019t seem to matter to Baltimore.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time an Oriole had been hit by a Yankee pitcher, as this latest occasion is the tenth occurrence over their last six matchups. \u201cI get it... the guy got hit in the head, so it\u2019s like understandable,\u201d Yankees starter Gerrit Cole said in a post-game conference.\n\nWhat started with Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde quickly screaming an expletive at Holmes evolved to both benches springing over their respective fences and both bullpens making the long run to home plate. Shoving never elevated to punching, but both teams released some anger in the midst of their battle for first place in the AL East.\n\nWill Aaron Judge win a second MVP?\n\nYankee right fielder Aaron Judge has been a force since he entered the league in 2016. The six-time All-Star, three-time Silver Slugger and two-time All-MLB First Team player won the AL-MVP in 2022, when he had an all-time season with 62 home runs and 131 RBIs while batting .311. He won 28 of 30 first-place votes that season, nearly winning the award unanimously.\n\nA so-far healthy Judge has put up similarly mind-blowing stats up to this point in the season. At the All-Star break, the Yankee has 85 RBIs, a .306 average, 34 home runs and 105 hits. Compared to the average MVP season, Mike Trout ended his 2019 MVP campaign with 104 RBIs, a .291 average, 45 home runs and 137 hits. All of these statistics show how good of a player Judge is and puts into perspective how much of the Yankees\u2019 load he is carrying.\n\nThe next closest MVP candidate in the AL is Orioles shortstop Gunnar Henderson. The 2023 Rookie of the Year has six fewer home runs, 22 fewer RBIs and only three more hits in 34 more at-bats. Long story short, Judge is the clear MVP front-runner in the AL.\n\nThe double play going into the weekend\n\nThe matchup between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Boston Red Sox is huge for LA as they look to bounce back from a down period. Both teams are looking to come out of the All-Star break strong, as Boston looks to maintain its AL Wild Card spot and LA tests their depth. Prediction: Los Angeles will win Games Two and Three.\n\nAnother series to watch is the AL West battle between the Houston Astros and Seattle Mariners. Houston is two games back from the Mariners and three-and-a-half games back from a Wild Card position. This is the second-to-last series between the two teams until they face one another again in late September. Prediction: The Mariners come away with the series by taking the first two games.\n\nLast weekend, the Orioles lost their three-game series, and the AL won the All-Star game, bringing my prediction total to an unimaginable 1-5-2.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/07/18/ducks-prospect-spotlight-coulson-pitre/", "response": "```\nDucks prospect spotlight: Coulson Pitre\n\nThe physical winger will strive to make an impact in the pros after signing his entry-level contract.\n\nWinger Coulson Pitre signed his entry-level contract with the Ducks on Apr. 3, which will allow him to make the jump to the professional level in 2024-25. The 19-year-old scored 27 goals with 28 assists for Flint in 2023-24.\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 The beauty of the Anaheim Ducks\u2019 prospect pool is its exceptional depth that extends past the top-picked headliners, of which winger Coulson Pitre is a prime example. Anaheim selected Pitre with the first pick of the third round in the 2023 NHL draft, at No. 65 overall. In a draft class retrospectively seen as historically dominant, Pitre stood out as a hard-nosed, playmaking forward with plenty of upside following a point-per-game 2022-23 Ontario Hockey League campaign.\n\nPitre\u2019s two-way game has put him on track to become a solid bottom-six piece for the Ducks should he keep developing positively. Pitre logged 55 points in 55 games during the 2023-24 OHL season, five fewer than he tallied in 2022-23, but he also skated in four fewer games while still improving his goal total. His 2023-24 figures also came while playing for a sub-.500 Flint Firebirds squad that somehow managed to sneak into the playoffs, largely thanks to Pitre\u2019s efforts. He finished top-three in scoring on the roster and served as captain for a portion of the season.\n\nPitre\u2019s junior career, like many prospects his age, started out unconventionally. The Windsor Spitfires drafted him in the 2020 OHL draft but Pitre didn\u2019t play a single game for the team after the coronavirus pandemic canceled the 2020-21 season. He would be traded to Flint before the 2021-22 season rolled around and immediately found a spot as a hard-working, goal-scoring shot creator with NHL potential, earning All-Rookie First Team status.\n\nAt 6-foot-1 and 185 pounds, Pitre does plenty more than the typical middle-round forward. He plays a cerebral, quick-footed game and battles hard even when he doesn\u2019t possess the puck. He\u2019s a polished skater, is skilled beyond his with the puck, and is versatile; he can play center or wing.\n\nCoulson Pitre picks the top corner! The @AnaheimDucks third-round pick starts and finishes off the @FlintFirebirds attack to give them the early lead pic.twitter.com/ej9Bk22x3l \u2014 Ontario Hockey League (@OHLHockey) October 19, 2023\n\nThe scrappy 19-year-old signed a three-year entry-level deal with the Ducks on April 3. Set to turn 20 in December, Pitre will aim to elevate his talents at the AHL level with the San Diego Gulls. Pitre will want to work on refining the smaller details of his game. While his awareness is strong, the Newmarket, Ontario, native would sometimes force plays that weren\u2019t there, leading to turnovers. But his hard-working attributes supplement his offensive game, as he\u2019s a sure bet to win battles along the boards and set up his teammates in transition.\n\nPitre isn\u2019t expected to be a superstar, top-line NHL forward but is still considered a high-value player for the third round of the draft. He plays with a smooth style that is difficult to defend and if he can gain more physical strength, his path to becoming a full-time Duck might not be super long. Given Anaheim\u2019s deep prospect pool, now bolstered following its 2024 draft selections, Pitre will have to continue to show more than just his point-scoring ability to stand out at the professional level.\n\nThe Gulls were a below-average scoring team in 2023-24 and could certainly use Pitre\u2019s high hockey IQ and solid mechanics to generate more opportunities. One of the Ducks\u2019 better two-way forward prospects, Pitre will also need to keep molding his identity at the pro level by testing himself at both wing and center on different lines. San Diego made substantial changes in the offseason, including not bringing back top-two centers Andrew Agozzino and Glenn Gawdin. But with the abundance of prospects making the jump from juniors to the pro level, and with Anaheim signing a handful of players who\u2019ll likely suit up with the Gulls in 2024-25, playing time will not be guaranteed.\n\nDucks fans and personnel will have their eyes on Pitre as he makes the difficult transition from the OHL to the AHL. With Anaheim\u2019s rebuild in full force, the team will look for future middle- and bottom-six options to stick around long-term, and Pitre could very well be one of them.\n```"}

The 49ers won 23-17. (AP Photo/Ron Jenkins)\n\nBy Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as July 18, 2024 at 8:44 pm PDT\n\nDallas Cowboys training camp is almost underway in Oxnard, California, meaning football\u2019s return is just a handful of Sundays away. With a new campaign on the horizon, the Dallas Cowboys can begin to look forward after a historical meltdown in last season\u2019s Wild Card game versus the Green Bay Packers. After another season ending in playoff misery, Dallas headed into the 2024 offseason with glaring holes on both sides of the ball.\n\nIn spurring the hopes of Cowboys fans around the country, owner Jerry Jones promised the team\u2019s desire to improve the roster, preaching the motto of \u201call-in\u201d in preparation for free agency. Yet, his words carried little value when making financial decisions this offseason. Instead, the Cowboys stayed quiet in free agency, signing several veteran players to one-year deals and retaining multiple depth pieces on the roster. While some new faces joined the roster, Dallas saw a handful of starters find new homes.\n\nRunning back Tony Pollard took a long-term deal with the Tennessee Titans, while center Tyler Biadasz and defensive end Dorance Armstrong followed former defensive coordinator Dan Quinn to Washington. Another inactive offseason in Dallas emphasizes the need for improvement of the younger talent on the roster.\n\nAs the Cowboys prepare for training camp in Oxnard, three position groups will have the most to prove heading into the 2024 season.\n\nInterior Defensive Line\n\nThe departure of Quinn in the offseason allowed the Cowboys to take a new direction with former Minnesota Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer as defensive coordinator. Zimmer, who has coached in Dallas and Cincinnati, has defensive philosophies that begin with stopping the run and featuring seven players in the box. The Cowboys\u2019 rush defense has been a blockade to the team\u2019s success over the last few years.\n\nLast year, the Cowboys ranked 27th in rush-stop win rate, successful 29% of the time. With the team\u2019s inability to bring in reinforcements and the loss of a veteran nose tackle Jonathan Hankins to Seattle in the offseason, Dallas is relying on 2023 first-round pick Mazi Smith, third-year Chancey Golston, and fourth-year Osa Odighizuwa to take giant leaps in 2024.\n\nHowever, Smith and Golston\u2019s production has been limited thus far, while Odighizuwa has shown glimpses of stopping the run. Smith\u2019s start to his NFL career has been underwhelming, and he struggled to make an impact as a rookie. His 31.8 rush defense grade from Pro Football Focus ranked 96th out of 100 eligible defensive linemen.\n\nAhead of the 2023 season, Smith\u2019s weight dropped to 290 pounds, a 35-pound drop from what he played for the Michigan Wolverines. Unfortunately, this hindered his ability to create leverage and play with physicality last season. However, Smith has worked to get back to his Michigan weight, and he is likely a mainstay of the Cowboys\u2019 defensive line this year.\n\nThe glimmer of hope resides in Zimmer\u2019s ability to teach the game to the young players and sharpen their technique in the run game, as he had done with past units. The Cowboys will need to get everything they can from the group, as Dallas faces five of the top 10 rush offenses from last year.\n\nLinebackers\n\nFollowing suit with the defensive line, the Cowboys\u2019 linebacker unit comes into 2024 unproven. While Dallas mostly kept quiet in free agency, the team\u2019s most significant addition was signing former All-Pro middle linebacker Eric Kendricks. Kendricks\u2019 addition reunites him with former head coach Zimmer and helps fill the hole of retired linebacker Leighton Vander-Esch.\n\nYet, outside of Kendrick, the rest of the unit lacks much NFL experience, with third-year linebacker Damone Clark considered a veteran in the room. Zimmer\u2019s scheme requires high-IQ linebackers who can play sideline to sideline. While Kendricks had his All-Pro year under Zimmer in 2019, the 32-year-old is not the same player he was then.\n\nHis coverage instincts and intelligence are still a plus, yet his lateral quickness has slowed down at his age. With the Chargers last season, Kendricks struggled to get off blocks, and his stiff hips affected his ability to tackle in open space, producing a mediocre 73.6 rush defensive grade.\n\nLast year, the Cowboys\u2019 linebacker unit ranked dead last in the NFL in success rate versus the run, putting the responsibility on rookies DeMarvion Overshown and Marist Laufiu to be impactful in their first seasons. Overshown suffered a torn ACL in the final preseason game last season, making the 2024 season his rookie campaign.\n\nLaufiu and Overshown are both downhill wrecking-ball machines. However, they need more anticipation in pursuing gaps. In college, Overshown produced a high missed tackle rate over his three years at Texas, combining for 52 missed tackles in that span. Yet, he excelled at exploding off the snap and tracking down the runner quickly.\n\nAt Notre Dame, Laufiu similarly excelled downhill but would overshoot gaps, opening clear paths for the running backs. As a Cowboys linebacker, getting on the field this year will testify to the player\u2019s high IQ and ability to stop the run. However, the bonus for the Cowboys\u2019 linebacker unit is its players\u2019 ability to play in coverage with good instincts.\n\nTight End\n\nWhile defense wins championships, touchdowns win games. And for the Cowboys in 2024, the offensive weapons have shriveled. In a pivotal year for veteran quarterback Dak Prescott, the supporting cast around him must step up, especially in the tight end position.\n\nLast year, the emergence of third-year tight end Jake Ferguson excited Cowboys fans about the Wisconsin product\u2019s potential. His 761 yards on 71 catches plus five touchdowns finished second on the team and in the top 10 for tight ends. Yet, the Cowboys still need him to take another step this season.\n\nOutside of Ferguson, the tight-end room doesn\u2019t inspire confidence. Last year, backup tight ends Luke Schoonmaker, Peyton Hendershot and Sean McKeon only combined for 12 catches on 24 targets. Schoonmaker, a 2023 second-round pick, was another underwhelming player from last year\u2019s draft class, struggling to have any impact.\n\nIn the offseason, he only took more steps back by missing OTAs with a hamstring injury and getting shoulder surgery earlier. For the pick to not be considered a bust, Schoonmaker will need to make significant strides in the passing and blocking game.\n\nAdditionally, Dallas made no effort to bring in receiving help this offseason, keeping the tight end and wide receiver units the same. Star receiver Ceedee Lamb cemented himself as a top-five receiver last season, catching a league-leading 135 passes for 1749 yards, which accounted for 37% of the Cowboys\u2019 total receiving yards.\n\nYet, the one-time first-team All-Pro can\u2019t do it all himself. Ferguson must be aggressive as a pass catcher with no backup support. The connection with Prescott and Ferguson has grown and will be critical to success in 2024.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nJuly 17, 2024 at 11:12 am PDT\n\nFrom as north as Toronto to as south as San Diego, five Trojans will begin their professional baseball careers as 2024 MLB draftees. While USC\u2019s 2024 baseball campaign was turbulent and underachieving, the roster featured no shortage of talent on the mound, in the field and at the plate. With five picks, this was the most successful the Trojans have been in the MLB Draft since 2019 when they had seven players selected, and USC continued its run of having a draft pick in every draft in MLB history, now with 354 players chosen all-time.\n\nOn the pitching side, right-handers William Watson and Josh Blum were both selected by the New York Mets, effectively continuing their careers together. For position players, outfielder Austin Overn and infielder Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek will each join American League East organizations in the Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays, respectively, while infielder Ryan Jackson will remain in Southern California as a member of the San Diego Padres organization.\n\nRound 3, No. 97 overall, Baltimore Orioles: OF Austin Overn\nOvern immediately broke out as a freshman in 2023, setting USC\u2019s single-season triples record with 14 while receiving Freshman All-American honors and receiving multiple Pac-12 awards. While he started slow in 2024, the speedy outfielder still led the team in home runs with eight and was a massive part of the Trojans\u2019 winning surge heading into the Pac-12 Tournament, as he tallied 14 hits in the final seven regular season contests. Across his two years with USC, he slashed .291/.376/.495.\n\nIn Baltimore\u2019s system \u2014 one that has successfully produced a variety of slugging major leaguers in recent years \u2014 Overn will aim to exert his high-motor five-tool potential and make a name for himself. He possesses pure athleticism that aids him on the basepaths and in the outfield, has raw power and can put the ball in play consistently. As highly touted as he was following his freshman year, getting picked on day two wasn\u2019t the original outlook on Overn. But for the former dual-sport athlete, he\u2019ll look to elevate his game in the professional system following a 2024 season that wasn\u2019t as electric as 2023.\n\nRound 7, No. 203 overall, New York Mets: RHP William Watson\nWatson\u2019s versatility in 2024 grabbed the attention of MLB scouts, as he transitioned from the bullpen to a starting role amid a period of injuries. The righty became a vital piece of USC\u2019s success down the stretch, leading the team to a win in each of his final three appearances. Watson compiled a sub-4.00 ERA and 46 strikeouts in 2024 and earned a crucial quality start in the Pac-12 Tournament against Oregon in which he struck out seven hitters and allowed just one earned run in six innings.\n\nThe Mets have a pretty average farm system and will look for value in a pick like Watson. At 6-foot-1 and 180 pounds, he doesn\u2019t have the biggest frame but will aim to continue developing himself into a starter with his flaming fastball. His offspeed options will be his main area for development and he\u2019ll want to focus on durability as he molds into longer outings.\n\nRound 16, No. 473 overall, New York Mets: RHP Josh Blum\nBlum rapidly improved his pitching over his three years at USC, exponentially decreasing his ERA and posting an impressive 1.87 mark as the team\u2019s closer in 2024. He had 10 saves while striking out 45 batters and keeping walks under control in over 33 innings of work.\n\nThe righty was lights-out for the Trojans until a fateful night on May 25 \u2014 the Pac-12 Championship game against Arizona. Blum allowed the Wildcats to walk it off in the bottom of the ninth inning in a tied game, which ended USC\u2019s season on a negative note. But that one hiccup shouldn\u2019t overshadow his dominant year. Blum will join Watson in the Mets\u2019 system and will hope to translate his impressive marks over to the professional side.\n\nRound 17, No. 510 overall, San Diego Padres: INF Ryan Jackson\nJackson was one of USC\u2019s most reliable hitters after transferring to the team from Nevada before the 2023 season. Across 116 games with the Trojans, Jackson slashed .307/.418/.414 and led the team\u2019s qualified hitters with a .324 batting average in 2024. He set the tone in USC\u2019s Pac-12 Tournament bout with Oregon, crushing a homer to put the team on the board, leading to a Pac-12 All-Tournament team selection and striking the notice of major-league scouts.\n\nThe Padres have a solid prospect pool, so Jackson will look to continue exerting his power and consistent ability when he begins his road to the show.\n\nRound 20, No. 607 overall, Toronto Blue Jays: INF Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek\nSon of one-time All-Star Mark Grudzielanek, Martin-Grudzielanek was a final-round pick following a mixed 2024 campaign in which he missed significant time. Nonetheless, he still hit .284/.369/.405 in the 20 games he played. Martin-Grudzielanek showed his pop in 2023 with seven homers in what was a sound breakout year after transferring over from UCLA. He\u2019ll join a Blue Jays prospect room that isn\u2019t the most stacked, so although he was among the final draft picks, he\u2019ll hope to prove himself in the professional scene should he sign and forgo his remaining college eligibility.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of the Buettgen family)\n\nBy Laurie Carrillo, Hali Mecklin and Sophie Sullivan\nJuly 17, 2024 at 8:47 am PDT\n\nNearly 200,000 homes remained without electricity Tuesday after Hurricane Beryl hit ground in the Houston area last week. The tropical storm landed on the morning of July 8, flooding roads and highways and knocking over power lines.\n\nAlex Buettgen, a junior studying communications and real estate development, returned home from a family vacation to find trees all over his neighborhood uprooted, branches and debris littering every lawn. Although his household\u2019s power recovered, his Wi-Fi was out for several days, leaving him unable to easily access his online WRIT340 class.\n\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s taking his conference calls using their [a neighbor\u2019s] Wi-Fi. I\u2019m using my hotspot to take my class. My brother is using his hotspot to take his class,\u201d Buettgen said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely all over the place right now in regards to that, but I\u2019m just lucky that we have power.\u201d\n\nBuettgen said the city was a \u201cdisaster.\u201d \u201cThere was no working traffic light, one working gas station, and the line for that was wrapped around the block,\u201d Buettgen said. He described collapsed power lines, tipped over billboards and \u201ccountless\u201d trees destroyed. Worst of all, Buettgen said, no power means no shelter from \u201cblistering heat.\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday it got up to 98, with all that humidity that comes after a hurricane. [It] probably feels like 117 and there\u2019s no way to cool off,\u201d Buettgen said on July 10.\n\nNow, Houston residents fear what might happen to their homes and way of life when hurricane season reaches its peak in early fall. \u201cWhen it gets September, when the big storms start to come in, what\u2019s going to happen? Is our power grid going to fall apart again?\u201d Buettgen said.\n\nThose questions prompted the Texas Public Utility Commission to launch an investigation on Monday into Houston-based utility company CenterPoint Energy, which manages most affected homes\u2019 power. The commission criticized CenterPoint on a lack of preparations, tree maintenance and overall communication with customers.\n\nCommission Chairman Thomas Gleeson said in a press conference on July 15 that the company must address these concerns as hurricane season approaches. Since the storm landed over a week ago, more than 2 million households have regained electricity. CenterPoint said they expect to restore power to 98% of impacted households by the end of Wednesday.\n\nBuettgen said the moment has brought out a community of neighbors supporting neighbors in Houston. \u201cIf you have the ability to help people out, help people out. You never know how far a helping hand can take you,\u201d Buettgen said.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Carlos Alcaraz @carlitosalcarazz on Instagram)\n\nBy Robert Westermann\nJuly 17, 2024 at 5:17 am PDT\n\nJannik Sinner may be the No. 1-ranked men\u2019s tennis player according to the ATP, but Spain\u2019s Carlos Alcaraz proved that in any given tournament from here on out, he has to be considered the favorite. The 21 year-old dominated Serbia\u2019s Novak Djokovic during Sunday\u2019s Wimbledon final, giving Alcaraz his fourth major title and second consecutive trophy at the All England Club. But beyond his pure success, Alcaraz\u2019s playing style just makes him so fun to watch. The countless cries of \u201cVamos!\u201d combined with fist bumps of encouragement from his coach\u2019s box create an infectious energy. When he wins points, games and sets, he knows exactly how to get the crowd on his side, often putting a finger up to his ear to warn spectators they aren\u2019t raucous enough for his liking.\n\nThe four-time Slam winner will be a force to reckon with for the foreseeable future. On the flip side, Djokovic\u2019s performance was, on the surface, surprisingly poor, but not entirely unexpected. He\u2019s barely five weeks out from a major knee surgery that took him out of the Roland-Garros quarterfinals and he\u2019s by far the oldest player in the ATP\u2019s top five. While the match ended surprisingly quickly given how long and competitive the first game was, Alcaraz\u2019s youth and fitness seemed to give him the necessary edge.\n\nSince Roger Federer\u2019s retirement and Rafael Nadal\u2019s decline due to persistent injury issues, Djokovic has been the best remaining player from the noughties-to-2010s era of tennis. With that comes substantial pressure and expectation, which hasn\u2019t seemed to affect the 37 year-old up to this point. He was only one match away from completing a calendar Grand Slam last season had it not been for Alcaraz, but a straight-set loss is concerning when compared to last year\u2019s five-set battle. There isn\u2019t enough evidence yet to say that Djokovic\u2019s reign has ended. Alcaraz looks unbeatable at the moment, but tennis is a game of momentum. The tide can shift quickly and Djokovic\u2019s struggles can easily turn around by season\u2019s end.\n\nSinner\u2013himself just one year older than Alcaraz\u2013beat Djokovic during this year\u2019s Australian Open semifinals in four sets, and the Italian likely would have reached another semifinal at Wimbledon had it not been for the vertigo he experienced. This shift to a new men\u2019s tennis generation, though, is fairly straightforward and largely depends on where Djokovic\u2019s career goes. If he can recover from his knee injury and return to full fitness, then he\u2019ll continue to compete with Alcaraz and Sinner, who have essentially replaced Federer and Nadal as Djokovic\u2019s main challengers. But if he can\u2019t recover, then there\u2019ll be space in men\u2019s tennis for a third major contender to fill. Although, whether two-time ATP Finals winner Alexander Zverev or 2021 U.S. Open champion Medvedev take that place or not may not really matter given how Sinner and especially Alcaraz have played this year.\n\nThe women\u2019s singles tournament at Wimbledon also went unexpectedly, but in a different fashion to the men\u2019s. Only one of the top four seeds made it to the semifinals, with No. 1-seeded Iga Swiatek falling in the third round to unseeded Yulia Putintseva and No. 2-seeded Coco Gauff falling to fellow American Emma Navarro in the fourth round. With both Gauff and Swiatek falling early and world No. 3 Aryna Sabalenka withdrawing before the tournament due to injury, 2022 champion Elena Rybakina was given an easy route to another title. She ultimately fell to 2021 French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova in the semis, who went on to beat Italian sensation Jasmine Paolini in three sets to earn the second major trophy of her career.\n\nWhile Swiatek is nearly impossible to beat on clay and hard surfaces, she often struggles to translate that level of play to grass, leaving the top-half of the bracket wide open. That creates room for players like Krejcikova to take advantage and make their way to a championship match.\n\nWimbledon\u2019s conclusion heralded two different shifts in men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis. On the men\u2019s side, Alcaraz and Sinner will almost certainly lead the next generation. They\u2019re at least a few years younger than most of the other top ATP players and have claimed all three of this year\u2019s major titles so far. The U.S. Open will be up for grabs in a little over a month, but it\u2019s hard to bet against the two youngsters winning upcoming tournaments. With Djokovic having to deal with his knee and other players having not yet proven they can win majors consistently, the odds are in their favor.\n\nThe women\u2019s side is a bit different, though. Swiatek has been the dominant force over the last two years\u2014she recently won Roland-Garros for a third consecutive year\u2014but has struggled on the other two surfaces. Gauff, Rybakina and Sabalenka have managed to earn their own major titles because of that, and players like Marketa Vondrousova are able to come out of nowhere. Besides the clay part of the season, it seems like even unseeded players can find ways to win on the WTA Tour.\n\nThe final Grand Slam of the season will be the concluding act on what has been a crucial year in professional tennis. For the men, it\u2019s marked what is likely the end of an era; for the women, it\u2019s proven that any trophy is up for grabs. The Olympics start July 26, and many of the world\u2019s top players are in the field. While the games don\u2019t have the same feel as a major, it will provide a starting point to see where tennis is going.\n```"}

In Seattle and Los Angeles\u2019 first matchup at Crypto.com Arena this season, former Sparks power forward Nneka Ogwumike made her first appearance back in LA in Storm threads. Ogwumike spent 11 fruitful years on the Sparks and was integral to their 2016 championship run. During her tenure, Ogwumike was an eight-time All-Star, winning Most Valuable Player in 2016 and Rookie of the Year in 2012. Wanting a change of scenery after a decade in Los Angeles, Ogwumike joined the Storm in free agency this past offseason. In her return, Ogwumike posted a double-double with 23 points and 10 rebounds, to go along with six steals. The veteran forward also knocked down two critical free throws to ice the game with ten seconds left.\n\nThe Sparks continued to show their fight against a talented Seattle team, overcoming a 12-point deficit in the third quarter. However, a poor 5-for-20 shooting performance in the fourth quarter was the nail in the coffin for Los Angeles. The Sparks\u2019 big three of forwards Dearica Hamby, Rickea Jackson and Azur\u00e1 Stevens came to play. Stevens led the charge with a team-high 24 points and 15 rebounds, while Jackson added 16 points and Hamby finished with 15 herself. In a pleasant surprise, third-year guard Rae Burrell had herself a career day off the bench. Burrell\u2019s five three-pointers Tuesday set a new career-high in threes made, while she also tied her personal scoring high with 18.\n\n\u201cRae is full of energy and life, and she is one of those glue people for our team,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cTo see her now reaping the benefits of all the work she has put in is awesome.\u201d\n\nHowever, the rest of the team\u2019s inactivity prevented the team from having much success. The Spark guards struggled to stay in front of their assignments, and were no factors on the offensive end. Guards Layshia Clarendon, Aari McDonald, Kia Nurse and Crystal Dangerfield combined for a total of 10 points over 63 minutes of playing time.\n\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s loss, the Sparks will have a league-wide break for the Paris Olympics break. While the wins have not been there, head coach Curt Miller and his group have been excited about the team\u2019s growth from the start of the season, particularly in how the squad has gelled.\n\n\u201cOur chemistry is getting better, and I feel that is important when rebuilding a team. I feel like we are catching on pretty quick,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe are clearly not where we want to be, but it is trending in the right direction.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead a month, the Sparks will host the New York Liberty (20-4) at 7 p.m. on August 15.\n```"}

At 31 years old, the deal will likely see Edmundson play some of his final NHL seasons in Southern California. (Photo/@BR_OpenIce on X).\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner July 16, 2024 at 12:12 pm PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Following a season where the Los Angeles Kings\u2019 offense was merely middle of the pack in scoring, general manager Rob Blake focused on upgrading at the forward position this summer. The Kings lacked offensive firepower in the 2023-24 season. The trade for center Pierre-Luc Dubois didn\u2019t pan out, 2020 No. 2 overall pick Quinton Byfield showed he\u2019s still developing and young forwards like Akil Thomas showed flashes of future full-time NHL status, all leading to inconsistent offense and a frustrating first-round playoff exit.\n\nNow, after losing second-pair blueliner Matt Roy, top-six winger Viktor Arvidsson and depth center Blake Lizotte in free agency, LA can\u2019t expect to waltz into the ultra-competitive Western Conference playoff picture in 2024-25. Blake did extend Byfield to a five-year contract, while also keeping multiple depth free agents on the team.\n\nAmid the departures, Blake added multiple players, acquiring talent at the blue line and at forward to fill the holes in the Kings\u2019 playoff-pushing roster and aid the aging stars.\n\nFree Agent Additions\n\nWarren Foegele, LW\nThe Kings nabbed winger Warren Foegele on the first day of free agency and locked him up for three years at $10.5 million total. Foegele reached the Stanley Cup with the rival Edmonton Oilers last season while receiving bottom-six minutes on a stacked roster. But despite the limited playing time, he still managed to reach the 20-goal mark, notching a solid 41 points in 82 games.\n\nFoegele is a logical addition considering who LA lost in free agency. At 6-foot-2 and 204 pounds, he plays a complete game, is a fast skater and never gives up on the play. Given the abundance of talent beside him in Edmonton, replicating his success from last year might be a stretch, but it was the best season of his career. Plus, at 28 years old, his game still has room to grow.\n\nThe fact that Foegele suited up in every game last season should also be encouraging, as the Kings have struggled with injuries at forward. He won\u2019t necessarily be the player Los Angeles relies on in must-score situations, but for depth, signing him made sense.\n\nJoel Edmundson, D\nWhen the Kings threw $15.4 million at 31-year-old defenseman Joel Edmundson over four years, it raised eyebrows across Kings fandom. Roy\u2019s departure left a blue-line void as he was the second-leading defenseman for Los Angeles in 2023-24 while serving time on the second line. Brandt Clarke, one of the most highly touted young blueliners, will aim to slot in the top four and replace Roy, but he\u2019s still developing, making LA\u2019s defensive pool malleable on the lower lines.\n\nEdmundson only tallied six points in 53 games with the Washington Capitals and Toronto Maple Leafs last season. While he\u2019s a solid third-pairing defenseman for the Kings, paying him $3.8 million until he\u2019s likely near retirement appears absurd. The left-shot veteran will look to be a regular penalty-killer and physical force in the defensive zone. His 6-foot-5, 221-pound build is enticing, but he\u2019ll also need to stay healthy, something he\u2019s struggled with, to be anywhere close to worth the contract.\n\nHe\u2019ll certainly benefit the Kings as a mentor to younger defenders like Jordan Spence and Clarke, however. Edmundson isn\u2019t Roy\u2019s direct replacement, but he appears to be Blake\u2019s attempt to fill a gap. However, losing an offensively sound defenseman, who for the record, received a big payday in Washington, and adding an older, less offensively minded one for a still hefty sum is confusing.\n\nJeff Malott, LW\nWinger Jeff Malott has only one NHL game under his belt as a career AHL player in the Winnipeg Jets organization. Los Angeles signed the 27-year-old to a two-year deal at $775,000 per season to likely suit up for the AHL affiliate Ontario Reign full-time. At 6-foot-3, Malott is advertised as a high-scoring, highly skilled winger who\u2019s perennially dominant in the minors. Ontario will appreciate his presence as he\u2019s notched at least 20 goals in his last three campaigns with the Manitoba Moose.\n\nJack Studnicka, C\nCenter Jack Studnicka was a 2017 second-round pick who never quite lived up to his potential, and he\u2019s bounced around a few teams since. Blake signed Studnicka to a one-year, two-way contract valued at $775,000 for the upcoming season. He split time between the Vancouver Canucks and San Jose Sharks in 2023-24, while also playing in the AHL. He had one goal in 22 top-level contests.\n\nLike Malott, he\u2019ll be a solid addition to the Reign. He could be a fill-in on the Kings when others suffer injuries, but he\u2019ll aim to earn his stripes in the AHL.\n\nGlenn Gawdin, C\nCenter Glenn Gawdin was signed to a two-year, two-way deal with LA and will also look to make an impact in Ontario. He\u2019s only had glimpses of NHL playing time across four seasons but was a regular scorer for the AHL\u2019s San Diego Gulls last season, registering 55 points with 22 goals and 33 assists in 70 games.\n\nGawdin\u2019s substantial AHL experience will aid the Reign as the team looks to make a run of its own.\n\nReilly Walsh, D\nRight-shot blueliner Reilly Walsh inked a one-year, two-way deal and has spent four seasons in the AHL. Given that the Reign have a crowded lefty blueliner pool, Walsh could certainly see quality ice time as an offensive defenseman. At 25 years old and 5-foot-11, he\u2019s not big and frightening, but he consistently recorded points last season and will look to continue doing so.\n\nCaleb Jones, D\nLeft-shot defenseman Caleb Jones signed a two-way deal for the upcoming season. He logged five points at the NHL level while also spending time at the AHL level last year. Jones is a player that could fill in if any of LA\u2019s main blueliners hit the injured reserve. He\u2019s a strong skater and physical at 6-foot-1.\n\nLike some of the other players who will likely spend lengthy stints in Ontario, Jones provides quality experience and is a contender to be called up at any given time.\n\nTrade Additions\n\nTanner Jeannot, LW\nWinger Tanner Jeannot was once a 20-plus goal scorer with the Nashville Predators, but he hasn\u2019t been the same since 2021-22. The Kings acquired him on the second day of the 2024 NHL draft, sending a 2024 fourth-round selection and a 2025 second-rounder to the Tampa Bay Lightning for the 6-foot-2 Saskatchewan native.\n\nFor Blake, bringing in Jeannot as a bottom-six piece is pretty low-risk, but sending off a second-round pick in a draft where LA could pick fairly early is the head-scratching part. Jeannot had seven goals and seven assists in 2023-24 while carrying a minus-10 rating.\n\nIf he somehow finds his footing and makes noise this season, since he\u2019s entering the final year of his contract, the Kings could trade him. Jeannot will make $2.665 million this year. A change of scenery might be what Jeannot needs.\n\nHead coach Jim Hiller probably has the 27-year-old penciled in on the fourth line, and he will look to bring life to the Kings as an enforcer and physical hitter. Considering he\u2019s a shell of what he once was, though, surrendering valuable draft capital could ultimately harm the Kings.\n\nBut to Los Angeles\u2019 credit, it did see improvement in its bottom six to some extent this offseason, so the team will hope for more depth production than it saw in 2023-24.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/07/15/dodgers-choke-in-final-two-games-against-detroit/", "response": "```\nDETROIT \u2013 The Los Angeles Dodgers (56-41) dropped their second series in a row and fall to 1-6 in their past seven games after losing two out of three to the Detroit Tigers (47-50). After the Phillies swept the Dodgers in their most recent series, they looked toward a mid-table Tigers squad to get back on track. The Tigers, on the other hand, were coming off two straight series wins, amounting a record of 6-1 in their previous seven games. A lackluster hitting squad in Detroit took advantage of a banged-up Los Angeles bullpen, allowing the Tigers to steal two wins in the ninth inning.\n\nGame 1 saw the Dodgers come back late to win 4-3 after a double from Shohei Ohtani pushed Chris Taylor and Austin Barnes across the plate. Los Angeles struggled at bat early on as Detroit All-Star Tarik Skubal threw three hitless innings to start the game. The Tigers offense was quite the contrary. Riley Greene hit a one-out double in the first inning, which scored two. Justyn-Henry Malloy then slapped a ball into deep right-center field, scoring Detroit\u2019s final run of the game in the third.\n\nThe only hiccup for Skubal\u2014a rarity for a pitcher of his caliber\u2014was in the fourth inning when Freddie Freeman hit a loopy changeup into the right-field bleachers. Later that inning, LA\u2019s Andy Pages knocked a single to left field, scoring Teoscar Hernandez and putting the Dodgers within one. In the top of the eighth, Hernandez singled on a low heater, scoring catcher Will Smith and tying the game. Ohtani sealed the deal on a ground-rule double, scoring Taylor and breaking L.A.\u2019s four-game losing skid.\n\nGame 2 was the first time the Dodgers blew a lead of five or more in the ninth inning since 2009, falling  11-9. Ohtani started the game with a triple and later scored on a fielder\u2019s choice via Freeman. Justin Wrobleski started for the second time in the MLB for LA, and was welcomed by Colt Keith who smashed a cutter scoring two runs. On the other side, Tigers starter Keider Montero walked in a run and let up an Ohtani solo-homer, the 200th of his career.\n\nIn the same inning, Dodgers second baseman Gavin Lux slapped a ball to the right field, scoring Freeman and Pages. Wrobleski struggled in the bottom of the fifth, giving up back-to-back home runs to Detroit\u2019s Ryan Vilade and Andy Ibanez. In an action-packed game, Ohtani scored third baseman Cavan Biggio before Kike Hernandez hit a 409-foot two-run homer. Freeman hit a sacrifice fly for good measure, scoring Ohtani to give the Dodgers a five-run cushion heading to the bottom of the ninth.\n\nRicky Vanasco started with the ball in his hand, which was taken away eight pitches and two runs later. Closer Evan Phillips was then tasked with finding three outs to end the game and take the series. Keith, who hit a double earlier, crushed an inside cutter to tie up the game. The Dodgers did nothing in their half of extra innings, as Freeman grounded into a double play, stranding Biggio, Ohtani and Hernandez on base. It took four pitches for Gio Urshela to hit a walk-off bomb into the left-field seats and help the Tigers find victory.\n\nLos Angeles fell into the same trap, literally throwing the game away in the ninth inning. The Dodgers again started the game strong, scoring all three of their runs in the first. Former Dodger Kenta Maeda led the charge for Detroit with five strikeouts in a bullpen day for both squads, allowing only one hit. Offensively, it took the Tigers until the fourth to score their first run. Yet again, the Dodgers managed to throw away what should have been an easy win.\n\nThe ninth inning began with a triple down the right-field line, which quickly scored on a Vilade bunt three pitches later. The very next play was a mirror image of the prior one when Ramirez rifled the ball past shortstop Miguel Rojas, ending the game in disappointing fashion for LA.\n\nThere is no explanation why the Dodgers dropped two games in the final inning. Although the bullpen has pitched more than the starters for Los Angeles, the load should be expected as Dodgers starters have been and will continue to be out due to injuries. The All-Star break comes at a good time for LA, who needs to flip the script on their season after a week off.\n```"}

Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. Thursday night after concluding NATO\u2019s 75th Anniversary Summit. Here are the main takeaways from the president\u2019s nearly hour-long appearance.\n\nRussia and commitment to defending Ukraine\nBiden opened the conference by declaring this year\u2019s summit a \u201cgreat success,\u201d emphasizing the importance of NATO membership to the United States. The president described the invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago as a \u201crude awakening,\u201d calling Vladimir Putin a \u201cmurderous madman on the march.\u201d The president stated that he had urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to stop providing support for the war in Ukraine, but has \u201cno good reason\u201d to talk to the Russian president \u201cunless Putin\u2019s ready to change his behavior.\u201d Biden said NATO is \u201cessential to American security,\u201d and that Donald Trump has \u201cmade it clear he has no commitment\u201d to the alliance.\n\nIsrael-Hamas war\nWhen asked if he wished he had done anything differently in addressing the ongoing emergency in Gaza, Biden said that despite having conversations with Egyptian and Jordanian leaders about ways to increase aid to Gaza, Israel was \u201coccasionally less than cooperative.\u201d He also said that he is \u201cdisappointed\u201d that some of his efforts, such as encouraging Arab nations to support his \u201cprocess for a two-state solution\u201d and designating a port in Cyprus for moving supplies to Gaza, have not succeeded.\n\nBiden\u2019s health\nIn response to widespread public concern about Biden\u2019s health following his performance in the first presidential debate, reporters questioned the president\u2019s ability to potentially serve for another four years. Biden clarified that he does not feel the need to go to bed earlier, yet acknowledged it would be \u201csmarter for me to pace myself a little more.\u201d He contrasted the rigor of his daily schedule with that of Donald Trump, saying that the former president has done \u201cvirtually nothing\u201d besides \u201criding around his golf cart, filling out his scorecard.\u201d When asked about his strategy to avoid another poor debate performance, Biden asked, \u201cCan you name me somebody who\u2019s got more major pieces of legislation passed in three-and-a-half years?\u201d Regarding his mental state, Biden said that he has undergone three comprehensive neurological exams, the most recent in February, all confirming he is in \u201cgood shape.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m tested every single day about my neurological capacity by decisions I make every day.\u201d\n\nWhen the president was asked what has changed since 2020 when he described himself as a bridge to a younger generation of Democratic leaders, Biden cited the \u201cgravity of the situation\u201d he inherited from his predecessor Donald Trump, particularly concerning the economy and foreign policy.\n\nStaying in the race\nDespite ongoing questions about his health, Biden affirmed his determination to run against Trump. He emphasized his need to \u201cfinish this job because there\u2019s so much at stake,\u201d raising his voice while discussing gun control and reproductive rights, asking: \u201cWhat the hell are we doing?\u201d Biden concluded the conference by stating he is \u201cthe best qualified to govern, and I think I\u2019m the best qualified to win.\u201d He said that recent poll data is not indicative of the campaign\u2019s trajectory, claiming that it \u201creally hasn\u2019t even started,\u201d and highlighted his \u201coverwhelming support\u201d from delegates.\n\nViral slip-ups\nJust over ten minutes into the press conference, Biden mistakenly referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as \u201cVice President Trump,\u201d without stopping to correct himself. When asked about Harris\u2019 ability to beat Donald Trump, Biden responded, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president if I didn\u2019t think she was not qualified to be president.\u201d Later, a reporter mentioned the mistake, saying Trump was already using the quote to mock him. Biden replied, \u201cListen to him.\u201d This slip-up followed another error before the event, where Biden introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as \u201cPresident Putin.\u201d Both speaking errors made national headlines and the clips quickly spread across social media, with both \u201cPresident Putin\u201d and \u201cVice President Harris\u201d becoming trending topics on Twitter before the end of the conference.\n```"}

As a tech writer and AI ethics consultant, I have spent my career dissecting the intricate dance between human society and technological advancement. However, I have noticed a growing chasm between the profound impact of AI on our lives and the public\u2019s understanding and interest in it. This realization sparked the creation of \u201cVirtually Nutz,\u201d an animation channel and series that aims to bridge this gap with creativity and humor.\n\nWhy Animation and Why Now?\n\nAt its core, \u201cVirtually Nutz\u201d is about storytelling. While technical articles and analyses play a vital role in the AI discourse, they often speak to a niche audience. Animation, on the other hand, transcends age, culture and education, reaching a broader demographic with ease and appeal. The timing couldn\u2019t be more appropriate. We are at the beginning of what could be humanity\u2019s most significant technological renaissance. AI does not just change the tools we use; it alters the very fabric of our daily lives. Yet, this accelerated pace of innovation often leaves the layperson bewildered or, worse, indifferent.\n\nEntertaining Enlightenment\n\n\u201cVirtually Nutz\u201d leverages the universal language of entertainment to delve into serious topics without losing its audience to technical jargon or doomsday complexity. Through the eyes of the squirrel protagonists, Danny and Ray, the series brings to light the ethical dilemmas we face with AI: job automation, digital addiction, privacy and the potential for a technological singularity. Each episode of \u201cVirtually Nutz\u201d mirrors our AI-driven reality with a comedic twist. It is a reflection of our world \u2013 one where the line between human and machine blurs by the day. By paralleling the squirrels\u2019 experiences with our own, the series opens a window into understanding and discussing AI\u2019s societal impacts in a relatable context.\n\nA Look into the Future\n\nThe series doesn\u2019t shy away from speculative fiction either. \u201cJunk Food Junkie 2076,\u201d a serialized novel adapted into animation, presents a satirical yet plausible future. It is a world where current health myths are turned on their head, and AI-driven propaganda dictates societal norms. This narrative is not just for entertainment; it is a cautionary tale of what could happen without informed and ethical guidance in AI development.\n\nThe Importance of AI Ethics\n\nAI ethics is the compass that should guide us through the murky waters of technological advancement. Without it, we risk stumbling into the nightmares science fiction has long warned us about. \u201cVirtually Nutz\u201d is not just a series of cautionary tales; it is a proactive engagement with the philosophical and moral questions that AI poses. Through humor and relatable scenarios, the series aims to demystify AI, making the topic accessible and intriguing to everyone. It fosters a more informed public that is better equipped to participate in the conversations that will shape our collective future.\n\nMy Role in the Narrative\n\nAs I continue to write in-depth articles and provide consultancy on AI ethics, \u201cVirtually Nutz\u201d stands as a testament to the power of creative communication. Your feedback and engagement are not just welcome but necessary. It is through your insights and discussions that the narrative of AI and its ethical considerations evolves. I invite you to join this animated journey, to laugh and learn, and to be a part of shaping the dialogue around AI. Because, at the end of the day, whether you are a tech expert or a casual viewer, we are all navigating this new world together \u2013 and it is vital we do so with both wisdom and a touch of whimsy.\n```"}

Expand Center Robby Fabbri was a trade target for the Ducks, as Anaheim landed him to fill a gap on the bottom lines. The 28-year-old nearly reached the 20-goal mark last season with 18. (Photo/@DetroitRedWings on X).\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner July 14, 2024 at 12:30 pm PDT\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 The Anaheim Ducks are still a significant ways away from becoming a playoff contender, and have seemingly relied on drafting promising prospects as opposed to poaching highly sought free agents to build up their core. When free agency opened on July 1, on a day when over 100 players were signed, amassing over $1 billion spent by NHL teams, general manager Pat Verbeek hardly lifted a finger, even with loads of cap room to use.\n\nAs Anaheim\u2019s Western Conference foes\u2014the Nashville Predators, Edmonton Oilers and even the dead-last San Jose Sharks proactively added touted names to their roster\u2014the Ducks merely sat and watched. While Anaheim made some additional moves in the following days, Verbeek didn\u2019t make a true game-changing call, leaving the superstar void intact as the team prepares for the 2024-25 season.\n\nFree Agent Additions\n\nJansen Harkins, C\nVerbeek signed 27-year-old center Jansen Harkins to a two-year, $1.575 million contract on July 2. Harkins spent time with the Pittsburgh Penguins as well as their AHL affiliate last season. In 45 NHL games, he tallied four assists but couldn\u2019t find the back of the net. Hand surgery sidelined him for most of March, adding a roadblock in an already rocky season for the veteran. However, he showed promise in the minors, posting 12 points in 14 games.\n\nNow in the Ducks organization, he\u2019ll look to find more playing at the top level, as he averaged just over eight minutes of ice time per game, the lowest of his career. Harkins could be a useful depth piece for Anaheim. He\u2019s not flashy by any means, but at 6-foot-1, he could provide physicality on the fourth line. Given his solid AHL figures last year, the San Diego Gulls likely wouldn\u2019t mind having him aboard if the Ducks send him down.\n\nCarson Meyer, RW\nCarson Meyer is a work-in-progress winger who\u2019s played in 41 career NHL games across three seasons with the Columbus Blue Jackets. Anaheim swiped him for $775,000 on a one-year contract. Meyer will likely spend the bulk of his time with the Gulls given his lack of lengthy NHL experience. He registered two points in 14 games with Columbus last season while recording 37 in 55 games with AHL Cleveland. Meyer suffered an upper-body injury in April that shut down his season, but at 26 years old, he\u2019ll look to make an impact as a physical forward with some upside.\n\nTrade Additions\n\nBrian Dumoulin, D\nThe Ducks sent a 2026 fourth-round pick to the Seattle Kraken for veteran left-shot blueliner Brian Dumoulin. Dumoulin tallied a career-high six goals in 2023-24, notching 16 points total. At 6-foot-4 and 207 pounds, Dumoulin is physical and defensive-minded, not afraid to use his frame to block shots or hit opponents. On a Seattle team that struggled last season, he was a valuable depth piece, often slotting in the bottom defensive pairings, while earning a positive plus-minus.\n\nAnaheim\u2019s left-shot defenseman position is currently crowded, but Dumoulin provides veteran experience as a 32-year-old to the team\u2019s youngsters, like Olen Zellweger and Pavel Mintyukov. He\u2019s well-disciplined, strong and proactive in the defensive zone, something any team would want. Although he won\u2019t see top-line ice time, he\u2019ll probably be penciled into the second or third pairings on a nightly basis. This season will mark the second of Dumoulin\u2019s two-year contract, and the Ducks will pay him $3.15 million.\n\nRobby Fabbri, C\nThe Ducks dealt prospect goaltender Gage Alexander to the Detroit Red Wings for a 2025 conditional fourth-round pick and bottom-six center Robby Fabbri. Like Dumoulin, Fabbri enters the final year of his contract, with a cap hit of $4 million at 28 years old. He suited up in 68 games in 2023-24, nearly averaging half a point with 32 on 18 goals and 14 assists. Considering he was only given less than 13 minutes of ice time per game, his figures are nothing to scoff at.\n\nIn need of scoring on the bottom lines, bringing in Fabbri makes sense, especially considering that Anaheim only needed to surrender a young netminder, a position in which they already have several. On top of his scoring, Fabbri is highly skilled and energetic with power-play unit prowess. He\u2019ll likely see the ice in some capacity when the Ducks have the extra attacker, and on a less competitive team, he\u2019ll receive more ice time than he did in Detroit. He forechecks well, keeps the puck protected and leads offensive rushes, all traits that Anaheim will certainly appreciate.\n```"}

USC appointed Ishop four years ago to head admissions, financial aid, registration events and student success. She will join the College Board as their new senior vice president of higher education, membership and access on August 26, the non-profit, which offers standardized testing and K-12 curricula, confirmed by email. Ishop is the third senior member of USC staff to leave their position this summer. In May, Dornsife Dean Amber Miller left to become president of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. Senior Vice President of Human Resources Felicia A. Washington is leaving her position at USC to do the same job at the University of Pennsylvania. \n\nPresident Folt shared the news of Ishop\u2019s departure in an email to senior leadership on Thursday. In the email, she wrote that Ishop has helped offer $274 million in financial aid since taking her position. Much of that qualifies under the Affordability Initiative, a \u201cpresidential moonshot\u201d awarding free tuition to first-year undergraduates whose families earn $80,000 or less \u2014 roughly one in five new students. Folt joined USC in the wake of the Varsity Blues scandal, tasked with restoring confidence in the university\u2019s admission process. To do so, she brought Ishop on, a spokesperson said. Together, they restructured the department, particularly focusing on affordability for first-year applicants. \n\nUnder Ishop\u2019s tenure, USC also received a record-high 82,008 applications this past admissions cycle, the same year the University debuted an Early Action option. Besides affordability, Ishop focused admissions and application efforts on underrepresented student demographics. She launched \u201cTrojan International,\u201d an immigration case management system; the president\u2019s High-Tech Scholars program, which offers a track for transfer students in technology careers; and joined the Small Town and Rural Students College Network (STARS). \n\nPrior to USC, Ishop was the first vice provost for enrollment management at the University of Michigan for six years, and was the vice provost and director of admissions at the University of Texas for 17 years.\n```"}

They are earned. When the 2024 season started, Miller threw down the gauntlet, \u201cFight for the role you want, and be a champion in the role you have earned.\u201d Amid a turbulent Los Angeles Sparks season\u2014with injuries and losses mounting\u2014guard Aari McDonald\u2019s play has become a bright spot for Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to find myself. I\u2019m on rhythm, but there\u2019s still an opportunity to grow,\u201d McDonald said pregame on July 2. McDonald, a fourth-year guard, exploded onto the scene in June, emerging as a Sparks fan-favorite when she stepped in for the injured veteran guard Layshia Clarendon. She averaged 10.5 points and five assists in 11 games during June and saw her minutes almost exponentially stretch to 25 minutes a night. To begin the season, McDonald averaged 15 minutes a night, with her playing time fluctuating from game to game in May.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t have a pity party. I am here for a reason,\u201d McDonald said at Sparks practice on June 6. \u201cNever get too high or too low; when my number is called, be ready and deliver.\u201d McDonald\u2019s productivity in June earned her starting spot for the Sparks amid their grueling nine-game, 18-day road trip, during which the team went winless. However, McDonald\u2019s breakout spurred optimism around the team\u2019s future for the point guard position.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s success is rooted in her ability to push the pace and play with tempo. She drives downhill with creativity around the rim and has a reliable short mid-range shot, shooting 48% on two-point attempts. McDonald also displays quick instincts, forcing the opposing defense to pick their poison by either defending the midrange shot or playing the passing lanes.\n\n\u201cEvery time she\u2019s got the ball, I\u2019m confident she\u2019s always going to make the right play, whether it\u2019s going to get a bucket or it\u2019s kicking it out,\u201d Sparks rookie guard Rickea Jackson stated. However, McDonald\u2019s quick pace can sometimes hinder her flow and the Sparks\u2019 rhythm. She ranks fifth on the team with 1.9 turnovers a game, but this issue will likely be mitigated as she builds stronger chemistry with her teammates, resulting in a more free-flowing offense for the Sparks.\n\nInjuries in June to veteran starting guards Clarendon and Lexie Brown paved the way for McDonald\u2019s increased usage, and her vision as a facilitator and north-to-south scoring ability has cemented her in the starting rotation. McDonald\u2019s 29.3% assist rate ranks ninth in the WNBA among players who have played at least 10 games.\n\n\u201cI love the fact that Aari has taken advantage of her opportunity,\u201d Miller said. \u201cShe\u2019s more comfortable; you can tell she\u2019s learning the system more.\u201d Since her promotion to the starting lineup in June, McDonald has only improved her numbers, averaging 11.4 points, 5.4 assists and 3.3 rebounds while shooting an efficient 38% from the field.\n\nAs McDonald has become more comfortable offensively, Miller has given her the green light to hunt down more scoring opportunities. \u201cWhen [McDonald] is the head of the snake, it\u2019s just fun to play with,\u201d Jackson said. McDonald\u2019s next step is to improve her catch-and-shoot and overall 3-point shooting ability. Since entering the starting role, she has shot below-average 28% from the 3-point range.\n\nStanding at 5-foot-6, McDonald can struggle to find a good look from beyond the arc when she is one-on-one against larger defenders. However, in the pick-and-roll, McDonald pairs her explosiveness and ball handling effectively to create more open opportunities from 3-point range.\n\nAari McDonald and Dearica Hamby of the Los Angeles Sparks helping Stephanie Talbot off the floor against the Las Vegas Aces Friday, July 5 at Crypto.com Arena. (Photo courtesy of De'Angelo Scruggs/Infanity TV)\n\nWhen one is the Sparks\u2019 point guard, she is the offense\u2019s quarterback. They put their teammates in the best spots to thrive and are unafraid to be vocal as a leader. Growing into the role requires patience but a willingness to learn and devote time to the film room. And with a film guru head coach like Miller, studying tape is essential to getting on the court.\n\nMcDonald embraced the responsibilities of the lead guard position when she joined the Sparks this offseason. Describing herself as a \u201chomebody,\u201d McDonald constantly studies the game, figuring out her teammates\u2019 tendencies and styles by analyzing hours of film.\n\n\u201cWhen I come home from practice, I give myself maybe an hour or two to decompress, and then I\u2019m back to it,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cI am watching film or talking to our player development and my position coach.\u201d\n\nInitially an afterthought in the rotation, McDonald earned reps by coming off the bench. The backup position was familiar for McDonald after she predominantly sat behind veteran guards Tiffany Hayes and Allisha Gray with the Atlanta Dream during her first three years in the WNBA.\n\nAhead of the 2024 season, the Sparks traded two-time Defensive Player of the Year, guard Jordin Canada and the No. 12 overall pick in the 2024 draft in return for McDonald and the No. 8 pick.\n\n\u201cWhen I got traded, [Miller] wanted to talk about playing fast and my tempo,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cEvery time I get into the game, he looks for me to push and involve my teammates.\u201d\n\nJoining a new team presented new challenges and a learning curve for McDonald, as transitioning to a new playbook didn\u2019t come easy.\n\n\u201cComing into this new system was very hard for me,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cI was so accustomed to a different system from my other team.\u201d\n\nWith the Dream, McDonald never had the opportunity to let her college skill set shine, which she displayed in four seasons with the Washington Huskies and Arizona Wildcats. The Fresno, California, native dominated the Pac-12, leading the conference in scoring from her sophomore to senior seasons.\n\nAs an ultra-competitive player, McDonald won multiple Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year honors and one Pac-12 Player of the Year award. As a result, McDonald was a top prospect in the 2021 WNBA draft, and the Atlanta Dream selected her No. 3 overall.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what everybody loved about Aari [in college], she was a point guard with a scoring mentality,\u201d Miller said.\n\nThe Sparks seem destined to help resurface McDonald\u2019s glory-filled college days.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s scratched where she can go with this group,\u201d Miller said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t have a pity party. I am here for a reason,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cNever get too high or too low; when my number is called, be ready and deliver.\u201d\n\nAs the Sparks approach the league-wide Olympics break, which runs from July 21 to August 14, they currently sit at 11th in the standings with a 5-17 record. While wins have come at a premium this season, the growth of young players, like McDonald, creates hope for what is to come for LA.\n\nAll it took was players and coaches believing in her talent.\n\n\u201cPlaying with a coach and teammates that believe in you and trust that you will make the right play, that\u2019s all I needed, somebody to believe in me,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cWhen that happened, my confidence was boosted.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2024/07/12/dodgers-pitching-falters-again-in-series-loss-to-phillies/", "response": "```\nThe Dodgers (55-39) fell to the Phillies (61-32) in a lopsided three game sweep, as the Dodgers continue to struggle in the month of July, falling back to 3-6. Coming into the battle, both teams had comfortable leads in their National League divisions. Each side, however, was looking for the respected title of the NL\u2019s top team. Although game two looked close on the score sheet, there was no doubt which squad played better throughout the three games (Philadelphia outscored the Dodgers 19-5). This series was the first of two matchups that the two slugging teams will have against each other.\n\nThe biggest issue? The Dodgers simply could not keep up on the mound. Philadelphia, which has four All-Star pitchers this year, had their ace starters matched against Los Angeles. On the other hand, the Dodgers threw out the scraps of their starting rotation and bullpen against the powerhouse Phillies lineup. Giving up ten or more hits in each outing against the Phillies, the Dodgers had little chance to win, no matter how productive their hitting was.\n\nGame one was a no-doubter, as the Phillies dominated the Dodgers 10-1. Los Angeles started on the mound with Bobby Miller, who quickly gave up three runs in the top of the second inning. The barrage continued through the fourth inning, where the Phillies opened the game up after a grand slam by former Dodger Trae Turner and a 432-foot bomb from Bryson Stott. Miller finished out the fourth despite getting peppered with 10 hits, nine runs and two home runs, all in only 87 pitches. This outing moved Miller\u2019s ERA up to 8.07 in his 29 innings pitched.\n\nA rare pitching brightspot for the Dodgers, typical third-baseman Kike Hernandez threw a seven-pitch 1-2-3 inning, topping out at 52 MPH. The only real brightspot from this game from an LA perspective was third baseman Cavan Biggio hitting his first home run in Dodger Blue.\n\nGame two was much closer; however, the Phillies were in the driver\u2019s seat the whole way, topping the Dodgers 4-3. Gavin Stone started on the bump for the Dodgers, and three pitches in, let up a home run to lead off hitter Kyle Schwarber. Stone also struggled in the second inning, where the bottom of the Phillies\u2019 lineup did damage and put up another run. The Dodgers finally got something going offensively in the fourth, scoring Teoscar Hernandez on a fielder\u2019s choice. Shohei Ohtani was able to score another run in the fifth, tying the game before the Phillies were able to respond. Trae Turner hit an RBI infield single and then was able to cross home himself later in the inning, putting the home team up 4-2. The Dodgers were able to narrow the margin by scoring another run in the eighth but did not have enough, as All-Star pitchers Matt Strahm and Jeff Hoffman shut down the game before LA could capitalize on its momentum.\n\nGame three was a 5-1 loss where the Dodgers fell behind early and could not respond. Anthony Banda threw in the first inning for the Dodgers, where Turner did more damage to his former team with a solo home run. Landon Knack, however, was the main pitcher of the day for the Dodgers. This marks yet another game where Los Angeles was forced to rely on the bullpen. In his past few starts, Knack struggled when the opposition put the ball in play, and it continued into this game, as four of his past 10 hits allowed have left the playing field. Today it was Brandon Marsh who hit a no-doubter that practically teleported into the right-field bleachers. The Dodgers, who have been able to rely so often on their offense to keep them in games, struggled against one of the few Philadelphia pitchers not nominated as an All-Star. Aaron Nola retired eight Dodgers in a row before Gavin Lux broke his hitting slump with a solo home run to put the game within one. Nola continued to dominate the game and finished with nine strikeouts over his six innings pitched.\n\nThe Dodgers\u2019 hitting has generally been excellent, even without lead-off hitter Mookie Betts. But the injury bug has firmly struck the Dodgers\u2019 starting rotation and bullpen. The team currently has 12 different pitchers\u2014and seven starters\u2014designated on the IL. This also does not include the phenom Ohtani, who is not pitching due to a major UCL surgery that was not considered a Tommy John operation (which he has already had one of in his career). The three-player starting rotation of Knack, Stone and James Paxton have led to a heavier reliance on the bullpen. This increased stress on both starters and long relievers has unfortunately made injuries more common, leading to a vicious cycle of injuries for the Dodgers to navigate through. Not to mention the first starter in the series, Miller, who was demoted to the minor league after yet another tough game.\n\nThe team has yet to benefit from a healthy pitching roster, as many players are out due to elbow injuries. But looking ahead, long-time ace Clayton Kershaw is looking to make a return within the next two months, Tyler Glasnow will return shortly after the All-Star break, Joe Kelly is making great strides in his rehab assignments and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, as well as Walker Buehler, should make their return at some point within the next month or two. All of these players are enormous names around the league, so the Dodgers can hopefully rely on some pitching support in the next few months.\n```"}

But Luneau only ended up skating in 13 games in 2023-24\u2014across both the AHL and NHL levels\u2014making him eager for a bounce-back campaign in 2024-25.\n\nAs a three-year player in the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League, Luneau saw his scoring figures skyrocket in 2022-23 when he posted 83 points with 20 goals and 63 assists in 65 regular-season games with the Gatineau Olympiques, earning him QMJHL Defenseman of the Year. He also notched 17 points in 13 playoff games, bringing him exactly to the 100-point mark on the season.\n\nLuneau\u2019s electric 2022-23 QMJHL campaign followed his entry into the Ducks\u2019 prospect pool, as he was selected No. 53 overall by Anaheim in the 2022 NHL Entry Draft. After signing with the Orange County club, he set his sights on Honda Center, where he\u2019d begin his professional career, making Anaheim\u2019s 2023 opening-night roster as a 19-year-old.\n\nLuneau would suit up for the Ducks twice in October, averaging over 15 minutes of ice time without any goal contributions to his name. But after a six-game conditioning stint with the San Diego Gulls, he was called back up to the first team, posting an efficient three points in three games\u2014including his first NHL goal\u2014to end November.\n\nHowever, after playing in just two more games with the Ducks, the Victoriaville, Quebec, native\u2019s season was abruptly cut short after he dealt with an illness followed by a knee infection diagnosis that unfortunately prevented him from representing Canada in the 2024 World Junior Championship. From there, Luneau effectively had to shut down his season, capping off a year in which he flashed high potential before injury frustrations took hold.\n\nLuneau\u2019s size and toughness earned him a reputation as a potential first-round pick by some scouts. At 6-foot-1 and 195 pounds, Luneau moves the puck well and can navigate through traffic, using his frame to fight for the puck. His ability to lay down hits complements his offensive game, on top of solid skating mobility.\n\nLuneau is also a player who can lead power play opportunities, with the ability to find his linemates in transition by using his strong hockey IQ. He possesses two-way skills that any NHL team would want, and he\u2019s very well-rounded; the margin between his offensive and defensive game isn\u2019t very large.\n\nDealing with a season-ending injury is frustrating for any player, but especially for young ones trying to make a name for themselves. In a crowded Anaheim blueliner prospect pool led by Pavel Mintyukov, Olen Zellweger and the newly drafted Stian Solberg, Luneau will need to stand out in Training Camp and preseason games, even though he\u2019s already made NHL appearances.\n\nBut unlike the three aforementioned defensemen, Luneau is a righty and can provide depth on that side of the blue line, which isn\u2019t as stacked. He might not be as tactically skilled as some of the Ducks\u2019 top defenseman prospects, but his numbers have made up for it as his career has progressed. Also, considering that Jamie Drysdale was supposed to be a top-four right-shot defenseman of the future before he was traded, Luneau could easily help fill the void.\n\nIf Luneau is healthy, he will likely spend his 2024-25 campaign with both the Ducks and Gulls in some capacity; as a 20-year-old, he\u2019ll be eligible to suit up for San Diego full-time. Playing mostly in the AHL should be in Luneau\u2019s best interest, as he hasn\u2019t skated in a game since Dec. 7, 2023. But since 34-year-old Radko Gudas is the only righty blueliner listed on Anaheim\u2019s 2024-25 roster, general manager Pat Verbeek might quickly look to Luneau for NHL depth purposes.\n\nCritically, Luneau was not present on the Ducks\u2019 2024 Development Camp roster, which trained from July 1-5. This was likely due to his recovery process, but the reason is unclear. Nonetheless, when Rookie Camp and Training Camp commence in September, Luneau will hope to make an impact and re-earn attention after missing months of playing opportunities.\n```"}

Since playing the Boston Red Sox in mid-June, the team lost their past seven series and is 6-16 over their last 22 games. A two-person powerhouse batting lineup\u2014Aaron Judge and Juan Soto\u2014combined with below-average pitching is not a viable strategy in the long term.\n\nSo, what has changed since that Boston series? The big issue is that the Yankees\u2019 pitching is throwing meatballs, and the electric offense has slowed down. New York\u2019s pitching was solid in the first months of the season, with a 3.06 ERA in April and an even better 2.44 in May. During June, that jumped to 5.26, which is eye-openingly bad. A slump that\u2019s bled into July has not yet seen Yankees pitchers improve, letting up 5.85 runs per game and more than nine runs in a quarter of these games. With only starter Clarke Schmidt and reliever Ian Hamilton on the IL, blaming injuries is a non-starter.\n\nThe Yankees, renowned for their powerful hitting, are also grappling with offensive issues. As a team, they have fallen below the Mendoza line in eight games during this slump. In nine of these games, they also failed to break the .300 mark in slugging, yet another source for concern. It was only when both the offense and defense were firing on all cylinders that the Yankees managed to secure victories. In their wins, New York held its opponent to five or fewer runs. The offense combined for eight or more runs in four out of five of these games, swinging at 0.324 as a team and slugging at an impressive .565.\n\nThe Yankees desperately need to stop the bleeding and have an excellent opportunity to do so against a tough AL East foe in the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nPitchers at the All-Star game\n\nThe NL this year features a young lineup of pitchers with 10 of 13 seeing the mound for the first time in an All-Star game. One of these players will be Paul Skenes of the Pirates. Skenes\u2013the rookie who\u2019s taken over baseball\u2013has a strong chance at starting for the NL. The Pirates\u2019 ace and first-draft pick has not been a disappointment thus far, as his dynamic pitching arsenal has dominated every team he\u2019s pitched against.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Philadelphia Phillies (3.24 team ERA) have the most throwers on the roster, led by veteran starter Zack Wheeler. With a 0.99 WHIP and 0.192 opposing batting average, the 34 year old makes just as strong a case that he should start the game.\n\nThe American League features players from some of the top teams in the league as well as some of the worst. Crochet, a part of the 27-68 White Sox, leads the league in strikeouts (146) and puts himself in a spot to be the starter this upcoming Tuesday. Another player whose resume fits the part is Detroit\u2019s Skubal. In his latest start, the lefty was able to strike out 13 and secure his tenth win of the season. Both Crochet and Skubal have put up Cy Young-worthy numbers and will hope to continue their dominant run after the All-Star break.\n\n2024 Draft preview\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians, Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies round out this year\u2019s top-three picks, and are each in a different situation. The Guardians stole the top pick despite having a 2 percent chance in the lottery, and should add more depth to their already solid team. The Reds are still in a heated race for a Wild Card in the NL, but is looking for a missing hitter to have a legitimate chance at a World Series next season. With the third pick, the Rockies need to be selective and find a player who they can build a dynasty around as they\u2019re rebuilding.\n\nPredictions\n\nNo. 1: Travis Bazzana, 2B, Oregon State\n\nBazzana is the clear No. 1 pick in this year\u2019s draft. The Australian has the bat speed to match the hardest-throwing pitchers and the eye to make adjustments toward any breaking balls. Even though the Guardians already have Andres Gimenez at second, Bazzana will be worth every penny.\n\nNo. 2: Jac Caglianone, 1B/LHP, Florida\n\nThe Reds have struggled with their hitting this year, and Caglianone will be a huge boost to their lineup. In his time as a Gator, his power is something that differentiates him from the rest of this year\u2019s draft class. His ability to stay behind the ball and use the force of his 6-foot-5-inch frame to his advantage is just what the Reds need.\n\nNo. 3: Charlie Condon, OF/3B, Georgia\n\nCondon is yet another SEC player who thrived in hitting, leading the NCAA in OPS at 1.565. The former Bulldog continuously did spectacular things at the plate, leading the nation in batting average at .433, setting a single-season record of 37 home runs in 60 games and winning the first Golden Spikes Award for his school. His versatility and consistency at the plate would put Colorado in a solid spot to rebuild and create a roster that can reach the .500 marker.\n\nA double play going into the weekend...\n\nThe first games to watch will be between the two leading offenses in the league in the Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles. This will be a major tipping point for New York on whether they can pull it together before it is too late. Their Wild Card lead has quickly disappeared, and they now only have a slight cushion. The Orioles, on the other hand, are looking to win the third and final series against their divisional rival. The Yankees have their supposed one, two and three pitchers on the mound in Gerrit Cole, Luis Gil and Carlos Rodon. With the way the Orioles have been batting as of late, the Yankees top-three will need to pitch well to have a chance at taking this series.\n\nPrediction: Orioles win the series, taking games one and three against the Yankees.\n\nThe other game to watch will be the All-Star game next Tuesday. With the top offensive players from teams like the Orioles, Yankees and Astros dominating the American League team, it will be tough for the National League to keep up with the firepower needed to win the game. On the flip side, the National League has some of the top pitchers, featuring Skenes and the Phillies\u2019 aces, to try and thwart the opposition in a fun and largely symbolic game.\n\nPrediction: The American League will be too powerful offensively and beat the National League.\n\nLast weekend, the Mets tied their four-game series and the Yankees lost theirs, bringing my prediction total to an improbable 0-4-2.\n```"}

(Photo by Ling Luo)\n\nBy Hali Mecklin and Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as July 11, 2024 at 3:17 pm PDT\n\nUSC President Carol Folt on Wednesday released the full results of the 2024 USC Culture Survey, which assesses USC\u2019s commitment to its values of accountability, diversity, equity and inclusion, integrity, excellence, well-being and open communication. Some results from the more than 15,000 responses showed confidence in the university\u2019s administration. Some did not.\n\n\u201cOur Board of Trustees, the entire university leadership team, and I are committed to ensuring an ethical and inclusive culture at USC that enables us to achieve our moonshots, fulfill our mission, and support every Trojan,\u201d Folt wrote in the email. \u201cOur ongoing Culture Journey is USC\u2019s roadmap for building on the unique strengths of our university community, while helping us address challenges and plan for the future.\u201d\n\nFolt released abbreviated early findings from the survey on June 6. This is Folt\u2019s first university-wide communique of her new term, after university officials told Annenberg Media on Tuesday that her contract had been \u201camended and extended.\u201d\n\nThe six values the survey assesses were defined in 2019, the same year Folt started her tenure. USC partnered with the Ethics & Compliance Initiative (ECI) to create the surveys, choosing ECI based on its experience with high education and reasonable costs as a non-profit, said Stacey Giwa, the Vice President of Culture, Ethics and Compliance, Chief Compliance Officer.\n\nTo promote outreach on campus, the university uses more than 40 students and faculty who have previous facilitation training and are being trained specifically to lead discussion sections rather than using a third party. In addition, USC plans to partner with student groups and student government in the Fall to generate ideas for the best approaches to informing students about discussion sessions.\n\n\u201cECI was a great partner for us because they checked all of those boxes,\u201d Giwa said in an interview Thursday. \u201cEntities will often pay third parties when they want to go into the discussion sessions or the report outs. We think our community primarily wants to talk to other community members.\u201d\n\nThe troubling\n\n1. Students didn\u2019t share their thoughts\nOnly 14% of undergraduates and 17% of graduate students submitted responses for the culture survey. This excludes the input of thousands of students, the majority of the community here at USC.\n\n\u201cOn its face, we really want input from our community, especially around the values of open communication and accountability. [Those values] are not as high as excellence, D.E.I. and integrity,\u201d Giwa said.\n\n2. Almost half of respondents said USC leaders don\u2019t take responsibility\n40% of all respondents disagreed with the idea that university leadership accepts responsibility for their actions.\n\n3. Faculty said university leaders don\u2019t facilitate open communication\nOnly 39% of faculty respondents said university leadership actively listens and solicits dialogue. Similarly, only 40% of faculty members said that USC encourages them to speak up.\n\n4. Tenured or tenure-track faculty had the least confidence in the university\u2019s accountability and integrity\nOnly 36% of tenured or tenure-track faculty said they see accountability at USC, and a mere 45% said they see integrity. Faculty who don\u2019t have tenure or aren\u2019t on the tenure track are slightly more confident, with 46% seeing accountability and 59% seeing integrity.\n\n\u201cI would say, no matter where you score, it\u2019s all valuable information. We do plan and have been engaging with the Academic Senate about the best ways to get the faculty\u2019s input on their responses,\u201d Giwa said. \u201cWe want to engage with all the groups because there\u2019s room to highlight our strengths and improve.\u201d\n\n5. Almost a quarter of respondents fear retaliation if they speak out at USC\n22% of respondents disagreed with the statement \u201cmembers of their peer group can raise concerns without fear of retaliation,\u201d and another 23% were neutral on the topic.\n\n\u201cWe will stress that [value of communication], and it\u2019s going to be something we focus on. How do we get that confidence [from students to talk]?\u201d Giwa said. \u201cWhen we do the discussion sessions, we don\u2019t disclose who comes to them, and we summarize and roll up themes. And that\u2019s just a best practice because we want candid conversation.\u201d\n\nThe positive\n\n1. Each of the six unifying values was recognized at USC, according to most respondents.\nThe university community was most confident in USC\u2019s commitment to excellence, with 83% saying they see it at USC. Accountability came in last out of the values, but 59% of respondents still agreed that it was present on campus.\n\n2. The majority of respondents said they believe USC supports their wellbeing\nA vast majority of respondents, 83%, said USC provides resources for mental health and wellbeing support, and 82% reported that their peers at USC support their wellbeing.\n\n\u201cWhen we saw that come in, and it does carry some of the numerous highs, it doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t get ideas to keep moving forward on that. But I would say that was a proud and humbling moment,\u201d said Giwa. \u201cOur community really wanted well-being as a value.\u201d\n\n3. We have confidence in our peers\n79% of respondents said their peers act as good role models of ethical behavior. Faculty was the most confident in each other, with 83% agreeing.\n\n4. USC encourages students to chase their dreams\n88% of undergraduates and 87% of graduates report being encouraged to pursue their goals. Faculty and staff felt less motivated by the university, with 62% and 65% agreeing.\n\n5. Most of us are proud to call ourselves Trojans\n82% of faculty, staff and students at USC said they\u2019re proud to be a member of USC.\n```"}

{"key": "/2024/07/10/country-club-current-small-change-huge-results-for-scheffler/", "response": "```\nCountry Club Current: Small change, huge results for Scheffler\n\nScottie Scheffler has been the world's No. 1 golfer since March 2022. (Photo courtesy of Scottie Scheffler and TaylorMadeGolf @scottie.scheffler @taylormadegolf)\n\nBy Robert Westermann July 10, 2024 at 9:11 am PDT\n\nWhen golf fans look back on this season five, 10 or 50 years from now, there are a handful of moments that will define it: Rory McIlroy choking away the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2; Xander Schauffele finally breaking through with a major win at the PGA Championship; first-time Tour winner Akshay Bhatia becoming a fan favorite. However, only one player\u2019s accomplishments will truly last long in the memory: Scottie Scheffler.\n\nScheffler won the Masters for the second time, putting the green jacket back on when he did for the first time in 2022. He also captured three other tournaments over the span of March and April, all of which were signature events. There\u2019s even a strong chance he would have been in contention for the PGA Championship had he not been arrested before his second round, the charges of which were later dropped. But even a morning in jail and a mugshot couldn\u2019t slow Scheffler down, as he went on to win both the Travelers and the Memorial in June.\n\nHis success largely rests on his ability to rack up greens in regulation, which is a huge part of why he\u2019s leading the tour in scoring (68.48) and birdie average (4.98 per round). When Scheffler lines up with an iron, it\u2019s almost guaranteed to land somewhere near the pin. That leaves him with lots of short putts that are automatic for professionals nowadays, a part of his game that used to be often maligned.\n\nLast year, Scheffler found himself on the bottom end of one putting ranking, finishing 162nd in strokes gained while putting (-0.301). Even though he ranked much better in the 2021-22 season at 58th, it was evident that poor putting was preventing him from reaching his full potential. One small change within his bag, though, was apparently all he needed.\n\nAfter Hideki Matsuyama won The Genesis Invitational in mid-February, Scheffler made the switch from a blade to a mallet putter and began quickly filling up his trophy cabinet. This year, he still ranks just 89th in strokes gained while putting (0.037), but he\u2019s won six Tour events since switching putters. His improved putting, combined with the rest of his game, puts him in contention week in, week out.\n\nAnother unique aspect of Scheffler\u2019s game is how he shuffles his feet when swinging his driver. He nearly jumps off the ground as he rotates his body when following through, adding distance off the tee. One might think that\u2019d lead to inaccuracy, but for Scheffler, it doesn\u2019t seem to cause any issues. Those fundamentals apply to the rest of his game, too, meaning that in the fairway, rough and on the green, his shots include more rotation compared to the average player on Tour.\n\nDue to that increased rotation, switching putters made such a huge difference because a mallet putter provides more stability than a blade. Blade putters\u2014normally lighter than mallets\u2014don\u2019t provide golfers with much forgiveness, either. They may be the best choice for golfers who line up putts well and have good touch on the greens, but are dangerous for those who frequently hit the ball too hard or too soft. A mallet putter will more often than not get the ball closer to the pin even if it decreases how often one makes hard putts, meaning it\u2019s better for golfers who struggle with their putting touch.\n\nAt the end of the day though, whether you have a blade putter or a mallet putter, a graphite shaft or a steel shaft, golf is all about how a player feels. And Scheffler undoubtedly feels good. Since winning the Travelers Championship three weekends ago, Scheffler\u2019s been absent from golf. He\u2019s taken the time off to be with his family, and frankly, to give other players a chance to win.\n\nIn terms of where Scheffler\u2019s season fits in with the all-time greatest, he has a chance to tie a bow on his campaign with a win at the British Open in two weeks. If Scheffler were to win the Open at Royal Troon, he\u2019d certainly beat Jordan Spieth\u2019s 2015 year (five wins, two majors). He\u2019d even match the best years from Tiger Woods, Ben Hogan and Bobby Jones. However, the difference with a comparison like that is those players didn\u2019t have signature events with increased prize money, meaning top players competed in less events. Woods\u2019 2000 (nine wins, three majors) is widely known as the best PGA Tour season ever, and he did so in a 20-event season compared to the 36 the Tour has now.\n\nRegardless of where Scheffler fits in amongst the greatest of all time and how the rest of his season goes, it\u2019s still one for the books. It\u2019s hard to argue against his pure domination, all while competing with a star-studded field week after week.\n```"}

The Lynx\u2019s (16-6) 3-point shooting was the centerpiece of their dominant victory, made possible by their quick ball movement and off-ball motion. Minnesota converted on nine of 18 shots from 3-point range and raised its WNBA-leading 3-point conversion rate to 39.1%. The Sparks (5-17) could not match the Lynx\u2019s 3-point flurry; Los Angeles ended the night shooting a poor 15% from deep.\n\n\u201cWe missed a lot of uncontested shots again. This is a make-or-miss league. You have got to make shots,\u201d said head coach Curt Miller postgame. \u201c[We] have got to stay confident. You can tell it\u2019s in their head right now that they are missing uncontested shots.\u201d\n\nMinnesota delivered a large first punch from the jump, setting the Sparks on an uphill climb the whole game. The Lynx led by as much as 14 points in the first quarter and never looked back. The Sparks eventually made their runs to cut the deficit to five in the second quarter but struggled to maintain the energy throughout the first half. Minnesota regained momentum heading into halftime, leading by 16 points at the break.\n\n\u201cI am not sure we were ready for the physicality and fight. As much as you preach it, they have to have the desire when they walk out there,\u201d Miller said.\n\nDespite the loss, Sparks guard Dearica Hamby displayed her All-Star prowess, serving as the only Los Angeles player to score in double-digits with 18 points. On top of her list of accolades, Hamby reached a milestone in the third quarter, surpassing the 3,000 career point mark.\n\nWhile the Sparks had successfully limited turnovers in recent games, the team returned to its bad habits on Tuesday night. Aggravated by the Lynx\u2019s on-ball pressure, the Sparks coughed up the ball a whopping 18 times.\n\n\u201cOur turnovers against a very good defensive team crept up again. Some were self-inflicted, and some were disappointing reads,\u201d Miller said.\n\nEven on a night when the Lynx were missing their best player, forward Napheesa Collier, Minnesota found strength in its depth. The Lynx had four players finish in double figures, as forward Droka Juhasz scored 15 points; Carleton scored 16; guard Kayla McBride scored 11; and bench forward Cecilia Zandalasini had 11.\n\n\u201cWe are running the same type of plays. It\u2019s a great learning lesson for us that we can learn from them; it\u2019s not the plays but the execution of plays,\u201d Miller said. \u201c[Minnesota] is so crisp. They run their stuff so hard. They are fast in short areas.\u201d\n\nNext, the Sparks will travel to face the Dallas Wings (5-17) on Saturday at 12:30 p.m. at College Park Center. The last meeting between Dallas and Los Angeles on June 7 resulted in an 81-72 win for the Sparks.\n```"}

The university spokesperson said that the decision to extend Folt\u2019s contract was made before July 1, but would not say why it was not shared until after Folt\u2019s contract was set to expire.\n\n\u201cPresident Folt\u2019s contract has been amended and extended, and the board is looking forward to her continued service,\u201d the university spokesperson said.\n\nUpdate: Three hours after this story was published, the university sent Annenberg Media a follow-up statement. \u201cPresident Folt\u2019s contract remains in full force. Like all university officers, the president is subject to annual review and reappointment, which occurred this last spring,\u201d the university statement read. \u201cThe Board remains pleased with the university\u2019s strong direction under President Folt\u2019s leadership.\u201d\n\nFolt had been scrutinized throughout the spring semester for her handling of protests on campus and her decisions to cancel valedictorian Asna Tabassum\u2019s speech and the main-stage commencement ceremony.

For a week after its expiration date, the university would not describe the status of her tenure, but confirmed she was currently president. The Board of Trustees did not respond to Annenberg Media\u2019s two requests for comment.\n\nThe L.A. Times reported in March 2019 that Folt had signed a five-year contract. At that time, the board\u2019s chairman, Rick Caruso, provided details about her compensation and the expected length of her tenure. He said that Folt would be paid the same as the university\u2019s former president, who earned more than $1 million annually, and that he expected her to serve for at least a decade.\n\nNeither the board, nor its chairwoman, Suzanne Nora Johnson, would respond to questions from Annenberg Media about Folt\u2019s current contract or compensation. A university spokesperson told Annenberg Media that there is no search committee to select the 13th president.\n```"}

With the arena rafters adorned by many championship banners, expectations naturally run high for Los Angeles basketball. This season, however, the LA Sparks (5-15)  have struggled in meeting these heightened expectations. However, Sparks star forward Hamby has consistently risen to the occasion, shouldering the immense responsibility of carrying the Sparks when they need her most. Friday night was no different, as Hamby excelled under the bright lights with her fierce intensity and leadership.\n\nBefore their showdown against the defending back-to-back champion Las Vegas Aces (12-7), the Sparks had been riding a challenging streak, losing their last eight games. In a desperate bid to turn things around, Los Angeles turned to its newly minted 2024 WNBA All-Star, Hamby. Hamby, now a three-time All-Star, followed up the announcement with a performance that truly underscored her value to the team. Her tied league-leading 13th double-double lifted the Sparks to a 98-93 overtime victory against her former team, the Aces. Hamby\u2019s 28 points and 14 rebounds, coupled with her stellar all-around play, marked her impressive\u2014and now signature\u2014performance.\n\n\u201cThat game is very special to Dearica and will always be,\u201d said head coach Curt Miller postgame. \u201cYou get an incredible effort from Hamby every night, but this is an extra special matchup.\u201d \n\nFacing the perennial-contending Aces, the Sparks took on the challenge head-on against a team featuring four members of the Paris 2024 Olympics team. Heading into the fourth quarter, the Sparks led by 10 points and had the Aces on their heels. But in the Sparks\u2019 typical fashion, their later lead evaporated in the blink of an eye. Aces forward A\u2019ja Wilson scored 12 of her 35 points in the fourth quarter, and guard Jackie Young\u2019s 3-point prowess carried Las Vegas back into the game. Before Los Angeles could find its footing, the Aces occupied the driver\u2019s seat with four minutes left to play.\n\nYet, despite the fourth-quarter woes, the young Sparks\u2019 composure shined through in the final minutes. Facing a two-point deficit with 15 seconds left, LA turned to six-year forward Stephanie Talbot. Defended by former Sparks legend Chelsea Gray, Talbot utilized her 6-foot-2 frame, creating space for a game-tying, fading jumper to force overtime at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nTalbot finished the game with 13 points, five rebounds, and nine assists. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get talked about, but Steph Talbot is a really good passer,\u201d Miller said. In overtime, the Sparks remained active on the defensive side and composed offensively to produce their first win since June 9, defeating the Aces 96-92. Hamby scored five of her 28 points during the extra period, igniting the crowd with an and-one layup to give the Sparks a five-point lead with 24 seconds left.\n\n\u201cAnother fourth-quarter lead disappeared, but this is what we\u2019re talking about with a young team. You just have to keep putting them back in that situation,\u201d Miller said. \u201cTonight, they responded with some real grittiness and toughness.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s win marks the first time since 2019 that the Sparks have beaten the Aces in back-to-back matchups in a season. Friday\u2019s win snapped the Ace\u2019s six-game winning streak. \u201cRight now, there is a confidence in that locker room that they can match up with Vegas, as talented and as much respect we have for them,\u201d Miller said.\n\nOn top of Hamby\u2019s brilliant performance, Aari McDonald had herself a career night, scoring 23 points. The fourth-year facilitator has lately come into her own as the Sparks\u2019 point guard, causing problems all night for her former college teammate, Aces guard Kelsey Plum. McDonald finished the night above 50% from beyond the arc.\n\nRookie forward Rickea Jackson added 14 points, six rebounds and three assists, shooting a solid 37% from 3-point range. The Sparks\u2019 offensive pace flowed smoothly and heavily limited their season-long turnover issues. Los Angeles coughed the ball up a season-low three times while they forced Las Vegas to turn it over 10 times.\n\nNext, the Sparks host the Phoenix Mercury (10-10) on Sunday at 4 p.m. Both teams will look to extend their win streak to two, as the Mercury are coming off a Wednesday night win versus the Dallas Wings.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nBy Wellesley Mobasser July 06, 2024 at 12:00 pm PDT\n\nA third of the way through Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie, a meek assistant (played by Connor Swindells) asks the villainous CEO of Mattel (played by Will Ferrell), a plausible question indeed: \u201cIs Barbie Land like an alternate reality, or a place where your imagination goes?\u201d The table of suits answers in unison, \u201cYes.\u201d This serves as a comedic moment, sure, but more intentionally as Gerwig\u2019s discreet acknowledgment that Barbie\u2019s world-building makes no sense, and as a lousy attempt to absolve herself for a half-baked story and refusal to respect her audience.\n\nDucking behind self-conscious copouts such as this one, Gerwig deftly avoids the responsibility to ground Barbie in logic, reality\u2014or anything, really\u2014talking at her audience indignantly under the unassailable guise of feminism. Gerwig has dreamt up two worlds, both shaped by unchecked embitterment and willful delusion. One is the so-called real world, where people are so unrealistically misogynistic that dialogue beats conveniently fall into Gerwig\u2019s lap (i.e., the seemingly archaic sheriff\u2019s remark that Barbie is \u201cbetter in more clothes because you can imagine more\u201d), and the other is the Barbie Land, where everything is perfect, such that minor imperfections such as cellulite strike fear into the Barbies\u2019 hearts (yet, somehow, actual fat people don\u2019t experience a batted eye in Barbie Land). Barbie seethes at the alleged rules of the real world without even being able to follow the rules of its own. It laments everything and respects nothing.\n\nThis is because Barbie is not meant to tell a story; it is meant to push an ideology (and an incoherent one, at that). Gerwig\u2019s intention was not to make viewers feel but rather to make them agree. This becomes apparent in scenes such as when the Mattel execs are fooled by Barbie\u2019s excuse that she needs to make a trip to the bathroom, despite the knowledge of\u2013\u2013and the script\u2019s repeated reference to\u2013\u2013her not having genitals. Gerwig neglects to create a villain worth his salt (or even one who is sentient!) because her priority is getting to the next story beat wherein Barbie can learn something about how hard it is to be a woman.\n\nThe movie\u2019s marketing and lore in general was built largely on the virtue of its aesthetics. In love with its own collection of exquisite Chanel hats and recreations of iconic Barbie outfits, the film could be adequately described as one long dress-up party. Behind-the-scenes photos that circulated before Barbie\u2019s release got fans chomping at the bits to see its stars in their neon rollerblading getups, and the classically beautiful Margot Robbie was shilled onto ticket-buyers from every angle, in every outfit. The movie rode upon her image as much as it did her acting. And yet, Barbie scorns \u201cStereotypical Barbie\u201d and the concept of ideal feminine beauty at every turn. It laments Robbie\u2019s looks whilst obviously worshipping them simultaneously. It wails about beauty standards whilst intentionally capitalizing on them in the same breath.\n\nIn this vein, it is worth asking: would Barbie have done as well as it did if the originally slated Amy Schumer was ultimately given the role? One might find it interesting to hear Gerwig\u2019s reasoning for the recast.\n\nThere is no doubt Barbie alleges to be a feminist satire. I would urge viewers to question if it has earned either part of that description. Satire in general may fail to strike the same emotional chords that an earnest story does, but at least it delights us with its cleverness by not explicitly talking about the thing it seeks to comment on, whereas Barbie only talks about that thing. As for its claims at feminism, I would encourage viewers to hold filmmakers to a higher standard than the cheap sentiments Gerwig has sold as thought-provoking. I would implore them to examine that same meek assistant, and to challenge the depth or nuance of Gerwig\u2019s defeatist outlook: \u201cI\u2019m a man with no power; does that make me a woman?\u201d Middle school debate teams facilitate more productive and interesting discourses than this one.\n\nWhen the movie draws to a close and I am released from Gerwig\u2019s incessant whining, I am certain of one thing: it is hard to be a woman, but it is even harder to be an audience member at the whims of an undisciplined director with an insatiable desire to moralize\u2014in a Chevy commercial, no less!\n```"}

The draw confirmed Colombia as the winner of Group D, while Brazil qualified for the next round as runners-up. The two South American heavyweights will join Argentina, Canada, Venezuela, Ecuador, Uruguay and Panama \u2014 but notably not the United States \u2014 in the quarterfinals.\n\nRaphinha opened the scoring for Brazil in the 12th minute with a beautiful free kick that goalkeeper Camilo Vargas could only tip further into the top corner. After one Colombian equalizer was ruled out, Daniel Mu\u00f1oz finally broke through for Colombia in first half stoppage time.\n\nColombian fans came out in droves, appearing to make up about 80% of the crowd. They were loud from before kickoff, cheering even the simple awarding of a goal kick to their side, and jeering the Brazilian team when it had possession. The match was thrilling from start to finish, with Brazil needing a late goal to win the group, though Colombia came closest to finding a winner.\n\nOverall, the two teams have established themselves as the class of the tournament and will be favorites to beat Uruguay and Panama, respectively, to qualify for the semifinal.

The mediocre turnout was matched by mediocre play from the US, losing a pivotal match 2-1 to Panama after Timothy Weah received a red card in the first half for hitting an opponent in the face. Then, in a must-win match against Uruguay \u2014 the most formidable of the USMNT\u2019s three group-stage opponents \u2014 Gregg Berhalter\u2019s squad failed to rise to the occasion, losing 1-0 to end Berhalter\u2019s tournament early and put his job in jeopardy.\n\nElsewhere, Venezuela has been the tournament\u2019s surprise so far, winning all three of its games to win Group B.

(Photo courtesy of Paul Skenes and the Pittsburgh Pirates @paulskenes @pittsburghpirates)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler July 05, 2024 at 10:42 am PDT\n\nWho wore it best on the Fourth? Many Americans\u2019 favorite pastime is a staple on the Fourth of July. From then-Astros pitcher Nolan Ryan tossing his 3,000 strikeout to the iconic scene in The Sandlot when the kids play beneath fireworks, baseball and the Fourth of July have been intertwined for as long as the two have existed. As with many other holidays, the MLB creates fun alternate uniforms to celebrate the day. Each team\u2019s unique look allows critics and fans alike to debate over which team did it best. However, one team in particular hit a grand slam with their new look. Representing the capital, the Washington Nationals fitted nicely in their red, white and blue uniforms. Matched with their normal jersey and pants, the only change made was to the hat: It was all white, with a red brim and a \u2018W\u2019 covered with stars and stripes. The team (41-46) managed a sneaky 1-0 victory over an even-matched New York Mets team. The patriotic uniform fit the Nationals perfectly and would be a great addition to their season-long uniform rotation.\n\nA new look for the Home Run Derby\n\nThe first significant change in this year\u2019s Home Run Derby is the opening round of the competition, where unlike the original one-on-one format, the eight competitors will now battle the field for the four positions. The elimination process is simple: those who hit the least amount of home runs will be out. In the case of ties during this round, the competitor with the longer hit advances. The semi-final round will see the return of the head-to-head format, though. The field leader will face the fourth seed, and the second and third seeds will fight for their respective spot in the finals. Ties during the final two rounds will result in a 60-second swing off.\n\nThe second change in this year\u2019s Derby is the timed format. Since the format\u2019s introduction in 2015, the competition has become more about endurance than hitting. This year, the rules have been adjusted to lessen the importance of endurance. The MLB is adapting the competition to be more like the NBA\u2019s 3-point contest. Participants will now have 40 pitches or three minutes\u2014whichever comes first\u2014in the first two rounds, and 27 pitches or two minutes in the finals. The MLB also made a change to the bonus balls. Each player will earn three additional outs, where each ball that is not a home run is considered an out. However, players can now earn another out if they hit a bomb greater than 425 feet, giving those with slow starts a chance to catch up.\n\nPaul Skenes: Overrated or Easy NL Rookie of the Year?\n\nThe first pick in the 2023 draft saw the Pittsburgh Pirates select Paul Skenes from LSU. Winning the College World Series a few weeks prior, many wondered whether the hard-throwing righty had what it took to translate his game to the MLB level. During his time as a Tiger, Skenes had a record of 13-2, with a 1.69 ERA over 122 innings, in which he had over 200 strikeouts and just 20 walks. After dominating the triple-A with similar stats (0.99 ERA, 27 IP, and 45 SO), his first start for the Pirates came against the Chicago Cubs. Skenes proved he can belong in the league despite giving up three runs on six hits. During the four innings, he punched out seven and achieved a velocity of over 100 mph on 17 of 33 fastballs. A disgusting five-pitch arsenal with above-average spin rates, Skenes can mix in offspeed that runs up to 16 inches at times. His slider\u2014about 15 mph slower than the fastball\u2014is his go-to offspeed pitch that acts like a sweeper and tunnels great with his fastball. The right-hander has put up great numbers so far, the most impressive being that he has not yet left a game with his team trailing. His 2.06 ERA and 70 strikeouts give him a strong shot to be in the All-Star game, and he is currently favored to win the NL Rookie of the Year award. However, the scariest part of all of this is that he has yet to be visited by Tommy John. Throwing at the velocity, spin rate and volume that he does all lead toward one direction, and it is not one that a young talent like Skenes wants to be heading. The Pirates need to pay close attention to him, especially his elbow, or else he might walk alongside Tim Lincecum as one of the greatest what-ifs in all of sports.\n\nA double play going into the weekend...\n\nThe first series to look at this weekend will be the Mets (42-43) against the Pirates (41-45). The Mets, who have won 18 of their last 26, have fought their way to two and a half games back from the St. Louis Cardinals and the final Wild Card spot in the NL. On the flip side, the Pirates are four games back from that same position, and a series win will put them in a solid position as they pass the halfway mark of the season. Friday\u2019s game one matchup features the Mets\u2019s Luis Severino, who has led his team to victory in five of his last six starts. On the other side is Skenes, who is looking to garner yet another win and move the Pirates closer to a wild-card bid. Saturday and Sunday\u2019s day games will be fun to watch as New York\u2019s electric offense will go to work against Bailey Falter and then Mitch Keller. Prediction: Skenes will lead the Pirates to a victory in the first game, but the Mets\u2019s offense will take over and win the final two.\n\nThe second series to watch is one of the greatest rivalries in all of sports: The Boston Red Sox against the New York Yankees. The Red Sox (45-39) are half a game back in the AL Wild Card and want to stay close to the third place Kansas City Royals before the two matchup late next week. The Yankees, safely in first place in the wild-card, look to keep their lead but, more importantly, need to get back to the baseball they were playing earlier this year. They are 3-7 in their last ten outings and have been poor since their previous matchup against Boston, when they lost two out of three. The Yankees will have a relatively strong part of their rotation ready for the Sox. In game one, Nestor Cortes will start and likely tally his 100th strikeout of the season. In game two, Gerrit Cole\u2014who missed the start of the season due to elbow inflammation\u2014will start in his fourth game of the season. Game three will be the struggling Luis Gil, who gave up 16 runs in his last nine innings. Boston needs to be aggressive at the plate to win in New York. Prediction: The Yankees take all three games against the Sox.\n\nBoth the Mets and Mariners lost their series last weekend, bringing my prediction total to 0-3-1.\n```"}

For some golfers, making one particular coaching change can make all the difference.\n\nWyndham Clark poses with the trophy after winning the 2023 U.S. Open, a surprise result at the time. (Photo courtesy of Wyndham Clark and the U.S. Open @wyndhamclark @usopengolf)\n\nJuly 04, 2024 at 12:49 pm PDT\n\nSometimes, all it takes to shift an athletes\u2019 trajectory is one seemingly tiny change. Over the years, golfers have made changes to their game beyond the clubs in their bags. Six-time PGA Tour winner Viktor Hovland parted ways with swing coach Joe Mayo after the 2022-23 season even after raking in $30 million in earnings. Now, the two have joined forces once again after Hovland had a disappointing start to the year. Justin Thomas also made a significant change to his team when he limited how much he relied on his coach\u2014and father\u2014to address the issues in his game. In April, Thomas also split with caddie Jim \u2018Bones\u2019 Mackay, who had carried Phil Mickelson\u2019s bag for 25 years prior to pairing with Thomas in September 2021.\n\nThe trend of golfers making sudden changes continued in 2022 when Rickie Fowler reunited with his old coach, Butch Harmon, during a season that was not going his way. With Butch\u2019s help to undo some poor habits, Fowler quickly recorded two top-10 finishes in their first month back together. Fowler\u2019s case proves that making sudden changes is something that players should seriously consider in times of need.\n\nSo, what do these adjustments and their impacts say about golf and its direction? The sport is more of a team game than one might expect. At the end of the day, the golfers are the ones who swing the club and ultimately control their own destiny. Their caddies can give recommendations during tournaments and their swing coaches can give them suggestions, but their career outcomes are essentially up to the athletes. That isn\u2019t any different than other sports.\n\nThe difference between golf and other sports, however, is the importance of a psychological coach, someone who helps players navigate the mental aspects of the game. Sure, teams of other sports have them on staff, but because golf success relies so much on one\u2019s ability to think clearly and manage emotions, some players are expanding their coaching staff beyond their swing.\n\n2023 U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark is one of the first to utilize one to perform at the highest level. As detailed in Netflix\u2019s Full Swing, American sports psychologist Julie Elion was a huge part of Clark\u2019s win at Los Angeles Country Club. He entered the Open with 120-1 odds of hoisting the trophy on Sunday, but was able to hold off Rory McIlroy miraculously. Most of the crowd was rooting for McIlroy, who still seeks a fifth major after a long drought, creating a challenging environment for Clark that didn\u2019t necessarily test his ability to play golf, but rather pushed his ability to perform in big moments.\n\nClark has openly said that he talks with Elion almost every day. She helped him recover from a time when he literally told himself that he didn\u2019t want to pick up a club again. He genuinely lacked the confidence a top golfer needs to perform on Tour every weekend. His caddie, John Ellis, recalled how Clark told himself he wasn\u2019t good enough and that he continued to make his situation worse.\n\nElion\u2019s addition to Team Clark was exactly the change he needed. Elion also works with fellow Tour golfers Max Homa and Justin Thomas, who have both had their share of struggles and success throughout their careers. Thomas, who has won two PGA Championships, failed to place in the top 70 of the FedEx Cup standings last season. Now, he\u2019s at No. 16 in the standings, ensuring himself a spot in the Tour playoffs. Homa, on the other hand, is still seeking his first major victory. He\u2019s consistently one of the best golfers on Tour, but has just two top-10 finishes at major tournaments to show for it.\n\nThe direction that players under Elion\u2019s guidance seems to be trending upward, as all three players sit comfortably in the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings. Golfers\u2019 reliance on coaches like Elion signal that golf is headed in a direction where it might not be the individual sport that it\u2019s been known as.

The career development platform uses structured networking bootcamps and community support to help students looking to further their career. It offers a comprehensive approach to networking, focused on practice, learning and community engagement.\n\nJashin Lin, the founder and CEO of Growbie, brings a wealth of experience and personal insight into the challenges faced by international students. At 30 years old, Lin hails from Shanghai, China, and completed her undergraduate studies at Boston University. With a background that includes overcoming similar obstacles, Lin is deeply passionate about helping others navigate their professional journeys in a foreign culture.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to unlock career success for international students,\u201d said Lin. \u201cRight now, we are focusing on Chinese international students and young working professionals, predominantly in America.\u201d\n\nGrowbie addresses a crucial need by teaching first-generation international students how to network effectively. Lin explained, \u201cWe teach this group step-by-step through our signature networking bootcamp. It\u2019s a month-long experience with three main components: practice, career-focused learning, and community.\u201d\n\nGrowbie\u2019s boot camp emphasizes hands-on training, including mock networking sessions with feedback, one-on-one elevator pitch sessions, and peer interactions. \u201cWe are very strong on practice,\u201d Lin noted. This practical approach is paired with a detailed career curriculum that looks to cover every aspect of networking, from goal-setting to professional relationship maintenance.\n\nThe third pillar of Growbie\u2019s program is its vibrant community. \u201cWe now have over two hundred people in our group, hosting both online and in-person events,\u201d Lin shared. These events range from negotiation workshops to corporate panels and social networking gatherings, providing a supportive environment for students to hone their skills.\n\nJashin Lin speaks at Boston University (Photo courtesy of Jashin Lin)\n\n\u201cThis is a passion project of mine since my time back in college,\u201d Lin recalled. Having attended Boston University, she observed the challenges faced by international students, particularly those from China. \u201cI saw a lot of international students but very few leaders among them,\u201d she said. \u201cChinese students tend to stick with each other instead of mingling with locals or other international students.\u201d\n\nLin identified a significant divide in social integration and networking skills, something that became apparent when she began seeking job opportunities. \u201cNetworking with locals is extremely critical, especially in fields like investment banking,\u201d she emphasized. \u201cI realized there\u2019s a big gap in socializing with locals, and I am passionate about solving that.\u201d\n\nThis disconnect, Lin explained, stems from several factors, including differences in educational systems and cultural norms. \u201cIn Chinese education, we are very focused on academics. But in America, there\u2019s a comprehensive evaluation that includes extracurricular leadership,\u201d she pointed out. Additionally, the networking culture in the U.S. is more open to strangers and informal interactions, unlike in China.\n\nLin hopes to address adjusting to these cultural differences in her work. \u201cMost students realize the importance of networking when they come to the U.S., but they don\u2019t know how to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no class or mentor to guide them through the specifics.\u201d\n\nThe reason Lin hopes to be that guidance is because she has her own fair share of success and stumbles she made along the way. \u201cAs a freshman, I once misspelled an alumnus\u2019s name in an email, which ended our communication,\u201d said Lin. \u201cHis name was Slava, but in my haste, I wrote \u2018Slave.\u2019 The autocorrect feature didn\u2019t help either, turning my genuine effort into a grievous mistake. It was a painful lesson that taught me to double-check everything, especially names. It\u2019s a small detail, but it can make a huge difference in how you are perceived. Now, I always ensure to triple-check names and other crucial details before hitting send.\u201d\n\nIn drawing on these personal experiences, Lin developed the central demographic of her platform. \u201cWe focus on international students because it\u2019s a community I come from, and I want to prevent them from repeating my mistakes,\u201d she said. That said, Lin asserts that the networking skills they teach are universal. \u201cNetworking is essential for everyone,\u201d she said. In fact, she notes that 80% of her students are Americans in her Boston University lectures.\n\nFor students, Lin shares three pieces of networking advice: Show Up: \u201cYou miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t take. If you\u2019re not there in the room, there\u2019s no network to be built.\u201d Take Initiative: \u201cPeople are kinder than you think. Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out and ask for help.\u201d Come Prepared: \u201cDo your research and come prepared. Show that you value the other person\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nJashin Lin speaks at a USC CGSA networking event panel (Photo courtesy of USC CGSA)\n\nIn addition to its core programs, Growbie recently collaborated with the Chinese Graduate Student Association (CGSA) at the University of Southern California. This partnership aims to open these networking services to CGSA members. The two also share common goals, with CGSA working across USC\u2019s graduate schools, offering both social and professional opportunities for building a strong network and unifying the community.\n\nThis collaboration included an event hosted by the USC CGSA Career Development Department near USC on March 23. The Southern California Career Development and Networking Summit attracted over 20 distinguished guests from various fields, including technology, investment, media, and entrepreneurship. Growbie was a significant part of this event, contributing to a panel that discussed the value of networking and career development.\n\nBy leveraging USC\u2019s platform, the summit aimed to establish the CGSA Career Development Department as the premier hub for young talent, social resources, and career and entrepreneurship exchanges in Southern California.\n\nLin invites international students, particularly those from East Asia, to explore Growbie\u2019s resources. \u201cWe are very focused on developing social confidence for international students,\u201d she said.\n```"}

Washington guard Shatori Walker-Kimbrough scored 17 points and threaded 4 assists, lifting the Mystics (5-15) to an 82-80 victory on Tuesday night versus the Los Angeles Sparks (4-15) at Crypto.com Arena. The Sparks\u2019 inability to seal the deal in the fourth quarter overshadowed an impressive first-half performance from LA, which held a five-point lead at halftime. As the Sparks\u2019 offense ran dry in the fourth quarter, Washington capitalized with its 3-point shooting to pull itself back into the game. The Mystics finished the night shooting 46% from beyond the arc.\n\n \u201c[The Mystics] made big threes off slippage defensively, and mistakes made by our players and coverage in the fourth quarter,\u201d said head coach Curt Miller postgame. \u201cAnd that has been their recipe for their five wins.\u201d The Sparks\u2019 struggle to close out winnable games has become a recurring theme. In the fourth quarter, Los Angeles\u2019 undisciplined possessions\u2014consisting of poor shot attempts, missed layups, and late transitions on defense\u2014led to it being outscored 30 to 16 by Washington. \u201cI feel like we stop moving, and some of that is nerves,\u201d Miller said.\n\nOn top of the woes, the Sparks shot just 61.1% from the free-throw line, missing valuable charity stripe shots in the final minutes. The Sparks also ended the night with 28 made field goals on 22 team assists. Los Angeles\u2019 main problem is not having a late-game option to produce offense in the clutch. The team merely relies on guard Aari McDonald and forward Dearica Hamby as its two primary options in the final minutes. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a one-on-one break-you-down guard ... so it has to be a team effort, \" Miller said.\n\nHamby gave it her all on the same night as she was named to the 2024 WNBA All-Star game, scoring 16 points and grabbing 11 rebounds, ultimately putting together her 12th double-double of the year. Yet, Hamby\u2019s offense flamed out in the fourth quarter, as she scored her final two points with six minutes left in the game. McDonald, who possesses great vision as a facilitator and can score, showcased her usual ability with 17 points and six assists on the night. But late in the game, the Mystics\u2019 aggressive on-ball pressure hindered McDonald\u2019s true shot-making ability.\n\nThe Sparks extended their losing streak to eight games and are now winless since June 9. Next, the Sparks host the red-hot Las Vegas Aces (11-6) on Friday at 7 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo by Kasey Kazliner)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nJuly 02, 2024 at 4:14 pm PDT\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Unlike other teams, the Kings didn\u2019t have an abundance of selections at the 2024 NHL Entry Draft because of various trades, but they still accumulated prospect depth in a variety of areas. After taking forward Liam Greentree with the No. 26 overall pick, general manager Rob Blake made phone calls to three more youngsters, in rounds two, six and seven.\n\nRound 2, No. 57 overall: Carter George, G\nLA\u2019s netminder pipeline is quite bare, so taking a confident goalie in the earlier rounds wasn\u2019t a bad call by any means, especially one who grew up as a Kings fan. Carter George was one of the more highly rated goaltender prospects coming out of the Canadian juniors, standing 6-foot-1 and 194 pounds. George\u2019s raw numbers weren\u2019t stellar in 2023-24, but neither were his team\u2019s; the Ontario Hockey League\u2019s Owen Sound Attack made the playoffs, but finished under .500. Simply put, giving up a hefty amount of shots will do that to a team, as George faced an OHL-leading 1,923 this past season. This stat makes George\u2019s 3.30 goals-against average and .907 save percentage a bit misleading, as he was a main contributor to Owen Sound\u2019s wins. He was credited with 21 of the team\u2019s 29 victories with four shutouts in 56 appearances. His best showing came on Nov. 23, 2023, when made 50 stops against the Barrie Colts and kept them scoreless. He also thrived at Under-18 World Juniors this year, going undefeated with six wins, a 2.33 GAA and .915 save percentage. George moves the puck with ease, always staying composed and confident. While he doesn\u2019t possess a huge frame, he plays much bigger than he looks and always keeps a firm eye on the puck. He\u2019ll aim to progress through a Kings\u2019 goaltender pipeline still navigating the post-Jonathan Quick era.\n\nRound 6, No. 164 overall: Jared Woolley, D\nThe Kings acquired the No. 164 overall pick via a trade with the Anaheim Ducks which they used to select Jared Woolley out of the OHL. A member of the league-winning London Knights, the 18-year-old posted five points in 37 games, plus three points in the playoffs. This came following a 19-game stint in the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League, where he played at a point-per-game pace. As a left-hander, Woolley is a force in the defensive zone. He\u2019s scary to face, boasting a commanding 6-foot-4, 214-pound frame and exerting his toughness on the regular. He\u2019s never afraid to lay down a big hit, trap his opponents or use his body to create space for others. When he returns to London next season, Woolley will want to emphasize showcasing his offensive ability across a full season of action. On a team that just fell short in the Memorial Cup, he\u2019ll aim to use his physical strength to continue manning the blue line. While he was a late-round pick, his untapped potential on a premier OHL side should catch the attention of Kings scouts as the season turns over.\n\nRound 7, No. 198 overall: James Reeder, RW\nJames Reeder elevated his game in the United States Hockey League in 2023-24, reaching the 60-point mark with 20 goals and 40 helpers. A University of Denver commit, Reeder is fast, elusive and crafty with the puck. Despite being a smaller 5-foot-10 and 170-pound skater, Reeder\u2019s well-trained hockey eye helps him make intelligent decisions and overcome his frame. He often thoroughly scans the ice to find the right play, using his speed in all three zones to win the puck and outmatch opponents. Likely still growing at 18 years old, Reeder should aim to hit the weight room when he joins national champion Denver. After a solid season in the USHL, scooping him up in the final round represents strong value for Blake and company. Reeder is an offensive weapon with room to grow, literally and figuratively, before he makes the push into the pros. Reeder\u2019s skill set is built on a high motor and his keen vision makes him a promising youngster.\n```"}

Carlisle says these ambassadors are former police officers managed by Allied Security, and were hired by the university for an additional layer of safety.\n\n\u201cThey were just there as a precaution because we didn\u2019t have enough staff to handle that ourselves,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cThey\u2019re just a highly visible security presence that lends to the seriousness of the campus restrictions. Their presence is currently being evaluated.\u201d\n\nCarlisle said that the university assesses these precautions weekly for effectiveness, but the USC community can expect some changes come next semester. \u201cTo be practical, we will probably have to open some additional pedestrian gates,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cThere\u2019s some other ideas about how to accommodate our students, faculty and staff, but that will be a decision made by senior administrators before the beginning of the fall semester.\u201d\n\nCorrection: In a previous version of this story, the headline read that restrictions would continue through fall. Our source only confirmed they would continue for the foreseeable future. The headline has been changed to reflect this correction on July 2 at 1:08 p.m.\n```"}

He has been active in cyberspace as an influencer since he was 16. In TEDxSacredHeartSchoolsAtherton\u2019s \u201c Social Media Saved my Life ,\u201d Huey was open about his experience of being bullied in middle school because he was \u201cthe new kid in school.\u201d To cope, he turned to social media for hope and love that were missing in the classroom, creating music that sends positive energy to the online community. Today, Huey has garnered over 2 million followers on social media, released over 15 songs and launched three startups including Reach, whose mission is \u201cto nurture aspiring influencers and provide them with the tools to navigate the creator economy successfully.\u201d Reach is a community where student content creators and others interested in pursuing a career in the social media industry come together to refine their skills and network. The club has branches at over 10 universities.\n\nYet, the line between transactional relationships and friendships blurs when you have an online presence and command influence. Huey has admitted that his influencer life leads to no sense of real privacy and has created difficulty around social climbers befriending him. \u201cIt\u2019s lonely at the top. The circle becomes smaller the higher you reach.\u201d Huey said, \u201cContrary to the majority, to me, money is not the motivation. It\u2019s about being vulnerable and building a community. I saw that a lot of creators went through similar struggles as me. Everyone, at the end of the day, is a human.\u201d\n\nGraduated in May 2024, Huey majored in business administration with a minor in music industry. He now lives in Downtown LA with his roommate from USC.\n\nWaking up to respond texts \u201cI usually sleep at 5 a.m. and then I\u2019ll wake up at 7 a.m. So I\u2019ve been running on two hours of sleep every day for three or four years. And I\u2019ve never had coffee in my life.\u201d \u201cIf you come here at 7 a.m., you will catch me sitting on my bed, staring at my phone for 30 minutes looking at friends\u2019 Instagram stories.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll text people at 5 a.m. for company ideas: \u2018We have to do this,\u2019 then I\u2019ll wake up at 7. And I\u2019ll also respond to people when they are awake.\u201d \u201cI am very responsive and pride myself on taking less than five minutes to text back unless I\u2019m in a final exam or other situations when I genuinely can\u2019t get to my phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI eat two meals a day, typically breakfast/lunch and dinner. But I don\u2019t cook, just DoorDash. I haven\u2019t cooked in like a year. Other than baking once or twice.\u201d\n\nThe cookies Huey \u201cbaked\u201d from last night. (Photo by Wendi Lu)\n\nWhy college? \u201cThere was a point in my life where I wanted to drop out of school, but my parents valued education. So, I negotiated with them and came to a compromise: if I wanted to live in Los Angeles, I\u2019d have to go to college in LA. USC was my first choice and I loved my time here. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing, especially because Reach was born out of USC.\u201d\n\n\u201cGraduation doesn\u2019t feel any different, minus the classes. My education was more focused on networking and gaining resources rather than the textbook style of learning.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs an entrepreneur, I was already doing everything I learned in class. I took what I learned in class, including skill sets and values, and applied it to my company.\u201d\n\nHuey\u2019s souvenirs from some of the events that he has participated in. (Photo by Wendi Lu)\n\nInfluencer event No.1 \u2014 influencer gifting \u201cTypically, I\u2019ll have one or two influencer events every single day. I haven\u2019t had a day where there were no events.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my job to show up to events to network and hang out. As an influencer, you dress on the extreme side of the spectrum: either go very formal or well dressed or casual.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a small intimate event with forty people, and there are events of a larger scale. I did a gifting suite for Coachella, and we had 750 people. Giftings are always enticing though. Look at the bag: a trucker hat from True Religion, makeup from Pixi Beauty, essential oil and extra crispy chips.\u201d\n\nHuey being photographed in his typical outfit: a white T-shirt and sweatpants.\n(Photo by Wendi Lu)\n\n\u201cFor influencer events in LA, it\u2019s the same group of people. Everybody knows me if they\u2019ve been to my events.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t dig the host, you won\u2019t get in. In this case, I was approved because the host knows who I am. It\u2019s not only based on followers but also on them knowing who you are. I have six million followers, but if they don\u2019t personally know me, they won\u2019t accept me.\u201d\n\nWorking style \u201cI have a team, but I try to be independent and not rely on them. I like to get ahead and do work myself. I\u2019d say the successful people are the ones who are working their ass off every day. Then there are people who are complacent with where they\u2019re at and rely on their team. But even then you still need to keep growing your team if you\u2019re trying to elevate yourself, there\u2019s only so much bandwidth that you can do alone.\u201d\n\nHuey\u2019s to-do board in his room. (Photo by Wendi Lu)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re deciding between being a small business or a large corporation. At Reach, we\u2019re trying to build a company that has longevity.\u201d\n\nGym \u201cI used to work out every day. Because I\u2019m more busy now, it\u2019s four to five times per week. It\u2019s at an obscure time too. For example, today is in the afternoon. I rotate between cardio only and cardio/weight training.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I answer calls while I am on the treadmill. It\u2019s all about multitasking. As an entrepreneur, you have to do a little bit of everything simultaneously. So, if there\u2019s a call I have to take, I will take it.\u201d\n\nWork \u2014 event planning \u201cI am making a playlist for a Creator House that\u2019s coming up in Chicago this August. We have 10 artists right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have reached out to companies, and seven have got back to me. I would love to get a million brands to sponsor this event. It\u2019s the more, the merrier at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nOnce while Huey was drunk, he drew all the brands that occupy a piece of his mind. (Photo by Wendi Lu)\n\nInfluencer event No. 2 \u2014 OTH \u201cI generally don\u2019t have an agenda for every event. Sometimes I network and meet cool people, sometimes for the vibe or for free products. It\u2019s different every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe crucial message I want to deliver is that I\u2019m here, being present. In terms of social media, going to events shows that you\u2019re relevant and brands will register that as a sign of loyalty. People who show loyalty will get future opportunities from that company, who recognize that they are fans.\u201d\n\nHuey was photographed along with two other influencers. (Photo by Wendi Lu)\n\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s what\u2019s important for me as someone who attends these events, especially if it\u2019s a branded event.\u201d\n\nWork \u2014 playing catch up \u201cI go to sleep when my eyes close, but until then, I am responding to more emails until 1 a.m. Sunday is a perfect time to play catch up since people won\u2019t actively respond. At least I can clear my inbox. Because I have meetings every single day on the weekdays, so there\u2019s no time to respond to emails until late at night. And then late at night, there\u2019s only so much work that I could do. We can have more time to do work.\u201d\n\n\u201cStarting tomorrow, I will have Zoom meetings every 30 minutes. While my calendar is tight, I\u2019m flexible other than meetings since my hobbies and the events are comprehensive. A lot of people have different hobbies which are separate from each other. For me, it\u2019s a package \u2014 all my hobbies make up who I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I run my own company so I don\u2019t have to seek motivation elsewhere. If I were working for someone else, that\u2019d be a whole different story.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Kasey Kazliner)  By   Kasey Kazliner June 30, 2024 at  3:12 pm PDT \n \n \nLAS VEGAS \u2014 The 2024 NHL draft concluded on Saturday, giving Ducks general manager Pat Verbeek a handful of new names to develop as the team continues its rebuild. After selecting  Beckett Sennecke and Stian Solberg  in the first round, Verbeek added depth to his prospect pipeline in the proceeding rounds, capping off a strong draft weekend for the Orange County club.\n\nRound 2, No. 35 overall: Lucas Petterson, C\nHailing from Sweden, Lucas Petterson split time between the J20 Nationell and Swedish Hockey League this past campaign. However, the forward only suited up in five SHL games with MoDo Hockey and didn\u2019t see the ice much. With the J20 squad, he tallied 57 points on 27 goals and 30 assists in 44 games. He was the first Swede picked in the 2024 draft.\n\nJust like many other Swedish players who spend their amateur years on a larger ice surface, Petterson is a naturally strong skater. His ability to reach the offensive zone with ease allows him to set up his teammates, often dishing impressive passes for assists. At 6-foot and 173 pounds, he\u2019s a distinguished forechecker and puck-chaser, but he\u2019ll want to keep developing his frame before making the jump to the United States.\n\nPetterson has plenty of upside, with skills ranging from puck control, offensive-zone playmaking and intelligent shot-taking. He will aim to put on some strength and step up as a leader when he returns to his native country.\n\nRound 3, No. 66 overall: Maxim Mass\u00e9, RW\nMaxim Mass\u00e9 was one of the more highly touted players entering the draft who hailed from the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League. Listed as a right winger, Mass\u00e9 tallied 75 points with 36 goals and 39 assists with the Chicoutimi Saguen\u00e9ens in 2023-24, earning him the Mike Bossy trophy.\n\nAt 6-foot-3 and 190 pounds, Mass\u00e9 uses his size to enrich his offensive skill set. He\u2019s versatile and polished when controlling the puck, but his lack of fluid skating brings his game down. But even with this liability, he\u2019s an offensive weapon with a beautiful slapshot that will surely catch the eyes of Ducks brass in the coming years.\n\nRound 3, No. 68 overall: Ethan Procyszyn, C\nEthan Procyszyn doubled his point total from the 2022-23 season to 2023-24 while playing with the Ontario Hockey League\u2019s North Bay Battalion, notching 36 this past season. A native of Wasaga Beach, Ontario, Procyszyn is tough and physical, especially for a forward.\n\nAt 6-foot-3 and 190 pounds, he\u2019ll make any hit necessary to free up the puck. He\u2019s a grinder, making the most of his ice time even when not possessing the puck by setting goalie screens and hustling on every play. He\u2019s also an impressive passer, setting up his teammates by using his high hockey IQ to stay a step ahead of the puck.\n\nProcyszyn is not an amazing skater, though. He also massively prefers to shoot the puck from close range, which, combined with the lackluster skating, limits his offensive ceiling.\n\nRound 3, No. 79 overall: Tarin Smith, D\nTarin Smith was Anaheim\u2019s second blueliner chosen in the draft, following Solberg. Smith spent the 2023-24 campaign with the Western Hockey League\u2019s Everett Silvertips, logging 44 points as a solid two-way defenseman. He\u2019ll reunite with Ducks blueliner  Olen Zellweger , whom he briefly played with in Everett.\n\nSmith skates nicely at 6-foot-2 and 187 pounds. He\u2019s a thoughtful teammate, often setting his linemates up for offensive zone chances and thinking ahead creatively. While he\u2019s physically sound, he\u2019ll need to improve his awareness in the defensive zone, which will come with utilizing his skating skills accordingly.\n\nRound 4, No. 100 overall: Alexandre Blais, C\nAlexandre Blais is coming off an 84-point season (24 goals, 60 assists) with the QMJHL\u2019s Rimouski Oc\u00e9anic. He is a quick-footed, 5-foot-10, 152-pound pass-first forward with high value for a later-round pick.\n\nBlais\u2019 smaller frame is his main concern. His strong passing prowess offers him an opportunity to overcome his size, and was a large reason why he was drafted, but bulking up will be a necessity nonetheless. With that in mind, he is still a very dangerous playmaker.\n\nRound 6, No. 182 overall: Austin Burnevik, RW\nGiven his success as a goal-scoring machine in the 2023-24 United States Hockey League season, picking Austin Burnevik in the sixth round made too much sense for the Ducks. With the Madison Capitols this past year, he hit the 40-goal mark with 71 total points.\n\nAt 19 years old, Burnevik was a second-year draft candidate after going unpicked last year, and thus likely has less room to develop his game. He was likely limited this year and last because of his lack of skill without the puck. When he possesses the biscuit, he displays a pretty shot; without it, his skating is flawed and his defense needs improvement, even though he\u2019s 6-foot-4 and 195 pounds.\n\nBurnevik will suit up for St. Cloud State University next season.\n\nRound 7, No. 214 overall: Darels Uljanskis, D\nAnaheim\u2019s final draftee is a skilled blueliner with upside. Darels Uljanskis, a Latvian native, registered 29 points with AIK J20 of Sweden this past year.\n\nStanding 6-foot-2 and weighing 192 pounds, Uljanskis is a strong playmaker from the blue line, but could use development in every other area of the ice. While he possesses the skill set to have a chance at making the NHL, he\u2019s not elite in any one category. He has strong two-way potential with his frame but will need to work on setting up his linemates and improving defensively.\n```"}

(Photo by Nya Manneh)\n\nBy Nya Manneh June 30, 2024 at 10:17 am PDT\n\nClothing is a way to express oneself and an individual\u2019s unique identity, but it has also historically been used to protest against unfair disadvantages posited against certain minority groups in society. This was one of the many appeals of the zoot suit, which rose in popularity during the 1930s and 40s as a way for African, Mexican, Italian and Filipino Americans, among many other groups, to achieve visibility in public and display a form of resistance to assimilation into American culture.\n\nWhen these minority groups were forced to hide their culture to be accepted in American society, these suits allowed them to express their individuality, however little they may have had at the time. On Saturday, June 12, hundreds gathered dressed to the nines in their best retro outfits and drove their vintage cars to commemorate the 81st anniversary of the Zoot Suit Riots.\n\nThese Riots became known as a nearly week-long series of violent attacks in 1943 that targeted primarily young Latino and Mexican American residents in Los Angeles, California. Known as the Zoot Suit Cruise, over 100 classic cars ranging from the 1920s to the 1970s drive across the Sixth Street Bridge before making their way to 4th and Broadway of Little Tokyo in Downtown LA for dancing, a fashion show, a traditional indigenous ritual, among other events.\n\nHowever, Los Angeles Communities are using this tragedy to educate and ensure that history doesn\u2019t repeat itself. Beginning as early as the 1930s, the zoot suit was largely popularized by a growing nationwide jazz culture among Black and brown youth and even worn from an early age by Malcolm X, who described the ensemble in his autobiography as \u201cA killer-diller coat with a drape-shape, rear-pleats and shoulders padded like a lunatic\u2019s cell.\u201d\n\nMexican Americans added more accessories and colors to reflect their roots, but their distinct clothing, language and love for jazz led to a counterculture of criminalization by white supremacist groups. From June 3 to 8 1943, there was a series of anti-Mexican riots in L.A. ignited after some World War II servicemen accused Chicanx youth of attacking them.\n\nAs the creator of Zoot Suit Cruise, Manny Alcaraz explains, this was likely caused by a history of assault towards young Chicana women by men stationed nearby. In retaliation to this accusation, however, people of color styling these suits were targeted and hunted in an outburst of racialized violence that lasted several days.\n\nFrom then on, zoot suits were seen as unpatriotic for wasting fabric when they could instead contribute to the war effort and were subsequently outlawed for the extent of World War II. Six years ago, the founder of the Zoot Suit Cruise, \u201cPachuco\u201d Manny Alcaraz, began the cruise on the 75th Anniversary of the Riots with his friend Art Zamora.\n\nAccording to Chicana artist Autumn Rose, the cruise started as a small community event at a local diner when, \u201cthe last Wednesday of the month, all of these old classic cars would gather at this restaurant, and they\u2019d be playing music and just really having a community,\u201d Rose said. \u201cWe\u2019d have live music, we had food in the morning, and we just gathered together and had fun.\u201d\n\nAs community awareness grew, the annual celebration grew into a week-long event that started just last year. The parade celebrates different aspects of Chicano culture in Los Angeles. (Photo by Nya Manneh)\n\nFor Rose, this event holds special value to her family\u2019s legacy. From her great great great grandmother who was alive during the Riots, \u201cthe stories that she\u2019s told about the horrific violence that happened, everything that happened was so shocking and gut-wrenching to hear about, and how the people were treated back then\u201d, she explains.\n\n\u201cSo being able to have my car at this event and representing my great great great grandmother in that way, it means the world to me to be able to do that and tell the stories and share the history of it. It\u2019s something that everyone should know about.\u201d\n\nFor Pachuco and frequent cruiser Luis Garcia, the event is a way to educate younger generations on their history. As Garcia notes, racism has persisted past the riots, \u201cespecially with things with the border and with all the migration,\u201d Garcia said.\n\n\u201cSo I think it\u2019s important to remember the struggles that our ancestors and our fathers and those that came before us as a struggle that we still have to continue as well.\u201d\n\nHowever, for the likes of Alcaraz and Garcia, the Riots were a reminder of how men of color were treated in the service. \u201cI\u2019m a Marine Corps veteran, I personally did two tours out to Afghanistan,\u201d Garcia said.\n\n\u201cSo coming back, and then learning the history about what happened, especially what the service members did to people that look like me, even though we also did serve in the military kind of hit a soft spot. And ever since it\u2019s also been a form of protest in my own way against what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, for Alcaraz, a Navy veteran who fought in Vietnam, he was constantly aware of how people who looked like him were treated by their colleagues. \u201cIt was kind of hard for the Mexican guys in the service. I was in the Navy, and if I came on leave, and I want to put a Zoot Suit on because it was for entertainment, dancing, swing, I would get beat up. I would say, \u2018No, I\u2019m in the Navy,\u2019 you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would beat me up because I was wearing my Zoot Suit.\u201d\n\nThe zoot suit not only reflected a history of racial discrimination, but it was also an example of the formation of important aspects of Black and Chicanx cultures that shaped their racial identities even today. Each suit was made of different eye-popping fabric and decorated or accessorized in ways that were unique to the wearer.\n\nFor Mexicans who had newly immigrated to the U.S., zoot suits helped them break free of the suffocating expectations they had to follow to assimilate into American culture. Along with low riding, zoot suits are an extension of each wearer\u2019s sense of self.\n\n\u201c\u2018Brown and Proud\u2019 represents many different colors, which is also why you see the different colors [of zoot suits] because it comes in many different varieties,\u201d Garcia said.\n\n\u201cSo I think it\u2019s important to showcase that we are all different, and there are many different shades of brown.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Wesley Chen)\n\nBy Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier June 29, 2024 at 6:34 pm PDT\n\nThree more USC Trojans are on their way to the NBA. Freshman guard Isaiah Collier was selected in the first round by the Utah Jazz, freshman guard Bronny James was picked by the Los Angeles Lakers, and following the conclusion of the NBA Draft, fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis agreed to an Exhibit 10 deal with the Sacramento Kings.\n\nCollier was the first Trojan taken in the draft, as the Jazz decided to select the former No. 1 recruit with the 29th pick. This comes after Collier at one point saw himself projected as a lottery pick. Since those projections in mid-May, the highly touted freshman has seen his draft projections plummet all the way until Wednesday when the draft began.\n\nCollier joins the Jazz after averaging 16.3 points, 2.9 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game in his lone season at USC. He started 26 of the 27 games he appeared in, and also sat out injured for a month with a fractured hand in January. At times, Collier struggled with turnovers, free throws and consistent shooting. Despite this, the Jazz are getting one of the best guards in this year\u2019s draft class, especially as the Deseret News reported that NBA executives noted \u201chis work ethos and his desire to prove others wrong.\u201d\n\nBronny James was the next Trojan off the board, as the Lakers selected him with the No. 55 overall pick on Thursday. James\u2019 selection by the Lakers comes as a surprise to almost nobody, as his father, LeBron, has for years publicly expressed his desire to be teammates with his son. The conversations around this intensified during the younger James\u2019 time at USC this past year, when LeBron clarified that he still had that desire.\n\nAfter suffering cardiac arrest during a July 2023 practice, James made his debut in cardinal and gold on Dec. 10 in an 84-79 overtime loss to Long Beach State. James appeared in 25 games, starting six of them, where he averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. Despite being known for his aggressive defense as a Trojan, James struggled offensively for most of the season. He will now look to overcome the appearance of nepotism that his selection has caused, as he and his father look to make history as the first father-son duo to play for the same team in the NBA.\n\nThe final member of USC to join an NBA team was Boogie Ellis, who agreed to an Exhibit 10 contract with the Sacramento Kings once the NBA Draft concluded on Thursday. Under the terms of the deal, Ellis will sign a one-year, minimum salary (~$1.16 million) non-guaranteed deal with no bonuses. The Kings can also convert it to a two-way deal before the season begins. Ellis can also be waived without taking cap space, and would get a $5,000 to $50,000 bonus should he remain with Sacramento\u2019s G-League affiliate for 60 days.\n\nAfter starting his collegiate career with Memphis, Ellis transferred to USC for his final three years of college and started in all 91 of the games he appeared in as a Trojan. During his final year, he averaged 16.5 points, 3.5 rebounds and 3.0 assists. Ellis ultimately saw a bit of regression in his game during his fifth year of college compared to his fourth season, and he will now look to find his way onto the Kings\u2019 full time roster after going undrafted.\n\nCollier, James and Ellis will all enter the next stage of their basketball careers at the next level when the 2024 NBA Summer League tips off in early July.\n```"}

Greentree\u2019s main liability is his skating, as he often struggles with acceleration. Also, with Team Canada at the World Juniors, he didn\u2019t stand out nearly as much as one would\u2019ve expected him to, only recording four points in seven games.\n\nHowever, further development will give Greentree the chance to improve his mobility. His strong hockey IQ allows him to see plays develop before they\u2019ve occurred, which may also help mitigate a lack of top-tier skating.\n\nOn a Kings team known for its defensive philosophy, his two-way potential and willingness to make hits will certainly come in handy. He\u2019ll just need to improve his defensive awareness\u2014especially in his own zone\u2014and should aim to exert his physicality at a more consistent rate.\n\nHis sharp intelligence can often be seen in the offensive zone, as he tends to take shots from seemingly difficult angles, but will capitalize on them nonetheless. His soft hands can usually make up for his amateur skating ability and his passing is aggressive and cerebral.\n\nHis best performance of 2023-24 came on Jan. 27 when he notched six points on a hat trick and three assists. He also led the Spitfires with 11 power-play goals, displaying his relentless offensive aspirations every time he\u2019s on the ice.\n\nLiam Greentree completes the hat trick Each goal is finer than the last @SpitsHockey | #NHLDraft pic.twitter.com/LNakQ7P0au \u2014 Ontario Hockey League (@OHLHockey) January 28, 2024\n\nAlthough Windsor finished as one of the OHL\u2019s worst teams, Greentree will have the chance to return and lead them once again before making his way to Los Angeles full time. Because the team performed so poorly in 2023-24, Greentree had the chance to shine in many facets of the game, often stepping in on the penalty kill and setting the tone.\n\nWith free agency approaching, Blake and company will soon have a more complete picture of how the roster is shaping out ahead of 2024-25. Although Greentree\u2019s game will still need development at the junior level, he\u2019s certainly a big part of the team\u2019s long-term plans, and will look to step up and fill gaps in Los Angeles\u2019 young and inexperienced bottom lines at some point.\n\nLA isn\u2019t a top prospect-heavy team at the moment, but adding Greentree will certainly aid the club\u2019s future core. The Kings possess six total selections, and will pick once in the second round, once in the fourth, once in the sixth and twice in the seventh. Adding a high-upside winger in the first round should excite LA fans for what is to come.\n```"}

(Photo/@AnaheimDucks on X).\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner June 29, 2024 at 3:16 pm PDT\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Anaheim Ducks general manager Pat Verbeek had an action-packed first day of the 2024 NHL draft, making a surprising pick at No. 3 and trading up from the No. 31 spot to No. 23 in Friday\u2019s first round at Sphere.\n\nAt No. 3, Anaheim had a variety of options. While one might\u2019ve expected the team to call a highly touted name like Anton Silayev, Cayden Lindstrom or Ivan Demidov, Verbeek went with a skater less acclaimed in mock drafts: right wing Beckett Sennecke.\n\nThe Athletic had the 18-year-old mocked at No. 7 overall, so it\u2019s no secret that the selection was unexpected; Sennecke, himself, even couldn\u2019t believe that he\u2019d be the third name taken off the board following Macklin Celebrini and Artyom Levshunov.\n\nSurprising aside, Sennecke\u2019s acquisition adds polished puck-handling skills, cerebral playmaking and strength to the Ducks\u2019 prospect pool. He helped lead the Ontario Hockey League\u2019s Oshawa Generals to the 2024 OHL Championship behind 10 goals and 12 assists in the postseason.\n\nThis all came after a 68-point regular season in which he tallied 27 goals and 41 assists in his second year with the club.\n\nWhile 68 points in 63 games played in his sophomore season with Oshawa isn\u2019t anything to scoff at, Sennecke\u2019s numbers didn\u2019t progress massively from year one to year two. He only added 13 points in two extra games, whereas winger Tij Iginla, the No. 6 pick, saw a 66-point improvement between two of his junior seasons.\n\nSennecke\u2019s two OHL campaigns were rather similar statistically. But points\u2014especially without context\u2014are certainly not everything. Sennecke played out of his mind to end the regular season in 2023-24, posting 42 points across the final 34 games.\n\nAt nearly 6-foot-3 and 182 pounds, he\u2019s likely still growing with an already typical NHL frame. Sennecke\u2019s stickhandling abilities made him rise up the ranks as an elite prospect. He\u2019s deceiving, crafty, a deke savant and intelligent on rushes, never afraid to weave through opposing defenses and create opportunities.\n\nThe Toronto native\u2019s physicality allows him to forecheck, win puck battles and make the most out of every play. His late-season surge and seven game-winning goals with Oshawa proved his ability to secure victories by himself.\n\nHe\u2019ll just want to continue to adjust to his recent growth spurt before suiting up in Anaheim, as he grew nearly five inches across his OHL tenure. He could also improve his awareness when not controlling the puck.\n\nBut with star center Trevor Zegras\u2019 name circulating trade talks, picking up a game-breaking forward like Sennecke could fill gaps in the Ducks\u2019 rebuild.\n\nBut Verbeek wasn\u2019t content with just one big swing in the first round. Originally slated to use the Edmonton Oilers\u2019 No. 31 pick, the Ducks dealt it along with the No. 58 selection to Toronto to acquire the No. 23 pick as the Maple Leafs were on the clock.\n\nIn Toronto\u2019s spot, Verbeek called blueliner Stian Solberg, who was just the second Norwegian player picked in the first round in NHL history, and also the second of the night after the Detroit Red Wings took Michael Brandsegg-Nyg\u00e5rd at No. 15.\n\nExpected to be a lottery pick, Solberg adds depth and upside to Anaheim\u2019s already stacked defenseman pipeline headlined by Pavel Mintyukov and Olen Zellweger.\n\nAt 6-foot-2 and 203 pounds, Solberg moves well and uses brute force on opposing skaters. He\u2019s committed to playing with the Swedish Hockey League\u2019s F\u00e4rjestad next season and has already shown his professional readiness against premier opponents, as he represented Norway at the World Juniors and exerted his punishing physicality at the tournament.\n\nHe also added 15 points on top of his defensive masterclass with Norway\u2019s V\u00e5lerenga in 2023-24. He\u2019s simply an explosive force to be reckoned with, and will only add to the well-roundedness of Anaheim\u2019s prospect pool as a defense-first blueliner.\n\nHe\u2019ll just want to lean away from racking up too many penalty minutes and should work on finding more creative playmaking tactics before he winds up in the NHL.\n\nThe Ducks have eight picks total, and six picks left to use, barring any trades. They\u2019ll select once in the second round, thrice in the third, once in the fourth and once in the sixth.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of the Toronto Blue Jays @bluejays)\n\nBy Andrew Giesler June 28, 2024 at 4:16 pm PDT\n\nGuerrero Jr. ready to jump ship... to the Yankees?\n\nThe trade deadline is always a fun time of year for spectators, given how many of the league\u2019s top players dawn new uniforms with the hopes of finding playoff success and advancing their careers. Many struggling teams look forward to the deadline as it gives them the ability to trade away top-tier talent, hoping for a good return on investment with depth players and future draft picks.\n\nThis year, it looks like Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is one of these players. The worst team in the AL East, the Toronto Blue Jays, are 36-43 and need to shake things up. Although general manager Ross Atkins stated earlier this month that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make any sense\u201d to trade away Guerrero or shortstop Bo Bichette, all signs point toward one of them leaving to try and give the team a new look.\n\nGuerrero Jr. has been more vocal about possibly being traded, and he recently had a slight change of mind about a potential future as a New York Yankee. In 2022, Guerrero stated in an interview that he would not play for the Yankees and is happy in Toronto. And last year, he commented similarly, saying he does not like the pinstripes and that he \u201cwill never change that.\u201d\n\nAfter first baseman Anthony Rizzo suffered an injury that put him on the 60-day IL, Guerrero thought twice about his previous statements. Adding Guerrero to New York\u2019s stacked hitting roster\u2014even without Rizzo, who has accounted for eight home runs thus far\u2014would make it one of the most incredible batting orders ever assembled.\n\nHowever, nothing is set in stone, as Guerrero Jr. is also getting looks from the Houston Astros. The Astros seemingly have more to gain than the Yankees from this rumored trade. The Astros are a .500 team three games back from a wildcard position. They would hope that trading for Guerrero Jr. will help them extend their postseason attendance streak to eight straight seasons.\n\nThe Yankees, on the other hand, are 52-30 and one game ahead of the Orioles in the AL East. Whether Guerrero ends up in Houston or New York, any team will be happy with the Dominican first baseman.\n\nWho will we see at the All-Star Game?\n\nThis year, the All-Star Game will be at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, on July 16. As phase one of voting ends and phase two begins, it is time to look back at who the fans chose as the best players so far this season. Voting statistics are accurate as of June 28 and do not yet reflect starting lineups until they\u2019re announced on July 3.\n\nFor the American League, the top vote-getters were: Ryan Mountcastle (1B), Jose Altuve (2B), Jos\u00e9 Ramirez (3B), Gunnar Henderson (SS), Aaron Judge (OF), Juan Soto (OF), Kyle Tucker (OF), Adley Rutschman (C) and Yordan Alvarez (DH).\n\nA quick glance at the roster shows that the Orioles, Yankees and Astros have taken up all but one of the top spots, and for good reason. The Yankees and Orioles are the top two home run-hitting teams, led by outfielders Judge and Soto, while the Astros have the best team batting average in the league with Altuve, Alvarez and Tucker leading the charge.\n\nRamirez was chosen for his similar abilities, already having 21 and 72 RBIs this season.\n\nThen, the National League\u2019s lineup: Bryce Harper (1B), Ketel Marte (2B), Alec Bohm (3B), Mookie Betts (SS), Jurickson Profar (OF), Christian Yelich (OF), Teoscar Hernandez (OF), William Contreras (C) and Shohei Ohtani (DH).\n\nIn a similar circumstance as the AL, the Phillies, Dodgers and Brewers have dominated the voting in the NL. Instead of home runs, NL players boast higher batting averages than the AL as five of nine players are batting over .300.\n\nOhtani is leading the NL in almost all of the crucial statistics with 65 runs, 25 home runs, a .322 batting average, .643 slugging and an insane 1.045 OPS.\n\nOhtani\u2019s teammate, Betts, will not be playing in the All-Star Game due to a fractured hand he sustained last week.\n\nAstros seven-game win streak gets them back to .500\n\nThe Houston Astros had their struggles earlier in the season, but have worked their way back up after winning two out of three games in Chicago followed by two straight sweeps. The first opponent that they swept were the then-49-25 Orioles, who were on a roll after winning a road series against their divisional rival Yankees.\n\nThe Astros came out swinging in the series against Baltimore, winning game one 14-11. Although a shaky win that nearly saw the Astros blow a seventh inning 14-3 lead, they held on to win and showed their top-notch hitting abilities in the process.\n\nIn the final two games, Houston kept its foot on the gas and outscored Baltimore 13-2. They then outscored the Rockies in their two-game series 12-3, moving their record to .500 for the first time since the season began.\n\nAfter a 7-19 start, the Astros have since begun to trust one another. One player who has stepped up since a dismal start in April is starting pitcher Spencer Arrighetti. The rookie had his best outing yet against the Rockies, with seven innings pitched and 10 punch outs.\n\nArrighetti has begun to transform into one of the team\u2019s best pitchers.\n\nThe key for Houston has been getting the bats going. As a team, they lead the league in batting average (.263) and have the fewest strikeouts thus far. This speaks volumes about the team\u2019s approach at the plate: looking to put the ball in play instead of swinging for the fences.\n\nWith a team slugging percentage of .421, they frequently find bases and focus less on using the long ball.\n\nA double play going into the weekend...\n\nThe first of several key games to watch this weekend will be the Astros battling the Mets at Citi Field. The Mets, who also have a .500 record so far (39-39), are coming off a crucial two-game sweep against crosstown rival Yankees.\n\nOutscoring them 21-9, the Mets look to keep the bats hot against a similarly rollicking Astros team. Houston will be looking to extend their win streak, give themselves a positive record for the first time this season and put themselves in a better position for a wildcard spot.\n\nThe key matchup will be between Houston\u2019s Ronel Blanco and New York\u2019s Jose Quintana on Friday. Blanco, the Astros ace thus far, is coming off a win in his last start against the Orioles. He was able to survive a powerful Baltimore squad with only one run against and four strikeouts.\n\nOn the other hand, Quintana is coming off his best start this season: a six-inning, 103-pitch, eight-strikeout performance that led his team to a dominant 11-1 win over the Cubs.\n\nPrediction: The Mets take the series against the hot Houston squad.\n\nAnother series to watch this weekend will be between the Twins (44-36) and Mariners (46-37). Minnesota will try to extend its one-game wild card cushion, while Seattle is trying to extend the lead it has over Houston.\n\nThe series in Seattle will feature a defensively-focused team in the Mariners and a balanced Twins roster that can be occasionally explosive on offense.\n\nGame one will be another war between pitchers. Logan Gilbert will take the bump for Seattle, winning his past three starts convincingly. With 25 strikeouts and one walk accumulated over those three games, Gilbert is a force to be reckoned with when he is in the zone.\n\nHe is currently second in the MLB in WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched) at a staggering 0.89.\n\nOn the other side, Twins starter Bailey Ober is coming off of an 89-pitch complete game that included ten strikeouts and zero walks against the A\u2019s.\n\nPrediction: The Mariners\u2019 pitching will be too much, and Seattle will win the series\n\nIn last week\u2019s column, I predicted the Yankees would lose game one and win games two and three, taking the series, and that the Dodgers would win both games against the Angels. I went 0-1-1 on these picks, with the Yankees falling to the Braves, and the Dodgers splitting the freeway series. That makes our season total 0-1-1.\n```"}

Nike RBI World Series is Major League Baseball\u2019s youth outreach program that supports organizations that offer baseball and softball activities. It provides resources and assistance, focusing on underserved children and communities worldwide.\n\nTeam Heyward, coached by outfielder Jason Heyward, wore the previous City Connect \u2018Los Dodgers\u2019 jerseys.

Free health screenings were offered by UCLA Health and free eye screenings were offered by Vision to Learn.\n\nNichol Whiteman, LADF\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, said their mission is about more than just baseball. \u201cIt\u2019s also about the education and the health resources and bringing those services to the community,\u201d Whiteman said. \u201cSo we bring together a hub of partners that can make sure families are getting those dental screenings, eye screenings, health screenings, the books donated, the science of baseball training and so much more on site while also bringing the fun of Dodger baseball. We want to make sure the community feels the love outside of Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nDodgers Dreamteam is a youth development program run by the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation that uses sports to provide resources and services to communities facing social injustices.

He'll look for a bottom-pairing role with the Kings this year. (Photo/SJHN)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nJune 27, 2024 at 1:39 pm PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 On the day before the 2024 NHL Entry Draft kicks off in Las Vegas, the Los Angeles Kings have made a trade. The Kings sent fourth-line winger Carl Grundstrom to the rival San Jose Sharks in exchange for defenseman Kyle Burroughs on Thursday.\n\nBurroughs, a former seventh-round pick in 2013, played 73 games last season for San Jose, averaging just over 19 minutes of ice time. He tallied eight points on two goals and six assists while registering a minus-42 rating, which was the NHL\u2019s lowest for a defenseman. He was also second on the Sharks with 71 penalty minutes and isn\u2019t afraid to drop the gloves when he needs to.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 defense was crowded last season to the extent that head coach Jim Hiller employed the 11/7 tactic, allowing for seven blueliners in the lineup while using just 11 forwards. Given Burroughs\u2019 limited production, he\u2019ll likely have to work extra hard to receive playing time with the Kings, or else he\u2019ll likely end up serving most of his duties on the American Hockey League\u2019s Ontario Reign.\n\nWith that noted, however, Burroughs\u2019 main appeal is his physicality, as he was fourth in the NHL in hits among defensemen with 233. So if he can impress Hiller by exerting his strength before the regular season commences, he might be able to work his way into the crowded blueliner pool, especially with defenseman Matt Roy potentially signing elsewhere this offseason.\n\nThe 6-foot, 193-pound enforcer had also spent time with the Colorado Avalanche and Vancouver Canucks following a lengthy journey through the minor leagues.\n\nThe depth-for-depth deal shipped off Grundstrom to San Jose, who showed his upside in LA during the 2022-23 season, when he recorded 19 points on 12 goals and seven assists. But the 26-year-old regressed in 2023-24, posting just 12 points in 50 games, and is now a restricted free agent with arbitration rights.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, it makes sense for general manager Rob Blake to ship off a forward hoping for a new deal while bringing in a defenseman not needing one yet. And given the fact that the Kings just extended forward Alex Turcotte\u2019s contract, there likely wasn\u2019t room for Grundstrom on the bottom lines.\n\nBurroughs is still on a three-year deal he signed last summer, valued at $3.3 million per season. Grundstrom spent six years in LA and racked up 67 total points. In 2023-24, he averaged just under 11 minutes of ice time per game, four minutes less than his debut season in 2018-19. He was originally selected No. 57 overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2016. He has also never played in more than 57 games in a season.\n\nThe Kings will also have draft picks to work with this weekend, including the No. 21 overall selection, so they\u2019ll have opportunities to bring in more depth at both the forward and defense positions. And a lot can change between now and the first puck drop of next season, so Los Angeles will surely make more transactions to bolster its depth this offseason.\n```"}

The No. 1 high school recruit and three-time Georgia state champion was touted to boast elite passing, unmatched athleticism and the ability to turn a fringe Trojan team into a deep March Madness contender. But Collier\u2019s freshman season saw its fair share of peaks and valleys. While the 19-year-old began his college career on a tear \u2014 scoring at least 15 points in each of the first four games \u2014 a hand injury sidelined him for nearly a month, and when he returned, USC\u2019s season was already swerving off the rails.\n\nCollier finished the season averaging 16.3 points per game, good for second on the roster. But the Atlanta native often struggled in other technical facets of the game, posting a subpar 67.3% free-throw percentage and 1.29 assist-to-turnover ratio. Despite these suboptimal figures, Collier stood out on a disappointing Trojan team that missed out on the NCAA Tournament; he often exerted his ability to score at will, tenaciously finishing in transition by driving to the rim, using his physicality to create space and explode.\n\nOnce regarded as a potential lottery pick, his regression to the second-to-last selection in the first round might seem disappointing for some. But it shouldn\u2019t be a sign of disrespect for Collier, especially considering his unexpectedly frustrating freshman year. Now in the NBA, his biggest test will be proving his sky-high expectations and showing fans why he was so highly sought after by USC.\n\nWith the Utah Jazz, Collier will want to ease back into the true point guard role he took at Wheeler High School. With the Trojans, Collier appeared to be merely serviceable from 3-point range, knocking down only 33.8% of his attempts. His high turnover marks often stemmed from impulsive judgment, making his game appear sloppy and rushed at times. With rather limited minutes sure to come in year one at the professional level, Collier will aim to improve his off-ball skills and playmaking to help his more seasoned teammates.\n\nAs a rookie, his established strength and elusiveness might inspire Jazz head coach Will Hardy to utilize him when needing a close-range bucket, but as a 6-foot-3 guard, Collier will want to polish his outside shooting ability to adapt to the more fast-paced and physical NBA. Collier joins a guard cast of veteran Jordan Clarkson, Collin Sexton and reigning All-Rookie second-teamer Keyonte George, among others. Utah placed 22nd in 3-point percentage in 2023-24, so Collier won\u2019t be the only player eyeing improved numbers from deep.\n\nThe Jazz fell short of play-in and playoff bids last season, finishing with a 31-51 record. Utah, like Collier, will be in search of an identity in 2024-25, as trade talks surrounding star forward Lauri Markkanen and others circulate, creating questions about the team\u2019s desire to build a win-now roster. But the Jazz\u2019s competitiveness should be irrelevant to Collier\u2019s desired progression. He\u2019ll look to cement himself in Utah\u2019s rotation by answering the call off the bench, improving his game and expanding his abilities.\n\nHis first test as a Jazzman will be on July 8, a Summer League bout against the Memphis Grizzlies at Delta Center. After an inconsistent year at USC, Jazz fans might not know what to expect from Collier, but each game, shot attempt and fast break will give him the platform to show the world why he received so much praise coming out of high school.\n```"}

(Photo/LA Kings)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nJune 26, 2024 at 9:14 pm PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The LA Kings released their new primary logo last Thursday, and it was only a matter of time before it would be woven into the team\u2019s uniforms. On Wednesday, Los Angeles revealed its brand-new wardrobe.\n\nIn addition to the new badge, the home and away jerseys feature updated striping, outlined numbers and the Fanatics logo on the back. The team will also don new matte black helmets at home. The Kings also removed the piping from their previous uniforms, allowing the large 90s-inspired crest to be the focal point. The white jersey will be paired with a matching white helmet. (Photo/LA Kings)\n\nBelow the crest and on the sleeves sit thick stripes, which are silver and black on the white away jersey, and silver and white on the black home top. The previous home uniform only featured striping on the sleeves, while the retired away uniform had similar striping on the sleeves and front to those of the new jerseys. Crucially, from a striping standpoint, the new uniforms establish consistency across both the black and white tops, unlike the previous look.\n\nThe Kings' previous home uniform did not feature striping on the front, but it did have piping. (AP/Alex Gallardo)\n\nThe white helmets remain unchanged, while the chrome silver and shiny black helmets have been discontinued. The Kings will become the first team in NHL history to wear matte black helmets full-time, which will be worn solely during home games.\n\nThe new uniforms\u2019 numbers\u2014coated with a shiny texture\u2014were restored to the block look, moving away from the unique font used previously. Los Angeles will sport black pants at home and on the road, just like before. The Fanatics uniform template doesn\u2019t differ much from Adidas, but the main change is the removal of the shoulder dimples, among other minor tweaks.\n\nThe Kings will not have an alternate uniform in 2024-25, but fans can likely expect a third jersey release sometime down the road. The new home jersey will be on full display when general manager Rob Blake and company select the Kings\u2019 No. 21 overall draft selection on Friday at Sphere in Las Vegas, assuming the player is present at the venue.\n```"}

Excited fan reactions and passionate singalongs from admirers in the crowd filled her show at the Echoplex. Along with Ireland-based artist Oisin and Toronto\u2019s Ethan Low, Jay Kent opened up for South Korean singer-songwriter GSoul on Sunday evening. Her exhilarating, high-energy performance, invited a positive response from the groups of supporters who attended the evening\u2019s show to support GSoul and his fellow artists.\n\nThe Philippines-based musician is known for creating compelling and invigorating art through a luscious combination of soul and R&B in sound waves of melody. At the end of March, she dropped her first release of the year with \u201cTexting,\u201d a sultry, sexy R&B track that maintains a romantic aura, yet is complicated by lyrics speaking of conflict, pain, and an unbearable lack of communication in a fading relationship.\n\nSunday\u2019s show was filled with passionate, emotional, nostalgic energy and a crowd of adoring fans. The artist\u2019s performance was soothing and serene - an iconic duo that left listeners riveting in the joyous sonic interludes. When she performed \u201cTexting,\u201d fans sang back to her with almost immediate recognition. Every song elicited similar responses, as audience members raised their phone-holding hands up high for the opportunity to take a photo with the artist.\n\nJay Kent played a wide range of music, from covers like \u201cIf I Ain\u2019t Got You\u201d to other originals like her brand new track \u201cN-QUIL,\u201d that just released this week, as well as \u201cJust 2 Luv U,\u201d a song about wishing you could \u201cunlove\u201d somebody. The rising R&B artist was confident and her vocals were near perfect \u2013 if she was nervous, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to notice.\n\nThe venue was electric and overcome with emotion and sound. During the show, Jay Kent even handed her phone to fans to record their own videos. Audience members excitedly reached out for the chance to leave their own personal mark on the artist\u2019s performance.\n\nGSoul takes the stage\n\nFollowing Jay Kent, Ethan Low performed, followed by a highly-anticipated performance from GSoul. He brought the crowd home with hits like \u201cCan\u2019t\u201d while fans sang along, enamored with the budding artist whose talents lie in combining dance music with rap, hip-hop, and pop in an effervescent and smooth fashion. GSoul\u2019s DJ was an asset on stage, bringing positive energy and vibes that saw the house erupting in cheers and dance upon every riff and run.\n\nFans had come far and wide to witness the sparkling lineup, from locals of L.A. to fans from New Orleans. This is GSoul\u2019s first show in L.A. in two years, but fans seemed to already be excitedly awaiting his return, practicing the lyrics to his newest single as they anticipated a sequel to that soulful Sunday evening.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/06/26/uscs-chief-health-officer-says-covid-19-is-surging-encourages-booster-shots/", "response": "```\nUSC\u2019s Chief Health Officer says COVID-19 is surging, encourages booster shots\n\nCOVID-19 cases are on the rise in L.A. and new variants are circulating, according to USC\u2019s Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman. The new FLiRT variant of COVID, which became the dominant variant in May, now accounts for 63% of infections according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This strain, like previous iterations of the disease, is more transmissible but not necessarily more severe. It still elicits hallmark COVID respiratory symptoms, minus a loss of taste and smell, which was once synonymous with the virus but hasn\u2019t been prevalent in the last several variants according to Van Orman.\n\nThis surge is not unexpected, given the time passed since the last round of booster shots and summer travel, but Van Orman still urges students to be cautious to prevent the spread. \u201cThe surge is definitely because we have had the emergence of this new variant. There\u2019s genetic changes over time, and at some point, there\u2019s enough change that we call it a new variant, and people\u2019s level of protection from previous infection starts to wane,\u201d she said.\n\nThe average number of daily cases in Los Angeles County last week was 154, a significant spike from the 83 average reported on May 29. Cases have increased each week for at least the last four weeks. The L.A. Times noted that Los Angeles COVID cases are now notably higher than cases in the rest of the United States.\n\n\u201cOne of the interesting things about COVID is, with a lot of other respiratory viruses, we have this very clear cycle of when it happens,\u201d Van Orman said. \u201cCOVID doesn\u2019t quite have a cycle yet. We don\u2019t quite know it, and it\u2019s not predictable yet.\u201d\n\nTo keep themselves safe, Van Orman recommends students continue to receive yearly booster shots. For populations that are immunocompromised, she recommends getting the Fall 2023 booster vaccine, which is still available. For those who aren\u2019t, she said to wait until the next one comes out, likely in fall 2024. That one will be engineered for these new viruses. Additionally, she recommends vulnerable populations look into antiviral medications.\n\n\u201cThe uptake of [the fall 2023] vaccine was not great. About a quarter of the population got it. We tracked the data for USC, and under among undergraduates it was, again, maybe 20%, 25%,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s likely COVID is going to be an annual vaccine.\u201d\n\nUSC numbers are likely not accurate now, as fewer students are reporting their positive cases to the university and most have moved out of student housing for the summer. However, Van Orman recommends checking L.A. County wastewater data, published here weekly, to get a better picture of the spread.\n```"}

(Photo by Jack Hallinan)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan\nJune 26, 2024 at 2:45 pm PDT\n\nWith summer workouts underway, USC men\u2019s basketball held a practice open to the media to showcase what new head coach Eric Musselman and this revamped Trojan roster have been working on. Here are some observations from the workout:\n\nInjury updates\nJunior guard Desmond Claude sat out today\u2019s session with an undisclosed injury and Musselman said after practice that Claude is close, but waiting for clearance to start practicing. Musselman hopes to begin integrating him within the next four-to-six weeks. Musselman sees the 6-foot-6 Claude as a full-time point guard, so for the time being, the former Arkansas coach has the opportunity to test his other guys in that role.\n\n\u201cEvery day somebody\u2019s playing the point position that if Des was healthy, they wouldn\u2019t get those reps,\u201d Musselman said.\n\nIn the absence of Claude and sophomore guard Wesley Yates, graduate forward Saint Thomas and freshman forward Jalen Shelley shouldered a lot of ball-handling responsibility across USC\u2019s drills. At 6-foot-7 and 220 pounds, Thomas has substantial size for a potential offensive initiator, and Shelley is even listed as being one inch taller than his teammate, albeit much thinner.\n\nAccording to Musselman, graduate forward Matt Knowling, who arrived at USC from Yale, will miss at least the next eight-to-12 weeks due to surgery, but is expected to be fully healthy for the team\u2019s first game.\n\nSize concerns\nThere is one main thing about the Trojans\u2019 roster that jumps out: There\u2019s not a single 7-footer on the list. That\u2019s not unheard of in the college game, but the 7-foot-1 Vincent Iwuchukwu \u2014 who transferred from USC to Saint John\u2019s this past offseason \u2014 played a sizable role in former head coach Andy Enfield\u2019s rotation in the 2023-24 season and the 6-foot-11 Joshua Morgan \u2014 who ran out of eligibility \u2014 offered more prominent rim protection than anyone on this current roster seems capable of.\n\nMusselman name-checked graduate forward Josh Cohen as the team\u2019s biggest guy in practice today, with the UMass transfer handling the ball frequently around the elbow and keeping the offense moving. In a 3-point shooting drill, Cohen displayed good touch from range and has potential as a pull-up threat.\n\nMusselman also offered thoughts on senior forward Harrison Hornery and graduate forward Rashaun Agee. \u201c[Hornery\u2019s] played well, he can shoot the ball and space the floor, but [he and Cohen are] certainly a different type of centers. And then after that, it goes to [Agee], who\u2019s an undersized workhorse. And then from there, it\u2019s small ball, which I\u2019m comfortable dealing with, we\u2019ve done it a lot.\u201d\n\nMusselman also discussed the importance of having graduate forward Terrance Williams II\u2019s Big Ten experience as USC makes the transition to that conference. Williams played four seasons at Michigan, starting 31 games in 2023-24 and averaging 12.4 points per game, including 39.7% accuracy from beyond the arc.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s played in the league, veteran, guy that makes open shots,\u201d Musselman said, listing Williams\u2019 traits.\n\nElohim flashes\nHe still has a lot of room to grow, but freshman guard/forward Isaiah Elohim made probably the best play of the practice in a five-on-five half-court drill, beating his man in a one-on-one, driving down the lane and throwing down a dunk with two hands. Elohim is easily among the team\u2019s better athletes and already has a solid frame at 6-foot-5 and 200 pounds. The quality of his defense and shooting will likely determine the size of his role, but Elohim has the bounciness and aggression to make a real impression as a true freshman.\n\nNBA stars make an appearance\nWhen Kevin Durant, James Harden and Chet Holmgren walk into a gym, people take notice. The NBA trio trickled into the Galen Center as USC\u2019s practice winded down, eventually taking to the court for a joint workout once the Trojans had finished. While the stars\u2019 interactions with the USC players seemed minimal, members of the media couldn\u2019t help but enquire about their presence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for our guys to be able to watch [and] jump in workouts with them,\u201d Musselman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a steady flow of guys almost every day and the great thing about being in L.A. is a lot of these guys have offseason homes here ... We want to open our doors to them and it\u2019s great for our program.\u201d\n\nWithout reading too much into Durant and company\u2019s presence, it certainly contributed to a renewed sense of energy around Galen Center ahead of Musselman\u2019s first season and USC\u2019s debut year in the Big Ten.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/06/26/2024-nba-draft-preview-jacks-10-players-you-need-to-know/", "response": "```\n2024 NBA Draft preview: Jack\u2019s 10 players you need to know\n\nThis year\u2019s class lacks a Victor Wembanyama-esque star, but has plenty of interesting pieces from the college ranks and abroad.\n\nBy Jack Hallinan June 26, 2024 at 2:07 pm PDT\n\nDoing last minute homework on this year\u2019s NBA Draft? I\u2019ve got you covered. If you\u2019ve heard anything about the upcoming class of 2024, it\u2019s probably that this is far from the best collection of prospects. I wish I could say definitively that wasn\u2019t true, but I can\u2019t. And while an All-Star or two eventually emerges from almost every draft, there\u2019s certainly no Victor Wembanyama. There\u2019s not even a Markelle Fultz (as far as what draftniks thought he could be). But whatever tonight\u2019s draft lacks in starpower, it\u2019s somewhat made up for by depth and intrigue. Each of the top prospects has one or two key traits that could make them great fits for specific roles right away. As such, team fit matters more than ever and could lead to last-minute trades up or down the board depending on how things shake out. Most of these players have a glaring hole as well, so as we go down this list of must-know names, I\u2019m going to provide a verdict as to whether I\u2019m \u201cin\u201d or \u201cout,\u201d some classic sports radio BS. And remember, this isn\u2019t a ranking of the draft\u2019s 10 best players or a mock of the first 10 names off the board. It\u2019s a reflection of the 10 players whose storylines I find most compelling.\n\nDonovan Clingan, center, UConn\nThe first of two UConn players on this list, even more casual basketball fans likely know Clingan as the big man that played a huge role on a back-to-back champion Huskies team. The 7-foot-2 Connecticut native has the length and mobility to become a legitimate top-end defensive anchor in the NBA. In today\u2019s league, where space, pace and switchability reign supreme, Clingan\u2019s utility on defense has seen him rocket up draft boards in a way he might not have in other years. I say this not because Clingan\u2019s defensive upside is uniquely popular for this moment in 2024, but because of this year\u2019s lack of a bonafide, he\u2019s a can\u2019t-miss prospect. Unlike Wembanyama last year or even a guy like Cade Cunningham in 2021, it\u2019s hard to envision any prospect on this year\u2019s board becoming a reliable offensive hub. For that reason, Clingan makes sense as a high-floor lottery pick, especially if Atlanta elects to stay at No. 1 and build around one of their two star guards, Trae Young and Dejounte Murray. It seems unlikely that Atlanta can keep both and build a functional team, but whichever player Hawks GM Landry Fields chooses, Clingan immediately elevates the team\u2019s floor. He averaged 2.5 blocks per game in his sophomore season at UConn and had an offensive rating of 135.3 points per 100 possessions. Naturally, the quality of the team around him helps with that figure, but that\u2019s kind of the point; When Clingan is surrounded with a competent roster, he contributes to winning basketball. Verdict: In\n\nAlexandre Sarr, center, Perth Wildcats (Australia)\nSarr might have the highest ceiling of any player in the 2024 draft. Inspired by the wave of all-action foreign bigs, the basketball community is fascinated with Sarr\u2019s versatile defense and offensive feel. I use the word \u201cfeel\u201d as opposed to a more specific trait\u2014like shotmaking or playmaking\u2014because Sarr\u2019s ability to score at a high level remains a work in progress. The Frenchman and former Overtime Elite prospect came off the bench in Australia\u2019s NBL (which is a quality league, but still, he came off the bench) and in his 17.2 minutes per game, he scored an average 9.7 points. The draft is about projection, not prior success, but that\u2019s not an inspiring number. And digging into his shot diet, two of Sarr\u2019s roughly seven field goal attempts per match game from three, with him making just 29.8% of those. Yikes! Sure, he can develop a reliable three over time, but in the short term\u2014even on a bad team\u2014he has to do something offensively to justify his presence on the floor. And when you dial up Sarr\u2019s NBL highlights, he doesn\u2019t seem like a particularly gifted or aggressive interior scorer. You can effectively divide most of his at-rim makes into two categories: easy lobs or drives against smaller defenders. If that were to continue to be the case in the NBA, Sarr\u2019s hypothetical three-point shot would be imperative to his game, not just another tool in his arsenal. Were he to put it all together, Sarr could run away as the best player in this class, but the wide range of outcomes would frighten me as a GM. Verdict: Out\n\nReed Sheppard, guard, Kentucky\nThis boy can shoot. And not just in theory (cough, Alex Sarr, cough), I mean he can really shoot. Sheppard\u2014a Kentucky boy playing for his local Wildcats\u2014averaged 52.1% from beyond the arc while attempting 4.4 three-pointers a game, and playing almost 30 minutes a night, too. Catch-and-shoot, off a screen, dribble pull-up\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter, Sheppard makes them all. Shooting matters so much in this league that Sheppard\u2019s prowess from range alone would be enough to earn him an NBA contract. But Sheppard\u2019s passing and basketball IQ could see him climb as high as No. 3. As to the former, 2023\u2032s Kentucky Mr. Basketball routinely makes cross-court reads despite his height, can open up defenses with a drive-and-kick and is a reliable playmaker in transition. On defense, I\u2019m in danger of using lazy stereotypes for a young man of Sheppard\u2019s stature and skin tone here, but Sheppard has an instinctual, heads-up style of defense that saw him rack up 2.5 steals per game in college, providing value on that side of the ball even if his size makes him a revolving door from time to time. Again, this draft is about traits. We know Sheppard has an elite one in shooting and the rest of his game could make him an upgraded version of Payton Pritchard. Which is good. I promise. Verdict: In\n\nDalton Knecht, guard, Tennessee\nIf your team needs a bouncier Max Strus, boy do I have a player for you. While that\u2019s a ridiculous tagline, it also signals my faith that Knecht could easily play playoff basketball in the spring of 2025. He\u2019s an older prospect, having played five college seasons, so Knecht probably doesn\u2019t have much more room to grow \u2014skill-wise, that is\u2014but his scoring will help a team immediately. The former Colorado JuCo star became a high-usage player for Rick Barnes\u2019 Tennessee Volunteers and posted an impressive 21.7 points per game, shooting 39.7% from three-point range. Those are flat-out great numbers, especially in the gauntlet that SEC basketball has become. He\u2019s not just a distance shooter, though; Knecht has a pretty full scoring bag and his athleticism shines in downhill opportunities. The objectively most fun outcome would be for Knecht to land on a team with immediate playoff aspirations. They\u2019re not exactly the same kind of player, but if the Grizzlies were to decline Luke Kennard\u2019s option for 2024-25 and Knecht fell to them at No. 9, Memphis\u2019 offense would be a League Pass fever dream. Verdict: In\n\nZach Edey, center, Purdue\nAlright, here\u2019s the big one. Literally. Fact: Zach Edey was the most dominant college basketball player of the 2020s so far. Also a fact: By NBA standards, Edey\u2019s game is not sexy. In the five-out, pace-and-space offensive blueprint that just won the Boston Celtics the championship, Edey doesn\u2019t figure to be an NBA starter. But his size (7-foot-4!) and touch around the rim will also work at the NBA level, especially against the league\u2019s less long centers. Throw Edey out there for 20 minutes a game and he can grab you 14 points and five or six rebounds with relative ease. If you want to get really galaxy-brained, pairing Edey with a floor-spacing big creates an even bigger headache for opposing defenses. If Oklahoma City or Sacramento were to select him at No. 12 or No. 13, Chet Holmgren and Domantas Sabonis have well-rounded enough offensive skill sets to pull off some hilarious basketball moments. Just imagine a Chet-Edey pick and roll! Edey will go in the first 20 picks, but his fit with the organization will determine whether or not he becomes a cult hero-type impact player or a less funny Boban Marjanovi\u0107. Verdict: In, but keep your expectations low\n\nJared McCain, guard, Duke\nThere\u2019s always gotta be a Duke guy picked at the top of the draft. It\u2019s just a rule. The 6-foot-2 McCain saved his brightest moments for the end of the season, when he dropped two 30\u2013burgers in the NCAA Tournament, including an absurd 8-for-11 showing from three against James Madison in the second round. But like almost any freshman guard, McCain\u2019s year was inconsistent, with some low-lows that balance out the peak performances. He finished with single-digit points in 12 of his 36 games played and when he didn\u2019t score, McCain wasn\u2019t the most refined creator, averaging 1.9 assists per game in 2023-24. Of course, playmaking and creating for teammates goes beyond the assist column, but I think McCain has a fairly narrow range of positive outcomes for his NBA future. He\u2019s similar in size to Sheppard, but lacks the same ball hound defensive mentality and his three is slightly streakier. McCain could very well become a CJ McCollum-esque, high-end second option, but I remain skeptical. Verdict: Out\n\nZaccharie Risacher, forward, JL Bourg (France)\nAfter Wembanyama and Bilal Coulibaly last year and Sarr in this cycle, Risacher continues the streak of high-end French prospects flooding the NBA draft. Of those four guys, though, Risacher is probably the player I like least. He\u2019s a wiry, 6-foot-8 wing who projects as a three-and-D-type with potential for tertiary ball handling ability. Except, neither Risacher\u2019s three nor his D convince me. He has basically one sample size at the professional level of hot distance shooting. In his 17 EuroCup (the second tier European competition under Euroleague) games for JL Bourg this past season, Risacher made his 3.4 attempts per game at a 56.1% clip. In the French domestic league, that dropped to 35.2% across 32 games. On top of that, Risacher\u2019s mediocre athleticism may limit his defense to the point where Risacher will struggle to be a high-impact player unless he\u2019s a threat from beyond the arc. Like McCain, Risacher\u2019s path to becoming an A-plus pick seems narrow. He\u2019s receiving a lot of buzz to become the No. 1 overall pick, including in ESPN\u2019s Jonathan Givony\u2019s most recent mock draft, but that\u2019s much too rich for my blood. Verdict: Out\n\nStephon Castle, guard, UConn\nCastle is a bit atypical for a high-pedigree, one-and-done player in that, as a 19-year-old, he played a full season of functional, winning basketball that ultimately led to a championship, instead of chasing eye-popping individual stats. He wasn\u2019t UConn\u2019s go-to scorer largely due to a shaky jumper, but Castle is a high-end athlete who can get to his spots and finish around the rim through contact. And fascinatingly, Castle believes that he can be a lead guard at 6-foot-6. \u201cI feel like my true position is a point guard,\u201d Castle said at the Combine last month, according to CT Insider. He has enough ball-handling skill to make that comment semi-believable, but even still, making him your team\u2019s primary creator would be projecting out significantly from what he displayed at UConn. Castle would be a better fit in Detroit or Charlotte, where he could play off Cade Cunningham or LaMelo Ball and develop his offense at a more reasonable rate, as opposed to a situation like San Antonio, where Wembanyama needs a sure-handed guard to play with immediately. But whatever happens with Castle\u2019s offense, his worst-case scenario is that of a lock-down wing defender who shows up on playoff rosters year after year to slow down a Luka Don\u010di\u0107 or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Verdict: In, but don\u2019t ask him to be a point guard\n\nIsaiah Collier, guard, USC\nAdmittedly, Collier\u2019s inclusion here has a hint of USC bias. I watched him in person multiple times during the 2023-24 season and witnessed some great offensive displays. The Trojans half-court offense usually had headless chicken energy, but Collier never shied away from the responsibility of being the team\u2019s go-to guy alongside veteran guard and fellow prospect Boogie Ellis. Collier scored double-digits in all but two games this past season, and while it wasn\u2019t always efficient, he challenged defenses with his strength and skill when driving to the hoop. He\u2019s far from an elite jump-shooter, but Collier still shot just a hair under 34% from three-point range and almost never turned down open looks. However, he was a target on defense and occasionally seemed to lack effort, though the atmosphere of USC\u2019s underwhelming season probably didn\u2019t help with that. As such, don\u2019t be surprised if Collier falls into the 20s. Personally, I\u2019d like to see Philadelphia take him at No. 16 so that Collier can learn from Tyrese Maxey and be a potential spark plug scorer for a playoff team. Verdict: In, with serious reservations\n\nMatas Buzelis, forward, G League Ignite\nAlongside fellow five-star recruit Ron Holland, Buzelis spent 2023-24 playing for a G League Ignite squad that seemed stacked with young talent on paper, but ended up having a season from hell. The NBA\u2019s in-house developmental team went a dreadful 2-32, which may or may not have led the league to give up on the experiment, although they officially cited the rise of NIL opportunities for college athletes as the driving reason. The 6-foot-10 forward played in 26 regular season games, and given the team\u2019s situation, his stats weren\u2019t great. He scored 14.3 points per game while shooting under 50% from the field and a measly 27.3% from three (on 3.4 attempts per night). But when Buzelis is rolling, he shows flashes of being the complete offensive package. He has a strong desire to involve his teammates on offense and dishes the ball around fluidly in the half court and in transition. Plus, for his size he has a pretty reliable handle. Buzelis can legitimately protect the rim, too, posting 2.1 blocks per game against grown men in the G League. If the three-pointer comes along, Buzelis looks like a prototypical modern four who\u2019s definitely worth a punt in the top-eight picks. The best case scenario of pairing him with Wembanyama in San Antonio would lead to some thrilling big-man combination play. Verdict: In\n\nBronny James, guard, USC\nLike every other draft segment you\u2019ve seen or heard on ESPN or a prominent sports outlet of your choice, I had to tack on a Bronny James discussion at the end of this. What can I say, it gets clicks. I may be a Trojans fan and occasional apologist, but I can\u2019t mince my words when it comes to the younger James: Bronny has no place on an NBA court next season. His combination of size, measuring 6-foot-1.5 at the Combine, and production, averaging 4.8 points and 2.1 assists in his lone college season, would not be enough for any player not bearing the James name to hear his name called. Klutch Sports CEO and Bronny\u2019s agent Rich Paul claims that Toronto team president Masai Ujiri \u201cloves him\u201d and \u201ccould even take him without seeing him at 31,\u201d referring to Bronny not working out with the Raptors. Ujiri\u2019s interest in Bronny\u2019s basketball future could very well be authentic, but the Toronto GM could probably draft 15-plus players in that spot who are more likely to contribute to the Raptors\u2019 next winning team. If we\u2019re gonna do this, let\u2019s just do it in the least dramatic way: Bronny falls to the Lakers at No. 55 and GM Rob Pelinka takes him to appease LeBron James, preventing him from ring-chasing elsewhere. And who knows, maybe new head coach JJ Redick works his magic and Bronny eventually becomes an NBA rotation guy. Verdict: Out\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/06/26/country-club-current-dear-american-mens-tennis-its-time-for-a-new-major-champ/", "response": "```\nThere\u2019s a new No. 1 American in men\u2019s tennis. Greenville, N.C., native Tommy Paul earned his new ranking this week after winning the Cinch Championships in London on Sunday, besting unseeded Italian Lorenzo Musetti in straight sets. World No. 13 Taylor Fritz had held the title of top American since he surpassed John Isner back in 2019, the week after Isner fell in the round of 16 at that year\u2019s Miami Open.\n\nBefore Paul faced Musetti in the final at Cinch, however, he battled fellow American and rising star Sebastian Korda in the semifinals, ultimately coming out on top 6-4, 7-6 (2). Thanks to his showing in London and a runner-up finish at the Lib\u00e9ma Open in the Netherlands, Korda also climbed up the ATP rankings this week, now sitting at No. 20. Korda had already faced Paul this year, when Korda won in two sets in the Lib\u00e9ma quarterfinals a couple of weeks ago. Korda then followed it up with a victory over then-No. 23 Tallon Griekspoor in the semifinals, and although Korda fell to then-No. 9 Alex de Minaur in the championship match, both he and Paul have shown potential in the first few weeks of the grass season.\n\nThe Americans now claim four spots in the top-20 of the ATP rankings, with Paul, Fritz, and up-and-comer Ben Shelton at No. 12, 13 and 14, respectively, with Korda rounding it out at No. 20. Considering how good European youngsters like No. 1 Jannik Sinner and No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz are, the presence of that many top-ranked Americans seems promising. But there\u2019s a glaring fact that most American tennis fans widely acknowledge: an American man has not won a grand slam since Andy Roddick won the U.S. Open in 2003.\n\nAt the time, Roddick\u2019s win in New York City made fans think that there would be yet another era of competitive Americans in men\u2019s tennis, but Roddick never won another grand slam despite his five finals appearances. The big-serving Isner was another American who threatened to contend, but the closest he came was the semifinals at Wimbledon in 2018. He eventually flamed out and retired in 2023 at 38 years old.\n\nHowever, the last few years have somewhat re-sparked America\u2019s hope for a consistent grand slam contender of its own. The four highest-ranked Americans are the country\u2019s strongest chance at the moment, but American and world No. 30 Frances Tiafoe has been known to get hot at the right time, especially at slams. Tiafoe is strongest on hard courts, proven by his several quarterfinal berths at the U.S. and Australian Opens over the years. His track record at Wimbledon doesn\u2019t suggest he has a great chance this year, but he\u2019ll be a fan favorite when the tour returns to U.S. soil in August.\n\nThe interesting and somewhat strange situation with American men\u2019s tennis is that, despite the lack of grand slam titles, good players are out there; they\u2019re competitive across the three surfaces and at tournaments both at home and abroad. They\u2019ve actually won a fair amount of ATP tournaments throughout the past few seasons, most notably when Fritz won Indian Wells in 2022. But in slams, when all the marbles are at stake, an American has yet to push through since Roddick.\n\nOn the other hand, American women\u2019s tennis hasn\u2019t had the issues that the men have. 23-time grand slam winner Serena Williams, alongside her sister, Venus, was dominant throughout her career, while her male counterparts continued to struggle. Even now, Coco Gauff will defend her U.S. Open title in a couple of months, and usually performs well on hard and clay courts. Grass has been a more difficult surface for her, but she\u2019ll head into Wimbledon with momentum, having passed Aryna Sabalenka this week to become the world No. 2.\n\nAlthough, to compete for titles, Gauff will likely have to get through both Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, who topped the WTA rankings for the 109th consecutive week and often looks unbeatable. Gauff isn\u2019t the only American woman who will compete for trophies this year. No. 5 Jessica Pegula didn\u2019t play at the French Open due to injury and fell in the second round of the Australian Open, but just beat No. 24 Anna Kalinskaya in the finals of the Ladies Open in Berlin. No. 11 Danielle Collins has also been competitive this year, while No. 19 Emma Navarro won her first career title earlier this season at Hobart International and had a strong showing at Roland-Garros, where she made the round of 16.\n\nGiven that four American tennis players from both tours rank inside the top 20, it\u2019s a little unsettling that an American man hasn\u2019t won a slam in over 20 years. But those statistics paired together prove a worrying\u2014yet often exciting\u2014fact about tennis: it\u2019s a sport marked by dominance. Face the facts: men\u2019s tennis was dominated by Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and (still) Novak Djokovic year after year through the 21st century. When slams came around, they were instant favorites, no matter the location and surface. Every once in a while a challenger would shock the tennis world\u2014like Roddick did in 2003\u2014but they\u2019d never accomplish enough to even be considered a part of the legendary group.\n\nPlayers like Sampras, Andre Agassi and Jim Courier set expectations high for the future of American men\u2019s tennis. But since those three stepped down, nobody has climbed up to take their place. No American male made it past the round of 16 at this year\u2019s French Open, and with Wimbledon starting early next week, the chances of an American making a deep run remain low.\n\nThe next best opportunity for an American to make a major impression is when the tour moves from the clay and grass courts of Europe to North America\u2019s hard courts, a typically friendly surface for American-born players. Both Paul and Fritz are the top two in the country, and while there\u2019s more time for Shelton and Korda to reach their peaks, the two show even more promise given how quickly they\u2019ve risen in the rankings since turning pro. This year\u2019s U.S. Open will be difficult for any American to win, but anything can happen with the home-crowd advantage. You never know who could become the next Roddick. And after that, they\u2019ll just need to find a way to consistently compete with the European giants who aren\u2019t going away any time soon.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nBy Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as June 25, 2024 at 8:01 pm PDT\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 newly minted head coach spent his 40th birthday outlining his vision to restore the purple and gold to championship glory. Former NBA 3-point specialist and ESPN broadcaster JJ Redick was officially inaugurated as the franchise\u2019s 29th head coach on Monday afternoon at the Lakers\u2019 practice facility in El Segundo.\n\n\u201c[The] Lakers have some of the most passionate fans worldwide, and the expectation is a championship,\u201d Redick said. \u201cIt is on all of us to deliver a championship-level team. That is what I signed up for.\u201d\n\nBasketball savant Redick can now add NBA head coach to his lengthy basketball resume, although one that does not include formal NBA coaching experience. Drafted No. 11 overall out of Duke in 2006, Redick spent 15 years in the league as a reliable 3-point shooter for various teams.\n\nWhile Redick\u2019s career average of 12.6 points per game doesn\u2019t necessarily raise eyebrows, his deep knowledge of the sport and witty personality landed him a job in front of the camera even before his playing days were over. In August 2020, Redick founded ThreeFourTwo Productions to give NBA fans the inside scoop on the league, offering unprecedented access to players and coaches.\n\nOver his four years with ThreeFourTwo, Redick created the show \u201cOld Man and The Three,\u201d and later added a collaborative podcast \u201cMind the Game\u201d with LeBron James, whom Redick will now coach. Along with podcasting, Redick was a color commentator for NBA on ESPN broadcasts, most recently covering the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nHowever, Redick\u2019s coaching experience is minimal. Outside of his son\u2019s third\u2014and fourth-grade basketball teams, Redick hasn\u2019t coached a high-level team at either the collegiate or pro level.\n\n\u201cI am a two-time 55 Swish League champion in the third- and fourth-grade division,\u201d Redick said in comparison to two-time national champion Dan Hurley, one the candidates for the Lakers vacancy.\n\nYet, beginning his first NBA coaching tenure, Redick is not phased about the criticism he might receive and is focused on the bigger picture.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a f\u2014. I want to coach the Lakers. I don\u2019t dispel anything. I want to become a great coach in the NBA, and I want to win championships,\u201d Redick said.\n\nCoaching Philosophies\n\nCoaching in the NBA didn\u2019t strike Redick\u2019s attention until he interviewed for the Toronto Raptors head coaching role last summer. The Raptors chose to go in another direction, yet in pursuit of landing a coaching job, Redick spent the last year picking the brains of coaches and managers in the league.\n\n\u201cI am very fortunate that I have a small circle of people currently working in the NBA that I am friends with that I can confide in and help me,\u201d Redick said. \u201cThe further I got into those conversations, the further I got into my journaling about coaching.\u201d\n\nHaving spent the last few years analyzing the game in different formats, Redick\u2019s philosophies are driven by performance, leadership, collaboration and competition. Redick was forthright about being adaptable as a coach and creating marginal gains within the Lakers roster regarding three-point shooting and defense.\n\nRedick wants to improve the Lakers\u2019 ability to get quality looks from behind the arc, limit turnovers, and polish defensive scheming. As a unit in 2023-24, Los Angeles shot an eighth-best 37.7% from 3-point range while allowing opponents to shoot a fifth-best 37.6% from three. The Lakers also allowed an eighth-worst 117.6 points per game.\n\nRedick was adamant about creating a competitive culture in the Lakers organization and acknowledged the importance of making the process enjoyable.\n\n\u201cThe pursuit of greatness can not be miserable. Every day someone walks into this building, they have to enjoy it,\u201d Redick said. \u201cIt is sort of on me to create that culture.\u201d\n\nAnthony Davis in the No. 1 Role\n\nAt the press conference, Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka noted the involvement of their two superstars, forwards Anthony Davis and James, and signaled a change in their respective roles on and off the court. With the future in mind, the Lakers heavily consulted with Davis during the process while James took a back seat, being supportive from a distance.\n\nRedick took the time to address his goal of putting Davis in the best position possible to succeed. Davis is coming off an All-Star season, having averaged 24.4 points, a career-high 12.6 rebounds (third-highest in the NBA), and 2.3 blocks, earning him a fifth appearance on the All-Defensive first team.\n\nHowever, the current Lakers offense has ultimately been running through 39-year-old James, whose 29.2% usage rate was the highest on the team last season.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that I brought up with [Davis] was the idea of him being a hub,\u201d Redick said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he has been used that way and sort of maximized his ability.\u201d\n\nLike Denver Nuggets star Nikola Joki\u0107's role, Redick wants to display Davis\u2019 full skill set every night. Davis\u2019 new role will have the Lakers\u2019 offense look to run through him as a scorer and facilitator instead of being a traditional five whose sole focus is on providing an interior presence.\n\nFocus on Player Development\n\nAs much as the Lakers organization and fans want to see James play forever, Father Time always wins. In hiring Redick, Pelinka attributed Redick\u2019s prioritization of player development as key to his receiving the job.\n\n\u201cMy motivation for doing this job starts with a simple foundation of service,\u201d Redick said. \u201cThe greatest moments late in my career were about helping players.\u201d\n\nYoung teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves have found great success through dedication to player development, while the Lakers\u2019 formula has been very different. They consistently prefer to trade away picks and young players in hopes of acquiring stars. This strategy resulted in one championship in 2020, but the franchise\u2019s year-to-year results have been inconsistent.\n\n\u201cBeyond James and Davis, the group matters more than ever,\u201d Redick said. \u201cWe need six to seven guys who can play minutes deep into the playoffs.\u201d\n\nRole players like guard Austin Reaves, forward Rui Hachimura and guard Max Christie are part of Redick\u2019s plan to create a championship-caliber team. While the Lakers\u2019 superstars steal the headlines, Redick wants to create a well-rounded group.\n\nHis first duty will be helping make the Lakers\u2019 two selections in the NBA draft on Wednesday and Thursday. The Lakers currently hold the No. 17 and No. 55 overall picks.\n\nRedick\u2019s visions for the Lakers will take time to implement, needing buy-in and collaboration from players. Yet another unsuccessful coaching hire by Pelinka and Lakers President Jeanie Buss should be their last time making future decisions for the purple and gold.\n```"}

The recent HBO series \u201cQuiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV\u201d exposed jarring allegations against Nickelodeon acting coach Brian Peck and showrunner Dan Schneider. While Peck was arrested for sexually abusing then-15-year-old child star Drake Bell in 2003, the docu-series is the first time Bell has publicly shared his experience. In doing so, Bell and the other former Nickelodeon stars featured in the series brought to light a long history of abuse of child actors in the industry.\n\n\u201cSome of my best friends were series regulars on [Dan Schneider\u2019s] shows, and hearing their experiences was definitely jarring,\u201d Kamran Allahverdy said. Allahverdy is a former child actor who guest starred in \u201cSam and Cat,\u201d a Nickelodeon show created by Dan Schneider.\n\nPeck and Schneider were the main focus of the docuseries, but they are not the first Nickelodeon employees to have accusations of this type. In 2003, Jason Handy, a production assistant with Nickelodeon, was arrested for lewd acts on a child, one count of sexual exploitation of a child and one count of distributing sexually explicit material by email to a minor. In 2009, Nickelodeon animator Ezel Channel was sentenced to seven years in prison for committing \u201clewd acts\u201d on a 14-year-old boy and showing him pornography on set.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Nickelodeon. USC School of Cinematic Arts professor Justin Parpan said he witnessed some \u201cpretty awful behavior\u201d during his time on Cartoon Network, a popular children\u2019s animation channel. \u201cEverything from sexual harassment or racism to just really toxic work environments. There was lots of bullying, especially with the younger employees,\u201d Parpan said.\n\nIn 2014 Skyler Page, creator of the Cartoon Network series \u201cClarence,\u201d left the network amidst allegations of groping a female artist. \u201cI do blame a lot of those problems on the upper management and executive culture there that were not taking those problems seriously. It was all about the bottom line. If the show was profitable, they didn\u2019t care about any of [the issues],\u201d he continued.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next\n\nAfter Peck\u2019s conviction, he served 16 months in prison. Upon his release, he was hired on the set of \u201cSuite Life of Zack and Cody,\u201d a popular Disney Channel show starring child actors Dylan and Cole Sprouse. Despite confessing to sexual abuse of a minor, Peck went on to continue working with children.\n\nAnnenberg Media spoke to former child actress Madeline Curry about what needs to be done to improve the entertainment industry. \u201cExtensive background checks need to be in place for people who are going to be working with any child actors in general, but especially for people who are applying to have positions that are in charge of taking care of the actors,\u201d Curry said.\n\nCurry also touched on how she was able to avoid these situations as a child. \u201cI was going to professional jobs when I was pretty young. But my parents never left my side,\u201d Curry said. \u201cI was never out of their sight, and that was a huge step my parents took in preventing anything horrible from happening to me as a child.\u201d\n\nIt has been seven years since the #MeToo movement, which raised awareness for sexual harassment in the workplace, rose to prominence. The movement took off in the film and television industries, taking down Hollywood top dogs such as Harvey Weinstein, Charlie Rose and Kevin Spacey.\n\n\u201cBefore the #MeToo movement, it wasn\u2019t very common for directors to ask the actors if they felt comfortable touching another actor. It was an assumed state of mind that if you were in that room you were expected to feel comfortable with everyone you\u2019re working with,\u201d Curry said.\n\nDespite the change created by the #MeToo movement, it took until \u201cQuiet on Set\u201d was released for the stories of Nickelodeon child actors to gain public attention.\n\n\u201cI think that studios need to keep holding the \u2018most important people\u2019 accountable. Because a lot of times they create the culture of a TV show, and when those shows are toxic it comes from the top down,\u201d Parpan said.\n\nAccording to Allahverdy, some channels already have rules in place protecting their actors. \u201cOn the Disney Channel, we had a set teacher who was there not just to teach us, but to make sure that we weren\u2019t getting overworked and that we were being protected. I think that [having a teacher] has been the most transformative thing on any of those projects,\u201d Allahverdy said.\n\n\u201cQuiet On Set\u201d directors Mary Robertson and Emma Shwartz agreed, saying that \u201ccreating more support systems for children on sets, whether that is more access to mental health specialists or social workers,\u201d would help curb some of these issues.\n\nBut some industry insiders want more than just internal accountability. \u201cOur industry needs drastic systematic change throughout, or to be completely rebuilt from the ground up,\u201d said film producer and USC Cinematic Arts Adjunct Professor Barry Bogovich.\n\nCurrently, there is no federal legislation in place to protect child actors, but some states have passed laws such as California\u2019s Coogan Law. This law requires employers to place 15% of a child actor\u2019s earnings into a trust account, which can only be accessed when the actor turns 18 years old.\n\nBut some want more than financial protection: They want physical protection, too. \u201cThere\u2019s just a patchwork of state laws, only some of which require guardians to be on set with children ... there should be more federal protections for child performers,\u201d Robertson and Shwartz said.\n\nWhether it\u2019s adding more support for actors on set or passing federal legislation, it is clear something has to change in the world of kids TV.\n```"}

Strauss became the subject of international attention after a protest where students called attention to Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza. He was filmed saying the protesters were \u201cignorant\u201d and \u201cHamas are murderers. That\u2019s all they are. They should all be killed.\u201d\n\nFollowing this interaction, several students reported him to USC\u2019s Office for Equity, Equal Opportunity, and Title IX for discrimination and harassment. An online petition circulated that garnered more than 7,000 signatures calling for his removal, and another counter petition garnered over 24,000 signatures in support of him. Strauss was placed on administrative leave for the remainder of the fall semester but returned to campus in the spring.\n\nHe said that an investigative lawyer affiliated with USC interviewed students and eyewitnesses to the November incident throughout the spring semester. Strauss said he received an email from USC on June 7 stating that all complaints against him had been dismissed and there would be no further investigation. He said he got another email on June 18 indicating the decision was final after no one had appealed.\n\nStrauss said the 7-month investigative period made him feel unsupported by the USC administration since he and his lawyer both believed he had not done anything that violated USC policy. \u201cThe fact that [USC administration] was not supportive of me gave me the distinct impression that they did not want these kinds of statements and interactions with students,\u201d Strauss said in an interview with Annenberg Media Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any apologies for what I had done. I think what I did was perfectly fine. And obviously, the university has agreed because they said that there would be no disciplinary actions.\u201d\n\nStrauss said he is even more convinced he was right in November because of how he was treated after he returned to campus. He described an interaction with a student during the end of year pro-Palestinian protests when he was called \u201cUSC\u2019s most racist professor.\u201d \u201cI think it really vindicated what I said \u2014 that students really are ignorant about Hamas,\u201d Strauss said. \u201cI think unfortunately, that\u2019s still true even today, to a large extent with what happened at Columbia and UCLA and even here with the student protesters, most of whom are not even Palestinian or not even Arab. Having the police on campus and arresting people was entirely appropriate.\u201d\n\nOver 37,000 people have been killed and 86,000 people have been injured in Gaza since Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack. Since then, protests have erupted across the country on college campuses and resulted in academic consequences and police action taken against the participating students. At USC, the main stage commencement ceremony was canceled, leading to widespread criticism.\n\nStrauss said he thought USC could have handled the commencement situation better, starting with the selection of the valedictorian, Asna Tabassum, who was ultimately barred from speaking before the main state ceremony\u2019s cancellation. \u201cThe choice of that particular person as valedictorian, I\u2019m sure she was very qualified in terms of her academics, but somebody really should have done some better background checking,\u201d Strauss said, characterizing a link to pro-Palestinian resources Tabassum had embedded in her Instagram as \u201cpretty bad stuff\u201d and adding he was \u201cnot the only one who feels that way.\u201d\n\nAbove all else, Strauss said he feels good about how USC resolved the investigation into the moment that turned him into a cable news segment. \u201cMy only criticism is I think they could and should have resolved it months earlier,\u201d Strauss said.\n```"}

USC declined Annenberg Media\u2019s request for comment about the situation. \u201cWe\u2019re relieved,\u201d Ali said. \u201cObviously there are no winners here, a man has lost his life stealing but Ivan has to live with this the rest of his life as well, psychologically and emotionally.\u201d Before the decision, Gallegos\u2019 community was rallying behind him. Around 40 friends and family appeared at the courthouse Thursday as the DA\u2019s office concluded the stabbing was motivated by self-preservation. \u201cAfter careful consideration and a thorough review of all available evidence, we have decided not to pursue charges against USC student Ivan Gallegos. We believe that Mr. Gallegos\u2019s actions were driven by a genuine fear for his life and the lives of others. Our heart goes out to the deceased\u2019s family, friends and everyone impacted by this tragic incident,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n said in a statement. Xavier Cerf, 27, was allegedly trying to steal from cars on Greek Row when he was confronted and ultimately killed.  The DA\u2019s office says  Cerf was inside Gallegos\u2019s roommate\u2019s car when Gallegos and two others confronted him. Cerf allegedly claimed he had a gun and reached towards his hip before being stabbed four times. He is survived by his mother and three-year-old son. After Gallegos\u2019 charges were dropped, Cerf\u2019s mother, Yema Jones, posted a GoFundMe to return his body to Texas and fund his burial. The fundraiser has accumulated more than $4,700 as of Monday. She has not responded to an interview request. Cerf faced mental struggles in recent years, Jones told the  Los Angeles Times , and had a criminal record in Texas and California. But she described him as a \u201cvibrant\u201d person who \u201cloved to dance.\u201d \u201cOne thing about me is I\u2019m never going to paint a pretty picture about my son. I\u2019m just going to give you facts. Everybody goes through life issues,\u201d Jones told the LA Times. \u201cRegardless, he was still a father. He was still a brother. He was still a son. It didn\u2019t have to go that far.\u201d Gallegos was being held on a $2 million bail following his June 17 arrest. Gallegos\u2019 family had set up multiple GoFundMe pages which were taken down by the site after a combined $10,000 had been donated. That money also was refunded. GoFundMe\u2019s  Terms of Service  do not allow fundraising for the legal defense of violent crimes but it is unclear if the two pages were removed for that reason.\n```"}

Welcome to Giesler\u2019s Grand Slam, a weekly column covering all the MLB has to offer. My name is Andrew Giesler, and I\u2019m a sophomore from Los Angeles, California. I am an avid fan of all sports\u2014 especially baseball\u2014and love to utilize both statistics and science to analyze sports more effectively. Without further ado, let\u2019s get into this week\u2019s topics:\n\nA look back at Willie Mays\u2019s Career\nThe legendary \u201cSay Hey Kid\u201d Willie Mays passed away on Tuesday. He played 23 seasons in the MLB, most of which were for the San Francisco Giants from 1951 to 1972, before spending the final two years of his career with the New York Mets. When all was said and done, Mays retired with a batting average of .301 with 3,293 hits and 660 home runs. He was a first-ballot Hall of Famer, inducted in 1979, and had his No. 24 retired by both the Giants and the Mets. His resume only sounds more ridiculously good from there. He made appearances at 24 All-Star games, won 12 Gold Glove Awards, won the National League MVP twice, led the National League in home runs and stolen bases four separate times, and, of course, won the coveted Commissioner\u2019s Trophy in 1954. In 1999, he was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, receiving nearly 1.116 million fan votes. This week, the baseball community mourns the loss of one of the greatest players in history, a man who also played a pivotal role in the civil rights movement. Mays started his baseball journey with the Birmingham Black Barons, transitioning to the major leagues a mere four years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. In 2015, Mays was bestowed with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by then-President Barack Obama, who said, \u201cbecause of giants like Mays, someone like me could even think about running for president.\u201d\n\nWhat do injuries mean for the Dodgers?\nThis past Sunday, Mookie Betts hit the dirt after a 98-mile-per-hour four-seam fastball drilled his left hand in an at-bat against the Royals. The Dodgers (47-30) are leading the NL West by 9 games over the Diamondbacks and Giants; however, they will be without one of the best leadoff hitters in the league. Posting an OBP of .405 so far in the 2024 season, Betts constantly puts Los Angeles in a position to score runs. With Freddie Freeman, Shohei Ohtani and Will Smith waiting behind him, it is no surprise that the Dodgers have the second most runs (389) and RBIs (375) scored in the MLB. Betts has been crucial for the Dodgers offense, constantly putting himself in scoring position with a solid .488 slugging percentage and nine stolen bases. Betts\u2019s fracture will not require surgery. But the bad news is that this injury was on his glove hand. As a shortstop, batters will consistently fire hard-hit balls in his direction. The Dodgers must ensure Betts fully heals before coming back, for the risk of re-injury could lead to yet another devastating postseason loss for Los Angeles.\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto, a dominant right-handed pitcher who LA plans to be a long-time starter, was put on the 15-day injured list due to a strained rotator cuff. Although not season-ending, this injury is a blow to the Dodgers\u2019 rotation. With Dustin May, Tony Gonsolin, Joe Kelly, Brusdar Graterol and now Walker Buehler as well all out on the 60-day IL, along with Clayton Kershaw only making his minor league rehab start this past week, fans are left wondering how good a healthy Dodgers team could be. The likely root of Yamamoto\u2019s injury can be found in his June 7 start against the Yankees when he threw a season-high 106 pitches. The ball was flying out of his hand, effortlessly achieving a velocity in the high 90s. During his seven innings, he was able to throw his 19 fastest pitches of the season as well as 13 sliders\u2014the most he\u2019s thrown in the MLB so far. Although he was given a full seven days rest between his start against the Yankees and his next start against the Royals, Yamamoto still threw over 100 pitches in each of his past four starts. In his start on June 15, the workload finally caught up with him and he exited the Royals game after only 28 pitches. The Dodgers have to hope that their injuries will only be a minor setback, and will not cost them their most expensive postseason run yet.\n\nRockies robbed of a victory\nOn Tuesday night, the Colorado Rockies (26-49) and the Dodgers (47-30) played out an initially one-sided game. As the affair entered the ninth inning, the Rockies held a comfortable lead of 9-4. However, the Dodgers\u2019 Jason Heyward\u2019s grand slam narrowed the gap to a single run. With two outs and a 1-2 count, Colorado pitcher Victor Vodnik delivered a high fastball at which Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez check-swung, a moment that would significantly alter the game\u2019s trajectory. There is no direct rule for a check swing in the MLB; in fact, there is no rule for what is considered a swing at all. Being so vaguely defined, it\u2019s no surprise that teams are letting up runs and losing games because of varying calls on checked swings. The general rule of thumb is if the bat crosses the plane of the plate or if the batter\u2019s wrists break, he is said to have swung, and a strike should be called. In the specific case of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s at-bat, the sequence of events was clear. His bat undeniably crossed through the plate and his wrists broke at the end of his swing. This obvious swing triggered a wave of protest from Rockies players, fans and manager Bud Black, who was ejected after his heated exchange with the first base umpire. Fuelled by his frustration, Vodnik\u2019s next pitch was his fastest of the night, a fastball right down the middle. The outcome? A three-run homer by Hern\u00e1ndez propelled the Dodgers to an 11-9 lead in the top of the 9th inning. The controversy is yet another example of why the game\u2019s rules should be more clearly defined on paper. An objective metric determining whether a batter swings is essential so that calls are consistent and teams stop getting the short end of the stick in decisions left to an umpire\u2019s judgment.\n\nA double play going into the weekend...\nThe first matchup to watch will be the New York Yankees fighting at home against the Atlanta Braves. The Yankees, who are tied with the Dodgers for second most runs in baseball this year (389), and are third in the league in team ERA (3.18), will look to prove why they should be considered the best team in baseball against a 41-31 National League foe. Friday night\u2019s matchup will see a pitchers\u2019 duel between the Yankees\u2019 Carlos Rodon and the Braves\u2019 Chris Sale. Sale will try to keep his momentum going after a seven-strikeout outing against the Tigers. Rodon, on the other hand, will want to return to his typical rhythm after giving up seven runs through five innings. Prediction: The Yankees will drop game one but win games two and three to take the series 2-1.\n\nThe second matchup will be the freeway series between the Dodgers and Angels. It will be the first time Ohtani faces the Angels in the regular season since switching teams, and he\u2019ll hope to do better than he did against them in spring training. Ohtani went 0-6 in that three-game series with two walks and two strikeouts. This series will also be the first time the Dodgers have to fill the hole in the rotation with Yamamoto\u2019s absence. Fans will likely see a bullpen day, as Sunday\u2019s probable starter, Tyler Glasnow, is on only five days\u2019 rest and will not be moved up in the rotation. Prediction: Despite not having Betts or Yamamoto, the Dodgers will still pull out a two-game sweep.\n\nTo keep myself honest, I\u2019m going to keep track of my Double Play record each week. For now, we\u2019re 0-0.\n```"}

(Photo/LA Kings)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nJune 20, 2024 at 8:22 pm PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Los Angeles Kings have had an extensive logo history, from the franchise\u2019s early purple-and-gold days to the clean-cut, silver-and-black symbols they\u2019ve sported more recently. But on Thursday, the Kings unveiled their newest look to be worn on jerseys, shirts and caps in 2024-25 and beyond: an updated \u201cChevrolet\u201d logo.\n\nLos Angeles incorporated elements from different eras to build this modernized logo. The new design\u2014while featuring a slightly altered shape, colors and typeface\u2014resembles the logo used from 1988 to 1998, for which the original release coincided with the acquisition of four-time Stanley Cup champion Wayne Gretzky.\n\nThe 90s \"Chevrolet\" logo is often associated with Wayne Gretzky. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon)\n\nWhile the new logo and the Gretzky-era design have many similarities, the Kings didn\u2019t aim to just bring back a symbol of the past; the new logo also displays a recolored version of the crown worn on its original 1967 jerseys, a new and emboldened font for both \u201cLos Angeles\u201d and \u201cKings,\u201d updated speed lines and a white drop shadow to make the script pop out. The logo also employs a lighter shade of silver.\n\nThe Kings have yet to unveil new uniforms but are expected to before the 2024 NHL Entry Draft\u2019s commencement on June 28. Los Angeles had worn throwback white jerseys featuring the 90s logo from 2019-20 onwards during select dates, and had even chosen to use the jersey as its designated away uniform during the 2024 playoffs.\n\nThe new logo\u2019s shape contains a wider base and angle changes on both sides to fully modernize the vintage emblem.\n\nThe new logo follows a decade-plus period in which the Kings donned the \u201chome plate\u201d logo, a look that was used during the team\u2019s two Stanley Cup victories in 2012 and 2014.\n\nThe Kings won two Stanley Cups while donning the previous logo. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)\n\nIn a time when fans crave nostalgia, the Kings delivered. The fresh look, paying homage to the franchise\u2019s storied history while also making sharp updates, will surely be a popular look in the NHL\u2019s post-Adidas era, as Fanatics will become the league\u2019s jersey manufacturer starting in 2024-25.\n```"}

The LA-based side jogged out to a 2-0 lead within about 30 minutes, but just before the half, the referee awarded Racing Louisville (3\u20134-6, 15 points) a penalty for a centerback Megan Reid\u2019s seemingly accidental stamp on striker Elexa Bahr\u2019s foot. Right or not, Angel City (4-6-3, 15) and its fans seemed displeased with the call. But striker Sydney Leroux made sure that was not the story of the night with an 85th-minute winner, on Juneteenth no less.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so fitting that [Leroux] scored the winning goal,\u201d said head coach Becki Tweed in the postgame press conference. \u201cBecause I think for two games she\u2019s left everything that she possibly has on the field.\u201d The former U.S. women\u2019s national team standout scored her fourth goal of the season\u2014already doubling her tally from the 2023 campaign\u2014to give Angel City its first win in six matches.\n\nTweed\u2019s side thoroughly outplayed Louisville in the first half, penalty aside, with rookies Kennedy Fuller and Madison Curry connecting for the opening goal in the 17th minute. Curry, playing at left back, charged into the final third, waiting for a teammate to make a run, and beautifully disguised a direct pass into Fuller\u2019s feet, who finished first-time. The goal was 17-year-old Fuller\u2019s first in professional soccer and gave Curry her first assist.\n\n\u201cKennedy is so reliable, Kennedy\u2019s a true pro,\u201d Tweed said. \u201cWhether she comes off the bench, starts, doesn\u2019t play minutes\u2014she\u2019s the same person ... To score in the NWSL at [17] years old, she has such a bright future.\u201d\n\nFuller\u2019s goal capped off an excellent opening quarter of an hour for Angel City, in which the team applied consistent pressure to Louisville\u2019s backline and won the ball back consistently. The home side tallied 10 first-half tackles and five interceptions, both higher than Louisville\u2019s figures, despite Angel City having slightly more possession.\n\nMidfielder Raquel \u201cRocky\u201d Rodriguez doubled the lead 15 minutes later, capitalizing on a free kick deep in Louisville\u2019s half. Right back Merritt Mathias whipped an in-swinging ball into the box, which bounced uncomfortably for Louisville and gave Rodriguez time to quickly trap the ball and finish cleanly.\n\nAll was looking well and good for the black and pink. Having scored one goal in the previous three matches, seeing the ball hit the back of the net twice in the opening half hour or so surely eased some stress. The penalty decision threatened to unrail that momentum. Reid\u2019s accidental planting of her foot that of Bahr\u2019s ended in VAR advising the referee to take a second look (\u201cNo comment,\u201d was Tweed\u2019s statement about the decision.)\n\nMidfielder Taylor Flint stepped up to take the shot, sending goalkeeper DiDi Hara\u010di\u0107 the wrong way and side-footing the ball into the top right corner. Angel City rode out the half, which ended up including nearly 10 minutes of added time, but looked severely out of sorts to open the second 45.\n\nPerhaps sensing an opportunity they hadn\u2019t seen before, Racing Louisville\u2019s players opened the second half with increased intensity. For the opening 15 minutes of the second half, Angel City almost entirely failed to progress the ball beyond the halfway line. Louisville had the black and pink hemmed into their own half and ramped up the pressure on Hara\u010di\u0107's goal.\n\nAfter recording just three total shots in the first half, Louisville racked up 13 in the second half. Angel City seemed a bit tired after a three day turnaround from an away match against the Houston Dash. Tweed attempted to break Lousiville\u2019s momentum by taking off the embattled Mathias, who had switched to left back after halftime and promptly became Louisville\u2019s main target, but it didn\u2019t quite relieve the pressure.\n\nLouisville left back Carson Pickett scored her team\u2019s second with a back post volley that took an unfortunate deflection off ACFC centerback Sarah Gorden. But with winger Claire Emslie on the pitch, Angel City\u2019s leading scorer so far this season, there was a hope for a winner.\n\nThe breakthrough arrived in the 85th minute, when Louisville\u2019s backline bunched up to try and head clear an over-the-top pass, allowing Alyssa Thompson the space to play a first-time through ball to Leroux, who placed the ball in the bottom left corner clinically and sprinted towards the supporters\u2019 section to celebrate.\n\n\u201cWe knew what was going to happen,\u201d Leroux said. \u201cWe knew we were going to get one big chance and we were able to put it away.\u201d\n\nThe win leaves Angel City at ninth in the NWSL table, only behind eighth-place Louisville on goal difference for the final playoff spot. Each team has now played 13 matches, making this the exact halfway point in the league\u2019s 12th season. Only three points separate Chicago in sixth and San Diego in 10th, so the next few matches will be crucial for Angel City in their fight to stay in the playoff conversation.\n\nConsidering the plethora of young players in Angel City\u2019s squad, perhaps a confidence-instilling result like Wednesday night\u2019s will spur the team to greater success in the next 13 matches. \u201cThe league doesn\u2019t care about your age, we always say it to them,\u201d said Tweed, referring to her young players. \u201cThey love it, they don\u2019t want to be called teenagers. They\u2019re just footballers.\u201d\n\nAngel City goes back on the road to play Bay FC in a 7 p.m. kickoff on Saturday at PayPal Park in San Jose.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/06/20/usc-and-ole-miss-to-cancel-home-and-home-football-series/", "response": "```\nThe USC-Ole Miss series is off. With the Trojans\u2019 difficulty in schedule increasing as they prepare for life in the Big Ten and the Rebels expecting the SEC to switch from eight to nine conference games in 2026, the two schools ultimately decided to cancel their home-and-home series on Tuesday, with both parties mutually agreeing to the cancellation.\n\nUSC was slated to host Ole Miss at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Aug. 30 to kick off the 2025 season before traveling to Oxford to take on the Rebels in 2026. The Trojans and Rebels set up the pair of games in May 2020, not even six months after Ole Miss announced Lane Kiffin as their new football boss.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2013, Kiffin was the head coach at USC after serving as an assistant to the Trojan football team from 2001 to 2006 under Pete Carroll. But Kiffin\u2019s tenure in Los Angeles ended abruptly and unceremoniously, as former athletic director Pat Haden fired him on the LAX tarmac following a humiliating 62-41 loss to Arizona State in Tempe on Sep. 28, 2013.\n\nKiffin\u2019s expected return to the Coliseum to face his former team gave fans an additional aspect of intrigue given his ties to USC. In fact, his ties to the school appear to be strengthening, because while his oldest daughter Landry is currently enrolled at Ole Miss, his younger daughter Presley is currently committed to join the USC women\u2019s volleyball team.\n\nIn addition to the Kiffin family, Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart \u2014 who played his freshman year at USC before transferring to Oxford following the hiring of head coach Lincoln Riley and the subsequent arrival of Caleb Williams \u2014 also seemingly found himself caught up between his current and former school as a result of the series.\n\nWhile at USC, Dart took over as the starting quarterback in 2021 as Kedon Slovis regressed offensively and struggled with injuries during his third and final year with the Trojans. While Dart will be out of eligibility after the 2024 season and would not have played in this two-game set, his one year of service to USC also helped hype up the series, especially considering that he decided to join Kiffin and the Rebels.\n\nThe news of USC and Ole Miss canceling their home-and-home comes three weeks after unnamed sources told Matt Hayes of Saturday Down South that USC had spent almost two years trying to get out of the Vegas Kickoff Classic against LSU to start the Trojans\u2019 2024 season. The news of USC wanting to get out of the LSU game broke around the same time that rumors emerged that the Ole Miss series would be canceled.\n\nThis has led fans to wonder if Riley is afraid to face talented non-conference Power Five foes, while also leaving many fans disappointed with the decision. With the series officially off the table, USC will now need to find replacement non-conference foes to replace the Ole Miss games and finalize their non-conference slates for 2025 and 2026.\n```"}

Gallegos is currently being held on $2 million bail. He was arrested around 8:15 p.m. Monday night after allegedly fatally stabbing an unhoused individual identified Wednesday by the coroner\u2019s office as 27-year-old Xavier Cerf. Cerf was reportedly breaking into cars on West 28th St., USC\u2019s Greek Row, when Gallegos and two other individuals confronted him, according to LAPD Media Relations. The victim told Gallegos he had a gun, according to LAPD Interim Chief Dominic Choi, but a law enforcement source told the L.A. Times that no gun was recovered. Cerf was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nIn the days since the incident, two different GoFundMe fundraisers were posted by Gallegos\u2019 mother, and each raised thousands of dollars within hours before being taken down. While Annenberg Media cannot confirm the exact reason the fundraisers were removed, GoFundMe has a policy against raising money for the legal defense of violent crimes.\n\nIn addition to donations, supporters of Gallegos have been vocal online in advocating for his release. Some of them use the phrases \u201cjustice for Ivan\u201d and \u201cfree Ivan.\u201d \u201cHe should definitely be freed. There should be no reason why he\u2019s even there right now,\u201d Rafael Cardenas, a recent USC graduate and Gallegos\u2019 friend, told Annenberg Media. Cardenas said he recently became close with Gallegos and was planning on collaborating with him for his clothing business. He scheduled a meeting with Gallegos Monday evening, and arrived at Gallegos\u2019 residence, the Delta Tau Delta fraternity house, just minutes after the stabbing. He said he wholly believes Gallegos was acting in self-defense.\n\n\u201cReally, he was a hero, because if this burglar or robber really did have a gun, then we would have three dead USC students on frat row,\u201d Cardenas said. Two witnesses and friends of Gallegos also described his actions as self-defense in an exclusive interview with Los Angeles Magazine. The individuals, who the news outlet did not name, said that the man had broken into a friend of Gallegos\u2019 car, and refused to exit the vehicle. They said the man claimed he owned the car. \u201cHe feared for his life,\u201d one told LA Mag. \u201cHe had to defend himself.\u201d\n\nCardenas described Gallegos as a caring individual, whose goal is to give back to his community as an L.A. native from Boyle Heights. Gallegos started a non-profit called \u201cIf I don\u2019t, Who Will?\u201d with a mission to \u201cprovide comprehensive resources and guidance for young people as they navigate the critical transition to adulthood, with a special emphasis on those impacted by felonies, delinquency, gang violence, and substance abuse.\u201d He is also involved in music and Latinx communities and clubs on campus, and his Linkedin states he is a Presidential scholar at USC.\n\nDespite outspoken support for Gallegos in the community, there is also significant criticism of him on social media. Some questioned why he reportedly had a knife. There is no indication any of the people commenting witnessed the incident. The case is still being investigated and a hearing date has not been made available to the public.\n```"}

(AP Photo/George Walker IV)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner June 19, 2024 at 8:16 pm PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Forty points in 2023-24 simply wasn\u2019t going to cut it for the $68-million man. When the Los Angeles Kings traded for center Pierre-Luc Dubois in June 2023, the reigning 27-goal scorer was supposed to bring a new offensive spark to a team focused on making a deep postseason push. But when the Kings fell to the Edmonton Oilers in the first round of the playoffs for the third straight year\u2014with highly paid Dubois only logging one point in the series\u2014his days in black and silver instantly became numbered.\n\nThe 25-year-old was traded to the Washington Capitals in a one-for-one deal on Wednesday, illustrating Los Angeles general manager Rob Blake\u2019s predictable regret on acquiring him in the first place. The Kings landed 34-year-old goaltender Darcy Kuemper in the trade, who suited up in 19 games for Los Angeles back in 2017-18 before an eventual trade to the Arizona Coyotes.\n\nLos Angeles originally acquired Dubois in a sign-and-trade with the Winnipeg Jets. The Kings exchanged forwards Gabriel Vilardi, Alex Iafallo and Rasmus Kupari, plus a 2024 second-round pick for Dubois. While the Jets ultimately ended up in the same position as the Kings in 2023-24, losing in the opening round, Vilardi and Iafallo combined for 63 points alone, far more than Dubois was able to string together.\n\nDubois\u2019 Los Angeles tenure originally seemed promising. The Quebec native helped the Kings achieve their first two wins of the season by combining for three goals across both victories, following losing efforts in LA\u2019s first two contests. But Dubois\u2019 play would soon become inconsistent at best and certainly unworthy of his hefty deal.\n\nThe situation deteriorated even further through January, when Dubois\u2014over a stretch of 13 appearances\u2014only mustered three points total. While Blake and company ultimately end up as the losers of the Dubois saga, acquiring Kuemper gives the Kings some upside.\n\nFirst, there was zero salary retention on either side of the deal. Los Angeles will take on Kuemper\u2019s $5.25 million-per-year contract that will span over the next three seasons while shipping off Dubois\u2019 $8.5 million-per-season deal that will last for the next seven years. The league recently raised the salary cap to $88 million, so the trade will give the Kings over $23 million in cap space this summer, according to CapFriendly.\n\nWith LA\u2019s core aging and its playoff window shrinking, Blake will need to act accordingly during the offseason to put the Kings back in a threatening position. Before the deal, David Rittich was Los Angeles\u2019 only netminder under contract since Cam Talbot and Pheonix Copley are set to become free agents. Kuemper is coming off a rough 2023-24 campaign in which he allowed 3.31 goals per game and posted a .890 save percentage in 33 appearances. But as shown with Talbot\u2019s All-Star year with the Kings following a down year in Ottawa, LA might be able to squeeze success out of Kuemper and utilize him regularly in their rotation.\n\nDubois isn\u2019t a lousy hockey player; the Kings might have just been a bad fit for the young forward, and he\u2019ll have a chance to redeem himself on a Washington team experiencing the dying years of winger Alex Ovechkin\u2019s storied career. As for Kuemper, he likely won\u2019t be the only goalie acquired for Los Angeles this offseason, but he will have shoes to fill as the Kings navigate the post-Jonathan Quick era in the crease.\n\nWhile landing Dubois will go down as a failure for Blake, he wisely cut his losses. For now, Los Angeles will look forward to an offseason to attempt to gain capital and remain as a playoff contender.\n```"}

A scene of uncommon unity unfolded in Echo Park where the oldest and largest Abrahamic faiths found solace at Saint Paul\u2019s Common. Individuals of various faiths converged to observe a rare synchrony of fasting rituals on March 21: the Jewish fast of Esther and the 11th fast of the Islamic month of Ramadan.\n\nThe community iftar, the Muslim fast-breaking evening meal, was organized by New Ground in collaboration with Nefesh, a Los Angeles Jewish spiritual community. \u201cIt felt like a rare thing that shouldn\u2019t be rare. And it felt like we were proving to society: look, it can be done,\u201d said Zach Ritter, a Jewish attendee of the interfaith community iftar. \u201cIt gave me hope.\u201d Ritter is a member of New Ground, a Muslim-Jewish partnership for change that was founded in 2006 to foster community between American Muslims and Jews.\n\nSince the October 7 attacks and Israel\u2019s intense bombing campaign on Gaza in response, relations between Jews and Muslims across the United States have been tense. Instances of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia have increased, contributing to record high levels of hate. The Anti-Defamation League recorded over 2000 incidents of anti-Semitism after October 7th. Meanwhile, the Council on American-Islamic Relations received 3578 complaints of anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian discrimination.\n\nTo address this divide, New Ground\u2019s solution is to encourage hard conversations. This community iftar is one of 16 such community gatherings for the month of Ramadan, the 9th month of the Islamic lunar calendar when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset for spiritual discipline, self-reflection and increased devotion to God. The Fast of Esther, observed on the day before the Jewish holiday Purim, is a short fast where Jews abstain from food and drink to commemorate a time of danger faced by the Jewish people. It\u2019s a day of prayer and reflection, honoring Queen Esther\u2019s courage in saving them from annihilation.\n\nThe overlap of these two fasts allowed the communities to find similarities amid heightened animosity. The Muslim Surah Al-Fatiheh and Jewish prayer of Al HaNissim reverberated within the walls of an Episcopal Church at sundown. Despite the diversity in religious practices, languages of prayer and faith traditions, both communities expressed the same sentiments within their hearts \u2014 anger, sadness and a profound spirit of remembrance. Divided by religion, yet united by grief.\n\n\u201cI believe that us coming together here in California is not a direct step that changes anything that happens, but it is our opportunity to express that we are aligned with the same cause,\u201d Max Foreman, a member of Nefesh, said. \u201cWe must express our solidarity, even if it\u2019s just an expression.\u201d Foreman and his partner, Rebecca Bonahan, sat at a table in the corner with a calm demeanor, emphasizing that their presence was to show solidarity with Muslims and Palestinians.\n\nThe couple, who are both in their mid-30s, described themselves as deeply engaged in the Gaza conflict. Many attendees from both faiths spoke about the significant loss of life. On October 7th, around 1200 Israelis were killed by Hamas, according to the Israeli government. Since then, the Gaza Ministry of Health has reported over 32,000 Palestinians killed by Israeli Defense Forces.\n\nAt the beginning of the program, organizers made space to acknowledge the prevalent grief. They asked all attendees to share the name of someone in their life whom they were grieving, or even someone who had died in Gaza and Israel. Twenty minutes were dedicated to sharing a name or two and lighting a candle in their honor.\n\nAttendees at the dinner table sharing stories and engaging in conversations about religion and conflict. One attendee shared the name of Rania Abu Anza, a Palestinian woman whose twins were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Rafah. Another person at the same table shared the story of her relatives in Israel who were killed on October 7th. As a part of the event, attendees were asked to light candles in honor of one person they liked to remember. Some people lit candles for more than just one or two individuals. One person in attendance lit a candle for the journalists who had been killed in Gaza, while another said theirs was for all the mothers.\n\nThe room fell quiet, with sparse chatter at each table. Some shed tears, while others smiled as they recounted happier times. According to the event organizers, the aim of this was to \u201cfind stories of people who are too often relegated to statistics.\u201d\n\nWhile the organization has been working on bridging the divide between the two communities for almost 18 years, it has recently come under the spotlight for its \u201crelatively unique\u201d work, according to Paul Beck, who is chair of the New Ground Board of Directors. \u201cWe are trying to meet people where they are,\u201d he said. Universities, corporations and nonprofits have called on the organization to help navigate their workspace by engaging proactively with divisions driven by tensions in the Middle East.\n\nSince October 7, the number of meetings has drastically increased from around a dozen meetings a year to over 60 in the last few months. \u201cThe organization has fielded 100 distinct outreach requests from various organizations and individuals seeking assistance in navigating dialogue during this tumultuous period,\u201d Ben Ginsburg, the communications coordinator, wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to create an access point for people to enter,\u201d said Azeeza Hassan, the Executive Director of New Ground. \u201cThere will be moments where we\u2019re still going to ask really hard questions. But we can\u2019t ask them unless people are in the room.\u201d Hassan is a Palestinian American, whose family fled Palestine during the 1948 Nakba or \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d when over 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from present-day Israel. The Nakba in Israel is referred to as the War of Independence.\n\nIn addition to programming events like the iftar, the organization aims to bring Muslims and Jews together through its fellowship program for young professionals and high school mentorship program. Their Muslims and Jews Inspiring Change (MAJIC) program is a leadership cohort that trains Muslim and Jewish high school students in communication and conflict resolution. They attend Sunday retreats and sessions, learn from leaders and work on a joint project. Afterward, they receive a certificate from the City of Los Angeles, according to the New Ground website.\n\nSimilarly, their professional fellowship is for adults and aims to help them counter bias. Marium Mohibddin, a member of the 2013 fellowship cohort, shared how New Ground helped her. \u201cIt\u2019s changed my life. I had to really confront the anti-Semitism that I didn\u2019t realize I had within me, and really start challenging thoughts,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m being pushed to truly be a better Muslim. The idea of respecting others and really working and identifying people as people of the book.\u201d\n\nMohibddin was one of 100 people in attendance at the iftar, which not only brought two communities together but also blended cultures from around the world. This was reflected in a potluck where everyone brought traditional dishes to share, sparking curiosity and conversation. The food was set out on a patio outside. The spread included falafel, shawarma, hummus, and eggplant among other dishes. The menu featured vegetarian, vegan and fish options. Cuisines from around the world were offered, not limited to the Middle East. Dishes such as samosas, curry and Persian rice were also available. The dessert table offered a variety of treats ranging from baklava and Trader Joe\u2019s offerings to saffron rice pudding and cake.\n\nAttendees helping themselves to the Iftar spread. Among the event attendees, the number of Muslims fell short in comparison to their Jewish counterparts. Both organizations, New Ground and Nefesh, wanted to ensure a balanced representation of participants \u2014 an equal number of Muslims and Jews \u2014but that was not the case. According to an organizer at Nefesh, the 60 attendees who identified as Jewish were the majority, while the rest were a part of different faiths including Christians and Muslims.\n\nHassan, the director of New Ground, attributed the lower attendance to other concurrent iftars, including celebrations for Nowruz, as well as \u201cspecial prayers,\u201d while also acknowledging that communities are not only coming together but also staying away. \u201cI think both of them are true at the same time,\u201d Hassan added. \u201cI see more people coming in than I have seen before, or maybe people who have dropped off a long time ago and are now coming back. And I see people jumping off. I see more people coming in and I see people walking away. They\u2019re both true.\u201d\n\nHowever, Hassan is hopeful. \u201cI saw both grief and I saw receptivity. And I didn\u2019t see anybody step away,\u201d she said. New Ground\u2019s engagement with the two communities extends beyond the iftar and religious observances. According to Ginsburg, this involvement encompasses a diverse array of activities, such as facilitating crisis discussions, providing training for independent conversations, delivering presentations on compelling Palestinian and Israeli narratives and educating on the context and complexity of the crisis and its historical roots.\n\nAdnan Jaber and Michal Greenfield were two attendees at the iftar who embodied the mission of New Ground and strength in bringing Jews and Muslims together. The married couple \u2014 Adnan, a Palestinian from Jerusalem, and his wife Michal, a Los Angeles Jew who lived in Israel for nearly a decade \u2014 shared how spaces like the iftar and organizations like New Ground give hope to people around them. \u201cIt\u2019s idealistic. We need more of that. We love the community,\u201d Jaber said. His wife Michal agrees. \u201cIt gives hope. It nurtures hope, it validates hope as this real thing with a real community and not just something I hold and fan inside of me,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war has had a profound impact throughout the world, including here in Los Angeles. Initiatives like these are bridging the divide. \u201cI think that it\u2019s possible for Muslims to amplify Jewish voices and their own voices at the same time,\u201d said Hasan, the child of a Palestinian Muslim father and American Christian mother. \u201cAnd it\u2019s possible for Jews to amplify Jewish voices and Muslim voices at the same time, and that we can honor and lift up without it somehow coming at a cost to us.\u201d```"}

He lacked a certain respect and maturity that the other players on the PGA Tour had, and when he signed a deal with the LIV Golf Tour in 2022, it only added fuel to an already-raging fire. However, DeChambeau\u2019s capabilities as a player were undeniable. After his runner-up finish at last month\u2019s PGA Championship in Louisville, Kentucky, it felt inevitable that Bryson DeChambeau would continue performing at a high level. And at the U.S. Open, DeChambeau outdid his PGA performance as he went on to win a major championship at what is arguably the most difficult course the PGA Tour will see all year.\n\nAt Valhalla Golf Club in the PGA Championship, DeChambeau drilled a clutch birdie putt on the 18th hole that put him in a tie for first place with Xander Schauffele. A par from Schauffele, who was in the final group behind DeChambeau, would put the two in a three-hole playoff to determine a winner, but Schauffele went on to card a birdie and win the first major tournament of his career. While Schauffele won the tournament and made even more of a name for himself, DeChambeau still came away with a different kind of victory: stealing fans\u2019 hearts and becoming a crowd favorite after seasons of being the bad guy.\n\nAs Schauffele walked off the 18th green, DeChambeau was one of the first players to greet and congratulate him on his win. Just 24 hours prior to that, DeChambeau had another wild moment on the 18th hole when he chipped in for eagle. The crowd went nuts, but more importantly for DeChambeau, those moments gave fans more of a reason to get behind him despite his absence from non-major PGA events. His energetic playstyle makes fans want to see more of him, but since LIV Golf hasn\u2019t caught on the way it was expected to, it means he\u2019ll realistically only be in the spotlight four times a year.\n\nDeChambeau\u2019s victory couldn\u2019t have happened in a more dramatic fashion. Rory McIlroy, who has not won a major since the 2014 PGA Championship, missed four-foot putts on holes No. 16 and 18, resulting in two disastrous bogeys that ended up costing him the tournament. After recording three birdies throughout the first four holes on the back-nine on Sunday, it looked like McIlroy would finally win another major. Those costly three putts, however, allowed DeChambeau to win his second U.S. Open since he hoisted the trophy for the first time at Winged Foot Golf Club in 2020.\n\nThe way the Open finished, on top of the way DeChambeau competed in the two recent major championships, signal that it\u2019s time for the PGA and LIV Tours to set aside their differences. Too often nowadays the talk surrounding the game hasn\u2019t been about the competition between players, which is what should be emphasized in this sport. Instead, fans and commentators have worried more about who might be the next to succumb to a lucrative deal from the LIV Tour.\n\nDeChambeau, along with Brooks Koepka, Sergio Garcia and several other previous Tour golfers, made the switch to LIV at a time when their golf futures looked bleak. Those decisions don\u2019t take away their abilities as golfers and who they are as people, but it makes it significantly difficult for PGA Tour loyalists to accept them back, especially when their only appearances are at majors. DeChambeau, however, is an outlier from the typical LIV target in that he was still more or less at the top of his game when he jumped ship. Plus, he has stood out through passionate play as well as a consistent and diverse media presence that exposes him to golf fans of all generations.\n\nSpeaking of generations, it feels like it\u2019s been that long since PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan announced a merger with the Saudi-backed tour. The merger would combine assets from both tours, as well as the DP Tour, essentially creating a single worldwide golf league featuring the best of the best. Since then, practically nothing has happened besides PGA Tour board players, like McIlroy and world No. 8 Patrick Cantlay, getting dragged into the slow-moving negotiations, which has likely distracted them from playing their best golf.\n\nThe player board has faced constant questioning from the media about what will happen next with the merger. While those questions are justified, since the merger\u2019s result will significantly shift the future of golf, the players were left mostly in the dark as to what was going on behind the scenes. Regardless of it\u2019s Monahan or the PGA Tour board\u2019s fault for the lack of progress, it\u2019s evident the split that\u2019s taken place has disrupted the sport\u2019s culture for the worse.\n\nGolf has always been known as a sport in which players have tremendous respect for one another, and all that the creation of LIV did was create unnecessary conflict between the players. Additionally, some of the players who left the Tour for LIV haven\u2019t been the same golfers since their departure. The names that come to mind are 2020 Masters champion Dustin Johnson, 2022 British Open champion Cameron Smith and 2022 Genesis Invitational winner Joaquin Neimann. Ever since these players moved to LIV, they haven\u2019t performed anywhere near the level they had been while on the PGA Tour.\n\nThat might be because LIV hosts significantly fewer events and 54-hole tournaments, but players who were once loved by fans haven\u2019t been able to reinvigorate their game to where it once was. The trends in the media\u2014the diminishing relationships between players and missing out on the best players the sport has to offer\u2014all add up to one simple conclusion: it\u2019s time for the two tours to come back together.\n\nPutting money aside, which is difficult to do since LIV offered its players hefty sums when they joined, golf is not the sport that it once was when its best players aren\u2019t competing week in and week out. Sure, the best of the Tour and LIV can battle it out at majors, but those only happen four times a year over a four-month period. Once summer ends, there\u2019s an eight-month gap where golf fans may not watch a LIV player at all. That in and of itself should be enough of a red flag.\n\nA merger would not only allow for fans to see their favorite players nearly every weekend, but it would also allow for the players to focus on their game without the outside noise and politics. Simply put, golf has not been the same since LIV threw itself into the mix. And until an agreement is announced, the sport\u2019s storied culture will never be the same again.\n```"}

Still, the nonprofit has surpassed her expectations, with a total of 612 participants, 113 trained student leaders and 25 active community partnerships. Just this past week, Architecture + Advocacy earned a 30-minute time slot presentation at the Conference on Architecture & Design hosted by the American Institute of Architects.\n\nThe nonprofit was established in 2020 as a student-run project funded by USC Arts In Action to resolve the spatial injustice issue by architectural design. However, its seed was planted when Light, 23, took a gap year from USC during the pandemic to work as a community organizer, advocating for more affordable housing. She observed that despite many residents having their needs in mind, they lacked the means and the architectural literacy to advocate for themselves. On the other hand, development teams frequently failed to consider residents\u2019 voices: they were building two-bedroom units and a maximum of three bedrooms for multigenerational families with multiple children. Six children and their grandmother would cram in a three-bedroom.\n\n\u201cTo me, architecture connects the soul of the community to the technical and financial logistics of construction. But I think it failed to achieve that mission,\u201d said Light, who switched from the five-year B.S of Architecture to the four-year B.S. of Architectural Studies program after realizing she wanted an impactful life beyond drawing floor plans for architecture corporations. \u201cIn a nonprofit, you don\u2019t have as much monetary support, but what you do have is people\u2019s willingness to donate their time and money,\u201d said Light.\n\nGraduating in 2023, Light now lives in Culver City with her roommate whom she met playing club soccer at USC.\n\nBreakfast\n\u201cI usually do overnight oats and coffee. I recently got decaf coffee from Culver City. Now, I am used to it.\u201d\n\nResearch\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m taking a free Harvard online course on Data Analytics and Social Impact. So I\u2019ll spend 30 minutes doing that. I don\u2019t do it every day, but consistently a couple of times per week.\u201d\n\nHosting in a fine dining restaurant\n\u201cAfter the pandemic, I felt awkward interacting with people. So, I got the host job because I wanted to practice and build my people skills. I quit the sales job because of its lack of team support. In sales, I realized I had to work by myself, and in other people\u2019s space. Here, I have a team of people and can build deeper relationships with them. One of the things I learned is that I might be an ambivert, but I\u2019m a team person.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack then, I didn\u2019t know anything about anything. I sent my resume out to many places in Culver City to be a host. Juliet was the first place that got back to me. Turns out, Juliet is probably one of the nicest restaurants in Culver City \u2014 at one point, it was going for a Michelin star.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the difference between fine and regular dining when I applied. It\u2019s very intense: the fork needs to be an inch from the bottom of the table...etc But I went to architecture school, which required me to be meticulous and detail-oriented.\u201d\n\nBartending as teamwork\n\u201cWhat I do in the morning is mostly setting up and prepping: getting our wine out of the wine fridge or cellar and preparing our garnishes for the night team.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Amy [the restaurant server working with Erin] brought in a group of people, I needed to be back behind the bar and be ready to make all the drinks since they are the first thing people order. I like working here because nobody\u2019s a slacker. You can trust anyone to do their job.\u201d\n\nArchitecture degree and bartending\n\u201cThere are a lot of debates surrounding the value of a college degree, especially when I graduated with an architecture degree and ended up bartending. I\u2019m very proud of becoming a bartender.\u201d\n\n\u201cCollege taught me to design my learning process. Even the technology I was learning in architecture school has already been replaced by software. College teaches you to design your learning process: how to learn and teach yourself knowledge.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout January or February, knowing that my manager was looking for a bartender, I went to him and asked if I could start training. It\u2019s challenging to find a place that will train you to be a bartender since most places won\u2019t hire you unless you have previous experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI needed to learn 50 to 100 cocktails. How did I do that? By getting a book and reading it, sitting down every night and studying, making flashcards and going through them to have my friends test me, and having some practice sessions to mix drinks and test myself. A month later, I could demonstrate to the bar manager that I could make all the drinks. It was efficient to go from house to bartender because I had a great learning process. It\u2019s what sets you up for success in life: the ability to walk into any new situation and acquire the necessary skills to solve problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, I still look at the flashcards. I know enough to make most drinks people order from our cocktail list, but there are hundreds of other cocktails. So if somebody orders any drink I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll step behind and look at my phone.\u201d\n\nThe big picture\n\u201cI wanted something flexible, so I can work on Architecture + Advocacy and have that be my main focus. So working at Juliet is flexible, I\u2019ll work three or four days per week, and use that extra day to work on the nonprofit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I worked five days, I could make a lot of money as a bartender. But this is my side hustle. So my goal is to work four days a week, and then live bare bones to budget myself since I don\u2019t want to get addicted to a high lifestyle. The ultimate goal is to make the nonprofit my full-time job.\u201d\n\nPower nap\n\u201cI didn\u2019t become a nap person until I graduated from college. I usually nap when I come home from work. It helps me reset, especially if I go to dinner with my friends on Sunday night. I want to be energetic for them, not grouchy.\u201d\n\nSunset run\n\u201cI look forward to this run. It\u2019s the highlight of my week. Six miles takes me about an hour or a little bit under. Ideally, I run for 45 minutes, but sometimes I extend it a tad longer to settle into it. It\u2019s breathtaking when the run is accompanied by a sunset.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never used to do long runs when I was in school. I picked it up when I was with a triathlon team. So the six-mile distance I do is the last leg of the triathlon distance. I don\u2019t have a triathlon on my calendar, but I see myself doing another one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am grateful for my ability to run because I have rheumatoid arthritis. Many people who have that condition are not as fortunate as I am to the extent of staying active. I had a friend in high school, and there were days when she had to come to school in a wheelchair.\u201d\n\nPodcast while running\n\u201cI listen to podcasts during my sunset runs. The one I\u2019ve been listening to is \u2018The School of Greatness Hall of Fame\u2019 by Lewis Howes where he interviews remarkable people for their secrets to success. It motivates me to work harder. You have put your head in the game. As I run and listen to the podcast, I\u2019m like: Yeah, me too. I am Lebron James.\u201d\n\nSocial media for sports\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t my best run nor the slowest. I use the Nike Run Club App to record. Another popular app is Starva, I follow my friends from the triathlon teams on it. It\u2019s a little way to brag, but it\u2019s cool to see people challenging themselves.\u201d\n\nGrocery shopping & dinner\n\u201cI do my weekly grocery run on Sundays. If I don\u2019t do it today, it won\u2019t happen. Then, I would go a week without food until the next Sunday. I cook for my friends on Tuesday nights, me and my six best girlfriends, every week. I am a control freak, so I am the only one who cooks instead of rotating among us. But nobody complains, and they bring wine or wash the dishes.\u201d\n\nSimple pleasure\n\u201cI close my eyes and relish the Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups Candy. This is my way of rewarding myself for \u2018adulting\u2019 and going grocery shopping. Yay, you did adult things today.\u201d\n\nReading & bath\n\u201cTo get myself prepared for sleep, I take a bath with my lavender Epsom. I fall asleep reading fiction. Now I am reading three books: \u2018Swim with the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive\u2019 by Harvey B Mackay, \u2018Alice In Wonderland\u2019 by Lewis Carroll, and \u2018Emergent Strategy\u2019 by Adrienne Maree Brown.\u201d\n```"}

(AP/Mike Stewart)\n\nBy Robert Westermann June 12, 2024 at 9:44 pm PDT\n\nWith one day to go before 2024\u2032s third major championship, Scottie Scheffler can\u2019t stop winning. Despite a two-over-par final round at the Memorial Tournament, Scheffler bested runner-up Collin Morikawa by one stroke to earning himself $4 million, a handshake with Jack Nicklaus\u2014 designer of the course at Muirfield Golf Club\u2014and his fifth PGA Tour victory so far this year. Let me say that again: his fifth victory on the Tour, including a convincing win at the Masters.\n\nThe best golfer in the world has been undergoing several big changes in his life. Scheffler\u2019s win this past weekend at Muirfield marked the first tournament in some months where his wife was in attendance, this time with their newborn son. He also appears to have recovered from last month\u2019s arrest at the PGA Championship in Louisville, which occurred prior to Friday\u2019s round and may have led him to shooting a two-over-par round on Saturday that put him out of contention.\n\nHis absurd recent record means Scheffler is already being compared to Tiger Woods, who has 82 Tour victories all-time, 15 of which were at major tournaments. While Scheffler has a ways to go before he reaches those numbers, his performance in 2024 has been immense and there\u2019s no sign of him stopping.\n\nThe previous month of the PGA season saw lower scores than fans have come to expect. Rory McIlroy won the Wells Fargo Championship at 17-under-par. At 21-under-par, Xander Schauffele won the PGA Championship in a tournament where both he and Shane Lowry tied for the lowest scoring round in major history. Those scores aren\u2019t necessarily a worrying trend for the game, but it feels strange having tournament after tournament seem so... easy.\n\nThe results from the Memorial, however, signal that players are entering a tougher stretch of the season, and Pinehurst is set to continue that. Pinehurst is a course with significant history, hosting three U.S. Open tournaments in the last three decades. The course features some of the harshest-designed greens, which are often compared to \u2018turtle-backs,\u2019 or upside-down bathtubs, symbolizing just how difficult it is to get shots to stay on the green.\n\nWhether or not designer Donald Ross intended for the course to turn out this way, most players will likely avoid chipping and resort to bump-and-runs or putting around the greens. The course saw significant renovations back in 2019, when fairways were widened by as much as 50% and all rough was removed. Despite those changes, the fairways are still some of the most narrow on Tour and tee shots that end up anywhere but the fairway will lead to disastrous situations given the course\u2019s 7,550-yard length.\n\nNowadays, high-yardage courses aren\u2019t typically much of an issue for players on Tour because of how far they can drive the ball, but Pinehurst has a particular capacity to punish players who are inaccurate off the tee. Compared to 7,195-yard Valhalla Golf Club, host of the most recent PGA Championship, those 20 extra yards per hole make a significant difference in major tournaments.\n\nThe other major change made to Pinehurst in 2019 was the elimination of overseeding, which allows for firmer conditions throughout the year. Those conditions usually lead to longer tee shots, giving players birdie opportunities at long par-fours. The two longest par-fours at Pinehurst\u2014holes No. 4 and No. 16\u2014will be ones to keep an eye on throughout the tournament.\n\nHole No. 3 will be an early opportunity for players to get birdies. The 387-yard par-four is driveable, but three bunkers surrounding the green will require precise accuracy and some players may decide to avoid the risk while forgoing eagle chances. No. 8 is a 502-yard par-five that may also look like an easy hole on paper, but a back-to-front slope on the green and two bunkers along the left side of the fairway create complications. Still, the hole\u2019s short yardage makes it attractive for players in need of an eagle or birdie.\n\n13 LIV Tour players are in the U.S. Open field after playing in Houston over the weekend. Bryson DeChambeau was one stroke away from competing with Schauffele in a playoff at the PGA Championship, but the other LIV players haven\u2019t been performing well in majors as of late. 2018 Masters champion Patrick Reed played well at the Golf Club of Houston and is well-suited for a course like Pinehurst, but he won\u2019t be in the field this weekend after withdrawing from a Dallas qualifier.\n\nScheffler is the easy pick for this year\u2019s U.S. Open, but the winner will likely be someone who is both accurate off the tee and limits huge mistakes. Rory McIlroy, who almost always performs well at the U.S. Open, is a name that comes to mind. His distance off the tee will help this tournament, but he\u2019s tied for 37th in putting average. McIlroy was the runner-up at last year\u2019s tournament in Los Angeles, and he\u2019s always a solid bet to be in contention on Sunday as he looks for his first major win since 2014.\n\nHideki Matsuyama\u2019s chipping and touch around the greens will make him someone to look out for this weekend. Matsuyama has some momentum after finishing tied-eighth this past weekend at the Memorial. He finished outside the top-35 at the Masters and the PGA, so he\u2019ll be eager to place well in a major since winning the Masters in 2021.\n\nTwo-time major winner Morikawa has been performing well recently and was in the final pairing on Sunday at the first two majors this year. He finished second at the Memorial and is one of the best ball-strikers on Tour, giving him an edge when in need of pinpoint accuracy on approach shots. Morikawa leads the Tour in driving accuracy and has six top-10 finishes already this year. If he\u2019s able to limit mistakes throughout the tournament and stay atop the leaderboard until Sunday, it\u2019s likely he\u2019ll be in the final pairing of the third major of the year.\n\nPinehurst is a course that will punish errant shots, so there will be moments when players have to settle for pars instead of taking risks to go for birdies. The higher scores that the course has produced in the past will make for a different tournament than seen on Tour so far this year, making this weekend more about limiting mistakes than scoring as low as possible.\n```"}

Last year, USC beat Washington 3-0 in Seattle, won 3-0 against Oregon at McAlister Field and lost 4-2 to UCLA in Westwood.\n\nUSC opens Big Ten play on the road against Washington on September 13.

The Trojans return home to face Ohio State at the Coliseum before closing out the regular season against Penn State on October 20 in Carson and crosstown rival UCLA on October 27 at the Coliseum.\n\nThe date for the game against Oregon will be finalized upon TV selections by the Big Ten media partners. Should USC be one of the teams with the most points in conference play, they will be invited to the Big Ten Tournament, which takes place from October 31 to November 10. The Big Ten Conference has not yet released the details of how many teams will participate, what the format is or where the tournament will take place.\n\nLast season, USC went 11-5-3 overall and finished third in the Pac-12 with a record of 6-2-3. The Trojans advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament \u2014 their tenth consecutive NCAA appearance \u2014 where they lost to BYU 1-0 in Provo after defeating Grand Canyon in a first round, 1-0 shutout win.\n\nWith Rawlinson Stadium expected to be completed in the spring of 2025, USC should not be displaced from its normal home for long. Construction started at the beginning of the 2024 spring semester, and when completed, the stadium will be able to seat 2,500 fans, more than doubling the previous capacity of 1,000 that McAlister was able to hold.\n\nThe Trojans kick off their first Big Ten campaign on the road against New Mexico State in Las Cruces on August 15, where they will look to keep their NCAA streak alive and be competitive in their new conference.\n```"}

Both incoming and continuing graduate students in the programs will pay no tuition to USC starting this fall, saving them $58,234 from last year\u2019s tuition and fees. The programs serve 35 students, all of whom receive some sort of financial assistance according to the School of Dramatic Arts.\n\n\u201cRemoving the tuition burden for the MFA acting and writing programs is an important investment in the future of storytelling and the performing arts,\u201d Dean Emily Roxworthy said in the school\u2019s press release. \u201cSo often we see exceptional talent unable to reach their potential because financial barriers keep them from accessing top-tier training... By offering free tuition, we can now give more of these promising students the artistic home they deserve.\u201d\n\nThis move was inspired by \u201ctightening competition for opportunities in film and TV,\u201d and aims to ensure that there are fewer financial barriers for diverse talents to break into the industry, according to the school. It was made possible by scholarship donors and the school\u2019s board of councilors, which includes Connie Britton, who donated to fund the initiative, among other notable figures in the film and entertainment industry.\n\n\u201cBoth of our MFA programs in acting and dramatic writing are incredibly diverse, not only domestically, but internationally. And you know, this is precisely the population that we need stories from, right?\u201d Roxworthy said to Annenberg Media. \u201cBut at the same time, this is also often the population that can\u2019t afford to not only spend three of their creative years in school, but also to take on debt to do so.\u201d\n\nRoxworthy also said that achieving free tuition was a focus for the drama school specifically because MFA students often don\u2019t have time to pursue work outside of their degree program. \u201cYou\u2019re really in class from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. at least, often until 11 p.m. every day, because of rehearsal and the nature of the studies,\u201d Roxworthy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a particular need in dramatic arts that you don\u2019t necessarily see in the other schools at USC... I wouldn\u2019t think it necessarily would inspire [other free tuition programs at USC], because it\u2019s just a different type of need in our field.\u201d\n\nUSC will join multiple other prestigious drama schools providing tuition-free MFA courses. Juilliard\u2019s MFA in acting will also become tuition-free starting this fall. Programs in Yale\u2019s drama school have been free since fall 2021 because of a $150 million gift from David Geffen, a film producer and record label founder.\n\nThis announcement was held off until the completion of the School of Dramatic Arts\u2019 new building in March of this year. \u201cWe\u2019re letting the storytellers and performers of tomorrow know that we believe in them and the power of their dreams.

I was 18 years old and I had just bought The Artist\u2019s Way, a book by Julia Cameron. Now I\u2019m almost 22. So for three years I\u2019ve been taking myself out on a date every week, usually on Saturdays. I\u2019ve learned so much going on artist dates.\n\nAmoeba Music in Hollywood is one of the places I frequent, which is a massive record, CD and DVD shop. From there I started my CD collection. The first time I walked in I was in awe of the unfamiliar world of physical music (at least since I was in elementary school) and I walked 40 minutes in the raw heat right after my visit to buy a CD player as fast as I could, which ended up being a crappy $20 unit from Target, but it\u2019s still what I use. Starting a CD collection became, without any expectations, an opportunity for me to play the curator role and develop my music taste. I mostly listen to jazz, R&B and acoustic guitar songs.\n\nAs a student (I just graduated in May 2024) I wanted to visit Amoeba to pick up CDs regularly, but I had to be mindful of my spending. So I started listening to new music regularly on my phone to determine which CDs to buy. Now, I have a habit of listening to at least one new song daily (any genre and length) and saving it to a playlist. I enjoy Erykah Badu, Sade, Jorja Smith and Masego, and I\u2019ve recently dipped my toes into reggae. I enjoy songs from most genres, but these artists and categories are my favorites right now.\n\nBeginning to put together my CD collection was a way for me to start thinking like a curator, and was a stepping stone to pursuing a career as a visual arts curator and arts journalist. Feeling a sense of agency was really powerful and a way to experience my love for collecting, interpreting and discussing art. And this I realized from just one of the artist date experiences.\n\nSo what exactly is an artist date? What is The Artist\u2019s Way about? The book is a guide to \u201ccreativity as a spiritual practice.\u201d It is a 12-week, self-guided course with unique tools and exercises for each of the 12 chapters. These tools help you learn about your interests, heal wounds that block your creativity, and they help gently guide you to take action on your pursuits. Each week has different tools and exercises, but two are consistent for the whole book (and, as Cameron, and I too, hope, the rest of your life): morning pages and artist dates.\n\nMorning pages are an exercise where you wake up and write three pages of stream of consciousness. It clears your mind, helps access your true self, and guides you to a higher power that can answer questions and guide you to take action towards your highest self. (I know that sounds woo woo, but I promise it\u2019s real. I refer to it as the Universe, or universal power.) Morning pages have changed my life and I cannot go one day without writing them.\n\nArtist dates, on the other hand, are complete play. Morning pages and artist dates complement each other, as the former is more \u201cwork\u201d and the latter is more fun (morning pages can be, but aren\u2019t necessarily). They are, as Cameron writes, \u201ca block of time, perhaps two hours weekly, especially set aside and committed to nurturing your creative consciousness, your inner artist.\u201d\n\nSo, morning pages help clear your mind of past conditioning and thoughts, and artist dates refill your soul with inspiration, insight and experience. I used to think they were \u201cjust\u201d play, but they are a vital part of the process and often what I look forward to after a long week.\n\nI have visited museums (such as the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, LACMA, SF MOMA and others), galleries (18th Street Arts Center and a few independent ones), lakes, gone pedal boating, gone to the beach, library, bookstores (which are a go-to because you can find anything in them of just about any topic and be inspired), downtowns and so much else. I call it an adventure each week, because I try to make it an expedition where I leave the campus or home for a couple hours \u2014 and when I try to plan it like that, it forces me to get creative, especially when I am on a budget without access to a car.\n\nIn terms of planning artist dates, I use websites such as Funcheap, Eventbrite, L.A. Times, S.F. Chronicle and TimeOut to find events, and I use Reddit, Discover Los Angeles, L.A. Times and Cond\u00e9 Nast to discover evergreen monuments or places to visit. There is always something you can find or come up with to treat your inner artist every week.\n\nArtist dates have given me a light in my life, and I started playing guitar, pursued my love for painting, developed my own library of books, saw a psychic, learned how to be alone and really got to explore parts of Los Angeles that I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise during my college experience. They have made me comfortable and happy being with myself and showed me how much more there is to life than what I knew before.\n\nNo matter what it looks like, I highly recommend artist dates and seeing where they lead you. They\u2019ll become your own ritual, your own \u201cthing,\u201d something you make entirely for yourself, which feels so good and soul-fulfilling I don\u2019t think mere words can describe them!\n```"}

Yates III held 26 offers by the end of his high school career, most notably from the likes of Baylor, Gonzaga, and Houston. Yate III\u2019s enormous potential at the guard position provides even more depth for the Trojan\u2019s 2024 campaign.\n\nKevin Patton Jr.: Guard\nPrevious School: University of San Diego\nClass for 2024: Sophomore\nOn3 ranking: Four star (three star out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Four star (three star out of high school)\nCommitted: May 20\n\nKazliner: Patton Jr. stood out as a top young player for the University of San Diego, striking the attention of Torero alum Eric Musselman. Patton Jr. received the 13th and final men\u2019s basketball scholarship, effectively completing USC\u2019s overhauled roster. The Temecula native made the All-West Coast Conference Freshman Team and earned WCC Freshman of the Week four times in 2023-24. On top of averaging 9.8 points, 2.4 assists, and 4.1 rebounds per game, his defense is what piqued nationwide interest in the 6-foot-8 guard. Patton Jr. registered 1.3 blocks and 1.3 steals per game, including a defensive masterclass against Navy where he denied five shots. Patton Jr. has a knack for getting to the rim with ease and scoring inside. This was on display in his best performance of the season against Santa Clara University in the WCC Tournament, where he posted a season-high 19 points on 8-of-12 shooting with four assists. He started in only half of USD\u2019s games last season, so he\u2019ll look for an elevated role on a Trojan team seeking stardom.\n\nDesmond Claude: Guard\nPrevious school: Xavier\nClass for 2024: Junior\nOn3 Ranking: Four star (four star out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Four star (four star out of high school)\nCommitted: May 2\n\nHallinan: After an April full of mid-major commitments, Musselman added another Power Six player to his squad in former Xavier Musketeer Desmond Claude. The No. 32 overall player in 247Sports\u2019 transfer portal rankings, Claude won the Big East\u2019s Most Improved Player award in 2023-24, where he went from scoring 4.7 points per game as a freshman to averaging 16.6 as a sophomore. Standing 6-foot-6 as a guard, Claude cited Musselman\u2019s ability to develop big guards as a key reason why he committed to USC. Claude is prone to the occasional explosive scoring night, posting five outings of 25-plus points last season, including a 36-point display at Georgetown in which he earned 13 free throws and only took one 3-pointer. However, Claude has shot below 50% from the field and under 30% from deep in his collegiate career, suggesting his shooting touch has considerable room to improve.\n\nTerrance Williams II: Forward\nPrevious school: Michigan\nExpected class for 2024-25 season: Graduate\nOn3 ranking: Three star (N/A out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: N/A (four star out of high school)\nCommitted: April 30\n\nJohnson: Williams II joins the ranks of forwards to commit to Musselman and USC, but the Michigan transfer is the first to come directly from a Power Six school. The 6-foot-7 veteran improved every year he was with the Wolverines and had his biggest jump during the most recent campaign. Despite only putting up 6.1 points per game in the 2022-23 season, he averaged 12.4 points this past year. The Maryland native has a strong 3-point shot, knocking home 39.7% of his attempts from range, which was best among Michigan\u2019s regular starters this past season. Williams II also had a penchant for making it to the free-throw line and would have led USC this past season in free-throw percentage for players who put up more than 25 attempts.\n\nChibuzo Agbo: Guard\nPrevious school: Boise State\nExpected class for 2024-25 season: Graduate\nOn3 ranking: Four star (N/A out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Four star (four star out of high school)\nCommitted: April 22\n\nHolton: The Southern California native is the only current Trojan transfer who has played at the Power Six conference level \u2014 though it was in limited minutes \u2014 as he started out his career with Texas Tech. Agbo also has NCAA Tournament experience that few of USC\u2019s current roster has. Agbo broke out when he transferred to Boise State, becoming a crucial piece of their team which made the NCAA Tournament two years in a row. The 6-foot-7 guard \u2014 abnormally tall for his position \u2014 averaged a career-high 13.7 points and 5.1 rebounds a game, while shooting 45% from the field and 40% from three. His offensive game is primarily catch and shoot from outside the arc, where he is lights out as a spot-up shooter. Agbo\u2019s long arms not only help his 3-point ability, but it makes him a difficult defender to get around. His defensive stats don\u2019t pop off the charts, but the film shows that of a versatile and athletic defender, something the Trojans desperately need for next season.\n\nRashaun Agee: Forward\nPrevious School: Bowling Green\nExpected class for 2024-25 season: Graduate\nOn3 ranking: Four star (N/A out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Three star (N/A out of high school)\nCommitted: April 22\n\nKazliner: USC struggled to court a consistent post scorer last season, so Agee\u2019s high-scoring 2023-24 campaign stood out to Musselman and company, who brought in the journeyman. The 6-foot-8 forward started his career at New Mexico State, went to junior college, and then played two seasons at Bowling Green, where he averaged a near double-double with 13.3 points and 9.9 rebounds per game during his senior season. Named the No. 252 transfer prospect by 247Sports, he also shot an efficient 57.0% from the field and will join a Trojans team that lost a hefty amount of size this offseason with the departures of multiple forwards.\n\nSaint Thomas: Forward\nPrevious school: Northern Colorado\nExpected class for 2024-25 season: Senior\nOn3 ranking: Four star (N/A out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Four star (three star out of high school)\nCommitted: April 21\n\nHolton: After two lackluster seasons at Loyola Chicago, Thomas chose to take his talents to the Big Sky Conference where he averaged a near 20-point double-double in this past season with the Bears, earning him Big Sky newcomer of the year, as well as First Team All-Big Sky honors. Thomas shot a very efficient 47.0% from the field on nearly 15 shots a game. For his size \u2014 standing at 6-foot-7 \u2014 Thomas rebounded impeccably this past year. His 9.8 rebounds per contest ranked No. 22 in the country. His offensive game primarily consists of driving to the basket and creating contact to get to the free-throw line. Thomas doesn\u2019t waste his opportunities at the stripe either, as he shot 87.0% from the line last season \u2014 a skill USC couldn\u2019t seem to master this past year. Thomas\u2019 experienced, high-level scoring and rebounding will be key to USC\u2019s success in Musselman\u2019s inaugural year.\n\nMatt Knowling: Forward\nPrevious school: Yale\nExpected class for 2024: Graduate\nOn3 ranking: Three star (N/A out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: N/A (three star out of high school)\nCommitted: April 20\n\nHallinan: Knowling\u2019s commitment came in the flurry of weekend transfer pledges rounding out USC\u2019s roster alongside three other portal players. The former Yale Bulldog is listed as a power forward but stands at 6-foot-6 and weighs 200 pounds \u2014 slightly undersized to be a dominant inside threat. Yet, he had enough size to be effective in the Ivy League, posting 11.6 points per game as a senior, making 56.7% of his field goal attempts. Knowling doesn\u2019t have a reliable 3-point shot and his 62.8% rate from the free-throw line in his college career suggests that his shooting touch is limited, but Musselman probably expects Knowling to offer high-effort minutes off the bench. Knowling also brings notable March Madness experience to Galen Center, having played in Yale\u2019s upset over No. 4 seed Auburn in the 2024 tournament.\n\nBryce Pope: Guard\nPrevious School: UC San Diego\nExpected class for 2024-25 season: Graduate\nOn3 ranking: Four star (N/A out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Three star (N/A out of high school)\nCommitted: April 19\n\nKazliner: The Trojans essentially lost their entire backcourt from last season, so bringing in Pope, a tried and true shooting guard makes sense. The 6-foot-3 San Diego native has averaged over 18 points the past two seasons and is a pure scorer, which has cemented him as one of the best Tritons of all time with the fourth most points in school history. Pope was ranked as the No. 237 transfer by 247Sports and had offers from winning programs like NC State, Texas, and others. Pope shot 33.2% from beyond the arc and 41.8% from the floor last season.\n\nClark Slajchert: Guard\nPrevious School: University of Pennsylvania\nExpected class for 2024-25 season: Graduate\nOn3 ranking: Three star (N/A out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Three star (N/A out of high school)\nCommitted: April 10\n\nKazliner: Slajchert, a Los Angeles native, returns home following an elite senior campaign at Pennsylvania where he averaged 18 points per game. The 6-foot-1 guard shot 42.2% from deep and 48.7% from the field last season, leading the Quakers in both categories. Slajchert was placed at No. 152 in 247Sports\u2019 transfer rankings and will join a depleted USC backcourt. He can score at all three levels and will aim to be the Trojans\u2019 reliable 3-point option next year. Guards Boogie Ellis and Oziyah Sellers were the team\u2019s most reliable deep sharpshooters last season, but both have since departed. Slajchert will ultimately go down as a top Penn player, as he was just the 43rd Quaker to eclipse 1,000 points.\n\nJosh Cohen: Forward\nPrevious school: UMass\nExpected class for 2024: Graduate\nOn3 ranking: Four star (N/A out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Four star (N/A out of high school)\nCommitted: April 3\n\nHallinan: Cohen was the first transfer to commit to USC following Musselman\u2019s move, as he was also committed to Arkansas briefly before Musselman\u2019s departure from Fayetteville. After Joshua Morgan\u2019s eligibility expired and Vincent Iwuchukwu entered the transfer portal, Cohen will add some much-needed size to USC\u2019s roster at 6-foot-10 and 220 pounds. As a fifth-year senior at UMass, Cohen averaged 15.9 points and 6.8 rebounds per game, including 2.5 offensive rebounds per outing. The New Jersey native even started taking threes in the 2023-24 season, attempting one per game and hitting them at a 34.4% rate. Perhaps he\u2019ll advance as a floor-stretching big in the 2024-25 season.\n\nHigh School Recruits\nJalen Shelley: Forward\nHigh school (Location): Link Academy (Branson, Missouri)\nOn3 ranking: Four star (No. 59 in national industry rankings)\n247Sports ranking: Four star (No. 59 in national composite rankings)\nCommitted: April 26\n\nShelley became the second former Razorbacks commit to follow Musselman to L.A. on Friday, giving the Trojans another potential force on the wing and in the front court. Standing at 6-foot-8, 247\u2032s Brandon Jenkins describes Shelley as mostly a transitional threat on offense with his fluid athleticism and desire to attack the rim. If he brings reliable effort on defense, Shelley has the prototypical size to become a force on both ends of the floor.\n\nIsaiah Elohim: Guard\nHigh school (Location): Sierra Canyon (Chatsworth, California)\nOn3 ranking: Four star (No. 46 in national industry rankings)\n247Sports ranking: Four star (No. 47 in national composite rankings)\nCommitted: April 22\n\nHallinan: Ultimately, it made too much sense to not happen. Elohim, a Chatsworth, California native, committed to Musselman when the Trojans\u2019 new head coach was at Arkansas and ultimately decided to follow him to South Central. Elohim played high school ball at Sierra Canyon and averaged 12.8 points and 5.6 rebounds per game in his senior season. As the No. 47 recruit in the nation, the 6-foot-5 guard/forward has the pedigree to play a major role for USC next season, but will need to establish himself in a rotation full of mid-major veterans. At Sierra Canyon, Elohim was teammates with Bronny James, who was a freshman guard for the Trojans this past season before entering the transfer portal.\n```"}

Behind the scenes, it was a different story. At universities across Idaho, university attorneys sent memos advising faculty to be careful about how they spoke about abortion in the classroom. The University of Idaho\u2019s memo leaked to the press, setting off a media frenzy.\n\nThe memos were in reaction to Idaho\u2019s 2021 No Public Funds for Abortion Act, which prohibits the use of public funds to \u201cpromote\u201d or \u201ccounsel in favor of abortion.\u201d Public universities like Boise State use public funds for professor salaries.\n\nTaylor Wilson, who graduated from Boise State in 2023 with a degree in political science, said that students at Boise State were kept in the dark about how the No Public Funds Act would affect their education. \u201cHonestly, a lot of it is still confusing to me,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nThe penalty for breaking the law is steep \u2014 up to 14 years in prison \u2014 and it was unclear to what extent it affected academic speech, if at all, said Andrew Beck, a lawyer with the ACLU. Either way, professors did not want to take the risk.\n\nTwo Idaho teachers\u2019 unions and six professors across Idaho state universities along with the ACLU are suing the state for violating the First Amendment and being unconstitutionally vague. Post Roe v. Wade, Idaho lawmakers are not only challenging access to abortion, but in the case of No Public Funds, attempting to legislate the public discourse surrounding the procedure.\n\nAbortion was largely restricted in Idaho after August 2022, changing the landscape of reproductive rights within the state. Idaho\u2019s 2021 No Public Funds for Abortion law has created confusion in academia on whether or not discussions about abortion in the classroom are protected.\n\nThe law initially didn\u2019t attract attention from universities, said Martin Orr, a sociology professor at Boise State University and the president of the Idaho Federation of Teachers. That changed after the university attorneys\u2019 memo. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t clear the extent to which this affected faculty, what we say in the classroom, or the way we conduct research or how we report findings,\u201d Orr said.\n\nHe joined the suit as the president of the teachers\u2019 federation. Beck, who is currently litigating the case, said that professors fear normal lessons that touch on abortion could be \u201cconstrued as promoting or counseling in favor of abortion.\u201d\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, professors have changed their courses to avoid speaking about abortion in any capacity. Medical ethics classes have barred any discussion of the topic. Vox articles about feminism have been purged from mass media classes. Roe v. Wade goes unmentioned.\n\n\u201cThe anti-abortion movement has been sort of a central feature of American politics for decades. How do you not talk about that?\u201d Orr said. \u201cThey\u2019re lying.\u201d\n\nTo Blaine Conzatti, the lawsuit is nothing more than \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d Conzatti, who co-authored No Public Funds, is also the president of the Idaho Family Policy Center, which he calls a \u201cpublic policy think tank that works to advance the lordship of Jesus Christ in the public square.\u201d\n\nNo Public Funds is not the first law Conzatti has championed, nor is it his first tangle with the ACLU. He\u2019s helped pass four Idaho laws since 2020. One law he shored up support for, banning transgender women from competing on women\u2019s student sports teams, also faces an ACLU lawsuit.\n\nConzatti dismisses the ACLU\u2019s argument that No Public Funds is a free speech issue. He said that neutral discussion of abortion is allowed under No Public Funds, and professors are \u201clying\u201d when they say all in-classroom speech about abortion has been affected.\n\nIn the University of Idaho\u2019s leaked memo, the university\u2019s general counsel said that professors can have classroom discussions on abortion depending on if it is relevant to the class subject and \u201cinstructor neutrality.\u201d Conzatti agreed with the universities\u2019 legal counsel\u2019s interpretation of the law.\n\n\u201cStudents at colleges and universities deserve the best education they can get, and these professors are preventing them from receiving that education without any legal justification whatsoever,\u201d Conzatti said.\n\nAnd do you have any examples of what would constitute as advocating for abortion in the classroom or anywhere where you\u2019ve seen this happen?\n\nConzatti: Sure, if a professor were to stand up in the front of the classroom, and denounce conservatives for being pro-life, if a conservative... or if a professor were to stand up in front of a classroom and, you know, decry the Dobbs decision that came out two years ago and say that their personal belief is that it hinders a woman\u2019s right to choose and every woman should always have the right to choose.\n\nIf they\u2019re reading literature, and it discusses an uncomfortable rape scene or something like that, and the professor says, you know, I believe in this instance, the woman should have a right to get an abortion... Those are the types of examples, right, where the professor moves from remaining neutral on the topic to personally advocating a specific position.\n\nIn your mind, would it be okay for a professor to express the personal opinion of supporting the Dobbs decision?\n\nConzatti: Absolutely, yeah, yep. The law only prevents taxpayer dollars from being used to advocate abortion. It doesn\u2019t prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to advocate a position that respects the legal rights of preborn children.\n\n\u201cIn the same way that a professor shouldn\u2019t be advocating murder, a professor shouldn\u2019t be advocating theft, etcetera, while within the scope of their employment, these professors shouldn\u2019t be advocating for an activity that\u2019s recognized as a crime,\u201d Conzatti said.\n\nAn amendment explicitly excluding academic speech from No Public Funds died. Conzatti said he does not regret its exclusion because it was \u201centirely unnecessary,\u201d stating that \u201cthe text of the law is really clear.\u201d\n\nA culture of fear and silence\n\nBeck said that No Public Funds created \u201cmass confusion and panic\u201d on how it related to academia, or if it even related to academia at all. But with professors choosing to play it safe, the effect has been felt all the same.\n\nThe lack of clarity on the law created a culture of fear and silence on campus. Wilson said she never knew exactly what was allowed to be said in class. If a discussion about abortion naturally arose in one of her classes, the professor would steer the conversation in a different direction.\n\n\u201cThey were more wary,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvisement from the general counsel at the University of Idaho about what is not allowed under Idaho\u2019s No Public Funds for Abortion Act.\n\nEven though Boise State administration communicated to faculty to exercise caution when talking about abortion, Wilson said that professors never brought up the law or its implications in class. Outside of political circles on campus, most students probably didn\u2019t know what the law was, according to some Boise State students.\n\nWilson said she later spoke to a professor privately who expressed their disappointment at the law but felt that their hands were tied. Wilson got the sentiment that the law was not popular, even among conservative students. She said she spoke to one pro-life student who thought the law was against the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cEven though he doesn\u2019t personally agree with abortion, that\u2019s a whole other level, stopping people from talking about it,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nMaddy Horak, a senior studying political science at Boise State, said discussion about abortion is almost entirely driven by students, and professors will rarely bring up abortion of their own volition. Will Farkas, a junior studying communications and minoring in political science, noticed the same.\n\nStudents can still choose to write essays about abortion or bring it up in class, he said, but it is not prompted or encouraged by professors.\n\n\u201cYou could just feel the tension in the air where it\u2019s like, who\u2019s gonna say what about it?\u201d Horak said.\n\nLast fall, Horak took a class about women\u2019s legal rights where abortion was explicitly discussed in the context of whether abortion was covered by medical insurance and a protected reason to take off of work. Horak said the discussion was \u201ctechnical and directly applicable\u201d to the class, and did not veer into debate.\n\n\u201cI just noticed the conversation about it is just less as a whole. Where it seems like it would come up, it doesn\u2019t. Where it seems like there would be extended conversation on the topic, there isn\u2019t,\u201d Horak said.\n\nThe Young Democrats\u2019 \u201cvigilante system\u201d\n\nThe effects were also felt beyond the classroom. From fall 2022 to spring 2023, Wilson was the president of Boise State\u2019s chapter of Young Democrats. After No Public Funds was passed, certain aspects of the club were forced to go underground.\n\nThey could not partner with abortion advocacy groups like Idaho Abortion Rights or distribute the emergency contraceptive pill Plan B. The club receives limited money from the university, Wilson and current Young Democrats president Farkas said, which means they can fall under No Public Funds\u2019 jurisdiction.\n\nAccepting university funds also means that they can have access to university resources, like participating in club fairs and being on the events calendar, which is essential for member recruitment. Beyond the financial aspect, Farkas said he is more concerned about Boise State\u2019s politically diverse culture, and is careful about not alienating the university\u2019s administration or student body so the club can keep growing.\n\n\u201cWe know the school wouldn\u2019t be happy with tons of abortion activism or rhetoric from a school club,\u201d Farkas said.\n\nWilson said Idaho\u2019s abortion ban, which coincided with No Public Funds in August 2022, sparked more of a focus on abortion within the Young Democrats than in past years. Beyond reproductive access, the club also registers people to vote, participates in advocacy work and mobilizes people for protests.\n\nPost No Public Funds, the Young Democrats still helped people get abortions and distributed Plan B, but did so on an individual basis rather than as a club. Instead, an appointed safe person talked amongst club members to distribute Plan B or help people cross state lines to get abortions.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of our club ceasing to exist, were, in my mind, potentially greater than playing their game,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nPart of the problem was that the game wasn\u2019t clear. Wilson stayed in communication with university staff during her time as president, who were \u201ctrying to help me play it safe,\u201d she said, so the club didn\u2019t get shut down.\n\n\u201cThe most frustrating part is we\u2019re getting half-assed guidance, because they don\u2019t know what the rules are either. Nobody knows what exactly the rules are, but the university doesn\u2019t want to lose funding and the clubs don\u2019t want to lose funding,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nIn No Public Funds\u2019 second year, the Young Democrats have become less interested in appeasing the university. Farkas said that he never received any guidance from the university about what the club could and could not do, but unlike Wilson, he never asked them to clarify.\n\nWhile the club still is cautious about publicly discussing abortion, they have created a \u201cvigilante system\u201d to distribute Plan B, Horak said. After the No Public Funds Law, Plan B was removed from the student health center.\n\nConzatti said removing emergency contraception from publicly funded health clinics, like student health centers, was the driving force behind the law. Now, the Young Democrats receive Plan B from Idaho Abortion Rights.\n\nPeople can anonymously text a Google Voice number and club members will deliver them the pill. The club is looking to expand their Plan B network by implementing safe people in sororities and fraternities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re planting these resources in places and letting them find people,\u201d Horak said.\n\nAn uncertain future\n\nAs the second academic year of the No Public Funds law comes to an end, the fight in court against the law is just beginning. A ruling in favor of the ACLU would simply exclude academic speech from the law, not throw it out entirely.\n\nThe path forward for the lawsuit is not necessarily clear. Before filing the lawsuit, the ACLU asked Idaho prosecutors multiple times if professors could be prosecuted under No Public Funds and received no response, Beck said.\n\nOnly after the suit was filed did the Idaho Attorney General, Ra\u00fal Labrador, write in a legal opinion that the ACLU\u2019s lawsuit was unnecessary because the law did not cover academic speech. Nobody has been prosecuted for violating the law.\n\nThat opinion further complicates the case, Beck said, because a simple opinion from the attorney general does not create law. A future attorney general could choose to enforce it.\n\nNow the courts can throw out the case because \u201cthere\u2019s no longer any real fight,\u201d Beck said, and leave how the No Public Funds for Abortion Act relates to freedom of speech undefined forever.\n\n\u201cI think [Labrador] really did it in order to get out from under this lawsuit. So you can call that politics or you can call that sort of legal maneuvering,\u201d Beck said.\n\nTo Democratic students at Boise State, the fight over No Public Funds is business as usual.\n\n\u201cA very common theme with Idaho laws is that they just push stuff through and no one knows what the hell is happening,\u201d Farkas said. \u201cThey know it\u2019s really vague.\u201d\n\nTo Wilson, who navigated the first year of No Public Funds, the law was a \u201cstressor,\u201d she said, but not unusual in Idaho.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to live here,\u201d she said.\n\nWilson started her own company managing campaigns to try and flip some Idaho state seats blue. She said that \u201cdespite attempts at censorship,\u201d she is hopeful because there are thousands of people in Idaho fighting for reproductive rights.\n\n\u201cWhat else can we do?\u201d\n```"}

Forward Cameron Brink, posting her first career double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds, was a linchpin of Friday night\u2019s success. Her assertive play\u2014wildly crashing the boards and altering shots with two blocks\u2014demonstrated her fiery spirit. Her performance was crucial in leading the Los Angeles Sparks (3-7) to an 81-72 victory over the Dallas Wings (3-6) at Crypto.com Arena on Friday night, a performance that surely made fans proud.\n\n\u201cThe team, after the Minnesota game, responded with a bunch of individual and team pride,\u201d said head coach Curt Miller in the postgame press conference. \u201cBig credit to our players staying in attack mode and our post players to keep battling against a very strong physical team.\u201d\n\nBrink\u2019s career game included a  buzzer-beating layup  before halftime that electrified the crowd, showcasing her ability to inspire and lead. The Sparks\u2019 bench was equally pivotal, collectively contributing 34 points. Guard Lexie Brown, leading the second unit, scored 16 points and displayed her sharpshooting ability by knocking down four 3-pointers. The defensive intensity and scoring prowess of center Li Yueru and guard Aari McDonald kept Los Angeles afloat when the starters struggled.\n\n\u201cThe bench was huge, not only did they score, but they gave us energy,\u201d said Miller.\n\nDefensively, the Sparks set the tone early with aggression and tenacity, holding the Wings to 2-for-17 from beyond the arc. LA\u2019s active hands in the passing lanes resulted in nine steals, showcasing a proactive defense rather than a reactive one.\n\nOffensively, the Sparks seemingly transformed from their rough shooting night against the Minnesota Lynx on June 5. With 23 total assists against Dallas, Los Angeles\u2019 ball movement was fluid, leading to a 47% shooting night from the field. Instead of forcing ill-advised shots, the Sparks made extra passes, creating an offensive rhythm that was missing from previous games.\n\nThe team will aim to replicate this aggressive energy heading into the next matchup, against the reigning WNBA champion Las Vegas Aces (5-3).

Sparks forward Dearica Hamby tried her best to match Collier\u2019s effort and put the team on her shoulders with her 17 points and 11 rebounds; however, Hamby\u2019s effort was overshadowed by her team\u2019s 26% field goal shooting. Following Wednesday night\u2019s loss, the Sparks are on a three-game losing skid. The team\u2019s inability to move the ball is a glaring issue the Sparks have dealt with all season. With only 15 team assists Wednesday night and a league second-worst 18.6 per game, the Sparks must find a true point guard to run their offense. The Lynx\u2019s physicality frustrated the Sparks, especially rookie center Cameron Brink. Brink\u2019s foul trouble struggles continued against the Lynx, as she fouled out in the fourth quarter. This is Brinks\u2019 fifth game this season giving five or more fouls. \u201cAs much as the physicality is being allowed in this league, we\u2019ve got to make the adjustment,\u201d head coach Curt Miller said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be able to handle the physicality.\u201d Minnesota\u2019s strategic and free-flowing offense provided the synergy the Sparks could not replicate. Setting off ball screens and making backdoor cuts, the Lynx\u2019s movement created 30 paint points\u2014a critical factor in their victory. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s impressive with Minnesota right now is their tempo. They\u2019re just flying in and out of actions,\u201d Miller said. While the Sparks need to play with more muscle going forward, the team found a way to win the rebound battle against the Lynx. The Sparks grabbed a season-high 40 rebounds to the Lynx\u2019s 37. \u201cThey\u2019re disappointed but not discouraged. They believe these things can be corrected, but they\u2019ve got to throw the first punch,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to eliminate the slow first quarters.\u201d Next, the Sparks will host the Dallas Wings (3-5) on Friday at 7 p.m.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/06/05/stanley-cup-finals-the-keys-to-winning-the-series/", "response": "```\nThe Stanley Cup Finals is officially set as the Edmonton Oilers will face the Florida Panthers to decide who will bring home the best trophy in sports. The teams had two lopsided battles earlier this season, with the Panthers coming out on top in both matchups. Florida cruised to a 5-3 victory in mid-November and earned a 5-1 victory in Edmonton a few weeks later. Those early season losses might\u2019ve spelled doom for Edmonton, but the Oilers are a completely different team now than the one the Panthers saw originally.\n\nEdmonton started the season 2-9-1, including an 8-1 loss in their opening game against the Vancouver Canucks. After their second loss to the Panthers, the Oilers went on an absolute tear. They won 16 straight games, falling one short of the NHL record set by the Penguins in the 1992-93 season. This was partially thanks to a coaching change, which saw Kris Knoblauch turn things around and help his team finish 46-18-5. Edmonton had a 49-27-6 regular season record and was able to grab second place in the Pacific Division.\n\nFlorida was much more consistent than Edmonton thanks to its superior goaltending. The pair of starter Sergei Bobrovsky and backup Anthony Stolarz share the fewest goals against this year alongside the duo of Connor Hellebuyck and Laurent Brossoit in Winnipeg. Bobrovsky has been nominated as a finalist for what would be his third Vezina Trophy and is looking to win his first-ever Stanley Cup after 14 seasons in the league.\n\nBoth teams\u2019 regular seasons were successful for different reasons, but their postseasons have featured similar storylines. They both use speed to their advantage and rely on solid goaltending for any mistakes that were made in the process. Based on both teams\u2019 postseason strengths and weaknesses thus far, there are a handful of areas where they each must succeed in order to hoist the coveted Stanley Cup.\n\nKeys for Edmonton: Using speed to their advantage\n\nThere is no doubt that this will be one of the fastest playoff series that we have seen. The Oilers have been a fast team for years now, with Connor McDavid leading the charge. He has achieved a speed of over 24 miles per hour or faster for the past three years now and leads the playoffs for most 20 mph+ bursts. Behind him on this list of speedsters are teammates Ryan McLeod (3rd), Leon Draisaitl (5th) and Dylan Holloway (7th). With so many players who are used to playing an extremely fast-paced game, it will be imperative for the Oilers to focus on sustaining the speed of play in order to overwhelm the Panthers.\n\nGet on the power play\n\nThe Oilers have been dominant this postseason with a man advantage, sitting at a 37.3% success rate on the power play thus far. The dangerous five-man combination of Zach Hyman, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Draisaitl, Evan Bouchard and McDavid have combined for 19 power play goals over the 18 playoff games they have been in. The Oilers\u2019 power play is the only slow aspect of their game, as they methodically survey the opposing defense before seeking opportunities for backside passes.\n\nKeep goaltender Skinner in the game\n\nStuart Skinner is the wild card for this series. He has let up an average of 2.50 goals with a .897 save percentage in the playoffs so far. He\u2019s had some shaky moments, but it was occasions like Game 6 against Dallas, when he stopped 33 of the 34 shots from one of the league\u2019s top offenses, that prove how capable he really is.\n\nKeys for Florida: Using the goaltending advantage effectively\n\nBobrovsky is one of the top goaltenders in the NHL and helped carry his team to another Stanley Cup Final. Bobrovsky is a veteran goaltender who has played 87 playoff games in his career. With a .915 save percentage and a 2.37 goals against average this season, it was no surprise that he was voted as a finalist for yet another Vezina trophy. The way Florida could utilize him best is to take more risks in the neutral zone. As a veteran, he is much more aware of odd-man situations than other goaltenders are. By pinching the neutral zone, the Panthers will be able to force more turnovers, while maintaining a low risk of being scored on due to the netminder behind them.\n\nEliminate penalties\n\nThe Oilers are deadly on the power play. Even though the Panthers have the second-best penalty kill in the playoffs at 88.2%, it would be a disaster to give up their average of four penalties per game. The Oilers draw penalties easily due to their overwhelming speed. The Panthers have to make sure to keep their feet moving at all times or else they will be vulnerable to penalties that will lead to multiple goals over the course of the series.\n\nBe physical\n\nThe only way that the speed of Edmonton can be slowed is by playing the body. The Eastern Conference has many hard-hitting teams\u2014the Panthers being one of them. Averaging 43 hits per game throughout the playoffs, the Panthers need to establish their physicality early in Game 1 to set the tone for the series. As was shown against the Rangers, the Panthers can be speedy at times, but cannot rely on that against Edmonton. A more aggressive and physically focused game will help Florida counteract the Oilers\u2019 speed advantage.\n\nPrediction: The Oilers\u2019 speed will be what pushes them past the Panthers and allow them to raise their first Stanley Cup since 1990. Edmonton\u2019s offense will be too much for Bobrovsky to handle and the Panthers\u2019 physicality will not be enough to make up for their speed disadvantage. If the Oilers come out on top, it will almost certainly mean that McDavid will take home the Conn Smythe Trophy for most valuable player during the postseason.\n```"}

(AP/Abbie Parr)\n\nBy Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as June 05, 2024 at 7:23 pm PDT\n\nThis season, the Dallas Mavericks championship run has been more than just a testament to their talent. It\u2019s a narrative of growth, highlighted by the exceptional development of two of their newcomers, Dereck Lively II and Daniel Gafford.\n\nEntering this season, the Mavericks had a chip on their shoulder. Last year\u2019s campaign ended without a playoff appearance, despite bringing in former NBA champion and eight-time All-Star guard Kyrie Irving to pair with point guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107. Irving and Don\u010di\u0107 had all the tools to make a late-season playoff push, but integrating a new star into the system midseason isn\u2019t an easy task and the adjustment period saw the team struggle to find its rhythm.\n\nIn the 20 games Irving played for the Mavericks last season, the team posted an 8-12 record, finishing in 11th place in the Western Conference. It wasn\u2019t for a lack of skill\u2014the backcourt duo of Irving and Don\u010di\u0107 was as potent as any in the league\u2014but the Mavericks desperately needed a defensive anchor, a presence in the paint to complement their offensive firepower.\n\nEnter Lively II. The silver lining of the Mavericks missing the playoffs was the opportunity to select within the NBA draft lottery. With the No. 12 overall selection, they eyed the 7-foot-1 center from Duke. Lively instantly brought size and verticality, providing defensive stability.\n\nFrom the onset, expectations for Lively II were tempered. His 5.2 points per game at Duke left much to be desired offensively. However, his selection to the All-ACC Defensive Team during his freshman year showcased his potential on the defensive end, where the Mavericks hoped he could make an immediate impact.\n\n\u201cYou could see the future of him being an anchor on the defensive side,\u201d Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd said in an interview posted June 3rd. \u201cThe future just happened to come a lot faster.\u201d\n\nThe Mavericks were confident enough in Lively II\u2019s skills to name him the day one starter at center. In the early stretch of the season, Lively II\u2019s confidence kept building as Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving began to trust the rookie more. Lively II gained the trust of his teammates through his ability to aggressively get to the rim, catch lobs and provide his presence in the heart of the Mavericks\u2019 defense.\n\nHowever, the Mavericks weren\u2019t done improving the frontcourt, so they added Washington Wizards center Daniel Gafford and Charlotte Hornets forward P.J. Washington at the midseason trade deadline. The Mavericks instantly felt Gafford\u2019s impact as a lob threat, giving Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving another option in the pick-and-roll.\n\nWith the addition of Gafford, Lively II\u2019s role as a starter regressed, but the relationship between the two only blossomed. \u201cWe have a great one-and-two dynamic of picking each other up no matter what\u2019s going on,\u201d Lively II said in an interview posted June 3rd. \u201cI look at him as an older brother.\u201d\n\nGafford wrapped up the season as the full-time starter over Lively II, but their bond only deepened as the postseason commenced. Every time one of them steps onto the court, the other chimes in with, \u201cBe a monster.\u201d This simple mantra fuels their fiery play style, attacking the rim with ferocity and finishing with force.\n\nBut where they truly shine is in the pick-and-roll offense. Throughout the playoffs, the Mavericks leaned heavily on the pick-and-roll, boasting a 19% usage rate, placing them in the NBA\u2019s top five. This strategy became a lethal weapon, leveraging Don\u010di\u0107's keen vision and scoring knack with Lively II and Gafford\u2019s relentless rim-running.\n\nLively II has been a revelation in these sets, connecting on 70.8% of his field goal attempts, ranking him second among all roll men in the postseason, and averaging a formidable 1.26 points per possession.\n\nMavericks Luka Doncic's IQ excels in the pick-and-roll game. Doncic's patience and body control with the ball force defenders to pick their poison. On two plays with the same set, the combination of Doncic and Dereck Lively is on full display.\n\nYet, the pick-and-roll brilliance has extended beyond just Lively II and Gafford. It transformed Washington and Derrick Jones Jr. into deadly 3-point threats from the corners. Benefiting from Don\u010di\u0107's sharp passing off screens, both players saw a significant uptick in their postseason shooting. Washington\u2019s 3-point percentage climbed to 36.2% from 32.0% in the regular season, while Jones Jr. rose to 39.6% from 34.3%.\n\n\u201cBeing able to have both of us setting screens, catching lobs, throwing elbows, and catching rebounds makes our teammates trust us,\u201d Lively said.\n\nThe Mavericks\u2019 postseason journey has been a masterclass in chemistry and collaboration, particularly between their guards and centers. Lively II and Gafford have set 59% of the ball screens for Don\u010di\u0107, creating a dynamic offensive rhythm. This synergy has translated into a remarkable statistic: Don\u010di\u0107 has racked up 49 assists on dunks, the highest in an NBA postseason since 1997.\n\nThe vertical prowess of Lively II and Gafford, combined with Don\u010di\u0107's playmaking, has carved a path of dominance, painting a picture of basketball\u2019s artistry and precision.\n\n\u201cIt came naturally at the end of the day. We are two big targets for those guys\u2014Kyrie and Luka\u2014coming downhill,\u201d Gafford said postgame on May 26th. \u201cIt\u2019s always automatic, as long as we get the [opponents] big to help and make a decision.\u201d\n\nThe Mavericks capitalized on the Minnesota Timberwolves\u2019 drop coverage during the Western Conference finals. With the Timberwolves failing to apply immediate on-ball pressure after the screen, Don\u010di\u0107 had the luxury of choice. Lively II flourished, going a perfect 16-for-16 from the field and amassing 38 points and 31 rebounds across four games.\n\nDallas Maverick rookie center Dereck Livley has had himself quite the postseason debut so far. Right before exiting game three of WCF with an injury, Lively had one of his best sequences from the postseason, scoring six points in one minute.\n\nHowever, their mission to win the NBA Finals must still be fulfilled as the Boston Celtics loom\u2014the final hurdle on the path to the Mavericks\u2019 first Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy since 2011. Compared to others, the Celtics rarely blitz, employing the tactic only 1% of the time this postseason. This decision could prove costly.\n\nThe Mavericks aim to exploit 38-year-old center Al Horford, with Don\u010di\u0107 thriving against switches, averaging 1.23 points per possession this postseason. But the Celtics possess capable defenders\u2014guard Jrue Holiday, guard Derrick White, guard Jaylen Brown and forward Jayson Tatum\u2014ready to apply on-ball pressure.\n\nDuring the regular season, the Celtics defeated the Mavericks twice. Boston\u2019s variety of skillful defenders only makes Lively II and Gafford\u2019s roles more pivotal. Their ability to adjust the roll and offer a reliable option at the elbow for Doncic or Irving will be crucial. Patience with the ball, whether kicking out to shooters or attacking the rim, will alleviate the burden on Don\u010di\u0107's shoulders.\n\nFor Lively II, though, the end goal transcends stats: it\u2019s about being the last team standing. \u201cI am here to win games. I am not here to care about how many points I put on the board,\u201d Lively II said. \u201cGafford is the same way.\u201d\n```"}

There were 19 different high school players who signed to play for USC during the Early Signing Period, but the best way to quickly rebuild a roster these days is through the transfer portal. So far, USC has lost more players than they have brought in, but the Trojans have some momentum building as they look to compete in the Big Ten conference next season.\n\nFollow along with Annenberg Media\u2019s live tracker of everyone who has transferred in and out of USC.\n\nUSC\u2019s Transfer Portal rankings, as of June 1\n\nOn3 (Factors transfers in and transfers out): 28th\n247Sports (Just factors transfers in): 19th\n\nKamari Ramsey is one of the most important transfers to announce their commitment to USC. (Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Kyusung Gong)\n\nTransfers In\n\nCharles Ross: Wide Receiver\nPrevious School: San Jos\u00e9 State\nClass for 2024: Redshirt senior\nOn3 ranking: N/A (N/A out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Three star (three star out of high school)\nCommitted: May 28\n\nCollier: The transfer from San Jos\u00e9 State gives USC more depth in the receiver room. Ross played the past three seasons with the Spartans after starting his collegiate career with Nevada. During his time at San Jos\u00e9 State, Ross appeared in 27 games, starting 17 of them, where he had 65 receptions for 856 yards. The addition of Ross to the USC roster helps replenish a position that was heavily depleted after the Trojans\u2019 2023 regular season ended and the transfer portal opened. Ross will look to compete for playing time against the returning young core of receivers that includes sophomores Duce Robinson and Makai Lemon, as well as experienced transfers like Kyle Ford and Jay Fair.\n\nGavin Meyer: Defensive Lineman\nPrevious School: Wyoming\nClass for 2024: Redshirt senior\nOn3 ranking: Three star (N/A out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Three star (three star out of high school)\nCommitted: May 22\n\nSchofield: The 6-foot-4, 285-pound redshirt senior brings valuable experience to the Trojans, slotting in at nose tackle for the Cowboys. Over the past two seasons, Meyer appeared in 26 games, recording 66 tackles, 8.5 tackles for loss and four sacks. Despite starting six games in 2022, he was primarily a rotational player in 2023, logging 351 defensive snaps. Meyer\u2019s addition addresses USC\u2019s critical need for depth on the defensive line, a concern Riley has frequently highlighted. However, some critics note that Meyer\u2019s performance, while solid, has not necessarily stood out. Some have questioned his ability to consistently dominate at a higher level of competition. Despite interest from schools like Cal, Wisconsin and Illinois, Meyer will need to elevate his game if he wants to become a key contributor for the Trojans.\n\nMichael Lantz: Kicker\nPrevious school: Georgia Southern\nClass for 2024: Graduate\nOn3 ranking: N/A (N/A out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: N/A (two star out of high school)\nCommitted: April 29\n\nJohnson: Lantz provides an extra leg to compete with redshirt freshman Tyler Robles and redshirt junior Denis Lynch this upcoming fall. While Lantz was 23-for-28 on field-goal attempts with the Eagles last season, Lynch was 10-for-14 with USC in 2023. Lynch certainly has a leg on him \u2014 with a career long of 53 yards \u2014 but his inconsistencies between 30 and 39 yards was concerning; he went 5-for-8 between that range this past season. Lantz, comparatively, does not have the strongest leg in the world with a career-long kick of 48 yards. But he has been much more consistent at shorter ranges, knocking home 10 of 11 attempts in 2023 from the same range that Lynch went 62.5% from last year.\n\nJay Fair: Wide Receiver\nPrevious school: Auburn\nClass for 2024: Junior\nOn3 ranking: Three star (three star out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Three star (three star out of high school)\nCommitted: April 28\n\nJohnson: A seemingly inexperienced receiver room has gained a whole lot of experience recently. Fair played in 23 games across two seasons with the Auburn Tigers, snatching 324 yards \u2014 which was second on the team \u2014 and two touchdowns this past season. Fair was most dangerous for his ability after the catch and will add more speed for USC. The former Tiger did compile 149 of his 324 yards against UMass and Samford, creating questions about whether he is effective against stiffer opponents. Entering his third in college, Fair will now have the chance to answer those questions with the Trojans.\n\nKyle Ford: Wide Receiver\nPrevious school: UCLA\nClass for 2024: Graduate\nOn3 ranking: Three star (N/A out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Three star (five star out of high school)\nCommitted: April 23\n\nJohnson: Yes, this is the same Ford that transferred to UCLA from USC last offseason, but he is back, according to On3\u2032s Hayes Fawcett. \u201cMy fault I was trippin\u2019,\u201d Ford said to Fawcett when he announced his transfer back to the Trojans. The veteran wide receiver was only with the Bruins for one season, compiling 236 yards across 12 games, and entered the portal after Chip Kelly resigned from UCLA\u2019s head coaching position to become the offensive coordinator at Ohio State. While his UCLA numbers might not show it, Ford is a big addition to the wide receiver room. The 6-foot-3 pass catcher was much more productive in his final seasons with the Trojans, notching 365 yards in 2022 and 252 yards in 2021. The once and future Trojan will suit up in the cardinal and gold again in 2024, and immediately becomes one of the most experienced receivers in the room.\n\nGreedy Vance Jr.: Defensive Back\nPrevious school: Florida State\nClass for 2024: Redshirt senior\nOn3 ranking: Three star (three star out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Three star (three star out of high school)\nCommitted: April 21\n\nJohnson: More than anything, Vance Jr. brings experience to the USC cornerback room as he becomes USC\u2019s first commit in the spring transfer window. The Florida State transfer has appeared in 44 games across four seasons between the Seminoles and Louisville Cardinals. While he appeared in all 14 games for the 2023 ACC champions, Vance Jr. only made five starts, notching 18 tackles, one interception and three pass breakups this past season. After losing Tre\u2019Quon Fegans to the transfer portal April 21 \u2014 see more in the Transfers Out section \u2014 cornerback became a position of need for the Trojans. Playing time will come at a premium for Vance Jr., though, after strong defensive back performances at USC\u2019s annual spring game. Redshirt senior DeCarlos Nicholson, redshirt junior Prophet Brown and freshman Marcelles Williams excelled at cornerback for USC this past weekend as the trio all nabbed interceptions.\n\nJayden Maiava: Quarterback\nPrevious school: UNLV\nClass for 2024: Redshirt sophomore\nOn3 ranking: Four star (three star out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Four star (three star out of high school)\nCommitted: January 9\n\nHolton: After a whirlwind recruitment campaign the past two days, where Maiava initially committed to Georgia, he has flipped his commitment to USC and head coach Lincoln Riley. As a redshirt freshman at UNLV, Maiava took the Rebels to its first-ever Mountain West championship game, as well as throwing for 3,085 yards and 17 touchdowns to win Mountain West Freshman of the Year. In the Guaranteed Rate Bowl \u2014 a game where the Rebels scored 36 points \u2014 Maiava threw for 291 yards and three touchdowns. Maiava will provide much needed depth to the Trojan quarterback room while also getting the privilege to learn under the QB whisperer \u2014 Lincoln Riley. Maiava likely won\u2019t take redshirt sophomore Miller Moss\u2019s starting job after Moss\u2019s six touchdown performance in the Holiday Bowl, but Maiava should get some snaps behind Moss and gain much needed experience.\n\nIsaiah Raikes: Defensive Lineman\nPrevious school: Texas A&M\nClass for 2024: Senior\nOn3 ranking: Three star (N/A out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: N/A (three star out of high school)\nCommitted: January 9\n\nJohnson: The most eye-popping thing about Raikes is his size, coming in at 320 pounds. That weight would be tied for heaviest on the defensive line for USC this past season, adding some beef to the defensive front for the Trojans. His stats don\u2019t necessarily stand out, recording only 17 tackles this past season, but that is not uncommon for a hefty player who plays in the middle of the defensive line. Redshirt senior defensive lineman Kyon Barrs only recorded 18 tackles this year for USC, so Raikes will likely fill a similar role as Barrs did this past season. However, Raikes is listed as 30 pounds heavier than Barrs and should help with stopping the run, a key for a defense that gave up 186.5 rushing yards per game in 2023. Update: Raikes has since re-entered the transfer portal as of April 12. Find more information below in the Transfers Out section.\n\nJaden Richardson: Wide Receiver\nPrevious school: Tufts\nClass for 2024: Redshirt senior\nOn3 ranking: Three star (unranked out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Three star (unranked out of high school)\nCommitted: January 2\n\nHolton: Richardson played nine games this past season for the Tufts Jumbos, where he racked up an impressive 830 yards, 13 touchdowns and 46 receptions. Richardson played three years at Tufts where he totalled 1,564 yards and 20 touchdowns, the majority of which came across the last two seasons. Originally from San Mateo, California, Richardson\u2019s homecoming to the Golden State will provide needed experience to a young, yet talented, USC wide receiver corps.\n\nJohn Humphrey: Defensive Back\nPrevious school: UCLA\nClass for 2024: Redshirt senior\nOn3 ranking: Three star (four star out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Three star (four star out of high school)\nCommitted: December 21\n\nJohnson: Humphrey started in 11 of UCLA\u2019s 12 regular season games, notching 31 tackles, two interceptions and three pass breakups. The UCLA defense this past season \u2014 coached by USC\u2019s new defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn \u2014 was third in the Pac-12 in passing yards per game and second in interceptions. The Trojans, in comparison, were seventh and tied for 10th in those respective stats this past season. Humphrey can help Lynn and new secondary coach Doug Belk turn around USC\u2019s passing defense.\n\nKamari Ramsey: Defensive Back\nPrevious School: UCLA\nClass for 2024: Redshirt sophomore\nOn3 ranking: Four star (four star out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Four star (four star out of high school)\nCommitted: December 21\n\nJohnson: The Trojans seem to like taking two players from the same team, as Ramsey is one of two former Bruins to commit to USC. Ramsey, as of December 23, is the highest-rated player from the transfer portal to commit to USC, and for good reason. Ramsey did not allow a single touchdown across 369 coverage snaps, according to PFF. For a Trojan defense that allowed the second-most points in the Pac-12 this season, having a player like Ramsey will certainly help turn around the defense. Lynn was able to turn around the UCLA defense in only one year. Bringing in Ramsey and Humphrey, who were part of UCLA\u2019s turnaround, should hopefully have a similar effect on USC\u2019s defense.\n\nDeCarlos Nicholson: Cornerback\nPrevious School: Mississippi State\nClass for 2024: Redshirt senior\nOn3 ranking: Three star (three star out of Junior College)\n247Sports ranking: Three star (three star out of Junior College)\nCommitted: December 20\n\nJohnson: Nicholson, along with Humphrey, will provide the Trojans with two veterans with a lot of experience, something USC was lacking before adding these two transfers. Nicholson played in 25 games across the last two seasons for the Bulldogs. The Trojans have had success bringing in veteran cornerbacks from the transfer portal. Nicholson and Humphrey could end up similar to both redshirt senior cornerback Christian Roland-Wallace and former-USC cornerback Mekhi Blackmon. Roland-Wallace and Blackmon led Trojan cornerbacks in interceptions the respective year they transferred to USC.\n\nJo\u2019Quavious Marks: Running Back\nPrevious School: Mississippi State\nClass for 2024: Redshirt senior\nOn3 ranking: Three star (four star out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Four star (four star out of high school)\nCommitted: December 20\n\nJohnson: Marks finishes off the second of three duos that transferred to USC from the same school. The former Bulldog seems to be the heir apparent to junior running back MarShawn Lloyd and redshirt senior running back Austin Jones. Lloyd has declared for the NFL Draft and, assuming Jones does the same, it left USC\u2019s roster with only three running backs: two current freshmen and one incoming freshman. Marks brings in four years of starting experience from the SEC, a good thing for a running back room with a lot of talent, but little experience. Riley will likely start Marks \u2014 who rushed for 573 yards and four touchdowns across nine games this past season \u2014 out of the gate. It will be interesting, though, to see how many touches freshman running back Quinten Joyner receives in tandem with Marks, as Joyner showed out with limited touches this season, averaging 7.8 yards per carry.\n\nAkili Arnold: Safety\nPrevious School: Oregon State\nClass for 2024: Redshirt senior\nOn3 ranking: Four star (three star out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Three star (three star out of high school)\nCommitted: December 17\n\nOca\u00f1as: Akili was one of two members of the Arnold family to switch and return home to Southern California. Out of Mission Viejo High School, Arnold was a three-star safety with quick speed and great hands. He was an all-around athlete from high school, taking snaps at both kick returner and receiver. While at Oregon State, Arnold progressed tremendously as a tackler, having a career season in 2023 with 60 tackles and he was tied for the team-high with two interceptions. Riley\u2019s emphasis this portal season was to boost the underperforming defense from the past two seasons. Adding Arnold gives new defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn more depth at safety as All-American safety Calen Bullock looks to return for his senior year. And who knows, if the Trojans need more help at receiver, Arnold has some experience. Update: Since initial publishing, Bullock has since declared for the NFL Draft and will not return for his senior year.\n\nEaston Mascarenas-Arnold: Inside Linebacker\nPrevious school: Oregon State\nClass for 2024: Senior\nOn3 ranking: Three star (three star out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Four star (four star out of high school)\nCommitted: December 16\n\nJohnson: Mascarenas-Arnold is one of the better pickups for USC out of the portal. He earned All-Pac-12 First Team honors this season as he recorded 107 tackles, two sacks and two interceptions. His 107 tackles led Oregon State by a very wide margin \u2014 the player with the second-most tackles had 44 fewer than Mascarenas-Arnold \u2014 and he would have led the Trojans this season as well by a whopping 30 tackles. Tackling has been a major problem for USC for the past two seasons and Mascarenas-Arnold will aim to help Lynn and newly-hired linebackers coach Matt Entz fix it.\n\nNate Clifton: Defensive End\nPrevious school: Vanderbilt\nClass for 2024: Redshirt senior\nOn3 ranking: Three star (three star out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Four star (three star out of high school)\nCommitted: December 10\n\nJohnson: Clifton was a team captain this season for Vanderbilt, leading the team in sacks. USC only averaged 2.25 sacks per game through the regular season \u2014 tied for 45th in the country \u2014 so the Trojans hope Clifton can help improve those numbers. There was a stretch this past season where Clifton recorded at least .5 sacks in four straight games. UCLA averaged 3.42 sacks per game under Lynn \u2014 good for seventh in the country \u2014 so the combination of Clifton and Lynn should help USC\u2019s pass rush.\n\nHank Pepper: Long Snapper\nPrevious school: Michigan State\nClass for 2024: Redshirt junior\nOn3 ranking: N/A (three star out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: N/A (two star out of high school)\nCommitted: December 6\n\nJohnson: Fans never know the name of the long snapper until the long snapper messes up. Trojans fans will hope they never have to learn Pepper\u2019s name. He started as a freshman at Michigan State, and could do the same at USC. Pepper redshirted this season, so he should be a redshirt junior when he puts on a Trojan uniform for the first time.\n\nTransfers Out\n\nCeyair Wright: Cornerback\nNew School: ???\nCurrent class: Redshirt junior\nOn3 ranking: Three Star (four star out of high school)\n247Sports ranking: Four star (four star out of high school)\nEntered Transfer Portal: April 26\n\nJohnson: This one was not much of a shocker, as Wright was not included on the spring roster for USC. The former four-star recruit had an interesting tenure with the Trojans, balancing football with an acting career. Wright is most known for playing the son of NBA superstar LeBron James in \u201cSpace Jam: A New Legacy.\u201d On the football side of things, Wright played 23 games in three years with USC and compiled 41 tackles and an interception. Wright saw his most playing time in 2022, competing in all of the Trojans\u2019 14 games, but he only saw the field in seven games in 2023. As with many Trojan transfers, the talent is still evident with Wright, which is why 247Sports still rates him as a four-star transfer.\n\nDeijon Laffitte"}

(Photo by Desirae Ridley)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nJune 01, 2024 at 11:17 am PDT\n\nStarting the season with a 4-12 record\u2014 USC baseball\u2019s worst 16-game start in its 135-year history \u2014 certainly wasn\u2019t on second-year head coach Andy Stankiewicz\u2019s agenda. But the emergence of multiple unsung heroes, a revived offense and mound dominance boosted the Trojans (31-28, 17-12 Pac-12) to a nine-game winning streak heading into the Pac-12 Championship game, giving them the opportunity to erase early-season woes, win the conference\u2019s final title and earn an automatic berth to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe Trojans were mere outs away from accomplishing this feat, until an eighth-inning lead against No. 18 Arizona (36-21, 20-10) quickly dwindled away, effectively ending USC\u2019s season and chance to break its nine-year NCAA Tournament drought.\n\n\u201cWe came up short. And I know that\u2019s not what anybody wants, but at the same time, I\u2019m proud,\u201d Stankiewicz said.\n\nThe path to the conference title game wasn\u2019t all smooth and steady, on and off the diamond. In addition to the historically lackluster start, USC never truly had a home stadium. The reconstruction of Dedeaux Field \u2014 which sits on USC\u2019s campus \u2014 forced the Trojans to host games at Great Park and Cicerone Field in Irvine, plus Page Stadium in Westchester.\n\n\u201cIt was an adjustment for everybody,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cIt took some time to try to find our routine in all that travel, and I think that that\u2019s a big part of baseball.\u201d\n\nRoad fatigue aside, the rollercoaster season introduced fans to multiple dynamic freshmen. Infielders Kevin Takeuchi and Dean Carpentier, and outfielder Brayden Dowd all brought life to USC\u2019s offense right out of the gate.\n\nHailing from Clarkston, Michigan, Dowd fit right into Stankiewicz\u2019s system, making his presence known with a four-hit weekend at Stanford (22-33, 11-19), which earned him a starting role. When the Trojans needed him most \u2014 late in the season in a win-or-go-home setting \u2014 he delivered.\n\nDowd launched arguably the most important home run of the season \u2014 his first in a Trojan uniform \u2014 against California (36-19, 17-13) in the Pac-12 Tournament semifinal game; a go-ahead three-run blast which proved to be crucial as USC won 7-4.\n\nDowd\u2019s .324 batting average set him up for what will be a big sophomore campaign in 2025, the Trojans\u2019 first in the Big Ten. Takeuchi and Carpentier each posted similar stats, recording .289 and .287 batting averages respectively. They each scorched four round-trippers each.\n\nTakeuchi also contributed to USC\u2019s late-season magic, riding an eight-game hitting streak into the Pac-12 title game, including a four-RBI performance against Gonzaga (20-32, 14-10 West Coast Conference). Carpentier\u2019s brightest spot came in early April when he hit his first three career homers in consecutive games, all wins.\n\n\u201cThe expectation standard holds true whether you\u2019re a freshman or senior, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cThose young men understood that. They realized that they have a responsibility \u2014 to themselves, to their teammates, to the families, to this University \u2014 to show up every day ready to go.\u201d\n\nThroughout the team\u2019s abysmal start, one player consistently shined: sophomore catcher Jacob Galloway. With a team-leading .365 batting average in 2023 across limited at-bats as a true freshman, Galloway immediately unleashed his wrath on opposing pitchers to begin his 2024 season, tallying a 22-game hit streak spanning from the second game of the season to late March.\n\nWhile his production slid a bit as the season progressed, Galloway provided a jolt of energy into a USC lineup desperate for offensive production.\n\nSophomore outfielder Austin Overn\u2019s 2024 season featured early trials and tribulations before he resurfaced into the five-tool, All-Pac-12 player that fans saw break out in 2023 as a newcomer. In addition to leading the Trojans with eight four-baggers, Overn stole 17 bases and hit five triples on the year.\n\nSenior infielder Ryan Jackson hit .324 to lead USC\u2019s qualified hitters, including seven knocks in postseason play. The former Nevada transfer built on his 2023 success, doubling his home run total and slugging at a much higher rate.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 pitching staff also saw immense growth as the season progressed. Initially, junior right-hander Caden Aoki, the Pac-12\u2032s ERA leader in 2023, was USC\u2019s only consistent starter. Yet he still experienced bumps in the road, including an early-March performance against Arizona where he gave up nine earned runs.\n\nBut when Aoki went down with an injury later that month, Stankiewicz needed to rely on his other hurlers to fill the void. Senior starter Tyler Stromsborg, who had trouble to begin the year, managed to register multiple quality starts, and the bullpen showcased some top-tier arms.\n\n\u201c[Stromsborg] kept getting better,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cHe kept doing his work, he believed in himself ... It could have been easy for Tyler to go, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s my senior year, let\u2019s just get this thing over with.\u2019 But he didn\u2019t, he just refused to buy into that mentality and just got better.\u201d\n\nJunior righty Josh Blum notched 10 saves on the season with a sub-2.00 ERA in over 33 innings of work after moving into the closer role. Joined alongside juniors Fisher Johnson and Xavier Martinez, the Trojans\u2019 relievers catalyzed the team\u2019s late-season success and shut down opposing offenses.\n\nJunior pitcher William Watson originally began the year in the bullpen, but made his mark down the stretch as a reliable starter, leading the team to victory in each of his final three appearances.\n\n\u201c[Watson] stepped up. Guys got hurt, the opportunity presented itself, and he grabbed it,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cHe was a huge part of our success down the stretch.\u201d\n\nWhen Aoki returned, he didn\u2019t miss a step. In the Pac-12 Championship, he dealt over six innings of one-run ball and struck out eight Wildcats. While the team couldn\u2019t hold on to the lead, his gem gave the Trojans the best shot at winning and advancing.\n\nWith a conference-leading four players named to the Pac-12 All-Tournament Team, USC left its mark on the league one final time. With a move to the Big Ten on the horizon, Stankiewicz and company will want to address certain facets of the team to compete with the likes of the nation\u2019s premier squads.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting because now we get to kind of establish ourselves in another part of the country a bit more than we probably have done in the past,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a transitional period, we\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d\n\nWhile the 2024 season emulated some aspects of the 2023 campaign, the Trojans still managed to win at the right time and advance past pool play in the Pac-12 Tournament. While next season may have the same feel in terms of scattered home ballparks, USC will look to extend its historical prowess across the Midwest and enter the new conference with some pep in its step.\n\n\u201cWe just kept pushing forward and just kept reminding the guys that our best baseball is in front of us, you\u2019ve just got to stay the course,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cEverybody wants to be playing their best baseball at the end \u2014 and we were.\u201d\n\nFor the 12-time national champions, success in recent years has come at a premium. But with a determined head coach and glimpses of upside down the stretch, Trojan fans can feel optimistic about the direction of the program going forward with a lot to look forward to in future years.\n```"}

Giant Robot began as a small magazine that featured Asian pop culture in 1994 and has since grown to having two locations in Sawtelle where they sell art and feature local artists at their GR2 Gallery. This time, they partnered with JANM to bring the artists they collaborate with to a larger scale event.\n\nKonbini is the Japanese abbreviated term for convenience store: a place known to have everything you need from food to office supplies. Instead, this konbini included all types of art from prints of illustrations, keychains, cups, and t-shirts to coasters and tote bags from over 25 artists. It also featured a speaker event showcasing artist Felicia Chiao and Eric Nakamura, the founder of Giant Robot.\n\nDisplay at the beginning of the JANM exhibition featuring Eric Nakamura from GR. (Photo courtesy of Sheela Yuan)\n\nThe speaker event included an audience Q&A section. Sheela Yuan, an attendee and an illustrator herself, reflected on her takeaways from the panel. \u201c[Chiao] said that she struggled with [staying creative and avoiding burnout] but the way to work through it is to live life,\u201d said Yuan. \u201cInspiration for work for her always comes to her through her life experiences and she said that even if you feel like you\u2019re not making art that\u2019s good enough bad art is still art and that\u2019s an accomplishment in and of itself.\u201d\n\nChiao\u2019s art is known for its whimsical nature with soft edges, warm colors, and characters with cute smiles. Hearing Chiao\u2019s process, Yuan explains this event allowed her to find Chiao\u2019s art more relatable. \u201cAs an artist myself it made me realize we really do all go through the same struggles and process in creating,\u201d she explained.\n\nAt its core, the \u201cArt Konbini\u201d brought people together and allowed artists to share their work and journey with their audience directly. The panel was accompanied by booths set around JANM\u2019s Aratani Central Hall as if it was a mini fair or convention.\n\nArtists and guests in JANM's Aratani Central Hall for the \"Art Konbini\" (Photo courtesy of Sheela Yuan)\n\nIn an interview with Annenberg Media, Nakamura discussed the process of collaborating with an institution like JANM. \u201cIt\u2019s been really easy. I think this is one of the first things I asked for when they wanted to do a public program with [their] exhibition,\u201d said Nakamura. \u201cThis is something I have gotten to do at our shop \u2013 our gallery. Usually it\u2019s like maybe 10 vendors at the most and so it\u2019s nice to have like 30 vendors... I would like to have more if I could but for now this is amazing. I really love this, it\u2019s really fun.\u201d\n\nAttendees ranged from children and their families to aspiring artists. The event brought the excitement of sharing art as a community. Among the various vendors present, Kaylynn Kim and Christian Leon Guerrero co-hosted a booth with their prints, collaborative pieces, pins, and even live portraits.\n\nKaylynn Kim and Christian Leon Guerrero pose with their booth showcasing their art.

He explains that while he, of course, needs to like the art someone creates, it also comes down to the artist\u2019s vibe that he gets to know over time.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much variation between people but I think the common thread there is a similar temperament, a similar vibe,\u201d said Nakamura. \u201cNo matter how different they are I think everyone here kind of gets along and I think that is kind of key.\u201d\n\nChellioh\u2019s booth with her prints, totes, keychains and stickers.

Creating events in spaces larger than just the GR2 gallery allows Giant Robot and their collaborators to bring the joy of art to more people than just those visiting Sawtelle, continuing to foster the artistic community built by Nakamura and his team.\n\n\u201cAn event like this is just celebrating people who make stuff or do things and people that want to get out there,\u201d said Nakamura. \u201cI am trying to celebrate that.

(AP/Aurelien Morissard)\n\nBy Robert Westermann May 31, 2024 at 1:17 pm PDT\n\nThen-No. 6-ranked Matteo Berrettini quickly came to a halt on a court in Melbourne as the ball zipped by him during a practice session at the 2022 Australian Open. His frustrated face turned into a smirk as he turned toward his practice partner\u2014then-No. 40 in the WTA rankings and romantic partner Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107. \u201cYou are hitting really good,\u201d said Berrettini on Netflix\u2019s Break Point as the two gathered at a nearby bench for a water break. Berrettini then wiped the sweat off his face with Tomljanovi\u0107's towel, confirming the two are more than just practice partners. The relationship that began in 2019 over Instagram messages had since turned into something much more serious.\n\nIntra-office relationships are often frowned upon because of their potential to disrupt the workplace environment. The primary reason people find themselves in these relationships is that they want to have someone close who can relate to what they\u2019re going through, such as dealing with a difficult boss or client. And while being a professional tennis player isn\u2019t a common occupation, the pressure of winning matches and tournaments takes a toll on every player from the top seed to a qualifier.\n\nThat year\u2019s Australian Open proved to be a difficult one for Tomljanovi\u0107, as she fell in the first round to No. 8 seed Paula Badosa in straight sets. Berrettini, on the other hand, was at the peak of his career in both ranking and tournament success, having fought No. 1 Novak Djokovic to a four-set loss in the finals at Wimbledon in 2021. Seeded at No. 7, Berrettini would go on to the semifinals in the Australian Open before losing to Rafael Nadal in four sets, pushing another one of the sport\u2019s greats to the limits.\n\nAs a result of two opposite performances, the two weeks that followed were rather awkward. Tomljanovi\u0107 sat idly by while Berrettini continued to win. She appeared happy to see him succeed, but naturally, she would find it difficult not to become a little bit jealous. She left Australia before Berrettini finished playing, and the two would not be together again until Indian Wells, which took place two months later. The pair has since split.\n\nAthletes have to handle a lot of delicate relationships on and off the court; coaches, agents, teammates, trainers, parents and spouses, all of whom play a significant role in that athlete\u2019s life, also have opinions about what the athlete in their life should do. Serena and Venus Williams are prominent examples of that. Their father\u2019s occasionally harsh training tactics built them up to the dominant players they were. There have also been instances where children of famous athletes are forced to endure a huge amount of pressure because of the preset expectations that fans put on them because of their parents\u2019 success.\n\nThe first few days of Roland Garros have seen multiple relationships in which both partners are competing in the tournament: No. 9 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas and unseeded Badosa; No. 2 seed and 2024 Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner and 2019 U.S. Open champion Anna Kalinksaya; No. 15 seed Elina Svitolina and Frenchman Gael Monfils. Monfils and Kalinksaya lost earlier today.\n\nGiven how important the mental aspect of sports is rapidly becoming, situations like these add another dynamic to the sport. Each athlete already has to solve issues within their own game and stay in peak condition, but having to contemplate a romantic partner\u2019s similar lifestyle creates a potentially distracting scenario that we don\u2019t have much of a history of understanding.\n\nThe tennis world has been undergoing a slow transition from old-school players, such as Djokovic, Nadal and Roger Federer on the men\u2019s side, to a new era of tennis\u2014never more apparent than after Nadal suffered his first-ever first-round loss at Roland-Garros on Monday. And in the women\u2019s game, the Williams twins embraced an old-school style, as opposed to the seemingly countless modern players of which play the game much differently. This change has been ongoing for some time as the game\u2019s legends have succumbed to injury, but it became especially clear when Carlos Alcarez defeated Djokovic in a five-set thriller to win Wimbledon in 2023. Alcaraz and youngsters like him boast feisty play styles and often engage with the crowd when they win points. On the other hand, veterans like Djokovic possess much calmer demeanors and keep to themselves, never allowing their opponents to impact their mental game.\n\nThe emergence of a new generation of tennis players has coincided with the emergence of social media and documentaries like Break Point, which create even more opportunities for distraction. That\u2019s not to say the internet is a negative influence on tennis since many players utilize it for media and brand deals, but it cannot be taken out of the equation when it comes to evaluating a player. As players are increasingly put in the limelight, the way that they navigate the evolving tennis landscape will continue to play a role in their performance on the court. That makes the role of those who surround them all the more important.\n```"}

Organized by the Asian Pacific Cinema Association (APCA) in collaboration with the Coalition of Asian Pacifics in Entertainment (CAPE) and other organizations, these events showcased the unique challenges and triumphs of being an Asian film student.\n\nHighlights included panel discussions with industry leaders and networking opportunities designed to connect students with professionals who share their heritage and passions. On April 6th, APCA hosted \u201cAn Afternoon With APIDA in Entertainment,\u201d an event that blended creativity, culture, and networking opportunities. It was a joint effort by APCA, CAPE (Coalition of Asian Pacifics in Entertainment), Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s WAVE (Warner Asian Voices Elevated) Business Resource Group, and Gold House, featuring panels of industry speakers and extensive networking sessions.\n\nContinuing the collaborative spirit, Delta Kappa Alpha (DKA), APCA, and CAPE also hosted a speaker session the next day on April 7th featuring former Disney EVP Gordon Ho and Marginal Mediaworks CEO Sanjay Sharma. These industry leaders shared their insights and advice with Asian students aspiring to enter the film industry, spotlighting the importance of mentorship and networking.\n\nFor many aspiring Asian filmmakers at USC, APCA provides a vital sense of community and support through collaborative projects, networking, and educational events, focusing on fostering deeper, complex representations of AAPI culture. Katherine Lee, a sophomore majoring in Film Production, shared her journey with APCA, reflecting on how the organization has shaped her path.\n\n\u201cI joined APCA in my freshman year and found an incredible support system. The organization offers a platform to network, socialize, and find numerous opportunities in film,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing an Asian film major, my cultural roots and identity heavily influence the stories I want to tell, and APCA helps me connect with others who share similar experiences and challenges.\u201d\n\nBut Asian artists in the film industry often face unique challenges, including barriers to networking and implicit biases. Katherine Lee, a sophomore majoring in film production at USC, explained the difficulties of getting her foot in the door.\n\n\u201cAs an Asian filmmaker, one of the more difficult parts is probably connection. A lot of other filmmakers might have parents who are interested in the American entertainment industry, but as an Asian immigrant, you don\u2019t really have those connections,\u201d she said. Lee even pointed out the challenges Asian filmmakers may face once they manage to get into the industry. \u201cRacism is very real. There are implicit biases when people are promoting others or bringing them onto projects,\u201d she said.\n\nTo students, events like these are helpful in bridging the gap between aspiring filmmakers and industry professionals. The events extended beyond the panels and networking sessions. Attendees like Cameron Lee, General Program Director at APCA, found inspiration in the speakers\u2019 diverse experiences.\n\n\u201cAdele Lim, the writer-director of Crazy Rich Asians, was incredible to hear from,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone who has been such a big pillar for the Asian community being here was amazing.\u201d\n\nAPCA\u2019s industry programming director Maaya Shah discussed how important these events are to aspiring filmmakers. \u201cThese panels and mixers are invaluable for students to connect with professionals and learn from their experiences. It\u2019s all about fostering meaningful relationships that can propel young creatives forward.\u201d\n\nGordon Ho, a CAPE board member who spoke in one of the panels, emphasized the importance of overcoming these challenges through networking and mentorship, something his organization hopes to address. \u201cOne of the first things that you need is a network,\u201d Ho said to Annenberg Media. \u201cCAPE is there to help facilitate that networking and ideally provide mentorship.\u201d\n\nHo highlighted the role of CAPE in supporting USC students and APCA members. \u201cWe try to encourage networking and provide mentorship to help advance diverse voices in the entertainment industry.\u201d Ho said. \u201cA majority of people who go through the CAPE Writers Fellowship get placed in writing positions at major studios like Amazon, Netflix, or Disney.\u201d\n\nShah added how collaborating with organizations like WAVE, Gold House, and CAPE contributed to the event\u2019s success. \u201cTheir enthusiasm and dedication to uplifting APIDA voices were truly inspiring,\u201d she said. \u201cThese partnerships are vital for creating opportunities and platforms for APIDA creatives to shine.\u201d\n\nHo hopes for a future where the entertainment industry increasingly embraces diversity and leverages modern tools to democratize content creation. He encourages young filmmakers to take initiative and utilize available resources to create and market their own work. \u201cBuild your network, demonstrate your value by creating your own content, and exceed expectations in any opportunity you get,\u201d Ho advised. \u201cThe industry always has rapid changes, but there\u2019s always room for new, innovative filmmakers and content creators.\u201d\n\nHe discussed the importance of genuine storytelling in the industry. \u201cGreat content starts with the writing,\u201d he noted. \u201cIf we can have authentic writers who are diverse, that can tell diverse stories, it\u2019s always going to be better.\u201d\n\nAs for APCA, Shah discusses her hopes for the organization\u2019s future. \u201cWe hope to continue strengthening and fostering these relationships to expand and create bigger opportunities,\u201d she said. Shah envisions APCA growing within the USC community and forming meaningful relationships with external organizations to provide more opportunities for students and alumni alike.\n```"}

Holding the American flag in his hand, the bank relationship manager from Utah felt joyous during his naturalization ceremony, despite celebrating alone due to Covid restrictions keeping families and friends outside the courtroom.\n\n\u201cGetting my citizenship was [one] of the greatest moments of my life, second only to my children being born \u2014 I felt like I actually belonged somewhere,\u201d he said, remembering that day two years ago.\n\nFor Gonzalez, the day marked a special milestone. After immigrating from Mexico to Atlanta, in 1992 at only 3 years old, his life was marred with uncertainty as an undocumented immigrant. Without legal status, Gonzalez resorted to cleaning homes and landscaping with his parents after high school, unable to pursue higher education despite his good grades.\n\n\u201cThere was the looming idea that I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything even with a degree due to my legal status,\u201d he said.\n\nThe only breath of relief came in 2012, when the Obama administration implemented the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Gonzalez qualified.\n\n\u201cFrom that moment, I saw the virtue in the Democratic Party and told myself that I would vote Democrat one day to provide others that same opportunity,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nBut after naturalization, \u201cnot having the fear of deportation allows an individual to see other issues,\u201d he said. Gonzalez had avidly encouraged a Joe Biden vote in 2020. Now, he\u2019s a registered Republican.\n\nAs a result of experiencing high food costs and a lack of progress on immigration from Democrats, he begrudgingly backs Donald Trump this year.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I was looking most for someone besides Biden and Trump,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think of this upcoming election as me voting for Trump, but more so voting for issues. Every election, the issue of fixing [the] immigrant system simply feels like a taunt or a joke to get votes and sympathy.\u201d\n\nFor many Americans, the upcoming November elections imposes a flashback to 2020: a fatigued, drawn out match between two unprecedentedly unpopular candidates amidst a struggling economy and an all-time high for international instability, whether that may be a pandemic or two ongoing wars.\n\nFor recently naturalized citizens like Gonzalez, this election will be the first of potentially many acts of civic engagement, contributing to the historic impact naturalized citizens have had on elections in previous years.\n\nThe potential power of new citizens remains crucial to the presidential outcome, as evidenced by the numbers. The American Immigration Council estimated the number of non-citizens eligible to naturalize is 7.4 million. Biden\u2019s margin of victory in 2020 was roughly 7 million, underscoring the importance of these people in a close election.\n\nWith every vote counting, many non-citizens are currently rushing to gain their citizenship to have their voices heard.\n\nFrancisco Rodriguez, 42, originally came to the United States from South America to pursue his medical residency on a J-1 student visa. After two of his mentors were murdered in his home country, Rodriguez decided to not return out of safety, and was approved for a green card in 2019.\n\nThe Illinois-based physician recalls hearing lots of anti-immigration discourse during this time, which prompted his need to become politically active.\n\n\u201cWhile I was one of the \u2018desirable\u2019 immigrants, I realized that my motives for immigration were the same as that of many others,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t disagree [with] the need for migratory regulations, the rhetoric was toxic and maligned immigrants that like me, were hardworking and looking for a better future.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of my mentors during the 2016 election were apathetic; they did not believe that much would change,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not going to become that. I needed to become an opinionated participant.\u201d\n\nWhile Rodriguez has begun his citizenship journey, it\u2019s not clear yet if paperwork will process in time for him to be able to vote by November. Despite this, Rodriguez states that even if he were able to vote, he views his participation as \u201cmore symbolic than real,\u201d given that his county and state of Illinois are Democratic strongholds.\n\nNancy Flores is the deputy director at the National Partnership of New Americans (NPNA), a coalition of immigrant and refugee rights organizations aiming to increase civic engagement amongst immigrant populations. She shared that discouraged voters like Rodriguez shouldn\u2019t \u201close focus\u201d and instead shift their attention to civic engagement\u2019s impact at the local level.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s zoom in on local level initiatives; ballot initiatives that affect school boards, that affect our children, that affect our garbage collecting process,\u201d Flores said. \u201c[Civic engagement] is not just the federal level but actually, the more local you get the more it directly impacts your life and your everyday life.\u201d\n\nFlores honed in on the idea that while \u201cthe level of enthusiasm is certainly on a spectrum, for a lot of folks, you\u2019ve earned the right to vote, and it wasn\u2019t overnight.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor many folks, this has been decades in the making...and we see that this also translates to when people head to the voting booth, that it\u2019s a really emotionally charged journey and voting is the great equalizer in this country,\u201d she said.\n\nFor many others, obtaining citizenship was a given \u2014 election or not. For Karen Lee, 20, who was originally born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and moved to California at the age of 2, becoming a citizen \u201cjust made sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care too much about voting, even though I know it gives me more political power,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI know I should care, but I feel like I\u2019m so busy with other stuff that voting is at the bottom of my priorities.\u201d\n\nCiting the \u201cdifficulty of keeping up with political candidates,\u201d Lee shared that she will vote in the presidential elections in November and do her research on candidates closer to then.\n\n\u201cBecause I grew up in a very homogenous community, I never felt oppressed or felt a need for change in my life. I feel like my family isn\u2019t really political \u2013 we don\u2019t really talk about politics too often, [and] I never had a strong need to vote.\u201d\n\nAanya Jain, 21, echoed similar sentiments after having immigrated from India at age 10. The Indiana University student grew up in the Chicago suburbs after obtaining a green card through her father\u2019s job, and recalls a childhood not too different from ordinary citizens besides the inability to vote.\n\nLike Lee, obtaining citizenship was a rite of passage. As a permanent resident, her upbringing \u201cfelt very secure and safe,\u201d Jain shared, until the Trump administration threatened the stability of her status.\n\nJain\u2019s father pushed her and the rest of her family members to apply for citizenship as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cMy main motivation behind [obtaining citizenship] was to have that security and know that whatever happens, we are gonna be able to live here, because I know green card rules could change anytime [like] when Trump was in office,\u201d Jain said. \u201cIt was definitely very stressful for us.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Migration Policy Institute, the Trump administration implemented an unprecedented 472 administrative changes to immigration policies from 2017 to 2021. The 2022 report details multiple changes that complicated the naturalization process, such as increased vetting through \u201cincreasing evidentiary requirements for applying, including requiring applicants to provide details on arrests abroad, up to a decade of international travel history (instead of five years), and other documents (e.g., tax returns and children\u2019s birth certificates).\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Trump attempted to rescind the DACA program, exposing approximately 580,000 DACA-recipients to potential deportation and preventing authorized work in the states. The Supreme Court blocked the efforts with a 5-4 decision made in 2020, enshrining protections for the recipients, often known as \u201cdreamers.\u201d\n\nUnder the current Biden administration, an executive order made in 2021 reaffirmed these protections even further.\n\nWhile Jain credits her path to citizenship as without significant complications through the help of her parents and immigration lawyers, the business student recalls seeing \u201clots of happy tears\u201d at her naturalization ceremony in September 2021.\n\n\u201cThere were people from like 50 countries here,\u201d she said, \u201cIt was really cool to see at the end how much it can change lives.\u201d```"}

Solis)\n\nBy Grace Harrington May 28, 2024 at 5:22 pm PDT\n\nIn 2020, conspiracy theories about voter fraud ran rampant \u2014 culminating in a mob overtaking the Capitol to overturn President Joe Biden\u2019s certification vote on Jan. 6, 2021. Four years later in Maricopa County, Arizona, election officials are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best.\n\n\u201c2024 is going to be unpredictable and we\u2019re as prepared as you can be,\u201d said Taylor Kinnerup, the communications director for the Maricopa County Recorder\u2019s office. Maricopa County in particular became the center of national attention when Arizona flipped blue for the first time since 1996 in a tight race between Biden and former President Donald Trump, causing Republicans to cast doubt on the county\u2019s election process. The result was an audit of votes that critics denounced as highly partisan.\n\nNow, the recorder\u2019s office is working to preemptively combat election denialism. Some of the denialism comes from out-of-state instigators, Kinnerup said, but Maricopa County residents can also be mistrustful of the voting process. She said the county\u2019s constituent services department can receive thousands of inquiries a day during the height of election fervor. The questions, Kinnerup said, range from \u201cinnocuous\u201d such as \u201cwhere\u2019s my polling location and where can I cast my ballot?\u201d to much more serious: \u201cWe believe you stole the election and we\u2019re going to prove it.\u201d\n\nThe Maricopa County Recorder\u2019s office has heard all the conspiracy theories, Kinnerup said, and can debunk them all. It\u2019s hard to quantify how the attitude toward election integrity has changed over the years because there hasn\u2019t been sufficient data to track it, according to Northwestern political science professor Laurel Harbridge-Yong, an expert on partisan conflict and the author of a study on threats of violence against elected officials.\n\nHarbridge-Yong noted that it seems like threats and harassment against officials have picked up since 2016. In just one month in Maricopa County in 2022, election workers received 140 threats, including death threats, because of conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Stephen Richer, the county recorder, and other Maricopa County officials had \u201clegitimate\u201d threats that were investigated by the FBI, according to Kinnerup.\n\nThe sentiment stretches far beyond Maricopa County. In the heavily red state of South Carolina, some voters casted doubt on the integrity of the 2020 election \u2014 with at least one joining local officials to assuage his concerns. During early voting hours in the lead up to the South Carolina Republican primary, Lenice Shoemaker, the director of Lexington County\u2019s registration and elections, flitted between the room where a dozen voters are casting ballots and the back rooms filled with empty ballot boxes and poll workers.\n\nHer Carolina Gamecocks lanyard is decorated with a variety of pins: \u201cIDK, Google it\u201d in a text message bubble, a pink and blue \u201cPointless meeting survivor\u201d badge and the American and Israeli flags. Shoemaker has spent 10 years as an election worker, and two and a half years as director. Just after casting her vote at the Lexington polling center, Hillary Higgins, a dance studio owner from the nearby town of Batesburg-Leesville, said that she had some \u201cquestions that never got fully cleared up\u201d about the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cElection results should be finalized the day of,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for it to continue on for multiple days.\u201d As Shoemaker explained the primary\u2019s watertight vote-counting process in the back rooms of the polling center, one election worker, Matthew McGinnis, couldn\u2019t help but chime in. Six months ago, he didn\u2019t feel the election process was secure, he said. Becoming an election worker changed that.\n\n\u201cNow that I know the process, I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have checks upon checks.\u201d Shoemaker said election security concerns are \u201cfrustrating.\u201d \u201cLet me show you my hometown,\u201d she said. The harassment and overall mistrust in the election process has taken a toll on election workers. A study done by the election reform nonprofit Issue One found that half of Americans living in the western United States will have a new local election official in 2024 due to election worker turnover. In Arizona, 98% of people will be served by a new election official.\n\n\u201cThere are conspiracy theorists and extremists that have been putting extra pressure on election officials [and] making their life difficult,\u201d said Michael Beckel, the group\u2019s research director and author of the study. \u201cWe as a country should be uniting to make sure that they can step up and safely and securely run the 2024 elections.\u201d That might be a tall order just six months out from the same contentious presidential matchup as 2020.\n\nHarbridge-Yong said putting forward new candidates is the only way to move on from the current hyper-polarization around elections \u2014 which would also only happen post-2024. For now, officials are doing all they can on the ground to combat election denialism. Kinnerup said Maricopa County is opening their voting tabulation center for people to see the process with their own eyes, and Shoemaker is always happy to show people around her voting center.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously no way to predict what could happen in 2024,\u201d Kinnerup said. \u201cBut we are fully prepared to use what we\u2019ve learned in 2020 to move forward with whatever occurs.\u201d```"}

Spanning genres from hip-hop and indie to trap-soul to R&B to pop, and even EDM, the event delivered a diverse musical journey. Held on April 27 at Jianghu in Alhambra, YAR was more than just a concert \u2013 it was a cultural movement. Featuring performances by the 1214 crew and guest artists such as AN$oN, LAKO, Z33, and many others. The attendees experienced the vibrant and diverse sounds of the new generation of Asian musicians. The night celebrated the rhythm, soul, and pulse of the Asian music scene in L.A.\n\nOne of the standout performers of the night was Kid Keith, a Korean American rapper known for his versatile musical style, blending rap, hip-hop, R&B, and K-pop influences. Before his performance, Kid Keith expressed his excitement, saying, \u201cI\u2019m about to go crazy. I got some good songs lined up, lots of variety. I\u2019m really excited to perform for all my friends, family, and the fans out there.\u201d\n\nHe also discussed why events like YAR are important to rising Asian artists. \u201cYoung Asians Represent is a great way to show Asian culture and give exposure to hardworking Asian artists who put their soul into their music and create art,\u201d he said. Although he does not fit neatly into categories like K-pop, Kid Keith remains dedicated to his craft, focusing on expressing his emotions through music and encouraging other indie artists to pour their identity into their work. \u201cI don\u2019t fit the K-pop mold, and that\u2019s okay,\u201d Kid Keith said. \u201cMy music is about raw emotion and personal stories, not about conforming to a specific image. I want other indie artists to know that it\u2019s okay to stay true to yourself and your art. Success isn\u2019t just about fame or money; it\u2019s about connecting with your audience on a deeper level.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the musical spectrum, Vincent Hu (LAKO) and Tommy Zhang (Z33), shared their journeys and insights as artists. Hu, a USC student majoring in music industry, described his passion for music, which began in high school. \u201cTonight, I performed three original songs, each showcasing different styles, from Afrobeat to old school and abstract,\u201d he said. He also stressed the significance of music as a means to document and express life\u2019s experiences.\n\nZhang, a fellow USC student majoring in communications with a minor in pop music studies, highlighted the collaborative spirit of the event. \u201cPerforming tonight felt like a lifelong honor. Meeting like-minded friends in college who share a passion for music is rare. We\u2019ve created a strong bond through our shared love for hip-hop and R&B,\u201d he shared. Both Hu and Zhang expressed their future aspirations. Hu aims to become a record producer, bridging the gap between North America and China. \u201cI want to help artists on both sides of the world and create amazing music together,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Zhang hopes to make a lasting impact on the music industry without compromising his artistic integrity. \u201cWe want to leave our mark on music history, not just chase trends or money,\u201d he stated.\n\nEcho Yim and Jim Xu, the YAR organizers under 1214 Entertainment, shared the origin and mission of their organization. \u201cWe started hosting events in December 2020, and our goal was to provide a platform for talented Asian artists to showcase their music,\u201d said Yim. The name 1214 comes from the date of a pivotal phone call that set their journey into motion. Initially focused on bringing Chinese artists to the U.S., they soon discovered a wealth of local talent. \u201cWe realized there are many excellent Asian artists here who lack a stage to display their talent,\u201d added Xu.\n\n1214 Entertainment has hosted multiple events across cities like Austin and New York, showcasing independent artists. Their approach includes organizing non-profit events to maximize exposure for these musicians. \u201cOur model has always been about providing opportunities rather than making money,\u201d explained Xu. To Xu, this philosophy ensures that more people can attend and support the artists, creating a vibrant community of independent musicians.\n\nThe crew highlighted the diversity of the night\u2019s lineup, which included artists from USC and various local talents. They promoted community and collaboration in music, aiming to build a supportive environment where artists can thrive. \u201cWe hope to continue expanding and possibly organize an Asian music festival in Texas by the end of this year or early next year,\u201d said Yim.\n\nAmong the audience members was Zia Zeng, a USC freshman who came to support her friends. \u201cI can feel their passion for music. Even artists I didn\u2019t know before, I now deeply appreciate their talent,\u201d she said. Zia highlighted the pride she felt as a USC student seeing her peers perform on stage. \u201cI\u2019m proud of our school\u2019s talented artists. It\u2019s amazing to see them shine on such a big stage.\u201d\n\nThe crowd cheers and snaps photos at YAR. Baron Thrower II is a frequent attender at Jianghu\u2019s events. He shared his positive experience. \u201cThe artists tonight are incredibly talented. I\u2019m discovering new artists, and it\u2019s been a fantastic vibe,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone here is shining... Keep doing what you\u2019re doing, and let your art be seen and heard.\u201d\n\nZhang acknowledged the cultural challenges faced by Asian artists in genres rarely associated with Asian artists, emphasizing the importance of staying true to one\u2019s roots while finding a unique artistic voice. \u201cIt\u2019s important to stay true to our roots while creating something unique. The music scene here can be tough, but it\u2019s all about finding our place and staying authentic,\u201d he explained.\n\nThroughout the night, the stage at Jianghu became a melting pot of rhythms and beats. As artists like Kid Keith, Hu and Zhang took the stage, the audience united in their shared love for music and culture.\n```"}

Pictures, the Associated Press)\n\nBy Ethan Huang May 28, 2024 at 1:07 pm PDT\n\nThis article contains spoilers for \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga.\u201d\n\nThe contemporary blockbuster often finds itself enthralled with its own lore. There are times where every new Marvel film and television series feels like it just wants to promote the next installment. Recent Star Wars works like \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi\u201d and \u201cAhsoka\u201d seem to exist purely to fill the gaps in between other projects. In an age where fandom is mainstream, consumerism dictates that an audience\u2019s desire for more is a commodity. But at what point is there no story left to tell? This is especially the case for prequels in which the natural endpoint is the status quo of its predecessor.\n\n\u201cMad Max\u201d director George Miller is different. From its inception, the franchise has never truly invested in connecting its various films: actors playing multiple roles (sometimes in the same film), a lack of explained continuity, and characters who look far too young to have witnessed the nuclear war decades before. In the world of \u201cMad Max,\u201d these serve as a feature, not a bug.\n\nThe first \u201cMad Max\u201d takes place in a dystopian Australia, or \u201cthe Wasteland,\u201d where bikers have taken to the streets to wreak havoc. \u201cThe Road Warrior\u201d and \u201cMad Max Beyond Thunderdome\u201d are technically sequels to this first film, yet their image of the Wasteland is one already far beyond saving. These movies follow a simple premise: Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) appears, saves the day and once more wanders the Wasteland. \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d the franchise\u2019s fourth film, would continue this 30 years later. Max, now played by Tom Hardy, stumbles into the plot, does his part and vanishes in the crowd.\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy as Furiosa. (Photo courtesy of Jasin Boland, the Associated Press)\n\nIn doing so, Miller has transformed Max into something more than a mere character. He is a myth, a legend discussed by Wastlanders around the campfire as they guzzle gasoline and chew on human flesh. There is no overarching plot and no \u201cbig bad\u201d at the end of all of this. It is all just people finding hope and leisure in the midst of the apocalypse. Ultimately, a folk figure\u2019s appearance and their actions are all up to the interpretation of the witness.\n\n\u201cFury Road\u201d is the epitome of this idea, as Max merely serves as a point-of-view character peering into the world of his co-protagonist. Here, that secondary main character is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a woman seeking freedom not only for herself, but for the other women confined in a gilded oasis. The film ultimately ends with the overthrow of the warlord Immortan Joe and the establishment of a matriarchy in the Citadel, mirroring Furiosa\u2019s own origins.\n\n\u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d is a direct prequel to \u201cFury Road.\u201d For the first time in the series, Miller creates a film with inseparable connections to its predecessor: shared protagonist, shared setting and shared cast of characters. Anya Taylor-Joy as Furiosa (Photo courtesy of Jasin Boland, the Associated Press)\n\nBut it is not \u201cFury Road\u201d by any means. While the 2015 film was essentially a lean and mean feature-length chase sequence, \u201cFuriosa\u201d is a sprawling epic, covering 15 years of the titular character\u2019s life and the story of the Wasteland itself. Taken from her home as a child, Furiosa (now played by Anya Taylor-Joy as an adult and Alyla Browne as a child) embarks on a quest not only to find her way back, but to get revenge on the ruthless Dementus (Chris Hemsworth) for killing her mother.\n\nA large part of the film is devoted to explaining the backdrop, particularly the turf war between Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme, taking over from the late Hugh Keays-Byrne) and Dementus. It sets the stage for \u201cFury Road\u201d just a few years after the film\u2019s events, but that is not its primary purpose as a work. Like the rest of the series, \u201cFuriosa\u201d is just as much a character study as it is an action film.\n\nAmidst all the spectacular sequences full of exploding trucks, paragliding bikers and War Boys spraying their teeth with silver paint, is a story of a woman whose life has been stolen away from her. Anya Taylor-Joy as Furiosa (Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures, the Associated Press)\n\nAs a child, she watches her mother crucified by Dementus and his men before being traded to Immortan Joe to grow up to be one of his many wives. This, of course, does not last long, as the movie quickly shows Furiosa\u2019s ambition to take control of her own life. She runs away, disguises herself as one of the mechanics before working her way up in the ranks with the help of Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke), a mentor-turned-lover and the only person to truly care for Furiosa in the Citadel.\n\nTaylor-Joy embodies the character\u2019s rage alongside her longing for a home she cannot return to. With just about 30 lines of dialogue, Taylor-Joy makes the most of Furiosa\u2019s physicality, acting through facial expressions and body language. Every moment with her on screen feels like she is a powder keg, ready to explode when confronted with her mortal enemy.\n\nStill, she also showcases the more tender side of the character. In one scene, Furiosa and Jack are captured by Dementus after an extended action sequence. Brutally injured, the two lean on each other, pressing their heads together while Dementus angrily rants about his plan being thwarted. It is a small moment, yet both the audience and the characters know what happens next. Before Jack is tortured to death and Furiosa tears her arm off to escape, the lovers share one last subtle moment of embrace all without a single word.\n\nOn the other hand, Hemsworth brings a twisted flamboyance to his role as the unhinged antagonist. At the start, Dementus is just the chatty head of a glorified biker gang with a sadism that makes him fit right at home with every other madman in the Wasteland. But throughout the 15 years, Hemsworth converts this entrepreneurial charisma into one of nihilism and hopelessness. We see a pathetic, aging leader losing his grip on his territory.\n\nChris Hemsworth as Dementus (Photo courtesy of Jasin Boland, the Associated Press)\n\nThe two are pitted against each other on the road through souped-up cars and big rigs decorated with excavator claws. Miller continues to deliver on these action sequences not only through incredibly intricate choreography, but a healthy mix of death-defying practical stunts and CGI. Composer Tom Holkenborg revives pieces of \u201cFury Road\u2019s\u201d score for these scenes, raising the audience\u2019s blood pressure and not giving a moment to breathe until the chase ends. The heavy, industrial instrumentation blends into the sound of roaring motors and booming gunfire. Moments of intensity bleed into moments of inspiration as Furiosa triumphs.\n\nIt is a sound fitting for the Wasteland, and one that nestles itself into the expansive saga told through \u201cFuriosa.\u201d However, even with how vast the Wasteland is, Miller, along with co-writer Nico Lathouris, approach depicting this world without a drop of cynicism. The current brand of franchise humor sometimes stems from self-awareness and self-deprecation when it comes to the \u201csilly\u201d or absurd elements of a universe. It is why superheroes have to joke about wearing spandex or why Deadpool has to walk on screen to quip about Kevin Feige.\n\nWith so many blockbusters out there, tropes have grown familiar, and it feels as though movies have to wink at an audience to get a point across. In contrast, the \u201cMad Max\u201d franchise is unashamed about how bizarre it is. It will depict its cartoonish violence performed by characters named \u201cRizzdale Pell\u201d and \u201cScabrous Scrotus\u201d without a hint of irony.\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy and George Miller at the 77th annual Cannes Film Festival. (Photo courtesy of Scott A. Garfitt for Invision and the Associated Press)\n\nThrough it, Miller allows the audience to buy into this strange world. You could truly believe in the legends forged in this Wasteland tethered by the characters who make a difference. By the film\u2019s end, Taylor-Joy\u2019s Furiosa and Theron\u2019s Furiosa are one in the same. Two very different performances are united through a single character, as Miller mythologizes Furiosa alongside the pantheon of warriors like Max.\n\nIt is further driven by the explicit ambiguity regarding the outcome of Furiosa\u2019s revenge, told orally through the film\u2019s History Man (George Shevtsov), recounting the tale of the \u201cdarkest angel\u201d in a world where written stories are obsolete. In creating this lawless landscape, the past becomes Miller\u2019s future. However, it is in that future without innovation that myth is created.\n\nAfter all, his recent film, \u201cThree Thousand Years of Longing,\u201d portrays how the progression of technology in the contemporary world can actually suffocate storytelling. Yet it is this fascination that has led him to utilize invention and modern filmmaking as his means of passing these chronicles onto a starving audience.\n\n\u201cFuriosa\u201d is a 21st Century epic stained with blood, tragedy and heroics. We are intended to \u201cremember her\u201d in the way we remember figures like Odysseus or King Arthur. The stories are riddled with truth, fiction, inconsistencies and ambiguities, but regardless, it makes us feel.\n\n\u201cMad Max\u201d was never about \u201ccuring\u201d the apocalypse, but rather the small victories that make the end of the world slightly less painful. Every town saved and every warlord toppled is a moment of optimism in the midst of chaos. We all wander the Wasteland aimlessly looking for hope. We sit at the campfire, telling tall tales that might inspire us, and now, it\u2019s Miller\u2019s turn to share his.\n\n\u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d is currently playing in theaters.\n```"}

(Photo by Katie Simons)\n\nBy Katie Simons May 28, 2024 at 11:13 am PDT\n\nDown the center of the Stanford Avalon Community Garden rows and rows of dark green herbs, expansive heads of lettuce, prickly cacti and crisp cabbage lay neatly in line. These colorful vegetables stood out against their asphalt surroundings. To the right and left, cars with revved engines buzz by. Overhead, city power lines towered high in a cloudy sky as their bulky transmission towers stood only a few feet away.\n\nMaria Pedroza still smiled as she glanced toward her plot filled with fresh produce, something that is seldom available in her neighborhood of Watts. The nearest food store to Pedroza is a 7-Eleven convenience store. According to Pedroza, the markets around her are \u201cno good.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn here it\u2019s fresh,\u201d she said, gesturing towards a garden plot.\n\nCushioned in between houses, busy streets and power lines, 180 garden plots stretch across eleven blocks throughout the USDA-classified food desert of the Watts. Projects like Pedroza\u2019s garden represent a greater movement towards using community gardening initiatives to fight food insecurity created by food deserts.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, 1 in 4 residents live in a food desert, according to USDA data. USDA\u2019s definition of a food desert is an area where at least half of the residents in the neighborhood do not have a grocery within half a mile and a significant portion of the community does not have access to a car. This forces many residents to rely on a gas station or mini-mart for their groceries.\n\nThese gardening solutions don\u2019t look the same for every Angeleno. While Pedroza\u2019s garden \u2014 which is operated by the Los Angeles Community Garden Council (LACG) \u2014 is situated in an expansive community garden, LA Green Grounds turns the front yards of homes in South LA into edible gardens. The organization hosts \u201cDig Ins,\u201d where volunteers help rip up a yard and plant fruit trees, vegetables, lettuce, herbs and legumes in the freshly tilled soil.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I want to start an organization that will help teach people how to grow food,\u201d Florence Nishida, master gardener and LA Green Grounds founder, said. \u201cI want to grow the food in their own yards, and have those people invite their community, their friends or their relatives to come and be the first students. And at the end of the day, we would have a garden built.\u201d\n\nFourteen years later, Nishida and her crew of volunteers have planted over forty edible gardens in South LA. LACG has seen similar success, and since Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa began leasing the land to LACG in 2006, they\u2019ve gained 235 members in Watts, while also expanding their programs to three more locations in the city.\n\n\u201cIn a community where there\u2019s not a lot of access to organic produce, it\u2019s a safe haven for a healthy source of food for gardeners,\u201d said Jesse De La Cruz, community partner for LACG who helps oversee the organization of the Stanford Avalon Community Garden.\n\nFor an average of $35 a month, community members like Pedroza can apply for a plot. The cost goes towards dealing with issues presented by the Los Angeles government bureaucracy. According to De La Cruz, their water prices from the Department of Water and Power have surged by 300% since 2016 because of classification rate changes. Additionally, under current law, LACG members cannot sell their produce, unlike farmers and gardeners with privately owned plots.\n\nIn De La Cruz\u2019s dream garden, there would be an organized system for the gardeners to sell their excess produce. \u201c[It would act like a] sales channel to local supermarkets and restaurants, and being able to really optimize yields in a way that\u2019s efficient for the garden owners and for the public,\u201d De La Cruz said. \u201cSo it will look like an active farmers market.\u201d\n\nThese community-centered experiences is how Nishida has been able to expand LA Green Grounds. On a sunny Sunday afternoon, while the smell of mulch drifted through the air, Lorenita Holloway\u2019s parents\u2019 dirt yard in Compton turned into a garden during their April Dig In. 13 community volunteers in close-toed shoes ripped up grass, laid and tiled new soil and mulch, built garden beds and planted all sorts of fruits and vegetables, while listening to Nishida sharing her gardening tips.\n\n\u201c[The volunteers] learned about soil \u2014 what to do with it, how to improve it, how to level the ground, how to add the amendments you need, how to plant, how to fertilize. It\u2019s that hands-on,\u201d Nishida said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that substitutes for actually doing it.\u201d\n\nNishida spoke to volunteers about the science behind determining the best fertilizers for their gardens, the proper amount of water for planting and which vegetables grow best in LA\u2019s dry climate. Adorned in hats with refillable water bottles in hand while consistently reapplying sunblock, the volunteers listened intently to Nishida\u2019s advice.\n\nAs soon as Nishida stopped speaking, the volunteers quickly began working while following her tips, joking around about all of the math involved with gardening as soft rock played in the background.\n\nHolloway saw the garden as an opportunity to cultivate a community with those interested in gardening and organic produce. \u201cI have told people and anybody that comes to help build it, then they\u2019re definitely able to come and get the fruits of their labor,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cI\u2019d love to have a little cart sitting out, you know, once a month or once a quarter when I got something to have extra to sell. Why not?\u201d\n\nFor Holloway, a local science teacher working to expand her school district\u2019s agricultural programs, her new garden serves as an opportunity to encourage her students to understand the importance of organic, fresh produce, even if it\u2019s not always accessible in their community.\n\n\u201cStudents from Robert F. Kennedy Elementary School can come down and we can do any type of experiential learning,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cKids don\u2019t know where strawberries come from. They think they just come out of the store...[My students can] understand how they\u2019re connected to nature and how we\u2019re supposed to take care of it.\u201d\n\nBoth gardens echoed that these gardens provide more than just healthy food options, but to emphasize personal ties to the food. Before the Dig In, Nishida consults with all garden recipients about what their favorite fruits and vegetables are, then tries to introduce them to her favorites \u2014 kohlrabi and Japanese purple mustard leaves \u2014 as well. Then, using her planting expertise, Nishida spent nearly an hour slowly walking the perimeter of the fresh soil while surveying sun and shade distributions in the yard, deciding the best spots for Holloway\u2019s favorite produce.\n\nWhen Pedroza began her garden over twenty years ago, it was originally so her father could grow the vegetables and herbs he grew up with in Mexico. When her father never took to the garden, Pedroza took it upon herself to keep up the plot. After a few friends around the garden taught her some basic gardening skills, Pedroza was able to grow the same hierba mora and quelites that her father did. Now, Pedroza can pass those same skills down to her grandchildren, even if the asphalt road is just outside of view.\n\n\u201cThis is a legacy for the children of my family,\u201d said Pedroza. \u201cMy grandson runs everywhere. When he is here, it\u2019s happy.\u201d\n```"}

The next two events will take place on August 24 during Dodger Day No. 6 at Salt Lake Park in Huntington Park and on August 31 during Dodger Day No. 7 at Heartwell Park in Long Beach.\n\nThe LADF\u2019s mission is to improve education, health care, homelessness, and social justice through proven programs in underserved communities. The LADF was reimagined in 2013 and has since raised over $154 million. The foundation has invested more than $60 million in a variety of grants and programs to local organizations, which have impacted more than 10 million kids.\n\nGala Mehta said having the opportunity to be part of the LADF makes her days better. \u201cWhen I get to see young people\u2019s faces, whether it\u2019s Shoes that Fit distribution, an L.A.

Caitlin Clark is not just a basketball player; she\u2019s a movement, a beacon of what the game can become. Her game is a lightning rod for possibility, for dreams not yet realized, and for the fierce, unyielding spirit of female athletes everywhere. Watching her play is not just witnessing a force of nature \u2014 it\u2019s a shared experience, raw, powerful, and undeniably captivating.\n\nFor 37 minutes, Clark battled against the rim\u2019s stubborn refusal. Each of her seven three-point attempts clanged off the iron, but she remained undeterred. Then, with 2:27 remaining, a simple crossover while guarded by Kia Nurse led to a moment that would light up the night. Clark launched a three-pointer from what seemed like Koreatown. BANG!  Crypto.com  Arena erupted in a symphony of cheers. Ms. Atlas shrugged. And she wasn\u2019t done.\n\nWith 45 seconds left and the Indiana Fever clinging to a two-point lead, Caitlin Clark spectacularly sealed the game. Coming off a down screen, with Kia Nurse in hot pursuit, she sprinted to the top of the key. Taking a dribble handoff from Kelsey Mitchell, Clark dribbled right twice, crossed the ball behind her back, stepped left, and let fly a 33-foot three-pointer. The ball arced perfectly, swishing through the net. Bang. Game over.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing, but I seriously think every shot I shoot is going to go in,\u201d Clark said. \u201cSome nights are absolutely amazing and some nights you struggle to shoot it a little bit, but I want to take those shots at the end of the game. I think it\u2019s a mindset and a confidence that you have to have about yourself.\u201d\n\nThe sniper from Iowa\u2019s resilience and flair for the dramatic transformed a tough shooting night into a showcase of her unyielding spirit and immense talent. She reminded everyone in the arena why she is a star, leaving a lasting imprint on the game and the hearts of those watching. Clark\u2019s fanfare is a testament to her undeniable talent and charisma on the court. Every dribble, every shot, every no-look pass is executed with a blend of artistry and precision that commands attention.\n\nShe moves with a grace that belies the gritty determination beneath; each plays a reminder of the countless hours spent honing her craft. It\u2019s no wonder that in the house that Kobe Bryant built, in a city teeming with stars, fans clad in a sea of yellow, purple, black, and navy blue, all eager to witness her next feat.\n\nHer ascent sparks discussions that transcend basketball. In a world grappling with racial disparities, her prominence raises profound questions about the nature of celebration and recognition. Her visibility, while well-deserved, underscores the necessity for a more comprehensive appreciation of talent across all domains. It\u2019s a dialogue about equity, acknowledgment, and the ever-evolving terrain of sports media.\n\nBasketball is not just a game for Clark; it\u2019s a unique blend of skills and strategies that redefine the sport. Her impeccable court vision and scoring ability are unmatched, and her leadership is undeniable. She brings an intensity that pushes her teammates, challenges her opponents, and thrills her audience. In every game, you witness the imprint of her passion, the mark of someone who lives and breathes the sport.\n\n\u201cKatlin\u2019s vision is second to none,\u201d Temi Fagbenle said. \u201cI love, I love love playing with her. I know I\u2019m open, but I don\u2019t know if she knows I\u2019m open, then she knows and I\u2019m like, Oh my gosh, she knew!\u201d\n\nOff the court, Clark\u2019s influence extends far beyond the game. She\u2019s a beacon for young athletes, especially girls who see in her a reflection of their own aspirations. Her journey, marked by triumphs and tribulations, speaks volumes about the power of perseverance and the significance of staying true to oneself. She shows them that it\u2019s possible to be fiercely competitive and deeply compassionate, to pursue their dreams while uplifting others.\n\nThere\u2019s lots of false narratives out there right now,\u201d Sparks head coach Curt Miller said. \u201cCaitlin is a fantastic player off to a great start. The numbers that she\u2019s already putting up are impressive. Obviously, people want more. The eyes that are on our game are at an all-time high right now, and it\u2019s great for our game.\u201d\n\nHer impact on the WNBA is not just significant \u2013 it\u2019s transformative. She\u2019s part of a wave of new talent, infusing the league with renewed energy and excitement. Her presence is a constant reminder of the league\u2019s potential and the incredible athletes shaping its future. Each game she plays is a step toward a brighter future for women\u2019s basketball.\n\nIn Caitlin Clark, we see the game\u2019s future\u2014bold, brilliant, and boundless.

As she continues to carry the weight of the women\u2019s basketball world on her shoulders, she does so with a grace that promises a bright, inclusive, and thrilling future for the sport we love.\n\n\u201cThis is my job, this is what I love to do, but I never want to lose the fun of the game, and nights like tonight remind me why I love playing basketball,\u201d Clark said.

(Photo by Kate Stuzin)\n\nBy Kate Stuzin May 25, 2024 at 2:31 pm PDT\n\nAfter her shift as a flight attendant, Najah Williams drove two long hours from Ontario, California to Riverside. Why? To satisfy her kava craving. Kava nectar is brewed from the roots of the kava plant. The drink has been a Pacific island tradition for over 3000 years which adherents say promotes relaxation and sociability.\n\n\u201cKava nectar makes me feel amazing,\u201d Williams, 27, said. \u201cWhen you drink it, it just feels like you\u2019re at the beach sitting in a wave. Not at the sand but in the water.\u201d The drink is alcohol-free, sugar-free and additive-free. Williams gets her kava fix at Kavahana. It opened in Santa Monica, three blocks from the beach, in February 2024. Kavahana is the only kava-nectar bar in the U.S. Wilen says this sets it apart.\n\nCo-founder Hannah Wilen has been drinking \u201cthe stuff\u201d for over a decade, to combat anxiety, she shared. She decided to introduce Fiji\u2019s national drink to an American audience. The latter half of the name Kavahana takes after her first name, Hannah. Wilen and partner Neil Bhatia came up with the idea of Kavahana last year. Since, they went from serving kava drinks in underground raves to a brick-and-mortar business.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be a bar. We don\u2019t want to be a coffee shop, either. We want to be a kava nectar bar,\u201d Wilen said. \u201cA place where you can sit on the couches and play board games or sit at the bar or do your work here and study. It\u2019s an open third space.\u201d Wilen says kava is coffee\u2019s \u201csister for relaxation.\u201d Unlike coffee, kava has a unique natural property of reverse tolerance. She recommends two to four drinks for first-time consumers to feel the effects. As you continue to drink it, you need less and less to feel the effects.\n\nKavahana enters the non-alcoholic beverage industry at a key moment. According to a DataM market research report, the Global Non-alcoholic Beverages Market reached $750.6 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $1,242.3 billion by 2030.\n\n\u201cWe like to joke here that mocktails are just juice and kava nectar is something that you can actually feel,\u201d Wilen said. Karen Locke, founder of Oregon-based beverage marketing agency High Proof Creative, said consumer preferences seem to be shifting towards functional beverages \u2014 drinks that don\u2019t just taste good but also offer health benefits, serving as a viable alternative to alcohol.\n\n\u201cThere will be more and more sober, curious people,\u201d Locke said. \u201cA lot of people are thinking that the non-alcoholic surge in sales and surge and product development is a trend, but I think it\u2019s a trend that\u2019s going to stay.\u201d Locke sees Gen Z as the group most impacted by the #SoberCurious movement. According to a new NCSolution analysis, Gen Z\u2019s interest in the sober curious movement increased 53% from 2023 to 2024. They surveyed over 1,000 Americans aged 21 or older to gather perspectives on drinking and alcohol trends in 2024.\n\n\u201cI think there is kind of a cultural push to be a little bit healthier. A lot of Gen Z turned 21 during COVID. They drink less because they were around fewer people with lockdown and bars weren\u2019t open,\u201d Locke said. \u201cPeople may have less to spend when they\u2019re younger, so spending less on alcohol-based products that might be $50, $60. It might be easier to find a functional beverage that they enjoy.\u201d\n\nWilen, seeking to use this trend to her advantage, has tapped into a significant portion of her customer base through Instagram and TikTok.\n\n\u201cI am actually the first kava content creator on the internet. I do a ton of education about what kava is, what it isn\u2019t, you know. A lot of my content is \u2018day in the life\u2019 or my failures, just being super authentic,\u201d Wilen said. \u201cIt inspires other people to start their own businesses, or to want to learn more about kava because the more we can be authentic about our business and about kava, the more people want to learn.\u201d\n\nWilen said the biggest challenge in promoting her business is challenging the misconceptions about kava. Usually when things seem too good to be true...they are. But kava-nectar\u2019s mood-boosting effects truly have no catch. A 2008 World Health Organization study found that kava extracts used in pharmaceuticals in the early 2000s caused liver damage. There is a difference in chemical composition between traditionally prepared brewed kava tea and kava in pill and tablet form. Natural kava nectar is not linked to any health issues.\n\n\u201cMost kava in the U.S. is ground-up kava root. You have to knead it and strain it for about 20 minutes before you drink it. There\u2019s another type of Kava, which is called kava extract. That\u2019s the worst kind of Kava in my experience because it\u2019s not the real root,\u201d Wilen said. \u201cWhat we serve is kava nectar. It\u2019s basically like drinking fresh kava on the islands.\u201d\n\nStaying true to kava\u2019s origins and her company being AAPI-owned, Wilen has integrated various flavors into Kavahana\u2019s menu. Customers can try ube which is a purple yam native to Southeast Asia, coconut, rose and matchakava nectar drinks.\n\n\u201cThe traditional way to drink Kava is just kava and water. But for a lot of new people, it\u2019s very difficult for them to just drink it that way because it\u2019s very earthy,\u201d Wilen said. \u201cThe reason why we do mix flavors is because we want to introduce people to cover in a more gentle way and a lot of people actually graduated drinking it the traditional style.\u201d\n\nBrianna Ibarrola, 25, embraces the natural flavor of kava. Her go-to order is the matchakava nectar \u2013 the earthy blend of the kava and matcha complement each other perfectly, she said. She came to Kavahana to relax after a busy weekend at Coachella.\n\n\u201cI feel very stable, like, level. I can still go about my day,\u201d Ibarrola said. \u201cI can drive still and everything, and it helps because I used to have social anxiety. The mental effects of it are kind of more grounded than alcohol. I\u2019ve met a few people here before, like, everybody\u2019s very friendly. I think the kava helps with that, too.\u201d\n\nAs with any small business, Kavahana now faces the enduring challenge: how to grow. Already, it has seen open mic nights on Tuesdays, trivia contests on Wednesdays and karaoke on Thursdays.\n\n\u201cAs the industry grows, it will take a lot more to market it,\u201d Locke said. \u201cIn terms of maybe events or gatherings are giving people a reason who haven\u2019t tried that non-alc beverage in an environment to go there and to continue to return.\u201d\n\nWilen prioritizes fostering a welcoming environment. She wants Kavahana to be more than just a place to get a drink.\n\n\u201cConscious connections, I think, is the big thing,\u201d Wilen said. \u201cSmiles and joy is really what we\u2019re all about. So, if we can bring that without alcohol, and we can have people come in as strangers and leave as friends, we\u2019ve done our job.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Zack Lara)\n\nBy Zack Lara\nMay 25, 2024 at 2:26 pm PDT\n\nWriter-director Daniel Epega\u2019s filmmaking journey was always tied to technology. He was seven years old when he began posting stop-motion and \u2018let\u2019s play\u2019 videos under the pseudonym \u201cLego Crafter Studios\u201d on YouTube. Epega went from bringing Lego Iron Man to life in epic recreations of Avengers: Infinity War to animating an award-winning short film about a stick figure who can draw objects into reality. Now, faced with the onset of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative software, Epega is trying to stay ahead of an uncertain future in the entertainment industry.\n\nEpega says the development of AI poses new possibilities and potential barriers for people working in entertainment. \u201cThe fear of AI and what it\u2019s going to do to change the whole landscape is why I pursue opportunities,\u201d Epega said. \u201cI like AI. I\u2019m studying it because I respect it and fear it enough to know it\u2019s going to change things.\u201d\n\nEpega is a sophomore at USC studying cinema and media, minoring in AI applications and pursuing a master\u2019s degree in data analytics. He and other aspiring filmmakers face the challenge of adapting to new AI technologies across the entertainment industry, including rapidly developing generative software that can originate realistic sound and video from simple prompts.\n\nThe fear is especially apparent in the writers\u2019 community after record-breaking strikes last year pushed for protections against AI usage. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) struck a deal that determined AI cannot be used to undermine a writer\u2019s credit or be used as a reason to reduce compensation.\n\n\u201cThe screenwriter is the most visibly threatened by AI,\u201d Epega said. \u201cThe chatbot writes scripts. It can put words on paper. That is the thing we all are presently afraid of.\u201d\n\nAI chatbots like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT can generate full-length scripts in seconds. Scripts that may take Epega months to develop can be generated with a click of a button. However, Epega is confident that writers can continue to stand out by leveraging their humanity.\n\n\u201cI have worked with chatbots and AI...and what I know that they still cannot do is hit the wits, ingenuity, and the heart of a real person,\u201d Epega said. He said companies will favor multitalented people who can work with the future.\n\n\u201cAcross any space, you will get professionals who can work with AI. They will replace those who cannot,\u201d Epega said. \u201cIf you are unwilling to work with AI assistants, then companies will see you as less efficient than those who can.\u201d\n\nEpega has interned with AI companies, tutored AI at Rice University and trained AI chatbots. He hopes that by learning about the technology and business of entertainment, he can educate others and lead responsible integration of AI across the industry.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t predict the future but I am doing my best to be a master of both spaces,\u201d Epega said. \u201cWhatever happens, I will be able to maneuver it and make changes to protect the artists and art that I love.\u201d\n\nScreenwriters are not the only ones who must adapt to the times. Directors may seek opportunities to create content quickly and at a low cost. AI can generate visuals and streamline time-consuming processes like mastering sound and rendering video.\n\nJaden Kirshner is a junior studying the business of cinematic arts and president of the AI in entertainment club, Art.Ificial. He claimed the most major upset to traditional filmmaking is emerging generative video software like Sora and Runway, which can turn images and text into video.\n\n\u201cI think those are the most disruptive ones because you can argue it gives anyone a camera and a sizable budget,\u201d Kirshner said. Despite their technical capabilities, Kirshner added that even with AI tools, filmmakers still need creative vision, skills and talent to tell a great story.\n\nLegally, generative AI technologies fall into a grey area. AI is not yet copyright-protected, so creators can\u2019t commercialize AI-generated content. Because of this, Kirshner said that most AI applications are currently used behind the scenes in post-production and sound.\n\nAI software like Flawless AI can automatically dub sound and enhance dialogue, while other models can translate content into hundreds of different languages.\n\n\u201cImagine you can translate [a film] into perfect Korean without ruining the actor\u2019s performance, with the actor\u2019s consent,\u201d Kirshner said. \u201cI think that revolutionizes the content world and the globalization of content.\u201d\n\nTo explain the power of AI in sound, he gave the example of a movie called Fall (2022), in which actors played climbers scaling a 2,000-foot cell tower. The filmmakers shot the movie practically, meaning they captured the raw reactions of actors as they climbed hundred-foot cell towers. Fearing for their life, the actors repeatedly dropped F-bombs. To maintain a PG-13 rating, the filmmakers turned to an AI sound company to redub the sound and replace profanity with appropriate language.\n\nKirshner said AI saved the film because as a small indie movie, the filmmakers lacked the time and budget to afford reshoots. Future films may utilize AI software to save millions of dollars in post-production costs, according to an article by Forbes.\n\nKirshner and Epega encourage other creatives to research AI and learn to work with new technology. AI poses a genuine threat to many jobs, including screenwriters. However, like any major change, there are ways to adapt and stay ahead of the times, according to Epega.\n\nHe said creators will find success by being flexible and staying open to AI as a possibility for creative growth.\n\n\u201cYou have to become a multifaceted leader on set because technology can become your right-hand man,\u201d Epega said. \u201c...Keep an open mind and keep changing because if you get stuck in the past or stuck into what you are familiar with, you may get booted out or fall behind.\u201d\n\nKirshner founded Art.Ificial at USC to help students explore opportunities in developing AI artwork and provide a space to learn about AI integration. He said there was a strong interest and curiosity about the development of AI in entertainment, but no community existed for students to come together and talk about it.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it will be our generation that\u2019s using these tools out in the workforce and being impacted by the developments happening now,\u201d Kirshner said. \u201cSo I felt that having that space to talk and learn about AI is really important.\u201d\n\nKirshner stressed the importance of ethically developing AI. He hopes that by keeping the conversation open, the club will help establish a moral standard for integrating technology in entertainment.\n\nThe club hosts workshops and panel discussions with creatives from major companies in the AI space. At the end of the year, members can show off what they learned by creating a capstone project.\n\n\u201cThe goal is you take everything we learned from the club and get interested in the topic, then go out, do your own AI-related work, and explore,\u201d Kirshner said. \u201cIt could be a research paper, it could be a film using AI...there are no limits.\u201d\n\nEpega encouraged writers to stay bold and remind the industry why they are needed. He said creating value for personal skills and talents is the best way to stay relevant, even when certain roles are threatened by AI.\n\n\u201cWe all have the impulse to punch the program in the face because it\u2019s affecting our industry, but we can\u2019t,\u201d Epega said. \u201cAI is going to be rolling around very soon, so if you can get experience working with computer science or get even a little bit of exposure to it, that will be a huge help.\u201d\n\nClips made by AI may lose their artistic meaning without human touch, according to Kirshner. He said that post-production will become increasingly important to carry creative value and enable human storytelling.\n\n\u201cThe big question is, will there be a point where you can\u2019t tell when a short film or TV show is AI or not,\u201d Kirshner said. \u201cThat is a really scary question to ask, and even though I am really interested in the AI space, I hope that there is never a world where we put in a prompt and it makes the show for us. I don\u2019t think that is good for anyone.\u201d\n\nKirshner said the industry will likely never reach that point. Given where the technology is headed, he does not foresee an AI takeover happening any time soon.\n\nKirshner and Epega hope for a future where humans and AI will collaborate on visual projects. Kirshner said great stories can emerge from human talent and emotionally driven storytelling, combined with the technical and creative abilities of emerging AI models in entertainment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the collaboration of humans and technology that will unlock new stories, new creativity, and great art,\u201d Kirshner said.\n```"}

Guard Kelsey Mitchell scored 18 points to lead the Fever (1-5) to a 78-73 victory Friday night over the Los Angeles Sparks (1-3) at Crypto.com Arena. Friday\u2019s electrifying matchup showcased a clash of this year\u2019s high-ranking WNBA draft picks, with the spotlight on Fever guard Caitlin Clark and Sparks center Cameron Brink. Enthusiasm teemed from the rafters to the sidelines in a packed-out Crypto.com Arena of 19,103 fans; an ocean of Clark\u2019s Iowa Hawkeyes and Fever jerseys could be seen throughout the arena. Although Clark battled to find her shot early on, a 30-foot 3-point shot in the game\u2019s waning moments secured Indiana\u2019s first win.\n\n\u201cYou embrace those moments when the team needs a big shot,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWould have been nice to hit a few more of those [shots] tonight, but we got the job done.\u201d Clark\u2019s performance for the Fever is a testament to her resilience. Despite starting the game shooting 0-for-seven from 3-point range\u2014when the team needed her to deliver\u2013\u2013Clark proved her mettle. She nailed two deep-range 3-pointers in the final minutes, showcasing the exquisite shot-making ability that made waves in women\u2019s college basketball.\n\nThe Sparks led by 11 points at halftime, seemingly having the game under control. Sparks forward Dearica Hamby, an offensive force to be reckoned with, carried the offensive load with 16 first-half points. However, the Fever staged a roaring comeback in the third quarter, neutralizing Hamby by holding her to just 2 points the rest of the game. Hamby got help from rookies Brink and forward Rickea Jackson, yet Los Angeles\u2019 inability to contribute from the rest of the team doomed its efforts. Brink added 15 points and nine rebounds, while Jackson continued her strong start, scoring 16 points on five-for-seven from the field. However, guards Lexie Brown, Kia Nurse and Layshia Clarendon stymied the Sparks\u2019 offense rhythm by contributing a combined 11 points.\n\nNext, the Sparks host the Dallas Wings (1-2) on Sunday at 6 p.m. Los Angeles will need a win over their division rival to move out of last place in the standings.\n```"}

Following a two-game homestand at Walter Pyramid Stadium in Long Beach to begin the season, the Sparks (1-2) are back in Los Angeles. Bringing waves of anticipation, the Sparks welcome rookie sensation guard Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever (0-5) on Friday night. The highly anticipated matchup was initially going to be played at Walter Pyramid Stadium, but the Sparks moved the game to Crypto.com Arena thanks to the WNBA\u2019s \u201cunprecedented viewership and attendance numbers.\u201d And, the 2024 No. 1 overall pick, Clark, is coming to town.\n\n\u201cVisibility is at an all-time high in our league. This is what I love to have [Crypto.com Arena] look like every night,\u201d said head coach Curt Miller. \u201cThe women deserve it.\u201d\n\nWhile the upgraded venue will attract more eyes to Friday night\u2019s game, the Sparks aren\u2019t letting the extra attention distract them from the goal at hand. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to be at [Crypto.com Arena], but it\u2019s another game. Doesn\u2019t matter who or what; it\u2019s about us and how we can get better,\u201d forward Dearica Hamby said.\n\nLos Angeles enters Friday\u2019s contest against the Fever on a positive note after securing its first win of the season against the Mystics. After falling short against the Atlanta Dream and Las Vegas Aces to begin the season, the Sparks handled their business in a 70-68 victory against the Washington on Tuesday night thanks to late game heroics from forward Cameron Brink.\n\nGuard Lexie Brown and Hamby have been the Sparks\u2019 one-two punch early on. With no true point guard on the team, Brown has taken on the challenge of becoming more of a facilitator. In three games, she is averaging 14.7 points and 3.7 assists. \u201cIn the offseason, I just worked a lot on my handles. I know I\u2019m going to get trapped a lot and get a lot of elite defenders every night,\u201d Brown said.\n\nAfter Brown\u2019s 15-point first half on Tuesday, the Mystics started to apply more on-ball pressure on her in the second half, trapping and doubling her anytime they could. Subsequently, Brown began to involve her teammates, finishing the game with six assists. \u201cWe expect to see ball screen traps by Indiana, and how we handle that will be a big part of the story,\u201d Miller said.\n\nHamby set her sights on being an All-Star this season, and so far, she\u2019s making an undeniable case. Tuesday\u2019s game was a testament to her versatility as an offensive force. But her impact transcends just putting points on the board. Her fierce determination on the glass has made her the league leader in rebounds so far, as she\u2019s recorded an impressive 13.7 per game. When you add her scoring prowess\u2014an average of 22.0 points on a stellar 59% shooting from the field\u2014the picture becomes clear. Hamby\u2019s chemistry with Brown in the pick-and-roll is a nightmare for any defense. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the best in the entire league at what she does,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBut even securing the win leaves things that Los Angeles must clean up ahead of Friday\u2019s game. The Sparks\u2019 early season weakness\u2014turnovers\u2014continue to plague them, and have disrupted the team\u2019s offensive flow and rhythm. Tuesday\u2019s victory, though sweet, came with a bitter reminder of this persistent issue as they give the ball away a season-high 28 times. The cocktail of carelessness and errant passes that has them sitting third in the league for turnovers, averaging a worrisome 17.3 per game. \u201cWe got to take care of the ball. It\u2019s going to be hard to win games in this league with the amount of turnovers we had,\u201d Hamby said.\n\nDefensively, the Sparks are a work in progress. They\u2019ll want to sharpen their focus on closing out shooters and quicken their rotations to cover assignments. Too often, opponents are left with the luxury of taking uncontested shots. Right now, Los Angeles is allowing its opponents to shoot a staggering 39.7% from beyond the arc, only trailing the Aces for worst in the league.\n\nOn the other hand, the Fever are still trying to find their rhythm as the season unfolds. Desperately searching for its first win, Indiana is stuck at the bottom of the WNBA table with a 0-5 record. The Fever\u2019s struggles are most glaring on the defensive end, where they\u2019ve allowed a league-worst 91.6 points per game. \u201cObviously, [Indiana] is hungry for their first win. I think they played well but have had a difficult schedule out the gate,\u201d Miller said.\n\nThe young Fever squad has shown flashes of promise but hasn\u2019t managed to consistently piece it all together. Clark has embraced the role of primary scorer, averaging a team-high 17.8 points. Third-year guard Nylssa Smith and veteran Kelsey Mitchell have stepped up as reliable scoring options, adding depth to their offensive game. \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be a tough game. It starts with Caitlin...[but] they have a ton of weapons,\u201d Miller said.\n\nFriday\u2019s matchup against the Sparks will see the Fever eagerly push the pace at every opportunity. Indiana has been trying to carve out an identity based on a fast-paced transition game, looking to capitalize on every chance\u2014whether it be from made shots, turnovers, or missed opportunities. Averaging 7.4 fast break points per game, the Fever are constantly searching for those brief windows to accelerate, hoping to catch their opponents off guard and finally break their winless streak. \u201cWe have got to match the energy that they have, up and down on the offensive end,\u201d said Miller. \u201cTransition defense is a big part of our success tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe Sparks look to extend their win streak to two games against the Fever on Friday, which would bring Los Angeles\u2019 season record back to .500. Tip-off is at 7 p.m. at Crypto.com Arena and will be broadcast on ION Television.\n```"}

(Photo by Liv Dansky)\n\nBy Siara Carpenter May 23, 2024 at 11:28 am PDT\n\nFor any young person with aspirations to host dinner parties, pairing food with wine can be a challenge. Fortunately, the Taste of Santa Barbara wine and food festival provided opportunities to learn from experts. It was a cool Thursday night in historic Old Town Santa Barbara when my journey towards soiree enlightenment commenced. As the entryway of the Margerum Tasting Room became filled with well-dressed guests, I overheard a man at the bar counter say, \u201cI\u2019m just here for a quick one,\u201d while motioning to a glass of Margerum Estate Vineyard White. As more people trickled in for the sold-out \u201cChef\u2019s Night Out\u201d event, he revealed that he is a local who works in the wine industry. \u201cA quick one\u201d in Santa Barbara apparently means a glass of wine.\n\nIn examining some of the events that took place during Taste of Santa Barbara, food with ambiance was at the forefront of the week. The Margerum Tasting Room has a very cozy and intimate atmosphere. Paired with local food, the event produced a warm, welcoming environment for guests. While I sat with my notepad out, a man came rushing down the stairs that led to the upper room. It was the star of the night: Chef Ramon Velazquez. Chef Velazquez created many hyperlocal pairings that intertwined bold Mexican flavors with dry Santa Barbara wines.\n\nSome can argue that anything can be a wine pairing as long as you enjoy drinking wine with a certain food. Others argue that there is a science involved. Chef Velazquez paired his five-course menu specifically to the wines on offer that evening. In addition, the ingredients he chose to incorporate into his dishes were seasonal and came from local farmers markets. I noted that Chef Velazquez worked backwards, choosing dishes that would fit with the flavor profile of the wine rather than letting the food dictate the pairing.\n\nAs I spoke with Chef Velazquez, a man came up and shook his hand; this was Doug Margerum, owner and founder of his eponymous wine company. He told me that Santa Barbara wine comes from grapes that get \u201cphysiologically ripe without a lot of sugar.\u201d Thanks to Santa Barbara\u2019s temperate climate, premium wineries such as Margerum produce \u201cdry wines that have lower alcohol, better acidity, that go better with food,\u201d he explained. Margerum\u2019s wines, he offered, can have notes of \u201capples and cherries, or citrus fruits and strawberries, depending on what side of the mountain the grapes were grown on.\u201d\n\nOne of the sweet pairings Margerum mentioned was his Late Harvest Viognier with lemon creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. In addition, he said, the local catch of scallops, sea urchin and spiny lobster pair well with his Sauvignon Blanc. This confirmed what I had just found out: you should know the flavor notes of your wine before pairing it, rather than doing what I normally do and treating wine as a drink on the side.\n\nThe following day I attended the Taste of Santa Barbara Soiree, it was there that I began to pick Stacie Jacob\u2019s brain about party planning. Jacob, the Taste of Santa Barbara events director, said the most important elements of party planning are sticking to a budget as well as a theme. The Taste of Santa Barbara was a commemorative community gathering used to educate the community about wine while also celebrating the life of Julia Child. The soiree was held in the Casa de la Guerra courtyard, which included circular tables with seating, as well as bar tables for a more casual atmosphere.\n\nJacob argued that a sit-down dinner \u201cwould perhaps miss out on the connection to the community, where you got the camaraderie of people coming and connecting with each other, and gathering. And so we kind of said, \u2018What about a soiree?\u2019 We didn\u2019t want it to be just a reception, we wanted to kind of have a little bit more of a party atmosphere.\u201d Deciding on the tone of the party aided in the next steps. Live music filled the courtyard with covers of some of the \u201880s greatest hits, and blue linens on the bar tables were paired with bright orange flowers that added a pop of color.\n\nJacob said, \u201cwe want to keep everything very natural and really put the focus on the food and the wine tonight.\u201d She added that events like this can in fact be held by college students, just at a different price point. Featuring local, more affordable pours demonstrates that great wine can be had at any value; it just matters what the audience desires.\n\nI also spoke with chefs during the soiree, inquiring about wine pairings and how even the most unique food can have an incredible pair. Each chef brought two to three items for guests to try. Chef Alex Bollinger of El Encanto brought abalone and vichyssoise because he thought that a white wine, like a Chardonnay, would be able to cut through the fattiness of vichyssoise, and a Sauvignon Blanc would pair well with the abalone due to its acidity. \u201cChardonnay mirrors those flavor profiles and complements them at the same time,\u201d Bollinger said.\n\nOther chefs contributing to the evening, such as Justin West of Market Forager, took the opposite approach. While he also worked backwards and matched the food with the wine, he said he enjoys pairing contrasting flavors as much as he enjoys symbiotic flavors. However, both shared the overarching message that when it comes to wine pairings, it depends on what you\u2019re eating as well as personal preference.\n\nWhen it comes to pairing wine with desserts, Chef Sandra Abu Zelli of Gipsy Hill Bakery opted to use local and seasonal ingredients. Her desserts \u2014 fruit pavlova and citrus tartlets \u2014 keep good company with a nice crisp white wine, similar to what Margerum had told me the day before.\n\nThe evening offered one of many examples throughout the week\u2019s festival of what can happen when the right wine meets its perfect pairing. Finding the perfect wine pairing and planning a party can be difficult, especially if you\u2019re on a budget or don\u2019t know where to start. With the pairings offered at Taste of Santa Barbara, one commonality shined through: shop locally. Local produce and catches provide extremely fresh and vibrant flavors that store-bought food might lack. In addition, it helps build relationships with your community and enhances your palate.\n\nWorking \u201cbackwards\u201d in order to choose food that would either compliment or contrast the flavors of the wine was another essential step. As for party planning, small upgrades, such as silverware or tablecloths, and pops of color can enhance a room immensely. However, setting a tone and maintaining focus on a central theme \u2014 food, music, community \u2014 can help guide both aspects of the planning process.\n\nFor all these reasons, Taste of Santa Barbara was an enlightening experience.\n```"}

Bhise\u2019s paintings, also making their U.S. debut, examined casteism and political revolutions through the writings of B.R. Ambedkar. At the forefront of the struggle against caste-based domination and its vertiginous implications on land, liberty, and labor, Bhise showed commitment to realizing enduring reform through activism and remembering struggles against caste, class, and gender-based oppression.\n\nOther artists went beyond traditional art and provided a unique perspective through mixed media.

Menon chose L.A. for his gallery over cities like New York or London because it was essential for the visual arts to be in dialogue with the larger movement around South Asian representation in media. \u201cHollywood is the epicenter of the conversation about global South Asian visibility, but I found that without the visual arts, this conversation felt incomplete,\u201d said Menon. \u201dBy engaging with larger questions of aesthetics, not just the visibility of South Asian people, we can have a much deeper conversation about representation. The South Asian community in the entertainment industry has been incredibly supportive and engaged with the gallery, which makes me want to invest even more in building out the gallery in L.A.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Past is a Country: Indo-Nostalgia in Contemporary Art\u201d runs through June 3 at Rajiv Menon Contemporary.\n```"}

In a nail-biting finishing, the Mystics had a final chance to turn the tide with just seven seconds on the clock, however, Sparks rookie center Cameron Brink had a different script in mind. As the seconds ticked away, Mystics forward Shakira Austin received the ball at the top of the key, poised to score the game-tying bucket. But before Austin could even think, the long-armed Brink swiftly shut down the play, delivering the game-winning block for the Sparks\u2019 first win of the season.\n\n\u201cHer immediate impact here, as she gets accustomed to playing in this league, is certainly at the defensive end,\u201d head coach Curt Miller said. \u201cWhen she\u2019s not blocking shots, she\u2019s altering shots.\u201d\n\nThe Sparks faced a tough challenge early on, trailing by five at halftime, 36-31. The first half was marked by poor shooting and a turnover-riddled offense. The Sparks concluded the second quarter with a mere eight points on 3 of 17 shooting and ten turnovers in half, setting the stage for a dramatic turnaround. Sparks guard Lexie Brown carried the offensive load in the first half, scoring 15 of her 20 points.\n\nHalfway through the third quarter, the Sparks faced a nine-point, 45-34, deficit. However, their resilience as a group spearheaded a 14\u2014to 5-run over the next four minutes, ending the game at 50. The Sparks\u2019 run ignited fire and energy back into the 3,627 fans in attendance throughout the rest of the game.\n\n\u201cWe have such dangerous threats at every position, especially in space,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThey came out and punched us first, and we recovered on those runs.\u201d\n\nThe Sparks\u2019 victory over the Mystics was crucial, especially after falling short in the previous two matchups to start the season. The team demonstrated resilience at the right moments and secured a win despite committing 28 turnovers.\n\n\u201cGetting a monkey off your back is always the hardest win. But we have two winnable games coming up and it\u2019s nice to get some confidence going into them,\u201d Hamby said.\n\nNext, the Sparks host Caitlin Clark, the No.1 overall pick, and the Indiana Fever on Friday night at Cyrpto.com Arena.\n```"}

The loudest voices in the gym? One group of 15 girls between the ages of 14 and 17. They are the only girls in the room. For the Los Angeles Select girls\u2019 basketball team, this is not just a gym. \u201cI don\u2019t see my home as my home anymore,\u201d Celine Najarian, 14, said. \u201cIt\u2019s just basketball. Day and night, every day. I\u2019m on the court.\u201d\n\nA study published last October by Dove and Nike found that one in two teenage girls drop out of sports. That\u2019s twice as often as boys. The leading cause: A lack of body confidence. These girls in Glendale are the exception. They call themselves a family, even if some have known each other for just a few weeks. They practice victory dances. They check hair and makeup. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good sisterhood and community,\u201d Ava Nawrocki, 17, said.\n\nWhy do so many adolescent girls ditch sports? According to the New York-based Women\u2019s Sports Foundation, girls have 1.3 million fewer opportunities to play high school sports than boys do. So if girls want to play basketball, it\u2019s typically with the boys. And the boys don\u2019t play the same. \u201cThe boys would never really pass,\u201d Elise Dermovsesian, 11, said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really care about girls\u2019 basketball.\u201d\n\nStep one to keeping girls in sports: Give them a league of their own L.A. Select does that with teams for girls aged six through 17. Bad coaches, a lack of community and low confidence lead girls to quit. A study published two years ago by the Women in Sport (WIS) organization said about 68% of girls quit sports because they feel judged; 61% quit because they aren\u2019t confident; and about three in four quit because they don\u2019t like others watching them. \u201cI used to be the worst player on an all-boys team,\u201d Sidney Besser, 10, said. Sidney\u2019s dad, Matt Besser, said they had trouble finding an all-girls team for her to play on. L.A. Select was the \u201cunusual\u201d exception. \u201cNow, I\u2019m fitting in perfectly ... on teams of girls,\u201d Sidney said.\n\nStep two: Give girls a reason to stay \u201cIf their mother or female figures in their lives are active, that sets up a norm,\u201d Meredith A. Whitley, a health sciences professor at Adelphi University, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pattern in their life ... to be comfortable being active, to expect that you can go out and join a game.\u201d Allexa Valencia, 15, earned a spot on her Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy varsity team as a freshman. Then, one week before the season opener last November, she tore her ACL. The doctor said she would have nine to 12 months of recovery on the bench, or her college basketball dreams would stay just that: dreams. For Valencia, the choice was a no-brainer. Six months in, she said three things have kept her spirit up: The love from her team, the support from her coach and UConn\u2019s Paige Bueckers. Bueckers, a redshirt junior guard on the women\u2019s basketball team, also tore her ACL, but one year before Valencia. After a year of recovery, Bueckers led the Huskies to the Final Four in this season\u2019s March Madness. \u201cSeeing her growth and her progress after all that time not playing and all that time not being able to do what she loves \u2014 it inspires me,\u201d Valencia said.\n\nThe recent spotlight on women\u2019s sports did not just top viewership charts. Among the girls aged nine to 17 across L.A. Select\u2019s teams, almost everyone had a female role model. \u201cPeople like Caitlin Clark, Cameron Brink, Angel Reese, Paige Bueckers ... I couldn\u2019t imagine the effort I put into basketball without looking up to them,\u201d Najarian said. \u201cJuJu Watkins ... I want to be like her,\u201d Averie Wiggins, 10, said.\n\nBut how does one combat the lack of body confidence leading girls away from sports? Two girls, one 16 and one 11, said Caitlin Clark is why they\u2019re in the game. \u201cShe motivates me to go to practice,\u201d Lucia Simon, 11, said. \u201cFor her to push herself to get to that kind of stage and show her abilities more, it\u2019s really inspirational,\u201d Lara Kasbarian, 16, said. \u201cIt shows me, \u2018This is what I want to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe National Youth Sports Strategy says girls who stay motivated are eight times more likely than their non-athlete friends to stay active when they turn 24. Still, two in five girls say women\u2019s sports just aren\u2019t valued as much as men\u2019s \u2014 even when 70% of girls in a sport \u201cdream of reaching the top,\u201d a September 2022 WIS study found.\n\nStep three: Let girls dream big Helping her players dream big comes easily to L.A. Select girls\u2019 coach Alexa Mirzaian, who played high school ball herself. \u201cJuniors, sophomores, freshmen have even said to me, \u2018Alexa, I want to play at the next level,\u2019\u201d Mirzaian said. \u201cWhen a kid says that, that\u2019s rare.\u201d \u201cI always talk with her about going big, going pro, playing in college, maybe WNBA,\u201d Valencia said.\n\nWhen the court becomes a \u201chome,\u201d the team a \u201cfamily\u201d and the role model a woman like Mirzaian, Clark or Bueckers, it builds confidence in girls. Not just on the court, but off it, too. For one 14-year-old, it brought real life lessons. \u201cBasketball makes me stronger more mentally than physically,\u201d Maral Shahnazarian said. \u201cNothing comes for free. You have to work for it.\u201d Among other lessons: discipline, resilience and patience. \u201cSometimes, when I don\u2019t make shots, I feel bad about myself,\u201d Sidney, a 10-year-old who dreams of the WNBA, said. \u201cBut I remember there\u2019s always another chance, and it\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d\n```"}

This production highlighted the unique role of Gate 5 Theater in enriching the university\u2019s cultural tapestry and offered a voice to its Asian community through compelling Chinese-language performances.\n\nCultural Bridges in Collegiate Theater\n\nFounded by Chinese students, Gate 5 Theater has become a cultural cornerstone at USC by not merely performing plays in Chinese but also fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of Chinese cultural narratives among the wider student body. This initiative has allowed students of diverse backgrounds to engage with a rich cultural heritage through the universal medium of theater.\n\nYixiao Liu, a senior majoring in urban planning, played the role of Lao Zhang in \u201cThe Neptune Express.\u201d He reflects on his transformative journey with Gate 5. \u201cBeing a part of Gate 5 has allowed me to blend my academic pursuits with my passion for theater seamlessly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a community where everyone shares similar hobbies and dreams, creating something truly unique together.\u201d\n\nYixiao Liu played Lao Zhang in the show (Photo courtesy of Zhuojie Wang)\n\nHis involvement has provided him not only with artistic satisfaction but also personal growth and new friendships.

Christine Zhao, the co-president of Gate 5 and a junior majoring in psychology and economics, emphasizes this welcoming environment. \u201cThe most attractive part of Gate 5 is the sense of belonging it offers.

However, it also presents an opportunity to share diverse cultural interpretations and enrich the campus\u2019s cultural diversity.\u201d\n\nBeyond cultural barriers, there are also logistical hurdles. The operational aspects of running a theater club, especially one that does not charge for performances, is daunting, according to Zhao. \u201cOur performances are free, so funding is tight,\u201d said Zhao. \u201cWe depend on donations and sponsorships to cover expenses like venue rentals, which can be quite costly.\u201d\n\nMembers of Gate 5 perform \"The Neptune Express\" on stage at Tommy's Place (Photo courtesy of Zhuojie Wang)\n\nHowever, conquering the language and financial barriers while creating a more diverse theater environment is Gate 5\u2032s goal.

(Photo by Liv Dansky)\n\nBy Siara Carpenter May 19, 2024 at 6:58 pm PDT\n\nIn my circle, wine is not the first drink college students reach for. Seemingly most students who enjoy drinking do so not necessarily for a drink\u2019s flavor profile, but to get buzzed as fast as possible. However, as students transition into employees, I\u2019m seeing wine becoming a beverage of choice as it holds a different connotation than beer or liquor. Wine is considered to be a fancier, upscale drink; to some, ordering wine can be confusing. With varying colors, vintages, locations of origin, balance, fullness and sweetness in each glass, ordering wine for beginners can be closer to a guessing game than an actual science.\n\nTo break it down, I asked a host of vintners and vendors at the Taste of Santa Barbara for advice on how to help beginners find that perfect wine.\n\nStep 1: DO YOUR HOMEWORK\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost that much money to educate yourself. And the amount of time that you put into it is what you\u2019re gonna get out of it.\u201d - Chef Alex Bollinger of El Encanto\n\nAs the \u201ctech savvy generation\u201d we have a plethora of information at our fingertips, it really is just a matter of curiosity. The basics of wine is that there are four categories: white, red, rose and sparkling, but this knowledge will only get you so far. Some things that Chef Bollinger recommends we look at are \u201cthe laws of each different country, what kind of grapes can grow where, what percentage of a certain grape can be in certain varietals as well as how the naming system of wines works.\u201d YouTube or other media that teaches about wine can help you understand that a location of origin and a name offer a lot of information about a wine\u2019s sweetness, color and general profile.\n\nStep 1.5: Memorize some general flavor profiles and see how location impacts flavor\nRiley Wathenslack of Foxen Vineyard and Winery used the term terroir\u2014a French term used to describe the soil, climate and impact a region has on wine grapes\u2014when describing the flavor of wine, because the wine\u2019s environment can change the flavor of it. Wathenslack also shared a couple rules of thumb when considering wines from Santa Barbara. \u201cSauvignon Blanc tends to have more kind of bright citrus notes,\u201d she says \u201cPinot Noir from Santa Barbara County can give you kind of nice bright red fruits like a lot of strawberry. Whereas from Western Santa Barbara County and Santa Rita hills, you get much more kind of dark plum, and like blackberry flavors.\u201d Essentially, she is saying that while you can expect a certain taste from a wine, you can get differentiation because of where the wine was grown.\n\nHowever, something that I learned this weekend is how unique a region Santa Barbara is when it comes to wine. \u201cSanta Barbara both suffers and is also celebrated as being the most diverse wine region in the world. In a 30-mile corridor, we grow 72 different wine grapes,\u201d said Wes Hagen of the Santa Barbara County Vintner\u2019s Association. \u201cAnd it requires the people who visit us to really strive to experiment and taste all the different wines that we have because we have a style of wine for everyone. We are a cool-climate wine grape region that\u2019s defined by these east-west transverse valleys that bring in the ocean breezes. So we have a perfect niche for every wine grape grown in Europe. So we\u2019re kind of like Italy, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, all the great wine regions of Europe, all combined in one little region.\u201d\n\nThis is all to say that if you would like to try a certain country\u2019s wine, after doing your research of course, but at a college price, looking for a wine grown in a specific part of Santa Barbara County that matches the climate of the respective region can be very helpful.\n\nHowever, just because you\u2019ve done your research does not mean that you are an immediate expert. Trying the wines and finding your personal preferences is an even bigger challenge.\n\nStep 2: DON\u2019T BE SHY ABOUT ASKING FOR HELP\n\u201cAsk your friends, ask the sommelier or the wine store what they\u2019re enjoying right now.\u201d - Stacie Jacob, Taste of Santa Barbara Events Director\n\nSomething Hagen said helps younger people get into drinking wine is, \u201cstarting sweet and finishing dry.\u201d New wine drinkers might not appreciate especially dry wine due to how abrasive the flavors might seem. Hagen suggests starting with sweeter wines, such as a white zinfandel, brachetto or riesling. In addition, many wines that are sold at Trader Joe\u2019s or Target will have labels describing their sweetness. Going to a brick and mortar wine store means that you will likely be helped by people who are very qualified to tell you about wine flavors.\n\nArmed with the knowledge of the three aforementioned \u201cstarter wines,\u201d try looking for a bottle of something sweet. It\u2019s helpful to describe what you\u2019ve tried and liked, whether it\u2019s sweet or dry, crisp and light, or high or low in alcohol content, big and full bodied or grown in a very specific region. Consulting with your friends or fellow new wine drinkers is also a great way to take a step into adulthood. Finding a group of people with a similar interests and budget means casting a wider net for sharing new discoveries.\n\nStep 3: DRINK WHAT YOU LIKE\n\u201cFinding wines that you like, means that you will grow into liking the more austere, structured acidic wines.\u201d - Frank Ostini of Hitching Post Wines\n\nYou do not have to like every wine you drink, or even enjoy it on the first time. The first wine you buy should be basic, because a complex wine can be very hard to enjoy for beginners. However, always getting a wine that you enjoy can be difficult when you are starting out; so one way to enjoy a robust wine is with food. Frank Ostini, a pioneer in the Santa Barbara wine industry for the past 40 years, noted that \u201cenjoying wine is a learned hobby that can take a long time.\u201d It is a medium that requires patience and experimentation, but the reward is worth the effort.\n\nHe is excited about the next generation of wine drinkers, and eager to see how they shape the future of the industry. \u201cYou might as well start young because one of the finest things is enjoying food and wine together. And that, of course, opens you up to having friends and people and enjoying life. Because that\u2019s what it\u2019s about,\u201d said Ostini.\n\nWine can symbolize a coming of age, and eventually with age comes refined taste.\u201dThe more expensive wines get more complex,\u201d Ostini says \u201cThe best wines I\u2019ve ever had, you really don\u2019t even have to put them in your mouth. You put small amounts in your mouth and you can taste them forever. And the smells are exotic. And that\u2019s why they\u2019re so expensive, because you can enjoy such small amounts of them.\u201d\n\nOnce you graduate to the fine wine category, enjoying wine can become a communal activity. This experience gives you the opportunity to share one of life\u2019s luxuries with someone else and watch as your tastes mature together. Liking expensive, dry wine might not be an immediate thing; but it can be very rewarding over time.\n\nStep 4: ENJOY THE LEARNING CURVE\n\u201cExperiment and give yourself a chance to be wrong\u201d- Wes Hagen of the Santa Barbara County Vintner\u2019s Association\n\nThis is where the fun part comes in. Drinking a reasonable amount of wine over an extended time period can expose you to so many different flavors. I\u2019ve found this experimentation has taught me what I do and do not like to drink. \u201cGive yourself a chance to be right,\u201d Hagen said. \u201cGet with a group of people that are also learning about wine. And once a month, everybody gets in a room together, everyone brings a wine according to a theme, white wines under 20 bucks, red wines under 20 bucks, etc. and everyone tastes it and makes their comments on it.\u201d\n\nAs we transition into adulthood, enjoying wine should be done with community in mind. Developing and trusting our palates only comes from experience. As new techniques develop and old ones continue, it is up to us to decide what we prefer and what we don\u2019t. We have a lifetime to learn about wine, but there is no better time than the present to get started.\n```"}

A galette is a buttery, flaky canvas on which the incredible variety of springtime produce can shine.\n\n\u201cAll of our fruits and vegetables are from the farmers market,\u201d said Barton. \u201cWe try to source as local and as fresh as possible. We have a relationship with all of the farmers, so it\u2019s important that they\u2019re represented. And their produce is gorgeous, so why would we not source from them?\u201d\n\nRoaming the Old Town Santa Barbara Farmers Market on State St., Barton opted to lean into green for the savory option. She dreamt up an asparagus galette paired with homemade ricotta, freshly shelled English peas and a lemony herb salad. Likewise intent on celebrating the season, blueberries and apples inspired King\u2019s sweet version.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something seasonal, so I started with strawberry and experimented with rhubarb, but landed on apple and blueberry,\u201d said King. \u201cThey were all good, but that combination was the best.\u201d\n\nSeasonality and locality are two of the key tenants on which Apples to Zucchini was founded. The school, which offers workshops for children, teens and adults, also emphasizes the importance of cooking, eating and cleaning together as a group.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the community,\u201d said Barton. \u201cNancy [Martz], our founder, is partly Austrian and I\u2019m Swiss and French, so we both grew up eating around the table with table manners. Every day was family time for us, and this is something we want to share. We want to teach kids and adults to set the table, to be part of a community and not just eat in front of a TV.\u201d\n\nThis commitment to community keeps locals coming back. Madison Daugherty, alongside her mother, were eager to participate in the galette workshop after taking a paella class the previous year.\n\n\u201cWe just had the most fabulous experience ever, so we wanted to do it again this year,\u201d she said.\n\nDue to an upcoming building auction in June, Apples to Zucchini is relocating from its current address at 2300 Garden St. to the Santa Barbara Middle School for its summer programming. The board members are in the process of finding a more permanent home, but they hope to find a kitchen space that can also accommodate events.\n```"}

Her presence is felt in the lengthy lines that regularly build up outside of La Super-Rica Taqueria, in the A.C. Postel Memorial Rose Garden where roses carrying her name perennially bloom and in the minds of the chefs and vintners who likewise call this region home. This is particularly true during the Taste of Santa Barbara (TOSB). For the third time in as many years, the community gathered together for a week of eating, drinking and reminiscing with the explicit intention of remembering Child and celebrating her outsize impact on this slice of California that she loved so well.\n\n\u201cMany long-time Santa Barbarans have a lot of stories about seeing Julia around town,\u201d said Todd Schulkin, executive director of the Julia Child Foundation for Gastronomy & the Culinary Arts. \u201cSo, I think a lot of people here feel that her legacy is still imbuing the spirit of the hospitality industry, and that\u2019s why we do the Taste of Santa Barbara. It really encapsulates these things that Julia loved and valued, which have only fostered and gotten bigger over time.\u201d\n\nNowhere was this more on display than Saturday night\u2019s \u201cLights, Camera, Julia!\u201d screening, where Chris Keyser, executive producer of MAX\u2019s series \u201cJulia,\u201d discussed Child\u2019s living legacy both onscreen and off with series director Jen\u00e9e LaMarque and Alex Prud\u2019homme, grand-nephew of Child and co-author of her memoir, \u201cMy Life in France.\u201d Viewers enjoyed a glass of Fess Parker wine with bags of buttery popcorn, one of Child\u2019s favorite snacks, as Keyser screened clips from \u201cJulia\u201d juxtaposed with original footage from PBS\u2019s \u201cThe French Chef.\u201d Then and now, Julia continues to dazzle audiences.\n\nSchulkin has spent a lifetime in pursuit of honoring Child\u2019s legacy and home. He sees how her positivity and infectious sense of humor have, to this day, inspired generations of people to cook and live in her image. Through events like TOSB, he hopes to continue facilitating this community-wide connection to Child, while simultaneously drawing attention to the American Riviera.\n\n\u201cThe food, the wine, the palm trees, the hills, the kind of rugged rocks, the dustiness with occasional tremendous rainstorms, it all is very Proven\u00e7al,\u201d said Prud\u2019homme. \u201cAnd I think one of the reasons that she came back to settle here was for that.\u201d Prud\u2019homme recalls taking her around the farmers markets during the last year of her life, and the joy that inevitably sparked in the wake of this connection with the people and the land. Child might have been a world-renowned celebrity, but in Santa Barbara she was a neighbor and friend.\n\n\u201cShe knew the olive guy and the strawberry lady and the lavender person, and she just loved it. She was such a people person,\u201d he said. Both in the kitchen and outside of it, Child led a life worth emulating. Her recipes are so much more than ingredients and methods, they are instructions for living. She said it best herself: \u201cThis is my invariable advice to people: Learn how to cook\u2014try new recipes, learn from your mistakes, be fearless and above all have fun.\u201d \n```"}

He\u2019s fed up with the state of the country overall but cited problems at the U.S.-Mexico border as his top issue, despite living nearly 2,000 miles away. Huges said he does not love former President Donald Trump like many others, but at least thinks Trump would \u201cput the country first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done and frustrated, the last three years have been a pain,\u201d Huges said. Huges, who moved recently from North Carolina, spoke to a reporter while visiting Seacoast Church in Mount Pleasant on a Sunday morning in February. He was with his 19-year-old son who was about to cast his first vote in the state\u2019s critical GOP primary.\n\nHuges said there are many issues he cares about and would like to see change after the upcoming elections in November. \u201cDo you want me to go get my list?\u201d He said while laughing. Then he made clear his biggest issue is people coming across the U.S. border illegally.\n\n\u201cAny issues, yes, shut the border down, so we quit being invaded,\u201d Huges said. \u201cThey are sending armies down to our country.\u201d\n\nSince the 2016 presidential election, immigration has become one of the central issues and concerns for many voters of any political party. But when it comes to supporting immigration policies from border security to immigrants\u2019 legal options, their approaches differ. And the difference between people living in California and hardline voters from red states could not be more stark.\n\nMore than half of California registered voters who took a poll published by the Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies think the U.S. borders are not secure in preventing people from entering the country with no legal documentation. But some of these voters don\u2019t agree with these approaches.\n\nMohammed Yousuf, who works in the international terminal at the Los Angeles Airport, said he always votes \u201cblue\u201d because he loves immigrants. He said he thinks the economic crisis is one of the main issues that needs to be taken care of by the president right now and that the country needs more options for the presidential candidates that can positively impact the economy.\n\nAs for immigration, he thinks it\u2019s among the most important issues. \u201c[The country] should have more people here because immigrants are the powerhouse of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should be welcomed here.\u201d\n\nHe said that as an immigrant himself, who came from the United Kingdom, he would always like the idea of allowing people in the U.S. from other places who are \u201cworkers contributing to grow this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not about Democrats or Republicans, I would always prefer more immigrants here because [the country] needs more skilled people,\u201d he said.\n\nThese divided views are thanks in part to messaging from both political parties. Nathan Gonzales, an editor and publisher of the nonpartisan political analysis firm Inside Elections, said that one of the reasons immigration is a top issue is because \u201cit falls under a broader umbrella, a message that Republicans are trying to make about security.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepublicans are going to talk about security whether that is security at the southern border or urban crime,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cThey want to hold Democrats responsible at all levels for any violence, chaos that is happening.\u201d\n\nSending public messages about \u201carmies\u201d of immigrants coming through the Southern border from \u201cjails and mental institutions,\u201d running away from criminal cases and making allegations about U.S. citizens being at risk of losing their culture and safety because of it, Republicans are increasing voters\u2019 concerns and doubts about this issue and on how Democrats are handling it, he said.\n\nThe candidates themselves are also offering vastly different perspectives. President Biden has been trying to provide more temporary legal status and work permits to undocumented immigrants in the U.S. while securing the border by supporting Senate proposals that would set daily limits on border-crossing asylum seekers, a policy that was turned down by Republicans.\n\nThe Biden campaign has also painted Trump as using cruel language and racist rhetoric. \u201cI will not demonize immigrants saying they \u2018poison the blood of our country\u2019 as he said in his own words. I will not separate families,\u201d Biden said in the State of the Union Address, referring to Trump.\n\nAt a recent speech in Wisconsin, Trump revved up the crowd on the topic. \u201cThe Democrats say, \u2018Please don\u2019t call them animals, they are human.\u2019 I said, no they\u2019re not humans, they\u2019re animals,\u201d Trump said at the beginning of April after speaking about criminal cases involving immigrant suspects and warning people that chaos would consume America if he does not win the presidential election.\n\nGonzales, who has analyzed and followed the U.S. elections closely for more than 16 years, explained that immigration as a stand-alone issue may not resonate as well among voters, but due to the broader picture painted by Republicans, especially since Trump\u2019s administration, it has gained some traction.\n\nMany Democratic voters and immigration advocacy groups have pressured Biden to take steps to protect undocumented immigrants while simultaneously executing actions to reduce illegal border crossings.\n\nEven though it looks like new immigration policy propositions are making it to headlines every week, according to immigration lawyer Gustavo Mora, not much has changed. \u201cIt is very easy to blame the other for all the problems we have in our country,\u201d Mora said. \u201cImmigrants and immigration have always been the scapegoat ever since I\u2019ve been in this field of practice.\u201d\n\nMora said that many politicians use this issue as a reason to justify their policies, specifically Republicans who blame \u201cthe invasion of immigrants coming into the United States and destroying our country when as a matter of fact, immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens of the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to data released by the National Bureau of Economic Research, this is true.\n\nRepublicans are not the only ones to blame, Democrats also use immigration as one of the main concerns to appeal to people\u2019s votes. \u201cAs much as they like to give promises about what they will do to immigration, nothing ever gets done, whether that is their fault or not,\u201d Mora said.\n\nCongress is under divided control, with Republicans narrowly holding the House majority and Democrats in charge in the Senate.\n\nCenk Uygur is the founder of the news outlet The Young Turks. He is a naturalized citizen who came from Turkey to the U.S. when he was a child. In October last year, he decided to run for president as a Democrat against Biden but later ended his presidential primary bid because of the Constitution\u2019s natural-born citizen clause, which requires candidates to be U.S. natural-born citizens to hold the office of president or vice president.\n\nTo keep running for president, he would need to enter a legal battle to gain ballot access across the country \u2014 which would cost him money he does not have. \u201cThey want you to die for the country but not lead it,\u201d Uygur said as he mentioned the Democratic Party did not want to be associated with him despite saying they support immigrants.\n\nUygur said that as he participated in both liberal and conservative television interviews, viewers would ask why he couldn\u2019t run for president. \u201cA beautiful thing happened, they would say \u2018Are you a 100% citizen or are you not a 100% citizen, I think you are... would he be less loyal to us because he was born in another country? It is discriminatory,\u2019 but the system sent a very clear message,\u201d Uygur said. \u201cYou are not equal, you are not fully American and you should be.\u201d\n\nWhile most Republican voters are in line with Trump\u2019s immigration policy ideas, some Republicans want to see a new way to deal with the crisis. Loretta Smith is a registered Republican and retired artist who thinks immigration is a complicated issue.\n\nSmith was at a rally in Irmo, South Carolina, organized by former Gov. Nikki Haley during the GOP primary. Smith told a reporter she used to work at an insurance company where she witnessed people who were not in the country legally using Social Security numbers that belonged to others.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a problem. We need to come up with some ideas to help these people that are coming over,\u201d she said. She added that some of them come because they live in places that are \u201cawful to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand why people want to come here and I don\u2019t think we just need to flatly turn people away,\u201d Smith said. She said she lives surrounded by farms and that most of the workers are migrants.\n\n\u201cWhen I look out, I am thankful for them because they\u2019re picking products that we can\u2019t get people here to do.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, even though Trump has used such harsh rhetoric for some immigrants, there are people from these communities who support him. Manuel Guerra is a Latino living in the city of Los Angeles who said he would choose Trump over Biden in the presidential elections.\n\n\u201cI know he is a racist, but he was a good president,\u201d he said. Guerra said that it is not fair to assume all immigrants come from Mexico when there are people coming from all over the world.\n\n\u201c[Many people] always have it against Latinos, they always blame that we are the ones doing bad things but half of them are working here not making troubles,\u201d Guerra said.\n\nMost immigrants, regardless of their home country or how long they have been here, said they come to the U.S. looking for more financial opportunities for themselves and their families, according to a 2023 survey conducted by the Los Angeles Times and KFF, formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation and an independent source for health policy research, polling and journalism.\n\nLos Angeles resident Maria Pineda, a Latina Democrat who retired from working at a hair salon, said she believes immigrants should receive support since they are coming to help the economy and enrich diversity.\n\n\u201cFrom all of those people who have come, some of them are doing bad things, but many of them also come to change their lives,\u201d Pineda said. \u201cI think we should receive support to fight against that.\u201d\n```"}

(Illustration by Sydni Zfira)\n\nBy Sydni Zfira May 19, 2024 at 3:44 am PDT\n\nIn a world dominated by digital media, first-time voters are bombarded with political ads tailored to their age group and interests. Luisa Tripoli-Krasnow, a sophomore at USC from New York City, stumbled upon an ad for President Joe Biden while scrolling on YouTube one evening. The ad, strategically crafted to resonate with Tripoli-Krasnow\u2019s generation, addressed issues of climate change, student debt and education along with upbeat music and a powerful narration by Biden. It was at this moment that Tripoli-Krasnow had become a target \u2014 not just of a political campaign, but of a meticulously crafted strategy to engage and mobilize first-time voters just like her.\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, both the Biden and Donald Trump presidential campaigns are working to attract first-time voters. Characterized by fresh perspectives and a willingness to challenge the status quo, these voters have the ability to sway election results in key battleground states. As the outreach to young people intensifies, these strategies signal a shift in campaign tactics and underscore the importance of engaging with America\u2019s newest voters.\n\nRecent polling data and interviews with young voters suggest that there is a noticeable lack of enthusiasm for Biden and his administration. In November, an NBC News national poll showed that Biden was trailing Trump by 4-points among voters ages 18-34. This is a sharp drop from the double-digit margins that Biden earned to defeat Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nSome young voters feel disconnected from the Biden administration\u2019s messaging, despite their active presence on social media platforms such as Instagram and X. While the campaign strategies have aimed to reach young audiences through engaging content and targeted advertisements, the challenge remains in creating genuine connections and tangible enthusiasm through online posts.\n\n\u201cI think that it is interesting because he [Biden] is trying to reach out to first-time voters on social media, but I think he just ends up getting laughed at,\u201d said Tripoli-Krasnow. \u201cAs president, he could be better spending his time doing something else.\u201d\n\nAlex Evans, a freshman from the Bay Area, remembers some memorable social media posts from Democratic presidential candidates both recently and in 2016. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of second-hand callouts, like I remember the Biden post on Twitter with the crazy eyes and I remember Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u2018Pok\u00e9mon Go to the polls\u2019 reference,\u201d she said.\n\nImmediately after the Super Bowl on February 11, Biden\u2019s social media team posted a photo of the president with red laser beams coming out of his eyes, a reference to the \u201cDark Brandon\u201d meme the campaign has been pushing. The intention behind the post seemed to be light-hearted and was aimed at trying to connect the president with younger audiences through relatable content. However, the post sparked controversy and debate, with some questioning its appropriateness or relevance in the context of the presidency.\n\n\u201cI feel like to an extent it was done in a way that it wasn\u2019t clear that it was a joke,\u201d said Evans.\n\nThe Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) estimated that 50% of young people ages 18-29 voted in the 2020 presidential election. This is an 11% increase from the 39% who showed up in the 2016 election. This reflects a growing participation and engagement among young voters, which helps to increase their influence in shaping election outcomes.\n\nThe Biden campaign not only maintains a robust social media presence with 17.2 million followers on Biden\u2019s personal Instagram account and 19.2 million followers on the POTUS account, but they also actively engage with college students through a combination of virtual and in-person campus events and organizing efforts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen that Biden has gone to a lot of college campuses to reach out to first-time voters to encourage them to vote. I haven\u2019t necessarily noticed any of Trump\u2019s efforts, but also I don\u2019t pay much attention to him,\u201d said Tripoli-Krasnow.\n\nWhile both campaign strategies are aimed at reaching young people, Trump\u2019s messaging often resonates more strongly with conservative-leaning youth. His campaign also places significant emphasis on large-scale rallies and events, which generate media attention and often feature high-profile speakers.\n\nSimilar to the Biden campaign, the Trump campaign maintains an active presence on social media, but a nearly two-year ban from X and subsequent use of his own platform Truth Social, means some young voters have found it harder to engage with his campaign.\n\n\u201cI think that social media has been very impactful and specifically the Trump campaign\u2019s usage of Twitter. When he was president there was a new Trump tweet in the news every few days and that was how a lot of people were finding out what he was doing,\u201d said Tripoli-Krasnow. \u201cWhen he got banned from Twitter, I started to see more of the negative sides of this because his usage of Twitter makes you see him more as a comedian as opposed to a president,\u201d she said.\n\nSmall, intimate gatherings and meet-and-greets are another valuable way for undecided voters to learn more about the candidates. These events offer attendees a chance to interact directly with the candidates in a more personal setting and allow for voters to ask questions and exchange ideas.\n\nChase Oetker, a first-time voter and student at Lewis University in Illinois, went to a Ron DeSantis meet-and-greet at Jethro\u2019s BBQ in Ankeny, Iowa before DeSantis had a disappointing showing in the state\u2019s caucuses and ended his campaign. Oetker is a registered Democrat, but wanted to gain a better understanding of who DeSantis is as well as the other candidates running, aside from Trump.\n\n\u201cI have a growth mindset and I want to view both sides and both political parties, so I\u2019m just looking for what values I hold to myself,\u201d said Oetker.\n\nYoung voters are the most active users on social media, making it a critical platform for engaging with this crucial demographic. Both the Biden and Trump campaigns recognize this, but more needs to be done in order to mobilize support.\n\n\u201cI think in order for campaigns to engage with the younger audiences they are going to have to adapt what their message is willing to give us as a generation,\u201d said Kamber Puebla, a freshman at USC from Gunnar, Texas. \u201cThey are going to have to be more involved with technology and be able to get in touch with us via our social media platforms.\u201d\n\nPolls specific to first-time voters are important for understanding the preferences, attitudes and behaviors of this demographic. The Harvard Youth Poll, which is part of the Harvard Public Opinion Project, is one such effort aimed at capturing the views of young voters. The initiative puts out a national youth poll of 18 to 29-year-olds each semester from a sample size of about 2,000.\n\nAs the chair of the project, Anil Cacodcar, a Harvard sophomore, helps to create the questions, analyze the data and brief a variety of government officials.\n\n\u201cWe really take into account the lived experience of young Americans and try to think about what young people are thinking about,\u201d he said.\n\nThe project doesn\u2019t necessarily engage with new voters, but they survey young Americans and ask them if they are registered to vote. Cacodcar detailed how they simply \u201cserve as a youth resource and don\u2019t lobby the youth.\u201d\n\nThe most recent poll released on April 18 found that young Americans see the difference political engagement can make. Of the 2,010 young voters surveyed, the majority believe it matters who the president is. The data shows that 57% of likely voters strongly disagreed with the statement \u201cit really doesn\u2019t matter to me who the President is.\u201d\n\nIn this poll, Biden led among 18-24 year-olds by 14 points, and among 25-29 year-olds by 26 points.\n\nIt is also imperative for the presidential campaigns to foster trust within their voter bases regarding the significance of participation.\n\n\u201cI think the main issue right now is whether or not people have faith in the democratic process. The burden will be on both parties to show their bases that there is value in showing up to vote,\u201d said a 2023 USC grad who is working as a digital campaign strategist in D.C.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2022 found that half of 18-29-year-olds in the U.S. have some or a lot of trust in the information they get from social media and around 56% of those surveyed have nearly the same level of trust in information from national news organizations.\n\n\u201cSocial media is definitely the frontier of youth vote, but more traditional modification methods might be more effective for reaching many first-time voters,\u201d said the campaign strategist. \u201cLook at Georgia as a case study, we should invest in going to voters and meeting them where they are.\u201d\n\nThe Biden team telegraphed its plans in a May 8 press release, claiming use of \u201cnew, innovative tactics of campaigning \u2013 TikToks, kitchen table conversations, and digital content \u2013 to better reach voters everywhere they are.\u201d It also detailed how they strategically used their campaign investments to target a younger audience by focusing on non-political programming and large-scale television events, such as March Madness.\n\nThis aligns with the shifting preferences of younger demographics, who are turning away from traditional network television. With the rise of streaming services and digital content platforms, many young people are starting to prefer on-demand options with limited or no commercial interruptions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t watch a lot of network TV that would have commercials,\u201d said Tripoli-Krasnow. \u201cBut, I think that going out to colleges and actually speaking to young people is important because a lot of people feel as though their voices don\u2019t matter, especially in a blue state like California.\u201d```"}

One of those students was his son, Michael, who was part of the student-led process to pick a new nickname for the district. Michael, 19 and now a sophomore majoring in journalism at USC, cites the experience as his first introduction to anything political.\n\nMichael Reo remembers it as the most political activism in Paw Paw in years, with people speaking out at student council meetings and school board meetings about the \u201ctouchy subject,\u201d some even sporting buttons proclaiming their position on the issue. Despite criticism aimed at their family, Rick Reo had hard conversations with the school board to make the change happen.\n\nParents often introduce their kids to politics, whether it be through their personal beliefs, the media they consume, or their own politicized actions. Families of USC students have influenced their children\u2019s political ideas, involvement and outlooks \u2014 and some students have even managed to influence their parents back.\n\nParents often value ethics over politics\n\nSheila Holsinger never considered herself particularly political. But when Texas Republican gubernatorial candidate Clayton Williams made his infamous rape joke during her time at Texas A&M, she found herself changing. Despite having fun being the \u201coff-putting\u201d liberal in a sea of conservatives, she just couldn\u2019t continue coexisting respectfully in the face of beliefs she found amoral. In 1990, Williams likened bad weather to rape, saying \u201cIf it\u2019s inevitable, just relax and enjoy it.\u201d The \u201cjoke\u201d led to a rift between Sheila and her roommate, to the point where Sheila moved out.\n\nWhile at Texas A&M, she met Jeff, a fellow Democrat surrounded by those with conservative views. Political involvement has stayed with the now-married couple throughout their lives, and both are still proud frequent voters. Jeff, now 54 and a software engineer for DirectTV, and Sheila, 52 and a public high school English teacher, imparted their values onto their 21-year-old daughter Molly Holsinger, a junior at USC with majors in political science and sociology.\n\nAs rare Democrats in Plano, Texas, the family often discussed politics in relation to their own lives, and Molly Holsinger cited her faith in her parents\u2019 morality as a reason for agreeing with them on many political issues growing up. \u201cI think that my parents are good people, and so if they approve or disapprove of something, that affects how I view the issue,\u201d she said. \u201cIn that very formative period, I was definitely really influenced by watching the news with them and then gauging their reaction.\u201d\n\nIn a 2022 Pew Research Center survey, just 4% of parents said it was \u201cextremely important\u201d for their children to \u201chave similar political beliefs to their own\u201d as adults, while slightly more respondents, 12%, said it was \u201cvery important.\u201d However, 94% of parents said they valued their children growing up to \u201cbe honest and ethical.\u201d\n\nSheila Holsinger echoed the importance of empathy and ethics in how she and her husband raised their children, citing her basic beliefs in human decency and human rights as the center of her politics and values. When people in their hometown put up signs saying, \u201cno panhandling,\u201d and \u201ckeep your windows rolled up,\u201d in response to people experiencing homelessness, Molly remembers her parents saying, \u201cThis is ridiculous, these people are struggling, why are we not helping them?\u201d\n\nJeff Holsinger grew up attending an evangelical Christian church, and despite the conservative politics he saw there, the biggest lesson he gleaned was \u201cthe underlying radical message of what I learned in Christianity\u201d \u2014 caring for those less fortunate than himself. \u201cThe people that are shunned by society are the people that need our help,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was about doing what was right for my fellow man.\u201d\n\nAfter one of Molly\u2019s childhood friends came out as transgender, Jeff and Sheila Holsinger saw a weight lifted from his shoulders. Jeff had previously reached out to him, taking him to a local game shop to play Dungeons and Dragons when he was struggling, and Jeff had never seen him happier than once he chose his name and began living his life authentically. \u201cIt just drives me crazy that people don\u2019t respect those things,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple thing to let somebody else have joy in their lives.\u201d\n\nAs a public school teacher in Texas for more than two decades, Sheila Holsinger has seen the destructive influence of repressive LGBTQ+ policies on children. While she begins her classes by asking for students\u2019 preferred names and pronouns, even asking if they are out to their parents so she can respect their boundaries, her office-mate refuses to use students\u2019 chosen pronouns.\n\nHer parents may have their disagreements with some of her political beliefs, but ultimately the Holsinger family is tied together by their ethics and their commitment to \u201cbasic human decency,\u201d Sheila said.\n\nDisagreement can breed understanding \u2014 or create barriers\n\nNot everyone has the luxury of starting from a place of agreement with their parents. Before the coronavirus pandemic, 21-year-old Michelle Lu, a junior at USC majoring in business administration, was too busy to pay attention to politics between school and extracurricular activities. When she was stuck inside for months during lockdown, Lu became more politically aware and felt a responsibility to combat the misinformation her family consumed from Vietnamese news outlets.\n\nGrowing up in a heavily Vietnamese community in San Jose, California, Lu lived with her mom and her mom\u2019s eight siblings, who faced a language barrier in American media. \u201cThere\u2019s so many Vietnamese immigrant kids that ... end up in arguments or are trying to educate their families,\u201d Lu said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to translate from Vietnamese to English, so it\u2019s hard to help our families understand what we understand.\u201d\n\nDue to the language barrier, Lu said her family got most of their information from Vietnamese outlets, many of which promote \u201cvery extreme takes.\u201d Despite voting for former President Barack Obama, Lu describes her family\u2019s views as conservative and remembers trying to convince her family in 2020 not to vote for President Donald Trump due to his views on international isolationism.\n\n\u201cWe ended up fighting or arguing and then I ended up crying and that\u2019s how it ends,\u201d Lu said. \u201cAnd then from there, my mom was like, \u2018We\u2019re not talking about politics in this household anymore,\u2019 so we just did not talk about it.\u201d\n\nSince heading to college, Lu has been able to have nuanced conversations with her mom about other salient issues such as abortion rights that end in a much more understanding fashion. More than anything, Lu cites her experience with her family as allowing her to interact with those who disagree with her.\n\n\u201cIt helps me see both sides, and I\u2019m able to not be as closed-minded when it comes to a different view,\u201d Lu said. \u201cBut it definitely shows that you can come from the same environment and think differently.\u201d\n\nSofia Coen, 20, came to USC from Nicaragua, where she was active in the 2018 political crisis, after which her family had to flee the country due to their political beliefs. As a junior majoring in international relations, Coen has become more involved in U.S. politics and been exposed to a more socially progressive environment.\n\n\u201cI had never really seen queer people in public,\u201d Coen said. \u201cCollege was really monumental for me in just strengthening and learning more about the political opinions I thought I had.\u201d\n\nDespite her family advocating for civil rights in Nicaragua, Coen says they avoided confrontation about major political divides. Coen attributes that partially to her parents infantilizing her and her siblings.\n\n\u201cWe were very much dismissed as children in our political opinions,\u201d Coen said. \u201cThey would not engage with us in any sort of discourse [in which] we didn\u2019t agree with them.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to personal issues, though, confrontation cannot always be avoided. Coen recalls a conversation with her dad about a year after she came out as queer, and she again felt like her experience was invalidated due to her age.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the conversation ended on his belief that I have no idea what I want because I\u2019m young,\u201d Coen said. \u201cI kind of had the choice of whether to keep defending my queerness or just kind of give up.\u201d\n\nCoen says she has mostly stopped having those conversations with her parents in an effort to protect herself.\n\nWhile some families can push through disagreements to come to a wider understanding of one another, respect for children\u2019s opinions is still a barrier for others across cultures.\n\nGrowing up in the thick of it\n\nJennifer Nehrer, 20, has been attending protests and political events for as long as she can remember. Growing up in the District of Columbia, life was always political. From watching Obama\u2019s first inauguration up close at age five to attending a protest outside the Cuban embassy after gymnastics practice, Nehrer\u2019s parents didn\u2019t shy away from exposing her to politics.\n\nNehrer, now a journalism major at USC, describes her parents as \u201cresist lib-types,\u201d being fairly establishment Democrats, while she is more left-leaning or progressive. D.C. is largely Democratic, and Nehrer said that being surrounded by that opinion certainly shaped her own views.\n\nThe influence of parental political ideology is evident in younger teens who are likely to still be living at home. Among teens aged 13-17, 81% whose parents are Republican or lean Republican identify the same way, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey. Similarly, for teens whose parents are Democrats or lean Democratic, 89% percent share those beliefs.\n\nFor Nehrer, that not only included her home life, but also her formative years at school. Nehrer went to a Jewish day school for elementary education as well as Jewish sleepaway camps, and these places colored her views on the conflict between Israel and Palestine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the first time I ever heard the word Palestine was seventh grade,\u201d Nehrer said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say anything negative [about Palestinians], they just didn\u2019t mention them at all.\u201d\n\nNehrer said it wasn\u2019t any one person who broadened her perspective, but the internet. She cited the Great March of Return in 2018 as a pivotal moment in her thinking, saying that it was a gradual change from \u201ctwelve years of cognitive dissonance\u201d to recognizing the narrative control of the \u201cAmerican Jewish establishment.\u201d\n\nWhile Nehrer agrees with her parents on most issues, this is not one of them. She described both her parents as subscribing to that American Jewish establishment, and that her father believes the boycott, divest and sanctions movement is antisemitic.\n\nShe attributes those beliefs largely to the education both she and her parents received that came solely from one side of the issue. College has generally pushed her further to the political left, but her views have not changed fundamentally. She said the greatest influence has been meeting more Palestinians and people from all backgrounds.\n\nOn the topic of defunding the police, Nehrer has differed from her parents, but she has been able to find enough common ground to have a productive discussion with her dad.\n\n\u201cNeither of us were yelling at each other ... that was lovely,\u201d Nehrer said. \u201cIt was like, so what\u2019s going on? Where are you coming from? Where am I coming from?\u201d\n\nUltimately, Nehrer recognizes that changing her dad\u2019s beliefs won\u2019t change the world, but she is still willing to have those deeper conversations.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a 60-year-old man and he goes to rallies sometimes, but he\u2019s not a lawmaker,\u201d Nehrer said. \u201cHe\u2019s not being actively bigoted, so he\u2019s not really my biggest problem right now.\u201d\n\nLessons learned across generations\n\nParents may not intend to impart their politics on their kids, but they certainly do. Whether it is by promoting morality in their political beliefs, opening kids up to more viewpoints or shaping their worldview entirely, the politics expressed in a child\u2019s formative years have an impact. And for the older generation, there is hope for the future.\n\n\u201cI want [our kids] to be able to be more outspoken and change the world where I wasn\u2019t able to,\u201d Jeff Holsinger said. \u201cPutting my kids out in the world, maybe they can change it where I failed.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2024/05/18/parents-of-trans-children-blame-republicans-for-anti-trans-laws-and-sentiments/", "response": "```\nParents of trans children blame Republicans for anti-trans laws and sentiments\n\nFearing trans-targeted violence and legislative restrictions, parents from the North to the South are relocating their families.\n\nFifty miles south of Atlanta, Anne Blair gripped the steering wheel heading down her winding driveway to drop her son off at the bus stop. What was a daily occurrence felt different this day for the 37-year-old mother of two. She was completely silent. Tears were streaming down her face while her son sat in the passenger seat. Across the country, many people felt this way on Nov. 9, 2016, the day after Donald Trump won the presidential election. For people like Blair it meant something more, it meant the safety and future of her child was at stake. Her son is transgender.\n\nBlair said she looked at her son and told him, \u201cEverything\u2019s about to change. You might not see it yet, but we\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d Parents of trans kids around the country have spent time and money trying to protect their children from the harsh realities of their local communities and guide them along their journey. As resources are slowly being taken away by local and state legislation, the journey is getting more difficult for some parents.\n\nEight years have passed since Blair\u2019s emotional drive to the bus stop across her 17 acres in Pike County, Georgia. She was right, things have changed since then. In 2024 alone, the ACLU tracked 513 anti-LGBTQ bills in the U.S., 14 of those in Georgia.\n\nAlmost 3,000 miles away, Tiffany Tilson works as an engineer just outside of Seattle. Tilson and her family moved there from Dallas last year, just two years after her 13-year-old daughter came out as trans. \u201cIt was the only reason why we moved. I would still be in Texas 100% if my daughter was not transgender. ... It makes me really angry, because now we\u2019re in a state where she\u2019s protected, but why did I have to move 3,000 miles away just for her to be herself?\u201d Tilson said.\n\nIn the two years they were in Texas after their daughter had come out, Tilson and her husband strongly advocated for trans rights. She said they went to every school board meeting, tried to meet with local elected officials, drove to Austin to talk to state legislators, and joined several trans rights organizations. Tilson noted that her daughter\u2019s experience encouraged her to study the legislative process and research all the laws proposed in Texas those two years. It also showed her the importance of local elections.\n\n\u201cFederally, I can\u2019t do a whole lot. But I can go drum up support for school board candidates that will help protect my daughter. That\u2019s what would affect our daily lives,\u201d Tilson said. She believes change begins locally. \u201cI would love to see [President Joe] Biden or the federal government do something like an umbrella protection while we work from the ground up. But, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s coming so at this point, we have to start somewhere,\u201d Tilson added.\n\nIn late 2023, Texas passed SB 14, the law that banned gender transitions for minors. Finding out that her daughter was going to lose access to any trans health care was Tilson\u2019s final straw. They had hoped laws like SB 14 would not pass so they stayed in Texas a little longer. Tilson said that had she known the propositions would have been signed into law, she would\u2019ve left the state immediately.\n\nTilson\u2019s daughter was the last new patient to be seen at a transgender healthcare clinic in Dallas. A friend in a Facebook group told Tilson about it and that the clinic might not be able to take anyone else soon. She rushed to get her daughter in and after one appointment they were protected as the final existing patient. That clinic and all of those like it in Texas have since shut down.\n\nTilson said she has taken a step back from being so politically active now that they are in a state where her daughter is protected. She had gone from being an outspoken activist and single-issue voter to being burnt out, but at least able to breathe. Tilson highlighted that she is concerned that people in states such as Washington are too comfortable with their protections and politicians. She worries that these \u201cliberal states\u201d might not realize how quickly things can go south, and talked about the politicians from just a few decades ago.\n\n\u201cTexas had a Democratic governor, Ann Richards. Oklahoma had a Democratic governor, I grew up with Brad Henry. Things can change very quickly and so I\u2019m very stressed,\u201d Tilson said.\n\nOn the other side of the country, Heather Liafsha works as an R.N. in Lexington, South Carolina. While she said her son Sebastian was not the first trans kid in the area, he was the first to have parental support. She took it upon herself to fight the school board on every trans issue that came up.\n\n\u201cI obsessively researched, I literally had a three-inch thick binder all sectioned out that I would take into meetings with them. I wanted to keep them on track and their ignorance was just impressive,\u201d Liafsha said.\n\nOne recurring theme in these meetings was her son\u2019s ability to be on the high school swim team. Sebastian, who is now 22, had been swimming on the girls team, but finally was allowed to join the boys\u2019 team senior year after he got top surgery and his testosterone levels reached a certain threshold. All year, Sebastian had been looking forward to his \u201csenior night,\u201d a swim meet where the school honored all of the soon-to-be graduates. The night before, Liafsha got a call that her son wouldn\u2019t be able to swim. She said she went to the school the next morning the second the doors opened with her binder in hand.\n\nNot only did Sebastian have his mom defending him, but other parents of the swim team were calling the school district and athletic director. They were refusing to swim if Sebastian wasn\u2019t allowed in the water. That night, other students and parents came to the swim meet in pride shirts and with signs that said, \u201cSebastian is the pride of our team.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have goosebumps just thinking about it. He got to swim, but we were furious with the athletic directors,\u201d Liafsha said.\n\nSebastian said that while the community support was empowering, there is almost no support from South Carolina politicians. He and his mother both cited Republican Gov. Henry McMaster as the face of anti-trans legislation in their state. Two years after Sebastian graduated, McMaster signed the \u201cSave Women\u2019s Sports Act,\u201d which banned transgender students from participating in school sports aligned to their gender identity.\n\nIn January, the South Carolina House of Representatives approved the \u201cHelp Not Harm Bill,\u201d which will ban all gender-affirming care for minors and force school officials to out students to their parents. The bill was recently approved and is awaiting McMaster\u2019s signature.\n\n\u201cThis is a good idea to keep young people safe and healthy. If they wanna make those decisions later when they\u2019re adults then that\u2019s a different story, but we must prevent our young people from making irreversible errors,\u201d McMaster said at a January news conference.\n\nSebastian said he is extremely worried about the effect this will have on trans children throughout the state as it is disheartening and does more damage than good.\n\n\u201cQuite literally my entire transition as a minor is no longer allowed. I had top surgery at 17, I went on testosterone at 15 or 16. All of the resources I used as a child, the places, the endocrinologist I went to, the therapy groups I saw, they\u2019re all disbanded. It\u2019s all been shut down. No one can do what I did,\u201d Sebastian said.\n\nLiafsha said she puts all the blame on Republicans and what she called the normalization of hatred since Trump was elected in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans want my son dead. That\u2019s the stuff that they\u2019ve said, especially with them calling [transgender people] groomers and pedophiles,\u201d Liafhsa said.\n\nLiafhsa and her son both stated that while they know the Republican Party is much more harmful to the trans community, they aren\u2019t enthusiastic about voting for Democrats this coming November.\n\nIn February, Liafsha and her husband were at an early voting center in South Carolina. Her husband was wearing a zip-up hoodie with a gray t-shirt under that had a rainbow heart on it, but they were there to vote for Nikki Haley in the Republican presidential primary. They are registered Democrats, but said that it felt more important to vote against Trump than participate in the Democratic primary.\n\nLiafsha and her husband said if Trump were re-elected they are confident that more laws like the ones passed and proposed in South Carolina would come into effect.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to Democrats, I don\u2019t see them doing much either ... The Democrats aren\u2019t helping, but they aren\u2019t actively pushing for an insurrection and actively pushing hate,\u201d Liafsha said.\n\nLiafsha and her son are both planning to vote for Biden in November.\n\nOne state to the south, Blair, who is a food safety specialist, said she is pushing her husband to find work in a different state. She wants to get out of Georgia. Her husband works in the railroad industry, so she says he will have opportunities in most places throughout the country.\n\nBlair emphasized the lack of community and protection laws for her now-18-year-old trans son as the reason she wants to leave the state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking to move either to a blue state where they have protection laws or to a more urban area where they have a local community. You need one or the other ... That community is what is going to band together and help get those laws changed,\u201d Blair said.\n\nBlair embodies the concept of a mother who is willing to give up her home and livelihood to protect her child and provide him with a safe environment. She doesn\u2019t want to move, but she knows what she has to do.\n\n\u201cI love my 16 acres. I love the three horses and the cats. But, I don\u2019t like the lack of resources,\u201d Blair said.\n\nSince her son came out, Blair has fought with the school board and, unapologetically, with her local community in Facebook groups. She is more concerned about her local politics since Georgia has two Democratic senators, but she still hasn\u2019t seen real change.\n\nLast year, Georgia passed SB 140, which banned the treatment of gender dysphoria for minors in hospitals and prohibited most surgical procedures associated with it.\n\nBlair hopes to see change on a federal level, but similar to Tilson, doesn\u2019t see that happening. Blair cited a mistrust in the judicial system as well. She said the Supreme Court used to be a beacon of hope for issues such as civil rights, abortion access and gay marriage, but now is illegitimate largely due to Trump.\n\n\u201cIt went shit when Trump got there because he packed it with Republican justices. The legitimacy of the Supreme Court has just gone downhill in the past three years. Just shady, shady opinions with stupid reasoning,\u201d Blair said.\n\nBlair worries that the trans community will be the next target of the Supreme Court. She said that since issues such as affirming gay marriage as legal were secured, it seems as if Republicans need a new marginalized group to come after.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re picking on trans people because they don\u2019t have everything under their thumb. They\u2019re scared of the other, they didn\u2019t learn from history,\u201d Blair said.\n\nBlair believes there is an increasing normalization of radical opinions among Republicans across the country, trans rights being one of their issues. She fears what this will mean for the future of her child.\n\nTilson, Liafsha and Blair said fear-mongering and over-politicization by members of the Republican Party only make their fears worse \u2014 especially when considering the February death by suicide of transgender teen Nex Benedict following a fight in the school bathroom.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just terrified. Terrified of my son becoming a hashtag,\u201d Blair said.\n```"}

A California bill wants to change that\n\nMany say the bill would help survivors be heard, broadening the range of people able to petition to see their sentence reviewed.\n\nOrganizers from Survived and Punished California, Asian Law Caucus, and California Immigrant Youth Justice Alliance at a car rally in May 2020, outside the San Francisco Ice building during an immigration bond hearing.\n\nBy Victoria Valenzuela May 17, 2024 at 1:07 am PDT\n\nIn 1995, on the day before Kelly Savage-Rodriguez planned to flee her abusive husband, she ran some final errands while her children, ages three and one, napped. She hoped to take them on the early morning Amtrak from Porterville, California, to Los Angeles and stay with her brother, but when she returned, she said, she found that her husband had beaten and killed her three-year-old son, Justin. She called 911. The police arrested her along with her husband. Savage-Rodriguez was jailed as she awaited trial, and said her lawyer did not have training in advocating for clients who suffered domestic violence. The judge used her history of abuse against her, she said, and said she was equally at fault for her son\u2019s death under California\u2019s \u201cfailure to protect\u201d charges that can criminalize the non-abusive parent in a domestic violence case because she had not fled. She was later convicted and sentenced to life without parole, same as her abuser.\n\nKelly Savage-Rodriguez and her son, Justin.\n\nIn the United States, survivors who are criminally charged often do not have their history of abuse taken into account during court to help judges and juries understand the circumstances, and they can face scrutiny or disbelief when they do share their stories. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter what I did or didn\u2019t do, it didn\u2019t matter how much I was trying,\u201d said Savage-Rodriguez, who was released in 2018 following a pardon and is now a coordinator for California Coalition for Women Prisoners. \u201cNone of it mattered. They wanted a conviction and that\u2019s all that they were concerned with.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, advocates are pushing for sentencing reforms that would provide a more trauma-informed approach to survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking. In the past five years, lawmakers in New York, Louisiana, Georgia, Virginia, and Wyoming have passed legislation to vacate the sentences of survivors. Now, organizers in California, where Savage-Rodriguez is from and where many other survivors are still incarcerated, are mobilizing for sentencing reform.\n\nSince 2021, the state already mandates courts to consider the experiences of survivors who have been convicted of non-violent crime. But a new bill championed by assembly member Mia Bonta \u2013 AB2354, the Justice for Survivors act \u2013 would go much further, allowing all abuse survivors to petition the court to vacate their arrests, convictions or adjudications, and also order law enforcement and courts to seal records related to the arrest and offense.\n\nDomestic violence is estimated to impact up to 10 million people in the US, and as many as one in four women and one in nine men. Among the prison population, the rate is even higher. According to the Felony Murder Elimination Project, up to 90% of people incarcerated in US women\u2019s prisons report having experienced emotional, physical, and/or sexual abuse. This doesn\u2019t just pertain to adult women \u2013 84% of girls in juvenile detention have experienced family violence.\n\nDomestic abuse and human trafficking survivors are particularly vulnerable to falling into the criminal justice system. They might face various hurdles to leave the violent situation, such as risks of losing financial or housing security, or experience victim-blaming. Additionally, law enforcement and courts are often ill-equipped to meet survivors\u2019 victimization and may not perceive that their actions might be based on a history of abuse rather than an immediate physical altercation.\n\n\u201cNobody wins because we want justice for the victim and at the same time, the survivor [of abuse] is also a victim,\u201d said Ny Nourn. Nourn was sentenced to life without parole when she was 21, for her witness of a murder committed by her abusive boyfriend. \u201cThe focus should be about healing by ways of holding people who have done harm accountable, and criminalization or incarceration is not the answer.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in San Diego, California, seeking love and validation after witnessing her mother abused by her stepfather, Nourn got into a relationship with a man twice her age, she said. She had a one-night stand with the supervisor at her job while she was a high school senior, and when her boyfriend found out, he beat and raped her, she recalled. He then killed her supervisor, in front of her, and threatened to kill her family if she told anyone, she said. Nourn kept the secret to herself. But two years later, she confided in two co-workers, telling them about her rape and the murder of her supervisor, she said. They encouraged her to talk to the police.\n\nNourn was arrested and charged with first-degree murder of the supervisor following a 10-hour interrogation, she said. She went to trial with her abuser as her co-defendant. Her defense attorney knew about the history of abuse, but told her it didn\u2019t matter, she recalled. \u201cA judge said I was responsible for my abuser\u2019s behavior,\u201d Nourn said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t control him. Yet I was responsible for his actions.\u201d\n\nNourn and her abuser were both sentenced to life. She was sent to the Central California Women\u2019s Facility \u2013 the largest women\u2019s prison in the world. There she started attending a support group for intimate partner violence, where she met many other women who shared similar experiences. Nearly four years into her sentence, Nourn filed a habeas writ that resulted in her life sentence being vacated and was granted a second trial, during which the court decided her defense attorney was ineffective counsel because he failed to present evidence of intimate partner violence. Nourn\u2019s sentence was commuted to 15 years, and she was released in 2017. Three years later, she was pardoned by the California governor, and she now serves as co-executive director of the Asian Prisoner Support Committee, an organization that provides support for Asians and Pacific Islanders who are incarcerated, and a volunteer member of Survived and Punished, which supports criminalized survivors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to give survivors a voice,\u201d Nourn said. \u201cI think it starts with individuals, a community of people that have power to really broaden or expand this bill. That\u2019s my hope.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s new bill will broaden the range of domestic violence survivors able to petition to see their sentence reviewed, said Darya Larizadeh, a senior policy attorney at the National Center for Youth Law who has been working on the bill with the Justice for Survivors Coalition. \u201cWe really want to bring California to be in line with other states that are already seeing this as a priority and doing much better to support survivors,\u201d said Larizadeh.\n\nThe bill helps survivors to clear their record, which might otherwise cause adverse consequences, such as trouble finding employment or housing. With no federal pathway providing relief to survivors, they are left to work with the laws in place in their individual states. While there were only five states that did not offer some kind of relief to survivors as of spring 2023, most of the legislation only applied to prostitution and human trafficking victims, did not apply to domestic violence survivors and had narrow scope of eligibility such as only applying to minors or not including retroactivity.\n\nLarizadeh also said that she had heard from public defenders across California that the original Justice for Survivors Act passed in 2020 had had an impact providing relief to some survivors, and she hoped that this bill would expand the relief to all incarcerated survivors of violence.\n\n\u201cSurvivors need some kind of relief, some kind of acknowledgment to what they\u2019ve also gone through,\u201d said Susan Bustamante, a volunteer with Survived and Punished and member of the California Coalition for Women Prisoners. \u201cPeople\u2019s voices need to be heard.\u201d\n\nBustamante is a re-entry coach at Home Free, a transitional housing program that helps domestic violence survivors and other women who have experienced trauma reenter communities after being released from prison. She is a survivor herself.\n\nSurvived and Punished members fighting for the freedom of other domestic violence survivors outside Central California\u2019s Women Facility in Chowchilla, California, in August 2020.\n\nHer husband abused her for six years until she confided in her brother, who promised to take care of it, she said. In 1987, on the day before she turned 25, Bustamante\u2019s brother killed her husband. Her brother died before the trial, and Bustamante was blamed for her husband\u2019s death, she said. She was sentenced to life.\n\n\u201cIt was really, really heartbreaking. You have no hope,\u201d Bustamante, 68, said. As a re-entry coach, Bustamante helps incarcerated survivors prepare for their parole board hearings, hosts domestic violence events at the prisons and supports them on their needs following release. She hoped the bill would help survivors be seen and acknowledged.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an important cause,\u201d Bustamante said. \u201cThey just are so busy trying to lock people up, they\u2019re not hearing them, because if they heard them, they wouldn\u2019t get these harsh sentences.\u201d```"}

USC women\u2019s basketball star and 3rd round WNBA draftee McKenzie Forbes continues the family legacy.\n\nMcKenzie Forbes looks to make a pass to JuJu Watkins during a 68-54 win over Oregon. (Photo by Robert Westermann)\n\nBy Eric Lambkins II May 16, 2024 at 5:57 pm PDT\n\nThere were no summer arts and crafts camps for the McKenzie Forbes, the third-round draft pick selected by the Los Angeles Sparks, as a child. Instead, the comforting smell of her grandmother\u2019s eggs wafted through the air to greet her in the morning for breakfast during her periodic visits. As the sounds of Los Angeles traffic blended with children\u2019s laughter as they skipped and ran through the neighborhood, Forbes and her brothers, Marcus, Max, and Mason, found their adventures in the backyard of her grandparents\u2019 Los Angeles home. This home is one of the many places they would often gather to play basketball, and their shared love for the sport brings them closer together.\n\nBefore the 28th pick in the 2024 WNBA draft, before the accrued March Madness acclaim, before collegiate stops at Southern California, Harvard and Berkeley, Forbes\u2019 childhood in a Northern California suburb was marked by the enchantment of a lemon tree in her grandparents\u2019 Southern California backyard. It wasn\u2019t just a tree; it was a sanctuary, a haven of wonder and possibility for her and her brothers. It was under this tree and here at her grandparent\u2019s home that Forbes\u2019 love for basketball began to take root.\n\nHer grandparent\u2019s front yard boasted a manicured lawn adorned with aloe vera trees and cacti, while the long, gray driveway seemed to stretch endlessly, inviting her dreams to take flight. And there, nestled against her grandparents\u2019 home, was a basketball hoop, silently becoming her first love and beckoning her to step onto the court.\n\n\u201cI think for me, it was how our family bonded and grew up every weekend,\u201d Forbes said. The rookie guard\u2019s connection to basketball is not just a game; it\u2019s a family tradition, a legacy woven into the fabric of their lives. Like her brother Mason, father, and grandfather before her, Forbes is carrying on the family business, a testament to the unbreakable bond and shared passion that unites them all.\n\nA History of Hoopers\n\nSterling Forbes, Sr., cast a mighty shadow that stretched far beyond the basketball court, shaping the essence of the Forbes family legacy. A stickler for the fundamentals of the game, he was a towering figure in basketball; he etched his name into the annals of Los Angeles lore as a two-time all-city player at Jordan High School in Watts and Pepperdine University history as an All-American. He set the school\u2019s now-broken rebounding record with hands that seemed to possess an innate magnetism for the ball (869). His talent caught the attention of the professional basketball world; Forbes, Sr. was drafted in the 11th round by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1960 draft.\n\nYet, it was his time with the Harlem Globetrotters that genuinely solidified his place in the hearts and minds of fans around the planet. With his trademark finesse and flair, he captivated crowds around the globe, his name becoming synonymous with the very essence of the game itself. For him, basketball was a calling, a passion that fueled him and helped him lay the foundation upon which the Forbes family would build their legacy\u2013\u2013playing the game \u201cthe right way.\u201d\n\nForbes\u2019 memory of him is hazy, a whisper she fights to recall. As she mulls through her memories, her shoulders go back when she speaks of him; her voice softens as she sinks into the memory of a beloved fixture.\n\nHer father, Sterling \u201cSmooth\u201d Forbes, Jr., a standout at Southwest Texas State, played for 10 seasons with the Globetrotters, traveling to 61 countries with stops in New Zealand, India, Italy, Spain, and Japan to perform with the basketball troupe. He would fall in love with places for various reasons: Japan for its technology, Italy for its food, and Australia for its unique and weird animals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a remarkable situation to have a chance to see the world through the game of basketball like I did,\u201d Smooth said. Through his travels, he\u2019d learn much about the world\u2019s troubles, like the racial castes in India and the plight of the Aborigines in Australia. He also learned countless lessons about our shared similarities and the connective power of play: that laughter is universal and that we all strive for happiness and opportunities for success\u2013for ourselves and our children.\n\n\u201cThe hour and a half, two hours, that you\u2019re at a Harlem Globetrotters show, you\u2019ll forget about whatever worries or problems you have because it\u2019s just a lot of fun,\u201d Smooth said.\n\nTo Smooth, basketball was more than a game; it was a well from which he would draw lessons of discipline, dedication, and the importance of passionately pursuing dreams. But \u201cSmooth\u201d is more than just Forbes\u2019 father; he was her first coach, guiding her through the early stages of her basketball journey. His teachings and support were instrumental in shaping her love for the game and her skills on the court.\n\n\u201cWith my dad, the biggest thing I learned from him in his basketball camps was that basketball is something that brings people together,\u201d Forbes said.\n\n\u201cKenzie\u201d recalls it all\u2013picking up her first basketball at age three, her mother, Sasha, teaching her how to dribble, and attending her brothers\u2019 practices, where she would intently watch the game\u2019s nuances. She remembers being in second grade, donning her brother Max\u2019s AAU team\u2019s jersey, and sitting on the bench\u2013hoping the team would get up by 40 so her father and head coach would put her in the game.\n\nDuring the games, Forbes would veer onto the court, getting up shots during timeouts and halftimes, impressing onlookers with her quickly developing skills and passion.\n\n\u201cShe was just excited to be there, and then whenever she had a chance to step on the court at halftime, she\u2019d shoot jumpers and threes and work on her ball handling. She was always a student of the game and always wanted to be good,\u201d Smooth said.\n\nA year later, at eight years old, Forbes joined her brother, Mason, as the only girl on the Folsom Force, where she frequently gave the opposing boys fits and buckets.\n\n\u201cKenzie played on boys\u2019 teams at an early age before she started playing with girls\u2019 teams, and it made a big difference in her play and style of play,\u201d Smooth said.\n\nA Backbone through Backboards\n\nFamily is the foundation of Forbes\u2019 world. It\u2019s the brick in every chapter of her life, bound to the mortar of her experiences of love and support. Growing up in a bustling household with four athletes, her parents were the ultimate MVPs, orchestrating the intricate dance of schedules and practices with precision.\n\nWhen her parents were unavailable, her maternal grandmother, Diane Stokes, and aunt, Shannon Forbes, stepped in, always ready to lend a helping hand. They braved long drives to AAU practices that seemed to stretch on forever. Despite the distance and the time spent on the road, they never once missed a beat, ensuring that their \u201cKenzie\u201d was never alone in the fulness of the gymnasium.\n\nThese moments, these acts of unwavering support and dedication, shaped Forbes\u2019 journey and instilled in her resilience and determination. Amid the chaos of logistical challenges, a sense of togetherness and support always existed, a reminder that no matter what, her family had her back, their support a constant source of strength.\n\nFor Forbes, family wasn\u2019t just about blood, but the bond forged through shared experiences and unwavering commitment. The voices of her aunt and grandmother thundered through a roaring crowd, the hugs they gave lingered a little longer after a challenging game, and the quiet moments of encouragement spoke volumes.\n\nAs she reflects on her journey, Forbes knows that she wouldn\u2019t be where she is today without the love and support of her family. They were her anchor, guiding light, and biggest cheerleaders every step of the way, and she is eternally grateful for that.\n\n\u201cWhenever I accomplish a goal that I set out, or have a career-type defining moment, I always think back to them,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely my backbone. None of this would be possible if it weren\u2019t for them.\u201d\n\nBouncing to her Own Ball\n\nThrough basketball, Forbes didn\u2019t just find a sport; she discovered herself. She learned ways to serve others and build community. At Harvard, she and her brother, Mason, started giving out clothes and raising awareness for the unhoused in the grueling winters in the Boston area\u2013\u2013a project that athletes continue to do today.\n\nIn a world often constrained by societal norms, basketball offered her a unique freedom\u2014a space where she could authentically be who she is\u2013\u2013unapologetically aggressive, vocal, and confident. Surrounded by other women who celebrated diverse styles, Forbes felt empowered to define her identity and carve her path through basketball, a journey that continues to inspire and motivate her.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a more masculine-presenting woman, and basketball is one of the places where that identity is celebrated,\u201d Forbes, the self-proclaimed tomboy, said. \u201cWhile the other girls at recess were picking daisies, I wanted to be on the court and play. I don\u2019t know, I just always loved it.\u201d\n\nBasketball has helped the uber-competitive rookie with her self-confidence, leadership skills, and ability to work with others. For Forbes, hoops is Heaven.\n\n\u201cIt was a space for me to kind of grow personally, and it helped my self-confidence a lot,\u201d Forbes said.\n\nAlthough she failed to make the Sparks roster, Smooth is confident that Forbes will continue playing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited, and we\u2019re blessed to have the opportunity for her to play in the WNBA. It\u2019s been a dream of ours since she was a little kid. It\u2019s tough\u2013\u201312 teams, 144 jobs. It\u2019s tough to make a roster, but when you do, if she does, it\u2019ll be a blessing for our family,\u201d Smooth said.\n\nForbes is still determining how, but she considers how she will honor her grandfather\u2019s legacy when she makes a team. Regardless, she is assured that her family will support her because, like her father and grandfather, Forbes now runs the family business.\n```"}

(Photo by Dylan Luden)\n\nBy Dylan Luden\nMay 16, 2024 at 1:41 pm PDT\n\nBicycle motocross, or BMX, is on the rise, but tracks in the sport\u2019s birthplace keep shutting down. Since its addition to the Olympic roster in 2008, BMX has grown its ridership in the United States. The number of U.S. riders has increased by over 2.5 million since 2011 to a total of approximately 4.5 million riders today. The sport was born in Los Angeles County in the 1970s, but the tracks around the area have dwindled; the Bellflower BMX track is now the only one open in Los Angeles and Orange County.\n\nThe Whittier Narrows BMX track in South El Monte was temporarily shut down on March 16 by the Los Angeles County Parks Department over the blockage of a handicapped parking spot. According to Whittier Narrows track manager Roland Leal, the county is pushing for a May reopening.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like an empty spot, you do something for so long and all of a sudden you have three nights a week where you think, \u2018What am I going to do tonight?\u2019\u201d Leal said.\n\nThe Whittier Narrows track closure was prompted by two claims filed by Los Angeles County resident Melanie Vaughn, and three claims filed by Norco resident Albert Harnden. Each claimant received $20,000 in total from the county.\n\n\u201cThey could have claimed more, honestly, for the number of things that went wrong in this case,\u201d said Michelle Uzeta, the attorney representing Vaughn and Harnden. \u201cThey did ask for a modest amount, the minimum statutory damages that would be available under the law.\u201d\n\nVaughn and Harnden filed the same complaint in September 2022, citing that they both have physical disabilities and wanted to park in the handicap space at the track, but it was blocked by bikes or otherwise made unavailable. They were told to park in another spot that was further away. Harnen sought $10,000 while Vaughn wanted $15,000 for damages from the incident.\n\nTwo months after his first claim, Harnden returned to the track to use it. According to public record of the claim, he was approached by one of the track\u2019s employees, Cari-Callahan Shea. Shea allegedly told Harnden she went to the county\u2019s office to look into the claims and that his complaint was \u201cf\u2014ed up.\u201d\n\nAccording to public record, Vaughn received word of the incident and felt too uncomfortable to return to the track because of what happened to Harnden. Vaughn and Harnden then each filed for $5,000, citing harassment damages.\n\nThen, according to public record, Harnden made another visit to the track to sell BMX-related items out of the back of his car in February 2023. Leal told Harnden that he couldn\u2019t sell on track property. Leal then called the sheriff later in the day thinking Harnden was selling again. However, the claim alleges Harnden was giving one of his team\u2019s riders a number plate to race. This exchange prompted another $5,000 claim issued by Harnden.\n\nAfter the track\u2019s closure in March 2024, people in the Southern California BMX community communicated on Reddit and bmxmuseum.com about the incidents. Many were upset that the track had to close down and blamed Harnden for the closure.\n\nAccording to attorney Uzeta, the track wasn\u2019t closed due to the claims made by her clients. Rather, she said, the parks department shut it down to change how the track operated.\n\nFor the time being, riders must travel to the Bellflower BMX track if they want to ride and improve their craft. Bellflower\u2019s track is around 15 miles away from Whittier\u2019s, but the time can stack up, especially during rush hour traffic.\n\n\u201cWhittier is my local track that I went to weekly and it definitely had an impact on me when it closed due to travel,\u201d said 11-year-old Vida de Vera. \u201cFor now, we\u2019re just going to use Bellflower until Whittier opens again.\u201d\n\nSince March 2024, the county has been remodeling the track during its closure, including adding new fencing, trimming trees and repairing sprinklers, and repainting the bathrooms, watch tower and storage bins. After its closure, Leal met with the parks department, telling representatives that he had been asking them to repair and maintain items that needed fixing.\n\n\u201cIt is a blessing in disguise because now they have a reason to get it done,\u201d Leal said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be in charge of maintenance and we won\u2019t have to be here on the weekends anymore doing that. It looks like it\u2019s going to be for the better.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, de Vera placed second at the grand national race in Tulsa, Oklahoma. de Vera\u2019s nine-year-old sister Ameri placed first for her age group at the race in Tulsa and also competed at the world championships in Paris, France later in the year. With Whittier\u2019s closure, the de Veras now have longer travel times to get to practice. They only have one option remaining in Bellflower since all tracks in Los Angeles and Orange County have vanished.\n\nOrange County used to house the Orange Y BMX track. It was once so popular that it garnered the nicknames \u201cWorld Famous Y\u201d and \u201cMecca of BMX\u201d because so many professional riders went there to hone their craft. That track closed in 2016 because the Orange YMCA \u2014 the owners of the land \u2014 raised the price to run the track for operator Ruben Sanchez.\n\nBellflower track operator Tammy Estep originally believed that the Orange Y\u2019s closure would bring in tons of riders looking for a new home. Bellflower is the closest track to Orange County, but not a lot of riders came because of traffic. What really brought out more riders for Estep was the coronavirus pandemic. The track was able to stay open while everything was shut down since BMX is an individual, outside sport.\n\n\u201cWe opened up a little bit at a time and it brought more riders out,\u201d Estep said. \u201cWe went from our average motor count being maybe 10, which was good, to it being 28 to 30, which was really good, and it\u2019s just been growing since.\u201d\n\nBellflower is able to gain attention through various avenues, as it hosts a state race once a year, offers special events and holds a beginners clinic twice a week. One of the clinic instructors is former professional rider Robert de Wilde, who has been volunteering at the track since he retired in 2012. de Wilde moved to the United States in 2001 from his home country of the Netherlands to compete for GT Bicycles at the professional level. He\u2019s been at the pinnacle of the sport, representing the Dutch national team at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.\n\nOver his years of riding, de Wilde has seen the sport increase in popularity in the United States and the rest of the world even though tracks in Southern California keep closing.\n\n\u201cThe drive and the passion and the excitement for the sport hasn\u2019t really changed,\u201d de Wilde said. \u201cPeople need an outlet, they found this outlet and they all enjoyed it.\u201d\n\nThere has been a push in recent months to build more BMX tracks in Southern California. Besides the remodeling of the Whittier track, a non-profit organization called SoCal BMX is trying to build a national-level BMX track in Irvine and pump tracks in San Clemente and Tustin. Pump tracks are built for bikes, but the track also functions as a multi-use facility for skateboard and scooter users. Pump tracks consist of sections of rollers and banked turns, hence the name pump track since riders don\u2019t need to pedal to make it through the course.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great stepping stone to get into BMX racing,\u201d de Wilde said. \u201cHopefully, the cities see the excitement, they see that there are people that are out there that want to ride and they love to ride. Hopefully they see that and in turn say \u2018Maybe we can do a BMX track as well.\u2019\u201d\n```"}

USC students\u2019 film fest showcased top international talent in comedy.\n\nBaby Shrek, talking snails, and women possessed: all could be found between the walls of the Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute on the evening of Sunday, May 5th. Young filmmakers and industry professionals mingled over margaritas, Mezcal and tacos before getting into the night\u2019s entertainment: 10 comedy shorts.\n\nThe 50/50 Comedy fest is one of the two bi-annual events thrown by 50/50 Festival; the other being a Horror showcase in October. The film festival was conceived by two students from the University of Southern California\u2019s School for Cinematic Arts. Luke Steinfeld, after seeing a thesis showcase, suggested to his friend, Michael Sunkin, that they should create a space to gather their fellow filmmakers and showcase their work.\n\nSome SCA students are already working in the industry, some are working for mainstay talent-support like United Talent Agency (UTA) and Creative Artist Agency (CAA) as interns, while others are creating short films of their own. 50/50 is indicative of the two sides of Hollywood represented at the festival: both the artists and business-sided movers and shakers.\n\nAttendees of 50/50 Fest mingling before the show. They focused on making the screening size small and intimate, connecting the right people to the right projects rather than casting a wide net of viewers. Steinfeld explained, \u201cThree hundred people watching a movie is cool or getting a million plays on Youtube is cool, but at the end of the day, if the one right person sees that, especially in this industry, that\u2019s such a massive step for a young filmmaker.\u201d He emphasized the importance of being connected to an agency, being connected to the right production or management company.\n\nWhen it came to putting the invites together, Steinfeld talks about how Sunkin played an integral role in getting the industry side. After the success of the first year, they have seen the festival expand significantly. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting calls from agency people and management people, like production companies basically asking how they can get involved,\u201d Steinfeld excitedly shared.\n\nPairing this year with FilmFreeway, a company that helps festivals connect with filmmakers, the Comedy Fest received 220 submissions from 35 different countries. The 50/50 team narrowed the selection down to 10 top picks and Steinfeld curated the titles in an order that he felt best brought viewers through the night. \u201cIt\u2019s so much about the flow, the actual curation of the lineup and making sure the programming [works]. I was a DJ back in the day, so it\u2019s so similar in that way. You can\u2019t be playing crazy, crazy, crazy [films back to back]. You need a nice pace.\u201d\n\nSteinfeld emphasized the focus at 50/50, especially when it comes to picking the film finalists, was to find pieces that reflected the current younger generation\u2019s interests and humor: \u201cIt\u2019s like it\u2019s made by us, and it\u2019s for us as. And it\u2019s made by young people. And it\u2019s for young people. So the programming team is very much our age.\u201d\n\n\u201cHallelujah\u201d Brooklyn based Elena Ridker created a hilariously fast-paced, cleverly written sketch set in a hospital delivery room where a woman in labor asks for the song \u201c Hallelujah from Shrek \u201d to play while her baby arrives. As the hospital team rebukes her for failing to understand the weight of the song and its history, citing Leonard Cohen and Jeff Buckley, the script delivers more than just a baby with a gut-busting twist.\n\n\u201cLittle Issues\u201d Jana Miley is an actor who wanted to create something that she could put out into the world to showcase her talent rather than waiting to get cast in other peoples scripts. In \u201cLittle Issues\u201d plays up the pleasures of food, whole discussing other types of pleasure.\n\n\u201cBummer\u201d With \u201cBummer,\u201d by Arthur Goldbart and starring Steinfeld, scored laughs with its distracted therapist, powerless against the distracting draw of Game of Thrones while his morose client bares his soul.\n\n\u201cDafanifi\u201d \u201cDafanifi\u201d impressed with its production design and witty script by French filmmaker Jonathan Figoli. Though the humor, which is positioned around poking fun at a dialect (A French analogue to Pig Latin) might not completely resonate with American audiences, the film itself is fun to watch and engaging from start to finish. This piece solidifies Figoli as one to watch.\n\n\u201cPaulie Gets Whacked\u201d Inspired by her recent watch of \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d Millie Cupp\u2019s submission, alongside River C. Johnson, shows three stooges, herself and the hilariously costumed Laurel Kathleen & Stephanie Corkery, as a bunch of tough guys who get very... close at their weekly poker night.\n\n\u201cAdulting\u201d Zach Shenouda and Ryan Robinson\u2019s entry is about what happens when two distant friends get together. What seems like a familiar and well-worn premise quickly reveals truths that flip the script on its head while escalating in unexpected ways.\n\n\u201cExtra Special Delivery\u201d Micah H. Eisenberg is only a Freshman (at USC), but he has a sophisticated and strange sense of humor that already feels so distinct. Jokingly introduced as Luke Steinfeld\u2019s clone, Eisenberg\u2019s work calls to mind Bo Burnham\u2019s masterful \u201cInside\u201d by blending the real with the absurd in a meta commentary about comedy and his personal life.\n\n\u201cAriel\u2019s Prized Possession\u201d Karolina Esqueda Rocha\u2019s addition to the female demonic possession on film canon is singular. It is hilarious and showcases Adrienne Picciotto\u2019s masterful delivery throughout her uninhibited performance that drives the piece.\n\n\u201cLovebugs\u201d Profound, enchanting, and intricate, \u201cLovebugs\u201d was this year\u2019s festival winner. The world inside this film was brought to life by the exceptional talent, Teddy Alvarez-Nissen. Alvarez-Nissen spent the better part of a year building out miniatures showing an entire city that exists behind a Los Angeles homes\u2019 bookshelf. Living in the miniature world is an elderly snail\u2013 performed by a rotating cast of actual snails Alvarez-Nissen raised for the film\u2013 with a story about love and life. It is inventive, elaborate, earnest and profound.\n\n\u201cGardens of Remorse\u201d The final feature of the night was Jasper Hamilton\u2019s whimsical odyssey of one man\u2019s dramatic apology. With a clever, goofy premise and sepia toned landscapes, Hamilton\u2019s comedy short stars Luca Rugiero and the audience giggling throughout to cap the night.\n\nThe event was made possible by their generous team of sponsors: Canva, Leilo, FilmFreeway, La Tierra de Acre, and De la Calle.

At least 29 students have received letters of interim suspension for their involvement in the protest encampment in solidarity with Gaza, as of Thursday evening. That includes at least four evictions from student housing.\n\nPresident Carol Folt told faculty in the academic senate meeting Wednesday that the appeals process would be expedited so that suspended students can be involved in graduation events. Initially, they were banned from campus, including all commencement events. Students and faculty expressed outrage, and members of the encampment said during negotiations on April 30 and May 1, President Folt promised not to administer academic sanctions on protesters.\n\nIn a clip of a recording of one of those meetings released to Annenberg Media, there is an exchange between Folt and student negotiators. It begins with Folt speaking. \u201cIf you\u2019re seniors, and you are planning to go to graduation, something really important to me is that you\u2019re able to complete your program and go to graduation,\u201d Folt said. \u201cSo I just want to say that.\u201d Students are heard asking if that is a threat to them graduating. \u201cWe don\u2019t appreciate the veiled threats,\u201d one said. Folt is heard trying to reassure them she meant that they could be provided academic accommodations. \u201cI have had many years of experience in universities. And when students get involved in things, sometimes they are unable to or they feel they can\u2019t take the test,\u201d Folt said. \u201cThey\u2019re feeling so pressured, they can\u2019t do that is all I\u2019m talking about.\u201d \u201cI would never do that,\u201d she said. \u201cWell we don\u2019t know that,\u201d one student said. \u201cWell I\u2019m telling you, now you know. I never have, never would,\u201d Folt said. \u201cIf you need help ... we try to offer that to everybody at this moment. It\u2019s not anything about a threat.\u201d\n\nThis week, two of the four student negotiators were among those issued interim suspensions, according to Jody Armour, Roy P. Crocker professor of law, who was present for both days of negotiations. \u201cStudents detrimentally relied on her assurances that they didn\u2019t have to worry about suffering disciplinary actions,\u201d Armour told Annenberg Media by text on Thursday. \u201cSo in fairness, there should be a kind of estoppel principle at play that prevents the university, through the president, from making representations that students rely on. And then pulling the rug out from under them after they\u2019ve been lulled into a false sense of security.\u201d The estoppel principle is a legal principle that prevents one from asserting a claim that contradicts what one has said or done before.\n\nArmour also pointed out that Folt in recent days repeated to faculty that she could not intervene in the disciplinary process. \u201cShe was representing here that she could determine the nature and scope of disciplinary actions independent of the disciplinary process,\u201d he said.\n\nUSC\u2019s public relations department has not responded to requests for comment by Annenberg Media. In a long FAQ posted on Monday, the administration listed violations they say were a direct result of the encampment, including vandalism, stealing university property, noise disruption during exams and \u201charassment and violence towards DPS officers and other students.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, a coalition of USC faculty from across ranks and departments staged a rally and sit-in in front of USC administrator\u2019s offices at Bovard Auditorium demanding all disciplinary actions be dropped, and strongly condemning the response to peaceful protests for the people of Gaza. In an open letter to the administration, the coalition of faculty demanded \u201cimmediate and full amnesty for all students arrested, suspended or who were served other disciplinary notices.\u201d They called for restoring students\u2019 access to campus and participation in finals, events and graduation.\n\nThe faculty also called into question the process of disciplinary action. \u201cNo evidence was provided within these notices (of suspension) to justify any alleged offenses of conduct, and no clarity was provided as to disciplinary procedures of timelines,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThis interim suspension process involves no meaningful faculty oversight or input and is deployed in a selective and inconsistent manner.\u201d\n\nA group of faculty members went inside to meet with Folt and Guzman. Following the meeting Tuesday, members of the negotiating team said the conversation focused on the process for interim suspension. \u201cWe brought up the issue really around the discrepancy of how these sanctions against these students came about,\u201d said an associate professor and member of the negotiation team, who declined to be identified. \u201cAnd we tried to get clarity from the administration in terms of how these types of sanctions are levied against students across the university.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really emphasized as much as we could about the reason why these students were placed into the sanction was because of university actions,\u201d the professor said.\n\nIn the letter, faculty emphasized that Folt, Provost Andrew Guzman and the administration were referencing alleged reports of violence and harassment from the encampment without providing evidence. \u201cFolt\u2019s missive to the community after clearing the encampment was filled with falsehoods and vague language meant to demonize students\u2019 nonviolent protest,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThese mischaracterizations and blatant lies were also used to justify the LAPD incursion onto campus, despite promises not to bring them in except under extreme and volatile circumstances, which had not occurred.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat might be an area that we need to agree to disagree on,\u201d the member of the negotiating team said. \u201cThat we have our experience of the encampment, and not seeing any violence. And then their claim is that they have complaints of violence that have not been fully gone through the process. They\u2019re in this interim process of being figured out.\u201d\n\nThe letter describes how the LAPD encampment eviction also treated students in an \u201carbitrary and uneven manner, i.e. not all students in the area had their IDs scanned,\u201d they said. \u201cMedics, journalists and legal observers who were not part of the encampment were also harassed, some kettled by DPS and the LAPD while student journalists were shunted off to a distant area that prevented them from documenting events, as noted in their reporting for Annenberg Media and the Daily Trojan. Students also appear to have been racially profiled throughout after the sweep.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, members of the academic senate voted 21-7 to censure Folt and Guzman citing \u201cwidespread dissatisfaction and concern\u201d among faculty around handling of recent events. They also voted to create a task force to conduct an investigation of \u201ccampus events over the last several months related to the conflict in the Middle East,\u201d and produce a public report of its findings by September 15.\n```"}

On the side of her part-time job, she writes for other artists, including her friend, Chelsea Jordan, and is releasing music under her own artist brand. Her recent release \u201cWorst Enemy\u201d pulls from Noah Kahan and Lizzy McAlpine in a story detailing self-criticism.\n\nAnnenberg Media talked with Gelman about navigating her roles as a songwriter and artist. Note: This episode was recorded in March. Full transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nGelman: So hi, I\u2019m Jamie Gelman, I am from New York City. I studied music industry at the Thornton School of Music and I graduated in December.\n\nGelman: So, I am primarily a songwriter for other artists. So I am in the room with artists helping tell their stories and curate the kind of narrative that they\u2019re trying to sing about. For my own artist project, I do alternative pop singer-songwriter stuff. I relate my stuff to Clairo, Lennon Stella, that vibe. But I work pretty closely with a lot of R&B artists and that\u2019s a huge influence for me, just like having grown up listening to it. And I also write house toplines. So I\u2019ll do house music. I try to do everything in between, but I\u2019d say those are my core, my main genres.\n\nGelman: I don\u2019t remember this, but my parents say that they had this Fisher-Price piano. I waddled over to it and figured out \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.\u201d And then my dad was like, \u2018I think we should maybe invest in some lessons and a real piano.\u2019 And so after that, since I was like five or six, I just started taking piano lessons with a classical instructor. So I was playing very old school, you know, Bach, Beethoven. I was playing these classical pieces and a six-year-old, seven-year-old me was like, \u2018I hate this.\u2019 It made me hate the piano. And then my parents, they saw something \u2014 a talent in me or they just saw that I enjoyed the act of playing, but not necessarily the pieces. So they encouraged me to maybe switch instructors before I quit and so I started working with an instructor who taught me like old school rock and jazz, and that completely shifted my perspective on piano and it completely influences the way that I play keys today. I started playing everything from, like The Beatles to Stevie Wonder, The Stones, like Sly and the Family Stone. Anything from the 60s to the 80s, I was pretty proficient in and it was so fun and I learned how to play with so much swing and whatever. All of this is to say I wouldn\u2019t be writing music now were it not for those fundamental piano, kind of years. And then after that, I played keys in my friend Sofia\u2019s band throughout high school, and I got to play at super cool venues that are classic in New York. And in my senior year of high school, I released my first EP, which is no longer on any platforms, but it was a way of me experimenting with the writing part of music, of singing over my keys, because for a while I was just playing keys. But then this was a really nice time for me to learn how to produce, arrange, compose and write this whole project. And that\u2019s what kind of was the basis for me being like, \u2018Alright, at least I want a minor in music.\u2019 Then I applied to USC on a whim, because I knew it had a good music school. I actually applied as a journalism major, because I knew I loved to write, I just didn\u2019t really know if it was through music or just through prose. And when I got in and started seeing that you could in fact, do music as a full-time thing, I started making friends in Thornton. My favorite classes were my Thornton classes. I started realizing that this was something that could be more than a hobby. But the point is, COVID happened. I changed my major to music industry when I realized, you know, I just thoroughly enjoy this the most and what\u2019s holding me back is fear of failure. I\u2019m just gonna say \u2018F\u2014 it, let\u2019s just do it.\u2019 I came back to USC as a music business major and from then on, I started DMing random people, expanding my network, going to events, and saw some success through that. And that kind of inspired me to keep going and now I\u2019m here.\n\nGelman: I mean, it\u2019s really scary graduating and coming to terms with your future and what you\u2019re actually going to be doing, how that can provide a sustainable income for you. You are grappling with different problems all of a sudden, but you\u2019re also no longer dealing with a lot of BS that you might have had to in college. So post-grad is really scary, chaotic, confusing, but also very exciting in that I just have so much autonomy over my day, I don\u2019t have to take that one geology class that I just have no idea what I\u2019m doing there, and what I\u2019m learning. I can just really devote all my time to music and bettering my craft, which is really cool.\n\nGelman: What\u2019s helped me a lot in the past few months, is trying to not think too hard about anything too far in the future. It\u2019s so easy to be like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m in this job they don\u2019t really f\u2014 with or all my friends are doing this, but I\u2019m still super behind\u2019 or in my case, I don\u2019t really have a 9 to 5. I\u2019m not making a consistent six-figure salary like my consulting friends are. You know what I mean? It\u2019s so easy to think too much about what you\u2019re doing and what you\u2019re not doing, especially when you graduate. And it\u2019s like, \u2018Wait, I\u2019m an adult. Now I should be doing XYZ.\u2019 I think it\u2019s just like literally taking things day by day, week by week, and situating yourself in a place that for now feels good to you and that is somewhat fulfilling, or gratifying. It\u2019ll just allow you to be more at peace and not have to be stressing so much about future milestones. Even being present with implementing a morning routine and going from there. That has brought me so much peace of mind. In a time when there\u2019s very little clarity, you\u2019re figuring out so much, there\u2019s so many moving parts, just things that will ground you and not allow you to live in the future.\n\nGelman: \u201cJust a Kid\u201d was narrating my post-grad experience to a tee. I was really frustrated and I went into the studio one day with the producer of the song Rich Tuorto who is in New York and I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to write about that day, or if I was even writing for myself. And I just started to vent about how this process is really driving me crazy and I just feel like I\u2019m not ready for the change. And I just still feel like I\u2019m, you know, in high school, growing up and I still have so much to learn. And I just didn\u2019t feel ready for this transition, even though I was. I just started singing these words like \u2018Something\u2019s wrong, but I don\u2019t know what I can\u2019t put my finger on it.\u2019 And that became the verse of \u201cJust a Kid,\u201d and we wrote that song together in a few hours. And it felt so satisfying to just kind of speak to that narrative. And I think that it really resonates with my peers who have also just graduated. But also my parents\u2019 friends were like, \u2018I still feel this way. I still feel like I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing sometimes.\u2019 So it was really cool to write a song that resonated with so many different people in different contexts. But it was also cathartic for me to sing about because music and songwriting at its core is like a way of speaking your mind and parsing through your thoughts in a melodic, pretty way I guess. So it was really cool to write about that. And then it was my first song as an artist.\n\nGelman: I\u2019ll write with artists who are grappling with things I\u2019ve never and will never deal with, especially when it comes to, you know, racial prejudices or biases against someone with a different sexuality. Those are things that I can\u2019t really speak to, per se, but what I can do is provide the safest space possible with that artist to kind of talk about it and I guess be a really good friend/therapist in that situation. Where I\u2019m not only I\u2019m like, \u2018Alright, yeah, I\u2019ve been through that exact same thing,\u2019 but it\u2019s like, \u2018Alright, I\u2019ve experienced hardships and have felt similar ways\u2019 or \u2018I really, truly empathize with you and let\u2019s work through this in a way that you think is best.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if that makes any sense. But I write, for example, with this artist, Chelsea Jordan, who is one of my best friends, but she sometimes will go through things that I\u2019ve never experienced and because we have that bond, where she can just tell me anything, and we can just like work through it, I find that that\u2019s enough to really tell her story, just through me being a good listener and having the tools with me to just shape her story that she\u2019s made.\n\nGelman: I have a rule where, unless circumstances don\u2019t allow it, I need to at least get a coffee with the artist I\u2019m working with first and break that barrier. Because it\u2019s so weird to just walk into a room and be like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m Jamie. Tell me your deepest, darkest secrets and trauma. And let\u2019s write about it and we\u2019ll call it a day.\u2019 I hate that. It\u2019s so disingenuous, it makes for a less profound writing experience. So if I can, I\u2019ll grab coffee with the artist because it also allows you to assess like, \u2018Do I vibe with the artist? Does the artist vibe with me?\u2019 and if not, then we probably shouldn\u2019t be writing together. But that coffee or even if we don\u2019t have time for that, like sitting in the room during the session and spending the first two hours just talking about stupid shit or about something that will ultimately lead to a more serious topic or something that they want to write about. It doesn\u2019t work otherwise, so you really have to make that effort as a writer to connect genuinely.\n\nGelman: I had this one song that I co-wrote with the artist Emei called \u201cLate to the Party\u201d and it went viral and the song got like a million streams in like less than two months, which was crazy for us. We were just these small artists and writers. It made no sense. So that was a very memorable experience for me, because it was the first time I had such public validation of my craft. My friends would always be like, \u2018Yeah, your music is so great. I love this song,\u2019 or my parents obviously are so supportive and think every song that I create is like a gift from God and whatever. But finally hearing random people tell me and tell the artists that this song was really impactful and good. Someone tattooed our lyrics on their arm, like that was crazy. So that moment for me was a huge turning point in terms of my confidence level to really pursue this seriously. So that\u2019s my first answer. And my second answer is I played a show at the Viper Room in Hollywood and my parents were there. That\u2019s why I booked the show because they were going to be here and one of my lyrics in \u201cWorst Enemy\u201d is \u2018Make Dad prouder\u2019 and singing that with him watching and smiling and videoing me was just so validating as well, because all I want to do, obviously as many kids do, they want to make their parents proud and remind them that they worked so hard to create this life for us for a reason. And we\u2019re making it worthwhile for them. So, I just really vividly remember, like, looking at him. And then the feeling of joy and pride, it was just a really sweet experience.\n\nGelman: The challenge I deal with almost every day is obviously, it\u2019s a very slow burn unless you have this viral hit, which honestly, I don\u2019t really want right now because the faster you go up, the faster you kind of fall down is what I\u2019ve witnessed. The slow burn in a songwriter\u2019s life or professional trajectory is really hard to grapple with sometimes because it\u2019s not like every session I go to I\u2019m getting paid and it\u2019s not like every session I go to automatically leads to a song being released the next day. So having that willpower within me, and being determined to go into these rooms, and spend four to eight hours in this windowless studio, writing with an artist who may or may not like the song, who may or may not choose to release it, and even if they do, it will probably take a year and a half, for it to go from creation to release. You have to be so internally motivated because no one else is really supporting you. I mean, outside of my friends and family. It\u2019s like, you gotta just keep pushing and keep your head down and work really hard and I think some days I\u2019ll wake up and be like, \u2018I need a path.\u2019 Our peers have these laid out trajectories for them. Like, you follow these steps, you\u2019ll make a lot of money and you\u2019ll have this routine, and you won\u2019t have to worry about... Sometimes I\u2019m like, \u2018Should I just do that? Should I just drop everything?\u2019 Life would be so much easier, there would be so many fewer unknowns in my life and then I remember why I\u2019m doing this and like I said, like those moments of validation make it all worth it. But, it\u2019s totally anxiety-inducing and every other day I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh God, like when is this gonna \u2014 when is my work gonna pay off?\u2019 So it\u2019s really hard a lot of the time.\n\nGelman: I truly love what I do. That\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m doing it is because it brings me so much joy and it just feels so right. I feel so lucky that I found something that just makes sense to me and I believe that I\u2019m good at, and I\u2019m really, really passionate about it. I never dread a session. I always look forward to that. And I\u2019ve never really found anything else that I\u2019ve responded this way to. I also just think I\u2019ve put so much time into it already. Four years of my life I\u2019ve been devoting pretty seriously to this. So why stop now? I\u2019ve got momentum. And yeah, I guess what I said with my advice to people who are about to enter post-grad life, I just try not to think about it too hard. I do it day by day. I\u2019m like, \u2018Alright, who do I have a session with today? This will be great. We\u2019re gonna write a great song and that\u2019ll be that.\u2019 It\u2019s not like, \u2018Well, what if the song isn\u2019t good? And what if the artist doesn\u2019t like me? And what if this artist never uses the song,\u2019 whatever. I just have to trust the process, leaving everything to the universe, or not everything, but leaving the trivial details to the universe and allowing a form of acceptance in what will come and what is meant for me. That has brought me so much peace of mind I cannot even express, so that\u2019s how I kind of stay optimistic day to day.\n\nGelman: I think I was very turned off by the whole artist project thing for a while because I was concerned that people would misconstrue my title. They would see me as an artist and not think I\u2019m a writer that they could invite into a room. I didn\u2019t think that those lines could be blurred. I soon realized that was not the case and that it was actually harming me by not putting out my own music. Because of how casually people treat Spotify and Apple Music now, because of how low the barrier to entry is to just drop a song, you can treat it as a little resume of sorts. You can just put all the music that you like on the platform, and it\u2019s just another way, another medium for people to find you and appreciate your artistry. I was also very deterred from having an artist project because I never felt confident enough in a brand, my own brand that I could promote to others. I never really wanted to be forward-facing. I don\u2019t really enjoy that. But now I kind of realized I don\u2019t need to do the full superstar aesthetic thing. You have people like Lizzie McAlpine who she\u2019s just herself. She\u2019s not really glamorous or glitzy. She\u2019s just super chill and I think unapologetically just like Lizzie. And I think seeing people like her remind me that your artist brand doesn\u2019t need to be a Lady Gaga, Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9. It doesn\u2019t have to be this big distinct brand. I\u2019m just myself and if people like that they can follow along. I just put less pressure around the title of an artist and allowed myself to kind of flow between them more gracefully.\n\nGelman: So I was in Rich\u2019s studio in Bushwick, New York. We started listening to reference tracks. I was really into Noah Kahan\u2019s latest album and I really love Clairo, like I said, and just a kind of alternative pop sound that I could somehow make my own. And also Lizzy McAlpine is a huge influence. So, we\u2019re getting into a groove. And I try not to think too hard when I\u2019m writing because when I start to think too hard, it\u2019s never good. It\u2019s more methodical and structured than I want it to be. So I really like to just sit and mumble s\u2014 until something makes sense. And that\u2019s how I feel like I\u2019m tapping into something deeper within me that I can kind of turn into something if that makes sense. So I was on the keys, he was on the guitar, playing some cool melodies putting down some sort of percussion and I literally was just like, \u2018I drink my coffee black ... I lack peace of mind a lot.\u2019 I don\u2019t think I had that second lyric yet, but it was like... \n\nGelman: I just sang that and then I went into the next line, like \u2018Long drives and plane rides / Get me in my bag every time / I cry to Noah Kahan like I am from Vermont.\u2019 Because my Spotify Wrapped had recently come out and it said that my listening habits were like that of 80 or 90% of people in Vermont and I was like, \u2018What.\u2019 It\u2019s because I listened to Zach Bryan and Noah Kahan and that was memed on social media. I remember everyone was showing where their listening habits were from and I thought that was so funny. So that was where that last line came from and I wanted to give him a shout-out because he had recently been making such an impact on my listening habits. He was introducing me to folk music, and I hadn\u2019t really been listening to it that much."}

The resolution also expressed the Academic Senate\u2019s endorsement to immediately create a task force with the goal of investigating \u201ccampus events over the last several months related to the conflict in the Middle East,\u201d and providing a public report of its findings by September 15.\n\n\u201cProvost Guzman and I welcome ongoing engagement with the newly created task force,\u201d Folt said in a statement to Annenberg Media. \u201cFor now, our focus is on celebrating the 19,000 graduates of USC\u2019s Class of 2024.\u201d\n\nAmong issues brought up by the resolution were the university\u2019s banning of a professor from campus, the cancellation of valedictorian Asna Tabassum\u2019s commencement address, the university\u2019s cancellation of the main stage commencement ceremony and outside commencement speakers, campus protests and the removal of protestors from campus.\n\nIn the final vote, 21 members of the Academic Senate voted to censure, seven voted to oppose the measure and six members abstained. The censure expressed the Academic Senate\u2019s formal disapproval of Folt\u2019s and Guzman\u2019s actions.\n\nEarlier in the meeting, the Senate tabled a motion calling for a vote of no confidence for both Folt and Guzman.

(AP/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner May 08, 2024 at  4:22 pm PDT\n\nSECAUCUS, N.J. \u2014 While Ducks faithful didn\u2019t get to celebrate as much as Sharks or Blackhawks fans, ping pong balls guaranteed Anaheim a top-three pick for the third time in four years. The Ducks had the third-best odds of landing the No. 1 pick at 11.5%, but stayed put at its projected position just like the 15 other lottery teams. This all came after the team finished 30th in the NHL with 59 points on a 27-50-5 record.\n\nBut picking No. 3 overall in a draft filled with potential difference makers, the Ducks will have options on defense or at forward, which will further strengthen their already-deep prospect pool. Boston University forward and Hobey Baker Award winner Macklin Celebrini, the presumptive No. 1 overall pick, was present on the broadcast and will be almost guaranteed to suit up in San Jose teal on the draft stage come late June.\n\nSet to select two picks later, Anaheim will look to add either a goal-prevention piece or a scoring savant. Last year\u2019s draft was touted as one of the strongest in recent memory. The Ducks capitalized on it by taking Swedish standout center Leo Carlsson after falling to the No. 2 slot in the draft order, despite finishing with the NHL\u2019s worst record.\n\nWhile this year\u2019s class doesn\u2019t quite boast the same headlining talent, picking toward the top will only continue to strengthen Anaheim\u2019s future. If the Ducks want to add to their blue line prospect group headlined by Pavel Mintyukov and Olen Zellweger, drafting Michigan State defenseman Artyom Levshunov should be a top priority.\n\nWhile the 18-year-old could very well be swooped up by Chicago at No. 2, his physicality and size would greatly benefit an Anaheim team that has recently struggled immensely in its own end. The Belarusian is also not afraid to jump into gear on rush chances and create transition offense.\n\nThe Ducks should also keep their eyes on Russian blueliner Anton Silayev, who stands at an intimidating 6-foot-7 and is a force to be dealt with in the defensive zone.\n\nGoing the forward route could see Anaheim land Russian winger Ivan Demidov, if he\u2019s available. Demidov\u2019s elite versatility, playmaking and craftiness on the wing would immediately give centers Trevor Zegras, Mason McTavish, Carlsson and Cutter Gauthier (if he winds up at center) confidence up the middle.\n\nWhile the upcoming pick won\u2019t necessarily give the Ducks a bonafide superstar or cornerstone piece for the franchise, it will allow general manager Pat Verbeek to add prospect depth and give fans hope about the direction of a team that\u2019s missed the playoffs six years in a row.\n\nAnaheim also acquired the Oilers\u2019 first-round selection at the trade deadline, which will be penciled in pending playoff results. Although not picking No. 1 overall again is disappointing, the Ducks have built up a young core from slightly later picks and have solidified a squad destined to make playoff pushes in just a matter of time.\n\nAnaheim has never selected first but has had eight top-five picks in its three-decade history. The 2024 NHL Entry Draft will span from June 28-29 at the Sphere in Las Vegas, as Verbeek and company will be on the phones right away to seek out the next great Duck.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/05/08/clippers-will-george-harden-stick-around-this-offseason/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 The Clippers\u2019 2023-24 season ended in huge disappointment, to say the least. LA stood at 35-16 in mid-February after a 25-6 stretch that began with a win over the Utah Jazz in early December, and it appeared that the Clippers had a serious chance at a deep playoff run. Trade-acquisition James Harden seemed like the player the Clippers needed to round out their roster, while Paul George and Kawhi Leonard were contributing as expected. The second-oldest team in the NBA (behind the Milwaukee Bucks), the Clippers\u2019 veteran presence gave them the advantage in many of those early- and mid-season games. \u201cWe just ran out of gas,\u201d said head coach Tyronn Lue  after their 114-101 Game 6 loss last Friday . So how did a team that was on fire suddenly run out of fuel in the first round of the playoffs? While the NBA\u2019s top teams are some of the youngest, like the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Minnesota Timberwolves, experience certainly played a factor in the Clippers\u2019 success. Injuries played a significant role in Los Angeles\u2019 downfall, with Leonard playing a limited role in their first-round series against the Dallas Mavericks due to knee inflammation. This put all the pressure on George and Harden to compensate on both offense and defense, and while the duo performed well in Games 1 and 4, it struggled during the other games and could not produce enough scoring to win. The Clippers now look to an offseason that could feature significant changes to the roster. Leonard already signed a contract extension through the 2026-27 season, meaning he\u2019ll likely be a Clipper for at least three more years. The two remaining major contracts the Clippers will need to address are those of Harden and George. George is able to sign a four-year extension until June 30, while Harden is guaranteed to be a free agent. \u201cWe do have great hope that we\u2019re going to be able to retain Paul and James, along with Kawhi, along with some of our other really really good role players,\u201d said Clippers\u2019 president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank during a press conference on Monday. \u201cAdd a couple of pieces that can make a big difference and we\u2019ll get back at it again next year.\u201d If the two 34-year-olds were to make one final move in their careers, now would be the right time to do so. George, now a five-year Clipper, played in 80 games total this year, the most for him since 2018-19. Harden is in a similar situation and played in 78 games, his most since the 2018-19 season as well. Both players\u2019 longevity this year was pivotal to the Clippers\u2019 success, but the Clippers still haven\u2019t seen the championship-worthy postseason prowess they\u2019ve desired during from the George-Leonard era. The furthest the Clippers have reached in the playoffs during this era was back in 2022, when they made the Western Conference Finals, falling 4-2 to the Phoenix Suns. That season, the Clippers beat the Mavericks in the first-round for the second consecutive time and defeated the No. 1 seed in the West, the Utah Jazz. However, the following year, the Clippers missed the playoffs entirely, losing to the New Orleans Pelicans in a play-in game that both George and Leonard missed with injuries. LA\u2019s personnel may shift in other departments, too. Lue may never coach a game in the Clippers\u2019 new Intuit Dome next year, as he is rumored to be at the top of the Lakers\u2019 list after they fired Darvin Ham last week. However, the Clippers\u2019 contract with Lue has him signed through the 2025-26 season and  the team has already announced  that they plan on extending that contract before he enters his final year. The Clippers should try and keep George by whatever means necessary. Even though he\u2019s heading toward the end of his career,  he is still the offensive threat he has been for the last decade. But it likely won\u2019t be easy for the Clippers to keep him while they try to acquire and re-sign other players. Harden, on the other hand, is replaceable; he\u2019s not the MVP that he once was in Houston and even though he had some big games for the Clippers, they have bigger gaps to fill this offseason.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/05/08/ten-questions-with-puzzwackys-jack-romero-and-james-cain/", "response": "```\nThe artist project Puzzwacky made its debut performance in early April at the El Cid. Still unreleased to the ears of mass audiences, we are left wondering: Who is this \u201cPuzzwacky\u201d that we keep hearing of? Puzzwacky is the artist project from the creative minds of USC students Jack Romero and James Cain. Romero appears as the frontman clad in black leather and chains with powerful pop vocals, while Cain brings the mastermind production behind their electronic sound. Together, they meld their unique technical backgrounds to immerse the audience into the queer electronic pop world of Puzzwacky. Seamlessly fitting together, the duo appears as two parts of one moving machine. Cain\u2019s concentrated contemplation perfectly complements Romero\u2019s exuberance as the pair bounced off each other\u2019s answers throughout their interview.\n\nAs seniors of USC\u2019s Thornton School of Music, the members of Puzzwacky quickly approach graduation. Ahead of their big day, the pair cue us in on what\u2019s to come next. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. Let\u2019s dive into it.\n\nTell me, what is Puzzwacky? Romero: James actually had a really good definition of it as kind of a musical tour of our combination of interest in music. How do you describe it? How was that little blurb that you wrote? Cain: Yeah, let\u2019s see if I can remember it. It started \u2013the influences start mostly in the 80s with kind of house and queer pop like Soft Cell. Romero: Frankie Knuckles. Cain: Pet Shop Boys. Yeah, Frankie Knuckles. But then also kind of draws from early 2000s synth-pop stuff like Kesha and Lady Gaga and then some indie sleaze like Peaches and Avenue D. Romero: With the indie sleaze a lot of that focus was on the lyricism behind that and the tongue-in-cheek type of humor throughout it, which is kind of what separates the sleaze from slut pop if that makes sense; Slut pop is more that Kim Petras vibe, whereas synthy sleaze pop, I like to describe as kind of this ratchet Americana type vibe, if that makes sense. And then, when it comes to just the entity of Puzzwacky, it is purely just unadulterated confidence. It\u2019s not bratty, but the b\u2014y side of both of our personalities. More so mine, James is not that b\u2014y. And it\u2019s not necessarily rude, but it\u2019s definitely in your face, aggressive in the best way possible, and just fun and funny.\n\nDescribe Puzzwacky in six words. Romero: Kink. Cain: First one I thought of was club. Romero: I wanna say c\u2014. That\u2019s the main word The tag is, \u201cPuzzwack the c\u2014.\u201d So, the word c\u2014 is our center focus word. Cain: If we only had one word, then it would be that. Well, it\u2019s not really one word but like in your face. If there\u2019s a good one-word synonym for that. I guess just confident. Romero: I\u2019m gonna say confrontational. Cain: Intense.\n\nHow did you start working together on this? Romero: So, I was taking singing lessons with Chris Sampson who\u2019s a fabulous mentor of both of ours. He\u2019s been guiding us a lot through this project. I originally started these lessons to talk about indie rock music and get his take on it and my writing because he\u2019s just a brilliant man to ask when it comes to music in any capacity. And I was showing him all my stuff I was writing and you know, I loved it and it was stuff that I still connected deeply with. But I could tell that Chris liked it a lot and he was obviously guiding me and supporting me and giving me great feedback. But, I just felt like I could click something harder. We were talking one day as most of our lessons ended up just us chatting and I was telling him about how, a couple years ago, the [end of] sophomore year, me and Evan Pruett, who\u2019s another producer, sat down and wrote two songs called \u201ckNAUGHTY\u201d and then started one called \u201cVogue! Marie Laveau!\u201d And I really fell in love with writing that then, but I didn\u2019t really care to explore it too much because I thought it was a fun thing we just did. And then I was like, \u2018Oh, I also have some electronic music that I did if you want to hear it\u2019 to Chris and Chris said, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 I showed it to him and he sat for a good 30 long seconds in silence and was like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna be honest with you, Jack, this is way more divisive to me. As a professor and mentor, I want to support you, whatever you want to do, but I\u2019m going to be honest, I really liked this.\u2019 And I took that and ran with it. Right after that lesson, I wanted to get cracking on it and then I wrote the chorus to the first song we worked on together, \u201cBarbianque,\u201d which is quote, \u201cI\u2019m so hot / I\u2019m so gay / I\u2019m a Barbie / I\u2019m on K.\u201d And then I think it was two days later, I asked James if he wanted to work on that song and then less than a week later, we sat down and the song just clicked so so f\u2014ing fast. And then I showed that to Chris, he loved it and we just decided to start working on the whole project and now we\u2019re 14 songs in.\n\nSo, was \u201cBarbianque\u201d the first time you two worked together? Romero: Yes! After I wrote the chorus idea down I pitched it to James and later that week we began working on it from the ground up together. We were decent friends and housemates beforehand but as sessions together began picking up we became great friends. It was fabulous to have our music and our friendship grow together.\n\nJack, you\u2019ve had a very committed rebrand from your solo work to this project, even changing your Instagram handle to @puzzwacky. What has this departure from your past work meant? Romero: It\u2019s honestly kind of become everything. For the past five months, it has become one of the only things I\u2019ve really thought about. We already have merch that we\u2019re developing, all designed by a girl named Julia McKay, and she has also been a huge collaborator in the project. When it comes to collaborators, we have garnered around a 26-person team that is fully volunteer-based, just because they believe in the project as much as we do. So it really is everything. It\u2019s been all-encompassing in both of our lives. We would have so many sessions: two or three nights a week and then all day on Sunday. My dad even bought me a German license plate that says \u201cPuzzwacky\u201d on it. It\u2019s on the front of my car.\n\nCain: I\u2019ve been spending the majority of my time working on this stuff for the past five months, and it\u2019s been really fun. Right now, we\u2019re in the stage of getting together live performances and trying to connect with some labels.\n\nYou\u2019ve briefly mentioned the potential of signing onto a label. How has that process been? Romero: We\u2019ve been in communication with a few. I don\u2019t want to jinx anything, but we\u2019ve been in communication with a few of them. I feel like that\u2019s just the route that we want to take with it because it makes the most sense. Our goal is to be able to have these things released through it and with that backing. However, I feel like if time gets the better of us, I think we\u2019re just gonna start doing it on our own because honestly, how it\u2019s been working so far on our own has been fabulous. But we\u2019re still in cahoots with a few of them \u2013 setting up some meetings. We have another mentor who is named Barbara Cane, and she\u2019s the vice president of BMI [Broadcast Music Inc]. So I met with her a few weeks ago and I absolutely fell in love with her. And she\u2019s also helping us develop this, not necessarily the persona, but just how to use what we have in our persona and each other to our benefit when it comes to the project. Because it started as James and I working on stuff together, and then I was going to release it. But then it turned into a very collaborative project. Every single meeting we have, we do it together now because we\u2019ve described everything, as most artists do, as these songs are very much our children.\n\nIt seems like you have a unique collaborative relationship creating this artist project. What is your creative process working together? Cain: I feel like most of the time Jack will come to me with some lyrical ideas. That\u2019s usually the inspiration for the starting point for most of our songs. Romero: Like a song title. Cain: Yeah, and then we\u2019ll find a few references of, what I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, those eras and genres of music and do some listening and decide what we like and what we want to take inspiration from. Then usually Jack will write and I\u2019ll produce the track simultaneously. Sometimes I make a track and then Jack will spend some time with it and write over it and sometimes the lyrical ideas just come as the track is being built. But overall, it\u2019s a pretty collaborative process. Jack will inform a lot of the production decisions that I make.\n\nRomero: So musically, that\u2019s kind of how it\u2019s built. We would have the beginning of the session, we track vocals for a song that I toplined after he produced it and then the second half of our session would be creating \u2013 that\u2019s what these six to eight hours Sundays would be just tracking and then writing and going back and forth. But as for the outward persona and identity, it\u2019s all based on kink culture and queer pornography. So it\u2019s a lot of leather, a lot of chains and just very fun party, dance, 80s if that makes sense. It\u2019s a lot of cruising references like we have a song called \u201cCruise 2 Lose.\u201d And cruising is one of those segments of queer culture that is still just purely and truly gay. And so it\u2019s kind of just grasping at those concepts and ideas. Personally, I\u2019ve been influenced a lot by artists such as Bob Mizer, who basically pioneered the queer porn industry, and he was just a beautiful artist and photographer. Mizer was one of those guys that owned this compound and he would find these queer men who were kicked out of their houses simply because of coming out and give them a home and a place to stay and offer them work and just all this beautiful stuff. So a lot of it is just the positive aspects of queerness. Then, of course, with the aesthetic of BDSM, leather chains, red, silvers, blacks, all that stuff.\n\nRecently, you held a focus group for Puzzwacky. I\u2019m sure there was both a lot of anticipation and excitement around people listening to the project for the first time. Romero: It was fabulous. Originally, the idea was that me and James were going to sit down with just Chris and talk over everything and get his opinion on everything. And then it turned into \u2013 we\u2019d collaborated with like five other producers and writers for some of the songs, and then it was going to be us and Chris, as well. Then I was in one of my meetings with Chris and he basically just told me, \u2018The room has 50 seats, and you\u2019re more than welcome to fill them up, but you don\u2019t have to.\u2019 And James and I talked and we decided that it would be the best idea because also when it comes to pitching the labels, the more info you get, just the feedback is the most important thing. And I made a Partiful and I sent it out and the event sold out within three days, which was fabulous. Especially when it\u2019s something that quite literally nobody has heard before. For it to sell out that fast was just amazing and getting support from not only friends but the friends of friends because I asked a lot of people to bring obviously someone that doesn\u2019t know us that way they can hear it and see what they think of it. And the feedback was very, very, very positive.\n\nYou\u2019re both also seniors at USC. So, as you are launching forward with this project, you are also about to graduate. How does it feel? Romero: Honestly, I was nervous about graduating until we started this project. Cain: Yeah, I\u2019m pretty excited. I\u2019m really looking forward to being able to spend a lot more time on this type of stuff. And yeah, I think there\u2019s a lot of potential behind it, so I\u2019m excited to see where it goes. Romero: And also a lot of support behind it already from not, even just our friends, but mutual friends and stuff like that. So after that, I think that\u2019s very validating in the fact of just adding to the confidence that we both share behind this whole brand or this whole artist project, I should say, not brand. Well, I guess it is a brand. But anyway. We\u2019re at the end here. If the readers take anything away from this, what do you want them to know about your new project? Cain: Be ready for something different. Romero: That\u2019s kind of our biggest thing people have told us. I don\u2019t want to sound like a b\u2014-, but everybody\u2019s said they\u2019ve never heard anything like it. Which is huge, you know, and it\u2019s one of those things where most things have been done before.\n```"}
