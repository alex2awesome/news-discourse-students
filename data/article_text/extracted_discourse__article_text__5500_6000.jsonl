(Photo by Alex Lam)\n\nBy Chuck White May 08, 2024 at 8:35 am PDT\n\nA group of girls in fur jackets and black skirts steps over puddles of questionable liquids beneath the downtown Los Angeles skyline. They make their way into a dark alley that is only lit by people taking flash pictures against the graffiti walls. They fall into the crowd of people waiting outside two large metal doors with the words \u201cThe Smell\u201d spray painted above them.\n\nInside, two dogs are leashed to a large desk where a young man is taking $10 bills in exchange for a light blue wristband that he is delicately placing on the wrists of the concertgoers. This back alley concert venue emphasizes its all-ages policy, as most people making their way inside look like they are in the process of applying to college.\n\nThe decor at The Smell, including a sign pictured here that reads, \"Wanna form a band? So do I!,\" is part of what makes up the venue's eclectic nature. (Photo by Alex Lam)\n\nA flier next to the desk reads, \u201cThe smell is here for you! It needs you to help out every once in a while...help run the best club in L.A.\u201d Below that, a piece of paper says, \u201cThe Smell saved me!\u201d\n\nVoices echo off the brick walls into the exposed wood ceiling and the heavy still air emphasizes the old warehouse scent that fills the room. A wide hallway leads into a large open room with a stage at the end. The first artist, Killing Wiba, comes out onto the stage and the room erupts in screams and claps.\n\nAs they start their first song, all eyes are on the stage and it becomes clear that this isn\u2019t your average concert venue. People are not only at The Smell for a good night, but to appreciate the music.\n\nThe Smell has been hosting shows at its current location downtown for almost 25 years. It opened in North Hollywood in 1998 after many other not-for-profit punk venues were shutting down. The original location of The Smell was opened by Jim Smith and two of his friends. Today, he is the sole owner of the venue.\n\n\u201cMe and a couple of friends decided to open a space, at least temporarily, and see how it worked out or if something else came along that would fill the void..but it kind of took off and grew,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSmith\u2019s work for The Smell is purely out of passion for the community and art. He said he does not make any money from his position and all funds go back into supporting the venue. He works at Teamsters, a union for UPS employees and waste truck drivers, during the day.\n\n\u201cThere had been a few places in L.A. that were these legendary D.I.Y., all-ages spaces, and a few months before we opened a couple of them closed for good. It kind of left a void,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe Smell runs smoothly (and maintains low prices) thanks to the contributions of volunteers. (Photo by Alex Lam)\n\nThe Smell has had an impact on the L.A. music scene for multiple generations. Mark Williams, a 50-year-old Los Angeles resident, is the father of the drummer for the band Forsythia. Forsythia frequently plays shows at The Smell.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived here for like 15 years. And yeah, a lot of my friends who grew up here will always say this place is legendary,\u201d Williams said.\n\nD.I.Y. venues are a staple of the punk community. Volunteers, artists, and attendees actively contribute to the success of the venue.\n\n\u201cThe artists and the promoters and the people that run the place. They are part of the same community and everybody kind of plays their part and keeps the space going. That\u2019s kind of key,\u201d Smith said.\n\nOne volunteer, Daryl Monroe, frequents The Smell as both an artist and an audience member.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a home to me and a lot of other kids,\u201d Monroe said.\n\nIt is easy to become a volunteer at The Smell, according to Smith. People either sign up on their website or in a book at the front of the venue. It is not an easy task to run an event, but Monroe felt it was a great experience and opportunity.\n\n\u201cIt was really hectic, not what I thought coming in. It\u2019s really fun to actually be on the other side,\u201d Monroe said while mimicking the motions of taking down names and putting on wristbands.\n\nFive volunteers are working at each event, with Smith running the ship. Two work the door, one works the snack booth and the other two run the sound system. With the venue at its 130-person capacity, the five volunteers hold a lot of accountability.\n\nThere is a \u201cno alcohol in or out\u201d sign at the entrance of The Smell. With the venue being all-ages, there is only a small vegan snack bar. It is reminiscent of a high school football concession stand and everything is under $2. Oreos, pretzels, LaCoix and coffee are just a few of the options available, and a $1 water bottle at a concert is something that is unheard of in 2024.\n\nTickets at The Smell are typically between $5 and $15, and the vegan snacks available at a consessions booth are all each priced under $2. The low cost is meant to encourage music and art fans of all ages to attend shows.\n\nThe Smell doesn\u2019t empty the pockets of the young adults who attend the events there. It keeps things cheap, which allows attendees to go to more shows and see more artists perform.\n\nSamara Chaplain, a 20-year-old punk music fan, who was attending her second show at The Smell, got a KitKat before she went into the show.\n\n\u201cOne thing I love about The Smell is I always get to discover small artists that I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise. I really like how intimate the venue is,\u201d Chaplain said.\n\nChaplain added that while there was no security at the venue, she still felt safe. Concerts are a place where she often feels unsafe due to the number of people and packed crowds, but that is not an issue at The Smell. People are there for the music, and even if there is a mosh pit, people still care about other attendees.\n\nThe Smell is open for music fans (and performers) of all-ages. (Photo by Alex Lam)\n\n\u201cThe crowds are always super friendly, and I like that. It\u2019s all ages too, so it feels really safe,\u201d Chaplain said.\n\nThe overall respect for others is also reflected in the setup of the venue and its mission.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more focused on the music and the art and the community rather than, you know, you go to a bar and sometimes you can\u2019t hear the band because people are just there to drink and talk,\u201d Smith said.\n\nWhen the last band, While We Sleep, steps onto the stage the crowd goes wild. The three boys in the band couldn\u2019t have been over eighteen. The lead singer and the bassist were wearing white collared shirts with ties, while Woodruff wore overalls and, for a short time, a black sweatshirt.\n\nBy the second song, a few members of the crowd begin pushing outwards, opening up a large circle in the middle. They stand and wait for the chorus to hit before they grab the hands of the people making the inside of the circle, pulling them in. They begin pushing each other and moshing. One man falls and his leg gets stepped on. Everyone around him begins to help him up and ask if he is okay.\n\nThe companionship between the crowd members who were strangers just minutes ago exemplifies the sense of community that lives inside The Smell.\n\nAt the end of their set, the members of While We Sleep proudly announce they are \u201cin the middle of applying to college.\u201d\n\nOriginal photography by Alex Lam.\n```"}

Moving from the indie-rock of \u201cKeep it Cool,\u201d Becker has returned to the SC Unplugged podcast to discuss her more pop-forward release \u201cDriveway.\u201d Alongside this genre shift, the singer-songwriter has also gotten management and is looking to build her team. As she\u2019s about to graduate from USC, Becker is on the brink of releasing her debut album and first music video.\n\nAnnenberg Media welcomed Becker back to the podcast to discuss her release \u201cDriveway\u201d and her upcoming album. Full transcript has been edited for clarity. Note: This episode was recorded in October 2023.\n\nBecker: Hey guys, it\u2019s Liz. I\u2019m back on SC Unplugged, and I am a senior now. I\u2019m about to graduate from USC. Again, I\u2019m from the Bay Area in California, and my major is popular music performance with an emphasis in songwriting.\n\nBecker: So since I released \u201cKeep it Cool,\u201d I released another song in the winter called \u201cAdrenaline,\u201d and those two songs are very much in the indie-rock sphere. And since then, I\u2019ve kind of switched to a more pop-y sound. So I definitely say it\u2019s more indie-pop now, kind of taking influence from Holly Humberstone, Lennon Stella and Julia Michaels. So, that\u2019s kind of the direction that I\u2019m going in now. And yeah, since then, me and my producer have recorded so much music and we\u2019ve released a lot and are planning to release a lot more. So, very exciting!\n\nBecker: I\u2019ve always wanted to kind of try a more pop sound. Because I mean, I listened to a lot of indie-pop and I also listened to a lot of indie-rock, but I just feel like this pop sound is just a lot more me than the stuff I was releasing before. So yeah, it was a conscious decision, because I knew that I always wanted to try it. So when we were writing the songs, me and Evan [Pruett], my producer, we were thinking like, \u2018We\u2019re gonna go down the pop lane.\u2019\n\nBecker: Well something exciting happened in January, like the beginning of 2023. I got connected with someone who works at Hallwood, which is like a management company for producers and songwriters. And I actually knew her from high school and she reached out to me and was like, \u2018I really love your music. I\u2019m working at Hallwood now.\u2019 And so she\u2019s my manager now, which is really exciting because that\u2019s been helping a lot, just with connections, and it\u2019s given me so many more opportunities.\n\nBecker: I mean, it\u2019s great. For right now, it\u2019s pretty much like a handshake deal. There\u2019s no contract or anything like that. But it\u2019s just great because she really believes in me. I mean, the cool thing about it is that she reached out to me, which meant that she wanted to work with me, she liked my music, and she thought that it could go somewhere, which just feels good obviously. And so, the biggest thing for me is that it just motivates me to do more and work harder at my music because I have the beginning of a team. And so yeah, I did more music over the past six months and released more music than I ever have in my life and that\u2019s around the same time that I started working with her. Yeah, she just has so many great ideas. So I can kind of start focusing more on the creative side of things and she does some of the more administrative stuff that an artist doesn\u2019t really want to do. But yeah, it\u2019s still very independent and we work together on a lot of stuff still, so it\u2019s great.\n\nBecker: Yeah, my live performances, they\u2019ve been great. I performed at Hotel Cafe in the spring, which was really cool. That was just a cool moment because I feel like before I moved to L.A., I saw so many artists that I respected performing at Hotel Cafe and then I got to perform there, which was cool. And then I was in London for a Maymester at the beginning of the summer. So we performed a lot at a lot of venues in London. And yeah, I mean, it was kind of a whirlwind because it was right after we finished school and then we went straight to London and were there for like three weeks and it was really intense. I mean we\u2019re still in school but obviously, it didn\u2019t feel like school. It was just gig after gig after gig and writing and recording and we got to record some of our music at Abbey Road Studios, which was insane. I loved that.\n\nBecker: Me and Evan decided to write an album this summer. So I went away and traveled a little bit at the beginning of the summer, after the year ended, and then came back and me and Evan immediately started working on this. We wrote eight songs in a total of like five days, which is crazy. And so those are all the songs that we\u2019re recording and finishing up right now. \u201cDriveway\u201d and \u201cWho You Are\u201d that are already out are part of that pack of songs. And so that was a really wild experience. And that\u2019s pretty much all I was doing over the summer plus working. Continuing into the school year, we\u2019re kind of just still trying to finish it up and get all the music out there because I just really want to have a project out there before I graduate.\n\nBecker: Something that\u2019s really exciting about this is that it very much has a cool through storyline, which I always love in albums that I listen to, and so I think it\u2019ll be fun for people who listen to it to kind of follow that storyline and see that unroll. So yeah, I\u2019m really excited.\n\nBecker: When you\u2019re making an album, I think the most challenging part for me was not being too hard on myself in the moment while I was writing the lyrics and the melodies and everything because I\u2019m such a \u2013 and all musicians are, I mean, so many people are just a perfectionist when it comes to writing music. And we set a goal and we\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re gonna write these songs in this amount of time.\u2019 So I had to keep telling myself that I can go back and edit later, but right now let\u2019s just get the song done. Get it out. And so I think having that time limit kind of helped me do that because I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t be so nitpicky about everything.\u2019 But it was also hard because I\u2019d be like, \u2018Shoot, that lyric is not perfect. I want to fix it\u2019 or like, \u2018That melody is not as good as it could be.\u2019 So that was really hard. But then I realized that you can always go back and edit and make changes later. And sometimes in the moment whatever you write, you think that it\u2019s not good, and then you go back later and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, wait, that was actually kind of sick.\u2019 So that was a challenging part. And then it\u2019s just cool to make a body of work. I\u2019ve never done that. I\u2019ve never written that many songs, and had a full complete project done. So I just think it was really cool and unlike anything I\u2019ve done before, and just made me fall in love with songwriting even more so, it was great.\n\nBecker: So \u201cDriveway\u201d was written by me and Evan Pruett, who\u2019s a producer and a songwriter \u2013 so talented. And this was the first song of the album that we wrote and it\u2019s about kind of trying to get away from a lost love or heartbreak by going home to your hometown and trying to center yourself again, but just not being able to stop thinking about this one person.\n\nBecker: \u2018Cause I had just been in London so I had kind of been thinking about this phenomenon of being so far away from someone but still they\u2019re taking up so much of your mind. And so I was like, \u2018What if we write a song about this?\u2019 And so we started writing the lyrics and this one honestly came out pretty fast. I think I had just gotten back from London and hadn\u2019t written a song for a while. Same with Evan. He had gone home for a little bit. So this one flowed out pretty fast. At the end, it was weird, like after writing this song, I was like, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s okay.\u2019 And then when we finished all the songs, I was like, \u2018Wait, no, this is my favorite one. We have to release this first,\u2019 which is cool because it was the first song that we wrote and we\u2019ve also released it first.\n\nBecker: So the piano was Evan. Evan is a great keys player. So he kind of came up with that riff at the beginning. And then that synth, kind of like a detuned sound, that was also at the beginning was his idea. I mean, he has so many great sounds that he comes up in his DAW where he does all his production. I think that whole riff, like the whole intro, came later after we wrote the songs. We kind of just started out with chords and melody.\n\nBecker: \u2018I wanna lose track of time / How long does it take?\u2019 It\u2019s kind of ironic how you\u2019re like, \u2018I want to lose track of time.\u2019 But then you\u2019re like, \u2018Can it go faster? Can I lose track of time faster?\u2019 So yeah, it was kind of a play on words a little bit. Because I feel like everyone has that feeling where they\u2019re just trying to relax, but these thoughts are running through your head and you can\u2019t calm down.\n\nBecker: \u2018Now I\u2019m drinking wine like lemonade.\u2019 I think that\u2019s just a good anthem lyric. And I feel like a lot of people can just scream that and it feels good to sing. But I think how that came to be is because a lot of it was comparing this hometown that you\u2019re going to, and how that felt like when you were younger, versus how it felt like now when you\u2019re going through all these adult things and you\u2019re getting your heart broken and now you can drink alcohol. So I wanted to come up with a line that compared how when you were younger you came up here and you drink lemonade, but now it\u2019s like you\u2019re drinking wine. So that was kind of the thought process behind that one.\n\nBecker: So this one is definitely based on real-life experiences, but it\u2019s embellished a little bit, like it\u2019s not completely true. But I think it\u2019s just a thing that so many people can relate to and I know I\u2019ve felt that way going home from college and going away to London, just feeling that sense of missing a person and not being able to distract yourself from them. This one isn\u2019t as specific as, \u201cKeep it Cool.\u201d Like \u201cKeep it Cool\u201d I\u2019m definitely calling out a specific person, but in this one it\u2019s kind of just more about the feeling.\n\nBecker: The background vocals for the song were really fun to record. All the harmonies were really fun. That\u2019s one of my favorite parts of making music is doing background vocals and just coming up with harmonies. And so we made them really big. So I think that helped a lot with making the song grow. In the first chorus, I think there\u2019s like one background vocal, but then as the choruses gets bigger and bigger, the stacks just get bigger. And so I just remember we were in the studio and it was just so fun to come up with all those harmonies.\n\nBecker: I mean, I want to shout out Evan because he\u2019s the best collaborator ever. And I loved making the song with him and the whole album, but he knows that already. Because \u201cKeep it Cool\u201d and \u201cAdrenaline\u201d I wrote all by myself and then had Evan and Truman [Sinclair] produce it. But it was just really cool to write all these songs with Evan and record them. Yeah, I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s like the first person that I feel like fully comfortable writing songs with, so it\u2019s great.\n\nBecker: TikTok has been really important, and I used to hate posting on TikTok, but my manager has motivated me a lot and given me a lot of ideas. So I\u2019ve gotten more comfortable with that. And I just flooded TikTok with the sound of \u201cDriveway.\u201d And so, I think my idea was I was hoping that one of them was gonna blow up and then the song was gonna be big, but that didn\u2019t happen. But that\u2019s okay because any person that sees it is a worthwhile addition to my listeners. Anyone who sees a TikTok and is like, \u2018Oh, I like that sound\u2019 and then pre-saves the song that\u2019s so useful. And so, I\u2019ve kind of accepted that you know, it\u2019d be great if something for TikTok blew up, but it\u2019s also great to kind of slowly build your fan base. And I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing with these songs, which is cool. So yeah, TikTok was a big part of it and just getting comfortable with that. That was the main thing.\n\nBecker: My view of what I want to do after I graduate changes every day. But I think now I\u2019m pretty set with what I want to do because now that I\u2019ve started really diving into the artist thing I\u2019m like, \u2018I love this. It\u2019s just so fun.\u2019 So I definitely want to keep doing the artists thing, keep recording and releasing my own original music under my name. And then I also want to write for other people. Because also, since I\u2019ve been working with my manager, she\u2019s set me up in a lot of sessions with people that she knows. And so I\u2019ve written for some other artists. And I also would love to get into sync and write music for TV and movies. So, I want to do all of that. And I definitely am going to have to have a \u2018job job\u2019 for the first couple of years after I graduate just to survive, but then any free time outside of that I\u2019ll be doing music and working on my own music and doing sessions with other people. So that\u2019s my plan and I\u2019ll be in LA for at least at least five or six years after I graduate. I don\u2019t want to take USC for granted because I know that once I get out of here I\u2019m gonna be like, \u2018F\u2014, I want to go back\u2019 but now I\u2019m just so ready to just get out there. I\u2019m so sick of the \u2013 like sometimes the school busy work just feels so like, \u2018Ahh, I just want to do it.\u2019 But I\u2019m trying to take advantage of the time that I have here.\n\nBecker: There are things when you\u2019re writing for yourself as an artist that you can write a lyric and not have to explain why you wrote that lyric. I write lyrics all the time that only make sense to me and I think that\u2019s okay when you\u2019re writing for yourself as an artist. But when you\u2019re writing for someone else it has to make sense to not only you, but also them. You have to kind of step into their shoes. So, I have to try and avoid bringing my own life experiences into whatever they are writing about. Because that might not make sense in their context, so I think that\u2019s the hardest thing about it and that\u2019s the main difference.\n\nBecker: My next goals. I mean signing officially somewhere with either Hallwood, the company that my manager works for. I think signing somewhere and just kind of growing my team because the numbers on my music that I\u2019ve released recently aren\u2019t huge, but they\u2019re definitely respectable for a beginning artist. So I think that after I release this project and the numbers are visible, I feel like I can start building a team and start venturing out and playing more shows and building that fan base.\n\nBecker: I think the most fulfilling part. I mean, honestly, I\u2019ve come to appreciate collaboration a lot more recently and I think making things with other people is such a special thing. I used to be afraid of that. Before I came to school songwriting was such a private thing that I would only do in my bedroom by myself, and I wouldn\u2019t even like to show my songs to other people that much. But now I\u2019m so grateful for the fact that I feel confident enough to share that creative process with other people and be comfortable with that. And yeah, I think it\u2019s really cool to like to see other people go through their creative process and how their perspectives can change the results of whatever you\u2019re making on that day.\n```"}

It was the first press conference since the group\u2019s early morning eviction from Alumni Park Sunday. More than 100 of Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and USC\u2019s Department of Public Safety (DPS) officers came in with riot gear and zip ties. Protesters dispersed peacefully, and there were no arrests. But those involved were identified by law enforcement as they exited campus, and the USC administration sent at least 14 students emails notifying them of disciplinary actions, including suspensions. At least two students were given eviction notices from student housing for the following day. More suspensions followed Tuesday.\n\nIn a testament to the difficulty of the issue, none of the press conference speakers would identify themselves by name. \u201cThese interim suspensions are yet another tactic of intimidation to silence students from voicing our dissent,\u201d said a speaker, who identified only as a 2024 graduating senior. At the press conference held outside the university gates at Trousdale Parkway, three representatives read a group statement. They called for the university to drop all charges and academic sanctions. \u201cNo evidence was provided in the emails from the administration to justify any alleged offenses of conduct. Yet statements from the administration demonstrate an obvious presumption of guilt,\u201d they said.\n\nIn the emailed letter, signed by Emily Sandovol, associate vice provost for student life, read \u201cit was reported\u201d that the recipient had \u201csupported the illegal construction of an encampment on campus that was cleared by LAPD and DPS early this morning and that you had to be removed by DPS/LAPD.\u201d Under the immediate interim suspension, the letter announced that students can complete final exams only with approval from instructors to do so remotely or virtually. Suspended students were barred from campus except for accessing urgent medical treatment at a healthcare facility.\n\n\u201cSome of the students suspended were identified because they were under threat of arrest by LAPD,\u201d said a faculty member who identified themselves as Jay. \u201cOther suspended students had been detained by DPS earlier in the week for reclaiming discarded materials, and even others were suspended with no explicit connection to the occupation.\u201d The group also condemned Folt for going back on promises they said she made during two negotiation meetings last week. They said Folt promised the group that the administration would not bring disciplinary action against students demonstrating. \u201cWhile Folt made no meaningful insights toward the coalition\u2019s demands, she did promise, on record, that she would not use academic sanctions or police repression against students unless the students engaged in violence,\u201d they said. \u201cWe now know her promise was a bold faced lie.\u201d\n\nThe faculty member present cited USC faculty\u2019s broad opposition to the repression of students protesting. \u201cThe administration has chosen escalation at every step,\u201d he said. \u201cThe administration has continuously characterized peaceful occupation as volatile and in dangerous violation of school policies in order to justify the police response. It is clear to all that the true danger to this community is the USC administration and the enthusiasm with which they wield DPS and the LAPD to repress the community.\u201d\n\nThe university public relations department is yet to respond to Annenberg Media\u2019s request for a comment but on Monday posted a long FAQ, which said the university had long standing policies against encampments, harassment and vandalism. \u201cThe encampment and occupiers endangered the health and safety of our community, created a focal point for potential violence, and deprived our community members of a safe and freely accessible academic environment,\u201d it read.\n\nMembers of the Divest from Death Coalition denounced the administration\u2019s refusal to discuss or negotiate around their demands. \u201cThey arbitrarily invoke codes of conduct to justify standing against humanity,\u201d said another group spokesperson, who identified only as an upperclassman. \u201cIf violation of school policy makes students worthy of repression and arrest then we must ask what punishment is worthy for a school that violates international law.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s FAQ addressed the decision to remove the encampment and responded to what they called \u201coccupiers\u201d demands within existing university policies. The administration suggested the group work through the Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility, formed in 2022 to advise the Board of Trustees, to push for divestment from companies with ties to Israel and weapons-manufacturers. On the call for an academic boycott from Israel, the administration responded that USC is against such boycotts as they stand against academic freedom. Among others, the administration repeated their commitment to freedom of speech, but within the university\u2019s existing policies set forth in the USC Student Handbook.\n\nThe Divest from Death coalition said the administration\u2019s reference to \u201csafety concerns\u201d is a method of suppressing students\u2019 rights to freedom of speech and assembly. \u201cHow can we ever imagine them to be guarantors of our safety when they openly admit to valuing their bottom line over human life?\u201d they said.\n\nNot long after the press conference, a protester who identified as a student was detained in the USC Village. He was demonstrating with a sign that read \u201csue USC\u201d and yelled, \u201csue USC for the obstruction of free speech in the false name of safety!\u201d DPS officers physically removed him from the area, then handcuffed and detained him citing trespassing. In a response to Annenberg Media\u2019s request for comment, DPS said the protester had twice in two locations refused to present his student ID as required by university policy, and so was arrested for trespassing, and transferred to LAPD for booking.\n\nHours after the press conference the Divest from Death coalition released an Instagram call to action to USC alumni to contact the administration and condemn the disciplinary actions and \u201cviolent harassment\u201d of students. \u201cWe unequivocally reject the intimidation of our administration and remain unmoved in our commitment to Palestinian Liberation,\u201d the collective said.\n```"}

Meet the young musician who is breaking racial stereotypes surrounding rock music.\n\nEva Kaleigh the Rockstar (Photo credit: photo courtesy of Eva Hernandez)\n\nBy Maya Broomfield\nMay 06, 2024 at 4:01 pm PDT\n\nWho knew the girl who quit piano lessons at four years old would grow up to be a rock star? Born Eva Hernandez but known for making music under the name Eva Kaleigh the Rockstar has come a long way since her musical journey started in Duluth, Georgia, a small suburb outside of Atlanta, Georgia. While Kaleigh quit playing the piano, she never stopped making music, teaching herself how to play multiple instruments.\n\nKaleigh moved across the country to attend USC to study psychology, music production, and the music industry, she began to see the power and importance of her voice. In her psychology classes, she was learning about depression and social issues that affect young people in our country. In her Black Music History class, she learned that so much of Black American music had been stolen and copied. All this news knowledge, pent-up frustration, and passion from her childhood exploded as she released her first EP titled \u201cRhythm of Love\u201d on September 15, 2023.\n\nKaleigh states, \u201cMy music is very inspired by my life. Sometimes literally, but sometimes, I see a lot of things that my friends go through and my family goes through. And that\u2019s also very inspiring to me. Because I\u2019m a psych major, I feel like I do take an analytical mindset a lot towards life and my music.\u201d\n\nEva Kaleigh the Rockstar (Photo credit: photo courtesy of Eva Hernandez)\n\nLike many young people who grew up in the South, Kaleigh\u2019s first introduction to music was through her grandfather, who listened to soul and blues artists like Little Richard, Al Green, Etta James, and Muddy Waters. \u201cI grew up listening to all of like, soul music, that rhythm and blues stuff. And like that is probably like my favorite genre ever\u201d says Kaleigh.\n\nComing from a mixed background with a Black mother and Mexican father, she grew up hearing hip-hop and corrido, paying close attention to the stories and imagery. As she got older, her taste in music expanded into being a fan of the boy band One Direction, and even after the band broke up in 2015, Kaleigh still found herself watching the band\u2019s old videos, imagining herself performing on stage, stating, \u201cI wanted to do that, not only be on the stage. But I wanted to make the kind of music that he was making; I wanted to have that type of positive influence on the world.\u201d\n\nHer love for creating music was also deeply influenced by her upbringing in Atlanta, a vibrant city teeming with creativity and renowned for its music legends. Reflecting on her inspiration, Kaleigh shares, \u201cAndre 3000 is one of my greatest influences in this regard. He seamlessly transitions from crafting rap anthems to soulful acoustic melodies on the same album.\u201d\n\n\u201cRhythm of Love\u201d was an unexpected release from a young Black and Mexican girl in 2023. In a time when the media can barely accept that Beyonc\u00e9 made an album that wasn\u2019t R&B, Kaleigh shook the table by releasing a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll EP. While Kaleigh admits it herself, the influences of 60\u2032s and 70\u2032s artists like Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and the Beetles are clear. Her smoky yet sweet voice is what makes her music stand out in the crowd. Her lyrics are relatable and show true to where she is in life as a college student, with themes of romance, relationships, and proving that she is the president of the campus Cannabis Club.\n\nKaleigh is right on time, as there is a renaissance for artists of color as they break down racial barriers about who belongs in what genres. After all, as Kaleigh states, \u201cI don\u2019t want it to continue to be that joke of, \u2018Oh, you like rock music? That\u2019s so white of you.\u2019 Because I think that\u2019s bull, music is not racial,\u201d says Kaleigh \u201cIt\u2019s not! It doesn\u2019t abide by those lines. It\u2019s a good thing for us to acknowledge the roots because that allows us to see, yeah, everyone can like this.\u201d\n\nAs a self-producer and artist, Kaleigh has been performing all over Los Angeles to fund her musical career. A challenge that she takes head-on \u201cMe personally, like, everything that I do as an artist is a direct, like, attack against my fear. I don\u2019t respect my own fear. And so like, I\u2019m always trying to push myself out of my comfort zone.\u201d\n\nKaleigh has talent and an ear for music. Being so young, she has plenty of room to only get better. Kaleigh says that she has big plans for the end of the year. An EP that will be paired with a documentary that will highlight her creative process and her journey to its release.\n```"}

As I step onto the platform, I look around at the curved architecture painted in red, and walk towards the towering apartments with lanterns strung across the passageway. The polished buildings decorated with \u201cNow Leasing\u201d signs make it clear that this is a new addition to the community, albeit with a few aesthetic choices to make it somewhat blend in.\n\nBlossom Plaza, a new apartment building in Chinatown in September 2023 (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nBut as Broadway street comes into view, I see a more familiar picture. I take a left, walking down the streets. At the bright and early time of 10:30 in the morning, the community is already active. Vendors selling fruits and vegetables set up their booths while customers haggle in Cantonese. But once in a while, the look of the street is interrupted. In between the traditional medicine shops and hole-in-the-wall restaurants lie some newer spots like a boba shop and other trendy restaurants with neon signs.\n\nI reach my destination: the massive gate with a pair of dragons sitting on clouds. Underneath it, I meet up with Helen Hua, a docent for the Chinatown Business Improvement District. Since 2008, Hua has come here about once a month to host something unique: a two and a half tour of Chinatown.\n\nHelen Hua: Ever since I was young, I\u2019ve been in Chinatown at various points with my family to eat. Later on after college, I got more involved with Chinatown.\n\nOther members of the tour come from all walks of life: some new residents in L.A. and others have been trying to schedule a time to join the tour for years. I tag along, as Hua guides us through spots like the Dynasty Center.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a hidden swap meet, where fellow shopkeepers greet each other ahead of a long day of work.\n\nChinatown's Dynasty Center remains a popular spot for visitors (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nAs well as Thien Hau Temple.\n\nHere, followers of Taoist tradition make offerings in hope of good fortune.\n\nAnd of course, Central Plaza, where much of the traditional architecture has been preserved, complete with signs bearing wonton font and statues of Bruce Lee and Sun Yat-sen, the first president of the Republic of China.\n\nBut after doing this for over 15 years, Hua has seen this community\u2019s evolution, and now with the arrival of new businesses, apartment buildings, among other developments, the landscape is changing.\n\nHua: Over a decade now of doing the tour, I\u2019ve seen a lot of changes, for better and for worse. I think in general, Chinatown, you know, the whole gentrification conversation does come into play. I see a lot of that as sort of just the evolution of a community.\n\nHistorically, Chinatown was a product of gentrification. Old Chinatown was originally built where Union Station is today, but because of that construction in 1938, the immigrants were forced to move. Where Chinatown stands today is actually where Little Italy used to be.\n\nIn more recent years, Chinatown has seen the rise and fall of businesses, changes in clientele, and of course, a pandemic that shook most of these independent shops.\n\nBut one place has been holding their ground since 1938.\n\nThis is Phoenix Bakery, an iconic Chinatown landmark best known for their strawberry cream cakes, almond cookies, and sugar butterflies. During the tour, Hua mentioned the long-running bakery, so I took it upon myself to pay them a visit.\n\nVersus other businesses in the community, Phoenix still gets lines trailing out their door over the weekend and part of that is because they own the property, with the founders having actually built the building in the 70s.\n\nI step inside, and I see cakes and croissants displayed in glass cases while a Chinese dragon costume hangs overhead. Kathryn Chan Ceppi currently owns the bakery alongside her brother. She grew up in Chinatown, having eventually taken over her parents\u2019 business.\n\nI walked into the kitchen, briefly catching the sweet smell of freshly-baked pastries, before Ceppi took me to a quiet room upstairs. Overlooking their sign featuring their mascot, I heard her story.\n\nKathryn Chan Ceppi: Chinatown has changed immensely since I was very young. It used to be a hub of activity. People used to come here, this was a destination spot for dinner, and for socializing, and for having a good time. With the development of Monterey Park and the San Gabriel Valley, the shift in population has gone out there.\n\nCeppi says there\u2019s also other obvious reasons for these shuttered stores.\n\nCeppi: We survived the pandemic because we own this property and we own the building. If we would have had to pay rent, which a lot of businesses had to, we would not have survived... The problem with a lot of the businesses that have closed here is that the next generation is not interested and doesn\u2019t want it. Also, there are other venues that people go to now for entertainment. So Chinatown has changed immensely from a place that used to be open until midnight, one, two in the morning to many empty storefronts.\n\nStill, she\u2019s optimistic, as there\u2019s new blood in Chinatown. Recently, several young business owners are moving in to make their mark.\n\nCeppi: I salute the young people that are opening up little boutique shops here, little coffee shops, little gift shops. It\u2019s a tough business. And this is not a time when doing business, especially for a small business, it\u2019s not a good time to survive. It\u2019s very difficult... We\u2019re hanging in there.\n\nWith these new entrepreneurs is also the growth of new immigrant communities, a shift Ceppi welcomes with open arms.\n\nCeppi: Asian covers a huge population now, you know, it didn\u2019t used to. Asian, you\u2019re either Japanese or Chinese, and now, we\u2019ve got a lot of Vietnamese people here. We have Thai, we have Filipinos, you know, I think it\u2019s great. The diversity is good. And then because of our proximity to East L.A., we have a lot of Latino customers, regulars. So we must be doing something right.\n\nBack at the tour, Hua continues to guide us down the street. We make it down to Far East Plaza, which today, has become a hub of multicultural cuisine, from Taiwanese food to Vietnamese pho to even Nashville hot chicken.\n\nHua pointed me towards a restaurant in the corner with its pastel turquoise and oranges and the empty alcohol bottles lining the windows. Steff Valencia is the CFO and co-owner of Lasita, a Filipino rotisserie and a natural wine bar that just started up in 2020.\n\nI sat down briefly with Valencia ahead of a busy night for her, and we chatted about why they started their business here in Far East Plaza.\n\nSteff Valencia: We all have our own memories of this plaza. My mom and I would come here. She would get her hair done at the salon in the plaza. This used to be a pho place, like my gosh, I don\u2019t even remember how many years ago, and so we all have our own memories of this place.\n\nThen I began to wonder, if in some hypothetical future the name \u201cChinatown\u201d becomes nothing more than arbitrary, will it, at some point, transform into something new, like what happened to Little Italy in the past?\n\nValencia reflects on this. Coming into this Chinatown as a Filipino American, she hopes that Lasita can support the existing community while also fitting into the greater L.A. landscape.\n\nValencia: We also identified this place as a more Angeleno place too, and Chinatown is a staple of Los Angeles. So it\u2019s a way to celebrate L.A. in general... We want to be able to say we\u2019re a part of something that celebrates the community here. It\u2019s a varying degree of ages. The demographic is changing. There\u2019s different challenges coming on board to this area, and we want to be respective of it, but we also want to make sure that we\u2019re part of a positive movement in the community.\n\nBut however this community ends up, to Hua, at least for the time being, Chinatown still looks and feels Chinese.\n\nA statue of Bruce Lee in Chinatown's Central Plaza in September 2023 (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nHua: L.A. is such a melting pot. It\u2019s just going to be a diverse community of all types of ethnicities, but I think Chinatown for now, and since I\u2019ve been involved in Chinatown, is still distinctly Chinatown. You know, a lot of buildings that have Chinese language on there. The Golden Dragon gateway has Chinese on it.\n\nAnd if it\u2019s anything to show for it, a lot of people did not want to talk with me for this story, mainly because they were uncomfortable doing interviews in English, and because my Cantonese is shaky.\n\nBut in any case, regardless of what it will look like, Hua hopes that she can play a role in continuing the story of Chinatown, and that these tours can serve as her way of passing it on to the next generation.\n\nHua: One of the biggest things that I\u2019ve seen, that I really feel hopeful about, that Chinatown will continue to exist, is the younger generation coming in to start businesses, live here. And actually, with my tours, I\u2019ve seen more Chinese, Asian people join my tours. So that\u2019s been really great to see.\n\nBut yeah, ultimately, Chinatown could face the same situation that Little Italy and the French community, where eventually they moved out, and there\u2019s really not much left of those communities that are at least visible here.\n\nBut at least on the tour, I tried to continue to tell their stories, and maybe, you know, God forbid, if Chinatown were to eventually officially end that it would have had such a long history that people in the future will still talk about it.\n\nI get back to the train platform, and reflect on my visit. Chinatown is still one of the oldest immigrant communities in America, and while much of its look has been frozen in time, the culture is evolving. But those left behind and those coming in for the first time hope to have a role in shaping the identity of Chinatown for the future.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Ethan Huang.\n```"}

Sally: I just turned all the way around the corner to come catch him. I seen him on the other street over there and I\u2019m like damn I just missed him. Roy Sally couldn\u2019t help but give in to his frosty cravings despite the gloomy cold afternoon. So he waved to stop El Renegado Ruiz, a bright red ice cream truck that just parked on Holmes Avenue in South L.A. Sally: Hey, this is convenient, its right here in front of your house. He\u2019s clean, sanitize just like Baskin Robbins. It\u2019s just it\u2019s at your door. Armando Ruiz has been making people smile for the past 32-years... serving up ice-cream, chips and even hot pockets since 1992. He owns the El Renegado Ruiz. Armando Ruiz (translated from Spanish): In this area I work I\u2019m known as El Renegado. He says everyone in the neighborhood knows him as el renegado, which literally means the \u201crenegade\u201d but in slang basically means the bad-tempered. Ruiz (translated from Spanish): I don\u2019t know why they gave me that name. They would say i would be grumpy and mean with the kids then they called me Renegado. He says he doesn\u2019t know why they gave him that name but he thinks it\u2019s because he acts a bit grumpy and mean with the kids. But of course, it\u2019s all in fun. Ruiz (translated from Spanish): Because the color red is one of those colors that\u2019s been special, when I was young I had a red car and it\u2019s just my favorite color. And my kids favorite color is also red. And you can\u2019t miss Armando\u2019s bright red truck. He says it\u2019s his favorite color. He had a car that was red and it\u2019s his kids favorite color too. *Customer ordering chili cheese order soundbite* At 16 feet long and 12 feet high, the truck also has colorful murals as well. On one side of the truck, Disney characters like Bambi, Minnie Mouse, and the seven dwarfs are splashed on the entire left side of the truck. On the other side is the order window. Customers are treated to a menu that\u2019s about twelve feet tall with 72 menu items like banana splits, ice pops and chili dogs. *customer soundbite: You got chili on that, aww yeah that\u2019s some business haha* There\u2019s also a menu for Mexican candy and another mural of two children riding killer whales. This is what customers are greeted to like 21-year-old Chino. The truck is now parked right outside his home, a mostly Hispanic neighborhood. Chino: He\u2019d been passing through my house, he\u2019d been there since elementary so I\u2019ve been buying from him ever since... During the summers, you know, getting the best ice cream out here and just supporting him, you know, I\u2019m gonna support him ever since that\u2019s why I don\u2019t leave him.\u201d *Chino Ordering soundbite: And a blue Gatorade... gracias Chino* In 1985 at the age of 17, Armando first began his frozen journey with his mom who owned her own truck \u2013 only it was white. He helped her everyday inside a 10 foot long truck, about half the size of his own. Ruiz (translated from Spanish): My mom encouraged me to start my own business to get ahead for my family. That was the motivation, to work with her for 6 years so then I could be on my own. She that helped me start my business. Armando says it inspired him to go out on his own. So after six years of working with her, he started his own ice cream truck business to better provide for his family.. But he didn\u2019t always work alone. For five years, Armando had some help. Ruiz (translated from Spanish): When my kids were much younger in school, my two boys would help me out and work in the truck. They did it for about 5 years. Later they didn\u2019t want to work anymore because during the summer it would get really hot inside the truck. He says when his kids were much younger and in school... they would help him out. But during the summer, the heat inside the truck became too unbearable for them and they stopped helping him. And in some ways, maybe that was for the better. Ruiz (translated from Spanish): When I first started I was robbed 5 times at gunpoint. Now not anymore because I\u2019ve been working here for 32 years. Everybody around here knows me now and it\u2019s much calmer. Armando\u2019s early years weren\u2019t easy. The long hours and unsteady income were challenging. He was even robbed five times at gunpoint when he first started. but after working in the same neighborhood for 32-years, it\u2019s become much calmer because everyone knows him. like Ana Gomez, who has known Armando for more than a decade. *Gomez ordering soundbite* Ruiz (translated from Spanish): Ever since I moved down here, which has been around 10 to 12 years... so on and off when I hear it come by I come out here and wave him down... you could go from the chili cheese with any kind of chips you want from waffle cone special. You could get even the palate mangonada and character popsicles. *Milkshake soundbite* Countless people he\u2019s served can attest to Armando\u2019s generosity in the community, and for some like Steven Wilson, ice cream became the start of a near three decade bond. Steven Wilson: He used to come by and he had the Squeeze pops. I tell him, I go. I go how many go in a box? He goes, I don\u2019t know. 15-16? I don\u2019t know. So I said you bring me a box and I\u2019ll pay you for it. That\u2019s how it started. One summer he came and I just started buying ice cream from him and it never stopped. ... I\u2019d say that was probably about 28 years ago. Armando says he has about ten years left before he\u2019s ready to park his truck for good and long time customers like Steven are not ready to let go. Wilson: He\u2019s a pillar in the community. I put it that way because you don\u2019t buy we don\u2019t buy off everybody\u2019s ice cream. Since his start with his mom back in 19-85, Armando says this the only job job he\u2019s ever known. and he\u2019s never abandoned the clients he\u2019s served for so long. Not even for a single day. Ruiz (translated from Spanish): My favorite part of the job is when they tell me that I gave them good business and thank you. When they tell me how beautiful my truck is. Armando loves his work. and you can tell. He says his favorite part of the job are when people thank him for his hospitality and when they tell him how beautiful his truck is. So rain or shine, when Armando\u2019s customers hear that iconic jingle echoing from down the block, you know they can always count on waving it down for a frozen treat or a hot meal. at least for another ten years. *Customer soundbite: Say bye nieve, bye nieve* For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Brandon Garcia.\n```"}

According to the liaison, the 13 students were notified via email that they had been placed on interim suspension from the university. Two of the students were also told that they would need to move out of their USC housing by 5 p.m. tomorrow. The staff member, who is also a USC alumnus, is facing disciplinary action.\n\n\u201cThe disciplinary action process has been vague and feels intentionally drawn out,\u201d the media liaison told Annenberg Media. \u201cIt feels like an effort to intimidate protesters.\u201d\n\n\u201cInterim protective measures\u201d can be taken by the university after it has received reports of student conduct violations but before it has made a final decision on discipline, according to the USC Student Handbook. Interim suspension includes exclusion from all classes, a prohibition on participating in university-sponsored activities and an exclusion from university premises. There are three days left of finals.\n\nThe letter, signed by Emily Sandoval, the associate vice provost for student life, read that suspended students may complete their final exams if their instructor approves them to do so remotely or virtually. The only condition under which they may enter campus is if they are seeking urgent medical treatment at a healthcare facility.\n\nAnother version of the letter obtained by Annenberg Media was sent to a student who had been detained earlier in the week. Prior to today\u2019s sweep in the early morning hours, students who had been arrested for criminal trespassing during the April 24 sweep were notified in an email from the university that \u201cany further violations of university policies ... [would] result in further discipline up to expulsion as well as an immediate ban from campus.\u201d The email specified that violating university policies against camping, vandalism and defying DPS directives, among others, would be grounds for disciplinary action.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether those facing the disciplinary actions were at the encampment during either the April 24 or this morning\u2019s sweep. According to the liaison, the suspensions were \u201cnot consistent.\u201d\n\nMembers of the USC Divest from Death Encampment previously told Annenberg Media that Folt said the protesters were not at risk of facing academic consequences for their participation in the protests during the first day of negotiations on April 29. The meeting was recorded by USC Divest and Folt\u2019s legal team, the liaison said. At one point during the meeting, protest organizers said Folt told them she \u201cwould never\u201d impose academic consequences on the student protestors.\n\nThe university did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Annenberg Media.\n```"}

He would sing in the car and perform little concerts for his family. Music like that of Vanessa Hudgens \u2014 his first CD \u2014 or Hannah Montana \u2014 his favorite show at the time \u2014 punctuated his childhood.

Then he booked the role of Friedrich von Trapp in \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d At the age of 13, he embarked on a six-month national tour of the musical, his biggest role.\n\n\u201cIt was exhilarating and unreal, and a dream come true, but also a lot of anxiety for a 13 year old,\u201d Gantz said.\n\nThe anxiety didn\u2019t stop when he came back home. His voice began to change during puberty, and he encountered a reality that many other child actors faced at this stage of life.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, nobody wants you,\u201d Gantz said. \u201cIt was definitely a shock. It\u2019s a lot. [You\u2019re] 14 years old and you\u2019re like, \u2018I failed.\u2019\u201d\n\nHaving skipped his eighth grade for his tour with \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d he dropped straight into high school as a freshman when he finished his tour. He joined the vocal jazz ensemble and continued performing in theater. By then his taste in music was beginning to change \u2014 then Lollapalooza changed everything.\n\nAs Aisenberg recalls, the sun was beginning to dip into the horizon on an evening in August 2019 when she and Gantz waited eagerly for Ariana Grande\u2019s set, which wouldn\u2019t start for another four hours. They found out that in the meantime, a country artist was getting ready to perform in half an hour.\n\n\u2018We were like, \u2018Oh my God, who\u2019s this country artist, we\u2019re gonna have to sit through this concert. We\u2019re gonna hate it,\u2019\u201d Aisenberg remembered.\n\nThen, a concert-goer in a pink cowboy hat and sparkles turned to Gantz and Aisenberg said, \u201cYou guys are gonna watch this concert, and you\u2019re gonna be obsessed with her.\u201d\n\nHe was right. The artist was Kacey Musgraves, and she quickly became one of Gantz\u2019s favorite artists, along with the entire country genre. Some of his other influences include Ariana Grande and another lifelong favorite, Sara Bareilles.\n\n\u201cI would really like to have a career like [Bareilles],\u201d Gantz mused. \u201cShe acts, she sings, she produces \u2014 it\u2019s just very much that [she wears] all hats, just following the art vibe.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, while taking a songwriting class, Gantz said he felt \u201chaunted\u201d by the memories of his first relationship. Processing those feelings through songwriting eventually led him to create his first single, \u201cMalibu Feels Like You.\u201d But the process took much longer than he thought it would.\n\nHe first wrote the song on guitar, working with his professor to refine the structure and add more details. Then, he connected with a producer over the summer. He battled perfectionism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shitty pitfall because you\u2019re never going to love something 100%,\u201d Gantz said, \u201cand with art, it\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s just about expressing yourself in the moment.\u201d\n\nLast summer, in a car with Aisenberg and her brother, Gantz let her hear the unreleased single with full production for the first time.\n\n\u201cMe and my brother were just blown away,\u201d Aisenberg said. \u201cSongwriting is definitely more of a private process for him, and he wanted to keep that sacred. But he was excited to show it to us and we loved it.\u201d\n\nThe song begins with a guitar strumming a soft melody backed by a subdued drum beat, allowing his soft and contemplative voice to reflect on the ways his life is bogged down by the memory of his past relationships. Then drums suddenly kick up into a faster rhythm as his voice becomes more determined, recalling all of the everyday experiences that remind him of his past relationship \u2014 from sunsets to getting fast food late at night. And then it all goes away, the soft guitar riff returns, and in two minutes and 52 seconds, the emotional journey is over.\n\nThis semester, Gantz also took on a vocal coach: Jeffery Allen. With 44 years of experience in training vocalists, Gantz was determined to get in contact with Allen.\n\n\u201cHe had worked very consistently to make himself known to me and to consistently tap me on the shoulder enough that I couldn\u2019t resist having him come into my studio for an audition,\u201d Allen said.\n\nAs Allen puts it, Gantz was searching for a way to expand his ability to express emotion through his voice. Throughout their training, Allen said Gantz was tenacious and motivated to succeed.\n\n\u201cThe journey to become a proficient, consistent professional really takes a lot of consistent work,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI understood from the very getgo that Roy was a gent who was very driven.\u201d\n\nGantz said his lessons with Allen helped him reconnect with his body and with his inner child.\n\n\u201c[Singing] \u2018Defying Gravity\u2019 as a kid, that was freedom of expression and letting it all out and not caring,\u201d Gantz said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t really felt that sense of freedom and expression until I started those lessons with him.\u201d\n\nThis semester, he landed the role of Mark Cohen in \u201cRent,\u201d one of his biggest in recent years. Fully embracing the role, he set his signing ambitions aside to get in the headspace of Mark. By the time the show concluded, Gantz realized that his efforts were worth it.\n\n\u201cI was struggling with committing myself to art and committing myself to being an artist, and the fear and the insecurity,\u201d Gantz said. \u201c[But] it\u2019s never been clearer to me what I need to do in life.\u201d\n\nHe said it can be hard to balance his songwriting ambitions with his lifelong dream of making it to Broadway, but the two aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.\n\n\u201cMusic and acting is not a double life,\u201d Gantz said. \u201cWhen you follow art, it just happens. I really feel like there\u2019s gonna be seasons of my life where I\u2019m on a Broadway show and committing to that and maybe not writing as many songs, and then seasons of my life where I\u2019m in the studio ... That\u2019s the career I want for myself.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled Rebecca Aisenberg\u2019s last name.

Most of the encampment was sleeping in the hour before the LAPD arrived on campus at about 4 a.m. In a Sunday morning email, USC President Carol Folt said LAPD was brought in at her request.\n\nSaturday afternoon, the Divest from Death group attempted to hang a banner from Doheny Library\u2019s windows, though it was not immediately clear what the message on the banner was since it failed to fully unfurl. From what could be seen, it seemed to include the name of Adnan Al-Bursh, a Palestinian doctor who died last week in an Israeli prison after being held for four months.\n\nHours later, Nancy Alonzo, the assistant director of the USC Village Residential Colleges came to the outskirts of the encampment with a letter, reading it aloud to the liaisons of Divest from Death \u201cThe encampment has to go down. As we have mentioned before, your encampment and acts of vandalism and the theft of university property violate policies and the law,\u201d she read. \u201cThese policies actually exist to protect the safety and security of every member of our community and we must enforce these policies consistently as we have always done. \u201cAnd then we also set up an alternative free speech area that\u2019s available to you all and you can move the encampment there,\u201d she continued.\n\nAccording to coalition liaisons, Alonzo would not allow them to take a picture or get a physical copy of the letter. The encampment continued its programming for the night, including a screening of a documentary titled, \u201cWARmerica\u2019s Fate,\u201d while the campus increasingly shut down around them.\n\nAround 5 p.m., DPS officers announced closures of certain campus buildings and began erecting additional wire fences around Alumni Park and campus entrances. By 6:30 p.m. the USC central campus had been locked down completely, with students only allowed to leave.\n\nAlmost 12 hours after the statement was read, LAPD arrived at Alumni Park around 4 a.m., setting up a \u201cpress staging area\u201d outside Bovard Auditorium and allowing outside press onto the campus for the first time in a week. At one point, DPS officers threatened to \u201ctake\u201d Annenberg Media reporters\u2019 press passes and one officer told reporters, \u201cact like the media, and we\u2019re going to treat you like the media,\u201d after asking why the staging area was so far from the encampment.\n\nNo public information officer appeared to be on the scene, and both LAPD and DPS officers failed to provide Annenberg Media with a representative from their respective departments to speak about the sweep. At about 4:15 a.m., LAPD officers moved toward the encampment. Annenberg Media reporters, Zain Khan and Olivia Kelleher, live on the scene estimated there were a couple of dozen LAPD officers and many more DPS officers in the area of Alumni Park.\n\nUSC sent a community message warning that LAPD was \u201cclearing the center of UPC\u201d and anyone who didn\u2019t leave \u201ccould be arrested.\u201d By 5:15 a.m., that message had changed, telling those remaining that they \u201cwill be arrested.\u201d Encampment members exited the encampment peacefully while drumming and chanting, \u201cLong live the intifada,\u201d and, \u201cFree, free Palestine!\u201d\n\nAs the sun rose Sunday morning, the encampment was completely cleared and officers began confiscating items and tearing down tents in the park. A statement from Joel Curran, USC\u2019s senior vice president of communications, said it was \u201cnecessary\u201d for the university to call in LAPD \u201cto provide security as this was carried out peacefully.\u201d\n\nFolt confirmed in her note to the campus just before noon Sunday that there had been no arrests as a result of the most recent sweep and further said that the university would \u201cnot tolerate illegal encampments of any kind.\u201d LAPD confirmed to Annenberg Media that no arrests had been made.\n\nThe Sunday morning sweep came a week and a half after an April 24 crackdown by LAPD officers that ended in 93 total arrests, including 51 students, during an initial clearing. According to a statement by Folt, the university has \u201cinitiated disciplinary review processes for individuals who have violated both our policies and the law.\u201d\n\nIn her statement, Folt reiterated that future demonstrations on campus would have to take place in the nearby, designated \u201cFree Speech Area.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Ling Luo)\n\nBy Alea Motwane May 04, 2024 at 10:33 pm PDT\n\nThere are certain violations of the law that can lead to an international student being deported from the U.S. This brings into focus the fine line these students walk as a protest movement is sweeping across the United States calling for free speech and visa complications. So, the question arises: can international students exercise their right to free speech through protest like their U.S. citizen counterparts?\n\nAn F-1 visa allows a student to temporarily live in the U.S. for a specific period of time while enrolled at a school, college or other forms of academic institutions. If a student on an F-1 visa is suspended from their educational institution, they are at risk of losing their visa status. F-1 visa regulations require students to maintain full-time enrollment and make satisfactory progress in their course of study. Suspension disrupts this requirement and can lead to the student falling out of status.\n\nAs protests and encampments sweep over 130 U.S. universities, resulting in approximately around 2,000 student arrests so far, including 51 at USC, international students are especially at risk. A student suspended following an arrest would be legally advised by their legal advisors to either apply for reinstatement to regain legal status or leave the United States voluntarily to avoid the risk of deportation.\n\nUSC President Carol Folt recently sent out an email to the student body saying, that \u201cthe university has initiated disciplinary review processes for individuals who have violated both our policies and law.\u201d Students who had been arrested on April 24 at the Alumni Park encampment received emails from USC noting their arrests.\n\nOther schools including Columbia University have warned that failure to comply with university policies could lead to probation, suspension or expulsion. Out of the students who were arrested at the pro-Palestinian encampment, at least one is an international student. This student declined to comment.\n\nStudents have been circulating a screenshot that claims to be of an email sent out by the Malaysian embassy advising citizens studying in the U.S. to not get involved with any demonstrations. It noted, \u201cespecially those taking place on campus related to the GAZA issue,\u201d and that citizens should not issue \u201cmedia statements\u201d on social media. The screenshot also showed a warning that \u201cif you are caught you will be deported immediately.\u201d Annenberg Media has not been able to authenticate the email.\n\nWhile the debate intensifies around the participation of international students in political protests, it\u2019s crucial to understand the balance between lawful expression and the stringent requirements of maintaining a valid student visa status. Politicians have been weighing in. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, called for the U.S. government to deport and revoke the F-1 student visas given to international students who are \u201cHamas sympathizers.\u201d \u201cI would pull their visa and deport them,\u201d Blackburn said.\n\nBack in October, 19 Republican lawmakers called for the revocation and deportation of international students on F-1 student visas who have \u201cendorsed terrorist activity.\u201d Similar comments were made during the Republican presidential debates. If the academic institution is able to argue that someone with a visa, such as an F-1 student visa, was to endorse terrorist activities, it could lead to them being placed in deportation proceedings.\n\nAccording to the INA, any non-citizen who engages in or incites terrorist activities is deportable. If an individual is deported, they generally carry a ban from the U.S., for 5, 10 or 15 years. In many cases, it is said that even after the period of the ban is over, it is difficult to obtain a visa.\n\nDeportable offenses generally include crimes such as potential jail sentences over one year, such as drug/firearms trafficking, rape, murder, or multiple convictions from separate incidents, among other violent felonies. Trespass, disorderly conduct or resisting/obstructing police officers in making an arrest, usually does not lead to deportation. There are also exclusion offenses, which deny an international student entry or re-entry into the United States.\n\nBeing arrested, detained or under police investigation does not lead to a student being excluded. \u201cFailure to appear\u201d at court resulting in an arrest warrant being issued could lead to the consulate requiring the student to produce a police report about the activity that caused the arrest warrant to be issued. Even then, not all convictions lead to exclusion.\n\nYousef Khafaja, a Palestinian student born and raised in Germany studying at Santa Monica College, said the fear of the consequences he could potentially face as an international student participating in protests has never stopped him from doing so. \u201cWhatever happens to me is not going to be as important as the cause,\u201d Khafaja said.\n\nKhafaja was a part of the UCLA encampment, and this week was \u201chit with a cone and a metal pole\u201d during violent counter-demonstrations. In spite of that, he believes in staying peaceful at the protests and not \u201cbreak[ing] any laws,\u201d in order to avoid being detained or arrested.\u201d I had to look it up,\u201d Khafaja said. \u201cIf there are any legal consequences even if I stay peaceful, that could affect my visa, that could affect if I finish my studies or reapply for a visa. And it definitely affects my employment opportunities.\u201d\n\nKhafaja explained the general fear among pro-Palestinian protestors, who are covering their faces to hide their identity, hoping to minimize the risk of them not being employed by certain companies due to their involvement in the protests. \u201cIf a future employee, employer or company does not want to give me a job because of what I do or what I did, because I used my right to freedom of speech, because I spoke about Palestine \u2013 then I don\u2019t want their job and I don\u2019t want their money,\u201d Khafaja said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not concerned about that. But as for my visa, definitely.\u201d\n\nAs the debate around these issues evolves, the experiences of these students will likely continue to shape and inform discussions about free speech, immigration policy and international education in the United States.\n```"}

The faculty also criticized the university for calling the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) April 24 to break up the Gaza Solidarity Encampment, resulting in at least 93 arrests. \u201cThe university also acted contrary to our core values when it called in armed police officers to violently suppress what was, until then, a peaceful protest that occupied a small portion of the campus that did not disrupt day-to-day operations,\u201d the letter said. The letter stated that the university should have had security nearby to protect peacefully protesting students and community members if it was concerned about student safety or \u201coutside agitators.\u201d \u201cInstead, the police came in full force and ran roughshod over all students present, created new security risks, and escalated matters,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWhile we do not doubt the challenges of handling these difficult issues, the university\u2019s decisions have come at a substantial cost to students and faculty, as well as USC\u2019s reputation as a premier research institution founded on intellectual freedom.\u201d Armour pointed out that USC was able to provide security to protect right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro during a 2018 speech at Bovard Auditorium, which ignited widespread criticism and concern. \u201cIn many people\u2019s opinion, he (Shapiro) was an avowedly virulent racist. And to those people, allowing him to speak made this campus unsafe, echoing much of the many of the concerns we hear today,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they placed [USC\u2019s] image over the vindication of this vaunted value of free speech and that\u2019s just unseemly.\u201d Armour also criticized USC\u2019s ties with LAPD and the escalation created by bringing armed officers onto campus and the continued police presence in the days since protesters\u2019 arrests. \u201cWhat evidence is there that this has been out of control or created conditions that are imminently harmful to anyone in the community,\u201d he said. Yesterday, President Folt sent out a community update that said the university had \u201cinitiated disciplinary review processes\u201d for those who have violated both university policies and the law. \u201cWe will take any further actions required to maintain campus safety and security, consistent with our legal obligations,\u201d she wrote. Armour, who has been part of the negotiations with protest organizers and the administration, expressed shock and disappointment at what he said appears to be an about-face. \u201cShe (Folt) seemed to understand the students\u2019 concerns and to suggest that she was going to give weight to those concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this really shows now that they have dug in their heels and are going back to a more kind of retributive punitive response.\u201d Armour and his colleagues also expressed disappointment in what they said was the failure of Provost Andrew Guzman, who is the former dean of the Gould School of Law, to protect students\u2019 rights of freedom of speech. \u201cThe letter really expresses how seriously his colleagues take the value of free speech,\u201d Armour said. \u201cAnd why they feel especially betrayed that that value was flouted.\u201d \n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Amy Lee)\n\nBy Taryn Snyder May 04, 2024 at 5:51 pm PDT\n\nFree time between his summer real estate internship turned into the makings of a viral TikTok video for Grant Pallokat. Better known to the music world as house artist and DJ Gkat, Pallokat recorded snippets of his first release \u201cPeace of Mind\u201d as he was dressed in his suit before work. The song, which samples \u201cUnited in Grief\u201d by Kendrick Lamar (which originally samples \u201cParadise\u201d by NOT THE TWOS), has now reached over 1.5 million plays on Spotify alone. Just a year later, Pallokat is gearing up to release his new house track \u201cCome my Way\u201d and take on DJing full time.\n\nAnnenberg Media chatted with Pallokat about his path to becoming a DJ, from the platforms he learned on to teasing his first release \u201cPeace of Mind.\u201d Full transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nPallokat: Hi. My name is Grant Pallokat. I am from Mahwah, New Jersey. I\u2019m a junior at USC. I\u2019m a real estate major. And yeah, I started getting into music in high school. I started DJing around junior year of high school, just doing things at friends houses, and then fast forward till college I started getting into music production. And from there yeah, I\u2019ve kind of been following that production route while still doing DJ gigs, wherever I can.\n\nPallokat: Yeah, I think traditionally, house music, when it was first coming up was mainly just, you know, original songs. And now I feel like there\u2019s this new wave of sampling. Sampling, I mean, it\u2019s always been used. But I feel like now more than ever, people use these popular songs and kind of switch the genre entirely, and chop up the vocals, pitch them higher or lower, speed them up or slow them down. And yeah, kind of puts them into this new genre that has been spreading so much over the past few years.\n\nPallokat: I started \u2014 I was just a rap fan. I only liked rap music and my parents would play country music. So I was a fan of country music, went to a few Kenny Chesney shows in my time. And then as I got to, I would say, my junior year, I had a friend whose older brother was in college, and he got really big into house music, started going to a bunch of shows. He started DJing himself. I would go over to his house. I would listen to the music he was playing. I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, this is neat.\u2019 Like, it\u2019s something new that, you know, I might like, and then yeah, I went to my first show my junior year summer. It was R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL at Red Rocks. And that was where I got hooked right away. I was like, \u2018Oh like this was...\u2019 It was like such a cool experience, something I was not used to. And yeah, from then on I was really big. I started listening to new artists like Eric Prydz was another artist I got into very early that kind of shifted my like of rap music into house music.\n\nPallokat: It was crazy. It was honestly very shocking just because I haven\u2019t taken any classes in music. I\u2019d never taken production lessons other than just YouTube videos and talking to other people who made music. So when I saw that reaction, I was like \u2014 you know, it\u2019s very easy to be hard on yourself when you\u2019re starting off making music because you watch these videos of these big artists and you\u2019re like, \u2018Ah, my song does not sound anything close to this.\u2019 But when I saw the reaction I was shocked to see that you know everyone just starts somewhere and then gets to wherever they\u2019re at. And it doesn\u2019t always have to be a big artist making a song that gets a good reaction. It can be an artist like me who had never released a song before and then also getting a good reaction from people like all over.\n\nPallokat: Another thing that I was very proud of for myself was, I\u2019d get Instagram DMs, like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m trying to get into DJing. How do you get into it? Or how do you start getting into making music?\u2019 And I was sending the same DMs to people a year before. And I was like, \u2018Just keep watching YouTube videos. Here\u2019s the videos I watched, and just stay consistent throughout. And don\u2019t be afraid to share your music with other people because you have no idea when it\u2019s just gonna skyrocket.\u2019\n\nPallokat: Max Styler, he\u2019s one of the artists I\u2019ve been listening to a lot recently. You know, he\u2019s on the younger side. He has been producing for a while. But I\u2019ve been following him for a good amount of time, so I\u2019ve been able to see his progression, which has been really cool. Other artists, I\u2019d say that I get a good influence from is, like I mentioned before Cloonee, he\u2019s really big in sampling. He uses very cool samples. And then just the guys who have been in the industry for much longer. Solomun, he\u2019s one of those guys who\u2019s been doing it for so long and has had so much success. And he hasn\u2019t slowed down at all. You still see him selling out the biggest venues and the most new venues.\n\nPallokat: My next song that I\u2019m releasing is actually an original. But the issue with sampling songs is sometimes you run into trouble. A lot of them I mean, you could find them on websites, where it\u2019s royalty free, so you\u2019re allowed to use a sample. But I just sampled a Drake song. Unfortunately, I probably won\u2019t be able to ever release that. I mean, I could throw it on SoundCloud, but I won\u2019t be able to release that. Because getting the clearance from that would cost a lot of money.\n\nPallokat: Yeah, I remember when I was \u2014 because like I said, I\u2019d never taken a music class or anything. So when all these people are commenting on my videos, like, \u2018Oh, you gotta release this, you gotta release this.\u2019 Then I\u2019m saying to myself like, \u2018I\u2019ve no idea how to release a song. Like, I don\u2019t even know where to start.\u2019 So I\u2019m back on YouTube, like \u2018how to release a song for the first time,\u2019 texting people I know that have released songs before. And then yeah, I heard of DistroKid. It\u2019s just distrokid.com. You have to get a membership, but it\u2019s very helpful. It\u2019s where you put in all the information for the song. It\u2019s where you give credits. And yeah, no, it\u2019s very helpful with getting your songs out to those platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nPallokat: I think one thing, I mean, one of the reasons I got into DJing is because even when I\u2019m just playing, when I started DJing at my friend\u2019s house, one of my good girl friends, Cameron, we\u2019d be in her basement, and it would be, you know, probably 10 or 15 of us. But when you play a song, no matter what song it is, it could just be a pop song, any type of dance song. And when you see the effect it could have on just the whole vibe of the environment. That was kind of what got me hooked. Where you could change the emotion of, now it\u2019s crowds, by just playing a song.\n\nPallokat: I think one of the main things I try to do when I\u2019m DJing is to just have energy. I\u2019ve noticed, just going to shows myself when you have a DJ who is playing music, but kind of sitting there and just doing what they do, which is twist knobs, click buttons, and transition songs. It is completely different from a DJ who does that, but is jumping up and down, getting the crowd involved. When you see a DJ who has energy up there, it\u2019s contagious. If you see a DJ jumping, you start jumping. It\u2019s just kind of one of those natural things.\n\nPallokat: So, for my first set, which was, as I said, my freshman year of college, I prepped for so long. I figured out which songs I was playing, when I was going to transition them. I practiced doing the transitions, probably like 50-plus times. I went to a studio off West Adams called Pirate Studios where we could rent a little DJ booth. And, yeah, I went there with my buddies, and I just practiced the set over and over and over.\n\nPallokat: I officially got a manager. So I\u2019m doing music full-time this summer. It was definitely hard to convince my dad that he sent his son to USC to study real estate or economics and then tell him like, \u2018Hey, Dad, I think I want to do music.\u2019 It was definitely a tricky conversation to have. And Dad, if you\u2019re listening to this I still haven\u2019t told you but I want to pursue it full time. Hopefully, I get to have that conversation before then.\n\nPallokat: I\u2019m gonna be staying in LA. I mean, I\u2019m going to be traveling a lot, just to play shows in different states, different cities to try to get more recognition in other markets than just LA or USC, more specifically. But I\u2019ll be in LA because there are a lot of artists that live locally in Los Angeles. I feel like that\u2019s one of the benefits of being at USC is because there are a handful of artists who reside in LA when they\u2019re not touring or playing shows in other states.\n\nPallokat: The song I\u2019m releasing next is called \u201cCome my Way.\u201d I just teased it for the first time last week. It\u2019s gonna be getting teased a lot more, but it\u2019s a new song. It\u2019s obviously a house song. It\u2019s more the minimal house aspect. I\u2019d say it has an influence from a lot of the Solid Grooves DJs, which is a minimal house label.\n\nPallokat: I kind of touched on this before but what I think I find most fulfilling is being able to see a song just from the very beginning, the very start of it to its finish and then seeing people know the song when you\u2019re playing it sets. I think that was my first kind of \u2018Ah\u2019 moment where I was able to make a song. Because I mean, I\u2019m making it in my bedroom, in a frat house on a small desk, you know, as people are walking in and walking out. I\u2019m recording TikToks. People are just interrupting, which I mean I love every bit of it, don\u2019t get me wrong, but being able to see it, you know, you could be in such a small area, and then being able to reach out to such a broad audience. And then I think, where I found the most fulfilling aspect of it was being at a show playing a song that I just made, and seeing people sing the words just from hearing it on social media, hearing it by word of mouth, hearing it just being played on Spotify. I think that is what I find most fulfilling about making music. It\u2019s also being able to just change the energy in a room at any given moment. You know, just pull the DJ board out, plug in the speaker, and you start playing music and you could completely change your room from silent and nothing going on to you just make it a party.\n\nPallokat: I was actually talking about this with one of my friends the other day. I was saying when they\u2019re all working at their office jobs, wherever they are, whether it\u2019s New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Texas, I was saying my dream would be getting shows throughout the US. Like going to New York, for example, and being able to text all my friends like, \u2018Hey, I have a show at this venue. You\u2019re all coming backstage with me. I\u2019ll see you guys on Thursday.\u2019 Being able to do that would be so cool because obviously I want to enjoy myself but I also love being able to enjoy it with my friends. I mean, yeah, sometimes you\u2019re gonna have to like \u2014 if I go to Europe, for example, I highly doubt my friends will travel there to see a show, unless it was very big. But I think being able to travel, DJ and still being able to have my friends experience it with me and my family. I think that would be my ultimate goal and also just making a living off it. But yeah, more than anything what I told them was, if I send them a text in the next two years, saying, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re gonna have to leave work early Friday. We got this going on.\u2019 That would be my ultimate goal.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/05/04/lakers-darvin-ham-fired-as-head-coach/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Just like Thanksgiving dinner, Ham\u2019s done. The Los Angeles Lakers fired head coach Darvin Ham today after the team suffered a first-round exit in the NBA playoffs against the Denver Nuggets. The Lakers lost the series 4-1 after making the playoffs by beating the New Orleans Pelicans in the NBA Play-In Tournament. Ham was the head coach for the Lakers for two full seasons after being appointed in the summer of 2022. Under Ham, the Lakers finished the 2023-2024 regular season with a 47-35 record. Throughout his two seasons as the Lakers head coach, Ham\u2019s teams had a 90-74 record in the regular season. A deep playoff run in the 2022-2023 season also came after a Play-In Tournament win, a mirror of the 2023-2024 season. Ham led the Lakers to the Western Conference Finals in 2023, where the team ultimately lost to the Denver Nuggets, who went on to win the 2022-2023 NBA title. Expectations for the Lakers\u2019 2023-2024 season were a little higher after their 2022-2023 season was riddled with injuries for star players. Lakers forward LeBron James only played 55 games and center Anthony Davis played 56 games in Ham\u2019s first season with the Lakers. James played 71 games and Davis played 76 games in Ham\u2019s second season with the Lakers, which probably raised expectations in the front office. The final series with Denver in 2024 was marked with ups and downs. The Lakers had double-digit leads in every single game of the series, but only managed to win one game against the Nuggets. Vice President of Basketball Operations and General Manager Rob Pelinka thanked Ham for his \u201cdedication and positivity\u201d in a statement posted on X. \u201cWe greatly appreciate Darvin\u2019s efforts on behalf of the Lakers and recognize the many accomplishments achieved over the past two seasons, including last year\u2019s remarkable run to the Western Conference Finals,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cWhile this was a difficult decision to make, it is the best course of action following a full review of the season. This organization will remain unwavering in its commitment to deliver championship-caliber basketball to Lakers fans around the world.\u201d Before his time with the Lakers, Ham was an assistant coach for the Atlanta Hawks from 2013 to 2018. He became the assistant coach for the Milwaukee Bucks from 2018 to 2022, winning an NBA championship with the organization in 2021. Ham is the fourth head coach the Lakers have let go since 2018. Frank Vogel, Ham\u2019s predecessor, was let go in 2022 after leading the Lakers to a 2019-2020 NBA championship and having a 127-98 record with the team. The former Bucks coach is also the first major coaching casualty across the league following the conclusion of the regular season and most of the first round. Adrian Griffin was notably fired midseason as the Milwaukee Bucks head coach, with Doc Rivers coming in to fill the position. Pelinka and his front office will now search the coaching market for their next coach, who could potentially lead them to a record-breaking 18th NBA title if James and Davis stay\u2014assuming the Boston Celtics don\u2019t get there first.\n```"}

(Photo by Carly Rieger)\n\nBy Eniola Adeleke May 04, 2024 at 4:40 pm PDT\n\nIn a rematch of the 2023 women\u2019s lacrosse Pac-12 Tournament championship game, the Trojans looked to repeat their success against the Colorado Buffaloes Thursday night. But coming off of a 13-10 win Wednesday night against UC Davis, the Buffs had other plans. Colorado defeated reigning Pac-12 champion USC 12-9 in the tournament semifinals at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum.\n\n\u201cColorado is a great team and they played incredibly well,\u201d head coach Lindsay Munday said.\n\nThe Trojans and the Buffs are familiar conference foes. Munday\u2019s squad had already defeated Colorado earlier this season 15-6 at home. Last year, USC defeated Colorado 12-6 at the California Memorial Stadium in Berkeley to earn its second-ever Pac-12 Tournament title.\n\nOn Thursday night, though, senior attacker Madeline Pisani led the Colorado charge, netting four goals. For the Trojans, senior attacker Maggie Brown scored five of USC\u2019s nine goals. Meanwhile, the Pac-12 Attacker of the Year, graduate Ella Heaney, did not touch the score sheet.\n\nThe Buffs started hot Thursday night, racing out to a quick 2-0 lead in just three minutes. It was this quick, aggressive offense that propelled the Buffs to victory against the Trojans. Colorado scored first in every quarter and led for the game\u2019s entirety.\n\nThe Trojans tightened up their defense following Colorado\u2019s fiery offensive start; senior goalkeeper Kait Devir came up with a big stop midway through the first. USC also picked up two ground balls and forced Colorado to commit two turnovers.\n\nHowever, the Buffs\u2019 offense proved to be dynamic and adapted to USC\u2019s awakened defense. Their patient passing scheme allowed them to penetrate USC\u2019s tight defense before sophomore midfielder Lily Assini buried the ball in the back of the net to put Colorado up 3-1.\n\nAfter allowing five Colorado goals in the first quarter, the Trojans limited the Buffs\u2019 scoring in the second. Devir was the Trojans\u2019 savior again, coming up with back-to-back saves to keep her team in the game. However, when USC\u2019s defensive stops finally allowed the Trojans to put one on the board, Colorado responded almost immediately with back-to-back goals to extend its lead to four.\n\nMunday also credited Colorado\u2019s success at the draw as a factor in USC\u2019s offensive struggles Wednesday night. \u201cI think they did a great job at the draw control in the first half,\u201d Munday said. \u201cIn the second quarter, we didn\u2019t win any draws, so it\u2019s hard to get a rhythm offensively when you don\u2019t have the ball. That kind of set the tone for us.\u201d\n\nColorado completely dominated the third quarter, with five shots on goal to USC\u2019s one and picking up six ground balls to USC\u2019s four. The Trojans are no stranger to trailing in a game, yet they just couldn\u2019t dig themselves out of the scoring deficit Thursday night. Munday\u2019s squad did not score once in the third quarter and entered the final period trailing 10-5.\n\nDespite the lackluster third, the Trojans started what seemed to be a comeback in the fourth. With a little over six minutes to play, USC had scored three unanswered goals to cut its six-goal deficit in half. The Trojans felt the pressure, and a comeback was on the horizon. USC\u2019s offensive stints became shorter as the Trojans were launching shots more quickly. The traveling pack of Buffs\u2019 fans grew quiet \u2014 a stark contrast to their loud chants all game long.\n\nHowever, late turnovers from USC and saves by Colorado\u2019s senior goalkeeper Danielle Heintz thwarted the Trojans\u2019 momentum, ultimately allowing the Buffs to come away with the win.\n\nColorado advances to face No. 1 seed Stanford in the championship game on Saturday at 12 p.m. Following its loss Thursday night, USC will eagerly await Selection Sunday to see if they will be competing in the NCAA tournament.\n\n\u201cFor the younger players, you use [this loss] as fuel,\u201d Munday said. \u201cIf this is the end of our season, it stays with you \u2014 and it should. You should remember this throughout the entire summer and throughout the entire next year and use it as motivation to not let it happen ever again.\u201d\n\nFor the seniors who may have played their final collegiate match Wednesday night, Munday reassured them of their legacy. \u201cThe message most importantly is that we\u2019re grateful for the group that we had, grateful for the seniors,\u201d Munday said. The seniors\u2019 legacy isn\u2019t wins and losses, it\u2019s so much more than that.\u201d\n\nThe draw will be announced at 6 p.m. on Sunday.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/05/04/clippers-no-leonard-no-first-round-victory/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 The Los Angeles Clippers couldn\u2019t keep their chances at a championship run alive, suffering a 114-101 loss in front of a rowdy Dallas Mavericks crowd Friday night. After getting humiliated 123-93 in Game 5 at Crypto.com Arena, the odds were not in the Clippers\u2019 favor as they headed back to Dallas for Game 6. Then, those odds decreased even further after Kawhi Leonard\u2019s knee inflammation was likely to keep him out for the entire series. The Clippers were already struggling without their leading scorer.\n\nGame 6 was not nearly the same domination by the Mavs that Game 5 was. The first half was in Dallas\u2019 hands until a 15-2 Clippers run late in the second quarter brought LA back to life. Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue seemed to have found a solid lineup in that quarter by bringing Norman Powell off the bench and having him play with the Clippers\u2019 starters in PJ Tucker\u2019s place. Powell hit several big shots that helped the Clippers reduce the 12-point deficit and Terrance Mann seemed like the right defender against Luka Doncic, as Mann held Dallas\u2019 starman to zero field goals in the last six minutes of the first half.\n\nBut things quickly fell apart. With the game tied at 52 apiece going into halftime, the Clippers looked like a brand new team and were firing on all cylinders. However, in the first two minutes of the second half, Doncic and Kyrie Irving combined for eight Mavericks points and Lue was forced to call a quick timeout. The Mavericks never looked back and outscored the Clippers by 15 in the third quarter. Irving struggled in the first half scoring just two points, but caught fire in the second half and finished with 30 on the night. Up by 20 points, Irving sealed the deal after converting on a four-point play halfway through the fourth quarter. Doncic finished with 28 points, while the Clippers were led by Paul George and Powell with 18 and 20, respectively.\n\nWhen the Clippers signed James Harden in November, many expected the trio of Leonard, Harden and George to take LA far into the playoffs. Those expectations looked even more likely to come true when they stood at a 35-16 record in mid-February. However, issues arose toward the end of the season that were never addressed and the Mavericks exposed the Clippers\u2019 weaknesses throughout the series.\n\nWhere it went wrong for the Clippers\n\nThe first and biggest issue for the Clippers throughout the year was the lack of an interior player who could rebound and defend consistently. Tyronn Lue frequently switched between Ivica Zubac, Daniel Theis and Mason Plumlee, eventually settling on Zubac once he recovered from an injury in early February. Zubac had his moments and was able to contribute offensively, but the Mavericks\u2019 athleticism prevented Zubac from keeping up in transition. Plumlee was given a chance later in the first quarter in Game 6, but the same issues remained.\n\nConceding offensive rebounds were another major issue for the Clippers and in the first quarter of Game 6 the Mavericks had collected six offensive boards before the first TV timeout was called. Dallas\u2019 big men, especially rookie Dereck Lively II, who grabbed 5 of his own, gave the Mavericks multiple second-chance opportunities on which they often capitalized. Theis may have been a better option than Zubac when fighting for loose balls since he\u2019s quicker and more feisty in the frontcourt, but Lue never gave him the chance.\n\nOne other problem for the Clippers that had nothing to do with basketball: body language. Oftentimes the Clippers\u2019 body language was extremely poor, and players often hanged their heads when the game was not going their way. Without Leonard healthy to lead LA in this series, the team\u2019s morale issues seemed exacerbated and the Clippers didn\u2019t appear to have the same confidence they did when they were winning game after game in the middle of the regular season.\n\nThe Clippers have some big choices to make this offseason after an early playoff exit. They\u2019ve already extended Leonard\u2019s contract, but George\u2019s status is up in the air and it won\u2019t be a surprise if he signs elsewhere. George and Harden are two of the best scorers in the league, but the chemistry between the Clippers\u2019 big three was too inconsistent to be confident in that group moving forward, especially with how the season ended.\n\nRegardless of the roster the Clippers have next October, the Clippers will need to pack the newly-built Intuit Dome and create an environment that opposing teams dread playing in front of. Crypto.com Arena was always going to be the Lakers\u2019 impenetrable home, but now that the Clippers have their own arena, it may mark the start of a new era of Clippers basketball.\n```"}

Griffin is an up-and-coming country-pop singer-songwriter from Lincoln, Nebraska who is graduating with a degree in music and songwriting in May. She started out as an acting major but has always found a passion in music and performance as she was part of musical theater growing up.\n\n\u201cI always knew that I wanted to do both music and theater and I was always kind of caught between the two. I just love performing, I love being on stage. It\u2019s where I feel most comfortable,\u201d Griffin said.\n\nGriffin describes her sound as a \u201c1970s Laurel Canyon troubadour meets Taylor Swift in her country-pop \u2018Fearless\u2019 era. She takes tons of inspiration from other artists such as Joni Mitchell and Carole King, as well.\n\nGriffin explained that she loved writing music throughout her college years. Whenever life threw good memories or bad times at her, she would say \u201cOh well, It\u2019s all just songwriting material.\u201d It naturally became a motto that Griffin had lived by throughout her college journey.\n\nAll 12 of the original songs on the album are based on real-life scenarios that she\u2019s been through: from feeling out of place at college parties to falling in love.\n\n\u201cI like to say that the album is sort of a tapestry of all kinds of joys, hopes, fears, and heartaches from my four years of college,\u201d she said.\n\nThrough the new album, Griffin explored her creativity by producing nine out of the 12 songs. For one song, she even included her own rhythm made with a red Solo cup in the background as an homage to the song title, \u201cRed Cup,\u201d a song about feeling out of place at college parties.\n\nVenturing out of her comfort zone and testing out all the knowledge and skills she gained, she worked with another student producer from USC named Jared Klinghoffer, in her tiny studio apartment where it took a lot of guitar and backing vocals.\n\n\u201cIt was so fun getting into it, getting to produce my own songs, because I was able to add my own personal touch to it, which was very meaningful to me,\u201d she said.\n\nThese 12 songs encapsulate her coming-of-age story, incorporating experiences relatable to any college student. Her track \u201cTwentysomething\u201d is all about her last year at USC, the ups and downs of being a senior in college.\n\nHer favorite lyrics on the album come from this track: \u201cIt\u2019s those who crash and burn are those who started the flame/Those who fall down are those who took a leap of faith.\u201d\n\nGriffin said she found herself connecting with that line, especially this year, as she\u2019s reminded that even if there are \u201ccrashes and burns,\u201d she\u2019s proud that she put herself out there and tried something new.\n\n\u201cUltimately, I want my music to spark joy in people,\u201d Griffin said. She said she hopes that through this album, her lyrics can resonate with others. She said she wants the melancholy tracks to remind listeners that they aren\u2019t alone, while the upbeat titles celebrate the highs of adolescence.\n\n\u201cAs an artist, I have a goal and hope to act as a role model for young women, to empower girls of our generation,\u201d she added.\n\nGriffin\u2019s love of music and determination stems from her family\u2019s support, and she said she is forever grateful to them. Beyond supporting his daughter\u2019s musical endeavors, Griffin\u2019s dad participates, as well. He is the drummer featured on some of the tracks on her album.\n\nGriffin said her dad has always drummed in a rock band his whole life and that she dreamed of them performing together. Following graduation, Griffin will be going on a mini-tour through Colorado, performing alongside her father on the drums.\n\n\u201cMy family support really means the world to me, and it\u2019s so cool that I get to share all this with my dad.,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that if I ever go on tour, he would definitely be my drummer.\u201d\n\nIn September, Griffin will be moving to Nashville to continue pursuing a music career. Griffin said her dream one day is to sing one of her original songs for an audience that would know all the words and sing along.\n\nTo show her appreciation and gratitude towards her listeners, she and her mom make and distribute handmade gifts whenever Griffin performs live.\n\n\u201cIf my future has anything to do with music, I\u2019ll be more than happy,\u201d she said.\n\nGriffin\u2019s new album, \u201cIt\u2019s All Just Songwriting Material\u201d is now available for streaming on Spotify.\n```"}

(AP/David J. Phillip)\n\nBy Valerie Fang May 04, 2024 at 1:33 pm PDT\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d is a column by Valerie Fang dedicated to the sport of figure skating. I always think that my introduction to figure skating in early 2022 has changed my life\u2019s trajectory for the better. Along the way, I have witnessed how so many athletes defy gravity to challenge both themselves and the limits of the sport. For this closing edition, I want to share a few things I have learned from following figure skating. It is both an appreciation post for the sport and a memo for myself to look back on from time to time in the future. Welcome back to \u201cIn the Loop\u201d \u2014 it has been a ride.\n\nKeep your axis straight. In figure skating, this is the foundation for making any jumps. Of course, you can still jump with a tilted axis, but that puts a lot of pressure on landing and lowers the jump\u2019s grade of execution (GOE). In life outside the rink, I think each of us all have our own axis: our sense of self. I will remember to not let the opinions of others sidetrack my own purpose and moral compass. Let this axis be the basis for every leap of faith we make in this world.\n\nAlways jump forward. The axel jump is the oldest and hardest jump in figure skating. It is also the only type of jump that requires the skater to take off forward. The most difficult part of life is perhaps also the most important. The most painful challenges are also the ones we must face head-on, because they are often the most rewarding. Find the courage to leap forward and do not look back. Nothing can define or limit you but your own conception of who you are and what you can achieve. As I move on to the next stage of my life, I will remember to always look ahead and move through life with wonder and fearlessness.\n\n\u201cBe the challenger, not the champion.\u201d You might think, \u201coh no, another Hanyu Yuzuru quote!\u201d I do not want to sound like a broken record, but the truth is that Hanyu was the sole reason why I got into this sport, created this column and still care about what happens in competitive figure skating even after his retirement. So, I feel almost obliged to mention this message, which I hold dearest to my heart, in the closing article. We have boundless potential, and there is no limit to what we can achieve. I will remember to brace for competitions with grace but always push for my own improvement first. After all, in any sports competition, breaking through one\u2019s own limits and exceeding what we think we\u2019re capable of is more valuable than any medal.\n\nFlowers will bloom. Figure skaters forever move me with their hopefulness and courage in the face of pain. One of the first things you learn when you start skating \u2014 even before you step on ice \u2014 is how to fall. Especially in the case of quad jumps which are ruling the sport today, skaters hit the ice with seven times their body weight if they fail to land. But, spring will come for those who have gone through the winter. Hold on to the dream with devotion and life will happen.\n\nAs I am graduating this month and embarking on a new chapter, my storyline at Annenberg Media is coming to an end. But, dear reader, our journey with figure skating does not have to. Because you care about what I write, I have sharpened my mind as a sports spectator. Figure skating has opened a door for me to reflect on my perspectives on life. And I\u2019d like to think that I have become a better human being because of that. Thank you so much for your attention and support along the way. I hope that, wherever you are in life, you can be accompanied by some figure skating content and stay in the loop.\n```"}

(AP/William Liang)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner May 04, 2024 at 1:19 pm PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Kings\u2019 last-ditch effort to come back in their first round playoff series in Game 5 was halted by the Edmonton Oilers, who eliminated Los Angeles for the third-straight year.\n\nThe 2023-24 season was full of ups and downs for the Kings. LA started the year as a stellar road team, winning its first 11 games away from home\u2014a new league record. But the tide turned following a stout 20-7-4 start when Todd McLellan\u2019s team went 3-8-6 over its next 17 games, resulting in the end of McLellan\u2019s head coaching tenure.\n\nGeneral manager Rob Blake promoted then-assistant coach Jim Hiller to steer the ship, which brought new life to the struggling Kings. The once-successful road team suddenly gained the ability to win in front of its home fans and managed to steal the third spot in the Pacific Division, finishing with 99 points on a 44-27-11 record, a five-point regression from the Kings\u2019 2022-23 total.\n\nThe Dubois deal: A nightmare in hindsight\n\nWhile LA made the playoffs, losing in the first round and extending the playoff series win drought to 10 years was a huge disappointment, especially considering the team is very much in win-now mode and had high expectations after a productive offseason.\n\nIn July 2023, the Kings made a blockbuster trade with the Winnipeg Jets to acquire 25-year-old center Pierre-Luc Dubois, who was coming off back-to-back seasons with at least 27 goals. Los Angeles surrendered forwards Gabriel Vilardi, Alex Iafallo and Rasmus Kupari, plus a second-round pick in 2024 to acquire the former Jet.\n\nDubois, who was supposed to add considerable offensive firepower to a defensive-minded Kings team, ended up severely underachieving in 2023-24. Signed to an eight-year deal with an average $8.5 million salary per season, Dubois only generated 40 points on 16 goals and 24 assists and just one point in the playoffs, spending most of his time in the bottom-six.\n\nOn the other side of the deal, while Winnipeg also lost in the first round, Vilardi eclipsed the 20-goal mark and Iafallo was a solid depth piece for the Jets, adding to the one-sidedness of the deal retrospectively.\n\nUnless the Kings buy out Dubois\u2019 contract or trade him, they\u2019ll be stuck with a regrettable deal for quite some time.\n\nWho\u2019s in goal?\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 goaltending tandem was revamped during the offseason when the team added veteran Cam Talbot on a one-year \u201cprove it\u201d deal to start in front of Pheonix Copley. The Kings\u2019 netminder group was always going to be malleable, as the 16-year Jonathan Quick era concluded in 2022-23.\n\nTalbot started the year on a tear, posting a 14-8-3 record with a 2.10 goals-against average on a .925 save percentage in his first 25 appearances, earning him an all-star nod. But when Copley underwent ACL surgery, effectively ending his season, Talbot\u2019s workload increased and the 36-year-old journeyman finished the year averaging 2.50 goals against on a .913 save percentage.\n\nThose aren\u2019t shabby figures, but his dominant first-half showing plateaued and he finished with a 27-20-6 record. David Rittich, who came in as backup, was a bright spot in net. Although he started in fewer than half of Talbot\u2019s games, he recorded better stats, lightening the load on his netminding partner.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 dilemma is that currently, none of the three goaltenders are under contract for the 2024-25 season. As a team that prides itself on its defense, the Kings will likely be fine with another brand new tandem next season, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to maintain some familiar crease identity while also supporting it with an accomplished backstop.\n\nBright spots to boast about\n\nUnsurprisingly, established veterans carried the torch for Los Angeles in 2023-24. In order, the Kings\u2019 top-four point leaders were forwards Adrian Kempe, Kevin Fiala, An\u017ee Kopitar and Trevor Moore. But the fifth, winger Quinton Byfield, who had never played anywhere near a full season in the NHL, broke out for the first time after his No. 2 overall selection in the 2020 draft.\n\nWithout a doubt, Byfield\u2019s form died down as the season progressed. But with 20 goals and 35 assists, he reminded fans why he was such a highly touted pick. He\u2019s been a bit of a late bloomer, but the glimmers of greatness in 2023-24 will make next season a big one for his development, as he fully transitions out of being a prospect and into a mainstay of the Kings\u2019 offense.\n\nThe Kings\u2019 regular-season penalty kill was a huge bright spot. LA ranked second in limiting opposing power plays 84.6% of the time, which massively fueled the team\u2019s defensive prowess. But Los Angeles couldn\u2019t contain Edmonton\u2019s lethal power play unit in the postseason, which went 9-for-20, leading to the Kings\u2019 downfall.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nThe Kings are a perennial spender that endeavors to keep their core together at all costs, so cap space to bring in a big free agent isn\u2019t something they\u2019ll necessarily have in the summer. In addition to the goalies, LA\u2019s unrestricted free agents include defenseman Matt Roy and forwards Viktor Arvidsson and Trevor Lewis.\n\nOn the restricted side, the Kings will either renegotiate or part ways with youngsters like Byfield, defenseman Jordan Spence and winger Arthur Kaliyev. Kaliyev had bright moments during the season, but Hiller would regularly scratch him from the lineup with limited reasoning, which might have foreshadowed his career in black and silver coming to an end. The 22-year-old tallied seven goals and eight assists in 2023-24.\n\nWith very few highly regarded prospects in the pipeline, the Kings find themselves in an interesting position when it comes to competing for a Cup; they\u2019re not bad enough to split up the core and rebuild, but they don\u2019t have the farm system or trade capital to contend with the top teams.\n\nThe Western Conference\u2019s best, the Dallas Stars, are an example of what Los Angeles should be trying to be; a depth-heavy squad filled with young talent and distinguished veterans to lead the charge. Two once-dominant playoff teams in the 2010\u2032s, the Chicago Blackhawks and San Jose Sharks, both finished at the bottom of the standings in 2023-24. Both teams, for years, had a consistent core of players on hefty contracts that, unfortunately, stretched out too long, causing future turmoil. Both squads also had limited future prospects to be excited about.\n\nHow does this connect to the Kings? Well, Los Angeles, the winner of the 2014 Stanley Cup, could fall into a similar pit if it can\u2019t find a healthy balance between young talent and the veteran core. Dubois was supposed to be the young catalyst this past season, but obviously, his stardom didn\u2019t come to fruition.\n\nYounger assets like blueliner Brandt Clarke, plus centers Akil Thomas and Alex Turcotte all showed some promise, so elevated roles should be in store for them next season to continue complementing the top lines, but it\u2019s probably not enough to make the necessary difference.\n\nThe Kings will also pick in the first round for the first time since 2021, which will be a later-round selection. Structural changes may be on the horizon for Los Angeles as well. Hiller was the interim head coach and won\u2019t have the lead role guaranteed for future seasons, especially considering the first-round exit. Blake could also be on the hot seat.\n\nContinuing to add depth and supporting the top lines will be critical to compete in the wild Pacific Division. And if one thing is for certain, the Kings will definitely want to avoid meeting the Oilers in the playoffs again.\n```"}

The House has passed legislation Saturday, April 20, to ban TikTok in the U.S. if its China-based owner doesn't sell its stake, sending it to the Senate as part of a larger package of bills that would send aid to Ukraine and Israel. House Republicans' decision to add the TikTok bill to the foreign aid package fast-tracked the legislation after it had stalled in the Senate. The aid bill is a priority for President Joe Biden that has broad congressional support.\n\nBy Hali Mecklin May 04, 2024 at 10:54 am PDT\n\nSamuel Aldridge is a 33-year-old dad from North Carolina. He\u2019s worked 12-hour days as a pipe-layer for most of his adult life. He\u2019s a self-proclaimed \u201cAverage Joe.\u201d He also has nearly two million followers and 50 million likes on TikTok. After a six-year social media journey across various platforms, Aldridge made it big on TikTok in 2022 as @Slamuri. His niche was storytelling \u2013 he\u2019s the faceless narrator behind the heavily researched,  50-part sagas  about true crime and internet drama that suck unsuspecting scrollers into hours-long deep dives. Thanks to the mysterious TikTok algorithm boosting one of his videos, \u201c TikTokers who did terrible things ,\u201d to over 15 million people, Aldridge was able to quit his construction job and support his family by making TikToks full-time. Two months ago he decided it wasn\u2019t worth it.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re sucked into creating content, a lot of your social life just kind of disappears,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized to keep things moving, I was just going to have to keep working more and more and I was already working 17 to 19 hours a day just doing content.\u201d In February, he announced on all his social media platforms that he was returning to pipe-laying and stepping back from content creation. His reasoning was simple \u2014 he wanted more time with his young kids, and TikTok had consumed his life. He feared he was missing a pivotal moment that he couldn\u2019t get back.\n\nAldridge isn\u2019t alone. Some users and creators on TikTok are parting ways with the app, citing a variety of reasons ranging from the addictive algorithm to body image issues. User growth as a whole on the platform is slowing down; TikTok\u2019s annual user base grew 84% between 2019 and 2020, but only increased by 16% between 2022 and 2023, according to a Business of Apps  report . On top of this mounting exodus, on April 23 Congress passed a bill proposing to ban TikTok if its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, refuses to sell within nine months. This new version of the bill, which initially passed the House in mid-March, was updated \u201cbased on negotiations with key senators\u201d to speed it through the Senate, according to  Politico . President Joe Biden signed the bill into action the next day.\n\nTikTok\u2019s future is dubious in America on all fronts, but Congress\u2019 arguments against the platform differ significantly from the average user\u2019s. The bipartisan legislators in favor of the bill say that TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership seriously threatens national security. Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, called the app \u201ca spy balloon in American\u2019s phones\u201d and \u201ca modern-day Trojan horse of the CCP\u201d on April 20 when he introduced the updated  measure  to the House. \u201cNational security experts are sounding the alarm, warning that our foreign adversaries are using every tool at their disposal, including apps like TikTok, to amass troves of sensitive data on all Americans,\u201d Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone said. \u201cThis bill takes decisive action to mitigate our foreign adversaries\u2019 ability to collect Americans\u2019 data and use it against us.\u201d\n\nHowever, for some users, China\u2019s data-storing practices aren\u2019t even on their list of reasons to quit scrolling. \u201cI think even if a lot of the public found out that there was a major link between the Chinese government and TikTok, they really wouldn\u2019t care,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cFor me right now, it could go either way because I don\u2019t really use it anymore. I\u2019m working a full-time job.\u201d\n\nAnna Shvidler is a college student and self-proclaimed reformed TikTok addict. She said she finally quit the app in late 2022 after many futile attempts, her main concern being how time-consuming it was. \u201cThe beginning of the pandemic felt like it was going on for such a long time because I had so much free time in the day, but as soon as I got TikTok, the days went by so quickly that they all kind of meshed together,\u201d she said.\n\nTikTok is the most engaging social media app by a large margin. The platform has an average engagement rate of 2.65% by follower count, meaning users spend more time and initiate more interactions on the app than any other, according to Social Insider  data . Even though this number has steadily fallen by about 35% each year, it still far outranks competitors, with runner-up Instagram following far behind at a 0.70% engagement rate.\n\nThe app\u2019s highly individualized algorithm is \u201cdesigned to continuously improve, correct, and learn from your own engagement with the platform to produce personalized recommendations,\u201d according to TikTok\u2019s  website . This ingenuity bombards users with an essentially infinite number of videos that, in theory, perfectly mirror their interests and beliefs.\n\nWhile there\u2019s little literature about the actual mechanisms of the app\u2019s algorithm, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s succeeding at keeping users engaged. In February, psychologist Christian Montag and neuroscientist Sebastian Markett published an  article  on the app\u2019s potential to be addictive, analyzing the link between mental health issues and what they call TikTok Use Disorder (TTUD). They argue that TikTok\u2019s staggering relevance and the lack of research on the platform warrant a unique category outside of general social media overuse.\n\nThe survey found that TikTok overuse was linked to neurotic and depressive tendencies. It also found that users may watch TikTok as a form of escapism from negative emotions, encouraging further addictive behavior. \u201cLet\u2019s say you are consuming a video, and although it is not funny, the next one probably will be and it is just a few seconds around the corner,\u201d Montag said. \u201cSo users are in an expectation mode that something interesting will happen when consuming the next video.\u201d\n\nPeter Anto Johnson is a biomedical engineering student at the University of Alberta studying addiction and \u201cdopamine fasting,\u201d a viral technique to restrict impulsive behaviors by cutting out engaging stimuli like TikTok. He said that while experts are still learning about the mental impact of social media, there\u2019s evidence that overuse can be detrimental.\n\n\u201cI think social media addiction is definitely something that\u2019s out there, and it\u2019s not recognized by the DSM or as a mental health disorder,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut I think with the growing trends, I do see it coming to be coming to a point where we might see that being classified as more of an addictive behavior.\u201d\n\nAddiction isn\u2019t the only mental health impact that\u2019s pushing TikTokers to quit. Some cite heightened negative senses of self-esteem and body image issues due to harmful content that slips through the cracks in the app\u2019s content moderation system. \u201cI started experiencing a lot of negativity with my first few videos,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cI started actually reading comments and taking things to heart. And that, as a creator, is one thing that you just really shouldn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nHateful social media comments are associated with a myriad of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety and body image issues, according to social anxiety expert  Arlin Cuncic . Specifically on image and video-based platforms like TikTok, users are bombarded with content that proliferates unrealistic beauty standards and encourages heightened self-scrutiny.\n\nEating disorder and body image content are such a contentious part of TikTok\u2019s algorithm that the app had a section dedicated to them on its community guidelines page. The  website  reads: \u201cWe want TikTok to be a place that encourages self-esteem, and does not promote negative social comparisons. We do not allow showing or promoting disordered eating or any dangerous weight loss behaviors.\u201d\n\nBut some harmful content inevitably passes by the algorithm\u2019s sporadic regulation, which has been criticized for its lack of moderation. Rachel Rodgers is a professor of applied psychology at Northeastern University who researches the intersection of social media, body image and eating disorders. She said she doesn\u2019t use any form of social media because of the potential detrimental impact it can have on mental health.\n\n\u201cIf a platform is mostly photo or video, it is orienting users towards taking pictures and videos of them,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cTherefore, that aligns with the discourse in our society that centers appearance as being an important element of people\u2019s social value, particularly important for people who typically hold lower levels of privilege and power.\u201d\n\nUsers like Natalie Williams, a 20-year-old pre-med student, say the rigid beauty standards TikTok promoted drove them off the platform. \u201cI was first inspired to quit TikTok because I was going through a period of my life where I was feeling really insecure, especially about my body,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI felt like every time I went on TikTok, I would just see random girls who are a size zero, size double zero, who looked perfect. And every time I saw that, it just made me feel horrible about myself.\u201d\n\nWhether their reasoning for quitting be worsening mental health or simply a lack of time for constant content consumption, former TikTok users are clear on one front \u2013 they don\u2019t care about China using their data. For the average person, China accessing their scrolling history isn\u2019t an immediate concern. The get-ready-with-me videos they make or the drama series they binge aren\u2019t particularly incriminating; Especially when they know that the countless other social media apps they use are storing their data anyway.\n\nEven international relations experts are skeptical about Congress\u2019 reasoning for their anti-TikTok tirade. Jonathan Aronson is a professor of communication, international relations and political science at the University of Southern California and an affiliate of the USC U.S.-China Institute. He criticized the bill as overkill and said banning TikTok is like \u201cusing a sledgehammer to drive in a nail.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do know the Chinese spy on Americans all the time. I also know American spy on the Chinese all the time. The Russians are even worse,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether or not there\u2019s anything special about TikTok doing it, from what I have seen, I doubt it.\u201d\n\nMeta, the American company that owns some of TikTok\u2019s biggest competitors like Instagram and Facebook, has been criticized for its data storage issues. In 2018, NBC compiled  a list  of all of Facebook\u2019s privacy issues since the platform\u2019s 2004 inception, including a March 2018 data breach that exposed the personal information of nearly 50 million users.\n\nWhile Chinese platforms may farm data, American apps don\u2019t promise much more security with users\u2019 private information. Perhaps some of Congress\u2019 anti-TikTok views aren\u2019t just about the sanctity of American data. Anti-Chinese sentiment grew significantly in the last four years, with 81% of Americans holding an unfavorable view of China in 2024 compared to 66% in 2020.\n\nThis may have been bolstered by former President Trump\u2019s public mockery of China; After calling COVID-19 the \u201cChinese Virus\u201d in 2020,  a study  published in the American Journal of Public Health noted an increase in hate crimes and anti-Asian hashtags.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to do this, if you can prove there\u2019s a problem, sure, go after them. But simply because they\u2019re owned by the Chinese?\u201d Aronson said. \u201cHow about if they were owned by the Swedes? Would you go after them then? Or if they were owned by the Israelis? Or the Gazans?... Where do you stop? How do you draw the line?\u201d\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Chew posted a  video  on TikTok on April 24 saying that the platform will challenge the law in court and does not plan on selling.\n```"}

Founded in January 2023, F1-Hire is the brainchild of CEO Chen Hang and co-founder Minna Wang. Their mission is clear: to empower international talents and aid them in navigating the complex path to secure their first jobs in the U.S. market.\n\nBut what exactly is F1-Hire? \u201cF1-Hire is a software that simplifies and enhances the job search and management process for international students,\u201d Chen said. Born out of the expertise of its parent company, Houren Education, which boasts 14 years of experience in international education, F1-Hire understands the unique challenges faced by its users.\n\n\u201cOur software is designed to alleviate the common pain points for international job seekers, such as sponsorship issues and lack of experience, which can be significant barriers,\u201d Chen elaborates. The software provides tailored job recommendations and critical information about employers\u2019 history with international hires.\n\nThe reason for starting this, according to Chen, is because the challenges international students face in the U.S. job market are substantial. \u201cFrom September to December 2019, F1-Hire analyzed approximately 730,000 job openings in the U.S., finding that only 1.6% of these were truly open to sponsoring international candidates,\u201d Chen said. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand that not all open positions are accessible to international students, and our job is to make this landscape more navigable,\u201d Wang adds.\n\nF1-Hire developed the International Talent Friendliness Index (ITFI), which daily updates the percentages of job openings friendly towards international talents. This index serves as a quantitative indicator of the U.S. job market\u2019s accessibility for international students, contrasting starkly with the general low unemployment figures that might suggest a thriving job market for all.\n\nF1-Hire\u2019s software integrates with major job search platforms like LinkedIn, Handshake, Indeed, Google Jobs, and Glassdoor, allowing users to cast a wider net in their job search. \u201cIt\u2019s not about sticking to one platform. Each has its competitive angle, and we equip our users to navigate through them all efficiently,\u201d Chen said.\n\nF1-Hire has already facilitated countless job applications, with a particular highlight being their collaboration with the University of Southern California (USC). Through this partnership, USC students can access F1-Hire\u2019s premium features at no cost, providing them a significant advantage in the job market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very proud of our USC collaboration, where our platform is actively used by the student community to great effect,\u201d Wang notes. In an effort to further support international students, F1-Hire, in collaboration with the University of Southern California (USC), is hosting a crash course on May 15th, from 1pm to 2pm. Titled \u201cCrash Course for International Students: Steps for Finding a Sponsoring Job in the U.S.,\u201d the session aims to guide attendees through the crucial steps necessary to secure a sponsoring job in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re diving deep into the strategies that enhance job search effectiveness, offering practical tips that can dramatically improve job search productivity,\u201d said Wang, the co-founder of F1-Hire. \u201cThis crash course is designed for both newcomers to the job market and those looking to refine their approach, ensuring all participants gain valuable insights to navigate the competitive landscape effectively.\u201d\n\nLiudy Zhou, a second-year master\u2019s student in the USC Annenberg Public Relations and Advertising program, shared her experiences and challenges as a non-STEM major using F1-Hire while looking for jobs. Zhou described the common hurdles she faces: \u201cI\u2019m currently facing some difficulties in job hunting. First, for many positions I apply to, especially in my field, there is hardly any response, and interviews are rare. I\u2019ve also encountered a few interview scams, which were mostly direct marketing or \u2018quote-unquote\u2019 sales companies that are commission-based and not very reputable.\u201d\n\nBut she found a new solution just recently. \u201cI started using F1-Hire this semester,\u201d she said. \u201cI learned about F1-Hire through the USC Career Center. An international advisor recommended it to me.\u201d Despite finding some of F1-Hire\u2019s features less accessible for non-tech students, Zhou has been trying to maximize her use of the platform.\n\n\u201cAs a non-tech student, some of the functions aren\u2019t very usable for me, and much of the database is focused on tech or data-related positions,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, I use the basic features like checking if companies are eligible to provide H-1B sponsorship and if they are E-verified.\u201d Zhou discusses how she is integrating it into her job search experience.\n\n\u201cI actually use F1-Hire in conjunction with another tool, Ultimate H1-B Sponsor Checker, which shows the sponsorship history over the past few years,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat helpful, but since I haven\u2019t found a job yet and haven\u2019t reached the negotiation stage, I can\u2019t fully assess how much it has helped. But it definitely serves as a crucial reference point.\u201d\n\nBut with how complex finding a job can be, Zhou suggested more personalized support from universities to improve the resources provided to international students. \u201cAs schools have a large base of international students, they could be more helpful if they focused more attentively on international issues, maybe adding a specific subtab on their websites with tailored advice,\u201d Zhou said.\n\nThrough her experience, Zhou illustrates the unique challenges non-STEM international students face in the U.S. job market and the potential for specialized tools like F1-Hire to evolve and better meet their needs.\n\nLooking ahead, F1-Hire aims to reach 100,000 users soon, with plans to launch \u2018F1-Hire Direct Hire,\u2019 a service designed to proactively connect employers with potential hires directly through the platform. \u201cOur future is focused on growth and improving our service to help students land not just any job, but the right job,\u201d says Chen.\n\nAs F1-Hire continues to innovate and expand, its impact on the international student community remains profound. With tailored solutions and a deep understanding of the market\u2019s nuances, F1-Hire not only helps international students overcome substantial hurdles but also ensures they are equipped to thrive in their careers in the U.S. As more students and employers engage with F1-Hire\u2019s platform, the future looks promising for this visionary enterprise, making it a key player in the intersection of technology, education, and career development.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Yang)\n\nBy Will Simonds, Suzanne Schofield, Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as, and Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier\n\nMay 03, 2024 at 3:26 pm PDT\n\nAfter an incredible 2023-24 season for USC women\u2019s basketball that culminated in the program\u2019s first Elite Eight appearance in three decades, head coach Lindsay Gottlieb will have to quickly retool. Gottlieb\u2019s squad has serious momentum heading into her fourth season at the helm of the Trojans, as well as a cornerstone player that has already developed into a superstar talent after just one year.\n\nBefore getting into the additions and losses for next season, let\u2019s take a look at which players are coming back for the fall, as well as what year they\u2019ll be in for 2024-25. Contributors Jude Oca\u00f1as, Crash Collier, Suzanne Schofield, and Will Simonds have broken down these roster changes:\n\nReturners (6)\nSophomore guard JuJu Watkins (No. 2 in Division I with 27.1 points per game in 2023-24)\nSenior center Rayah Marshall (averaged a double-double in back-to-back seasons)\nSenior center Clarice Akunwafo (nine career starts over three seasons)\nRedshirt junior guard Dominique Darius (2.5 points per game in 19 games last season)\nSophomore guard Malia Samuels (23 games, one start during freshman year)\nRedshirt sophomore guard Aaliyah Gayles (former No. 8 overall recruit)\n\nWhile Watkins is a clear star to build around for the future, Gottlieb also has to replace several key contributors from last season, namely a trio of Ivy League grad transfers that were consistent starters.\n\nGraduating (5)\nGuard McKenzie Forbes (USC\u2019s No. 2 scorer at 14.3 points per game)\nGuard Kayla Padilla (led USC with 42.8% 3-point shooting)\nForward Kaitlyn Davis (6.0 points, 5.8 rebounds per game with 24 starts)\nGuard Roxane Makolo (10 steals in 23 appearances)\nGuard India Otto (28 games over five seasons at USC)\n\nEntered transfer portal (2)\nGuard Kayla Williams (4.0 points per game, 31 starts over two seasons at USC) \u2192 transferred to Cal\nGuard Taylor Bigby (4.6 points per game, 18 starts over two seasons at USC) \u2192 transferred to TCU\n\nThough its seven losses will certainly hurt the Trojans\u2019 depth for the upcoming season, Gottlieb is already well-positioned to bounce back. USC boasts the top-ranked recruiting class in the nation for 2024, which includes three McDonald\u2019s All-Americans and six players in the top 100 of ESPN\u2019s recruiting rankings.\n\nUpdate: On April 27 and 29, USC also added a pair of familiar veterans through the portal that raise the Trojans\u2019 ceiling even higher.\n\nTransfer portal commitments (2)\nKiki Iriafen, 6-foot-3 forward\nPrevious School: Stanford\nClass for 2024-25: Senior\nCommitted: April 27\n\nSimonds: On top of an already stacked high school recruiting class, the Trojans also grabbed the top player in the portal \u2014 forward Kiki Iriafen \u2014 according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. During her junior year at Stanford in 2023-24, Iriafen took a massive jump, leading the Cardinal in scoring at 19.4 points per game on 54.6% shooting, in addition to 11 rebounds per game. Her accolades include 2024 Pac-12 Most Improved Player and AP All-America Honorable Mention.\n\nIriafen is a Los Angeles native, attending high school at nearby Harvard-Westlake. Along with fellow forward Cameron Brink, Iriafen helped lead Stanford to a Pac-12 regular season title this past season, as well as a Sweet 16 appearance. However, USC defeated Iriafen\u2019s Cardinal in both matchups this season, including in the Pac-12 Tournament championship game. But, hey, if you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em, right? Iriafen entered the portal after legendary Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer announced her retirement earlier this month.\n\nNotably, Iriafen took her official visit Friday along with Oregon State guard transfer Talia von Oelhoffen, who has USC listed among her four finalists.\n\nAlready a top contender for 2025, Iriafen \u2014 paired with an elite defender in Marshall \u2014 makes the Trojans\u2019 frontcourt a nightmare matchup as well. The will-be senior\u2019s experience will also be impactful for a USC squad that was set to rely on a lot of freshmen in the upcoming season. And that\u2019s not even to mention the JuJu-Kiki combination \u2014 perhaps the best-named duo in the country.\n\nTalia von Oelhoffen, 5-foot-11 guard\nPrevious School: Oregon State\nClass for 2024-25: Graduate\nCommitted: April 29\n\nCollier: The addition of Talia von Oelhoffen firmly gives the Trojans the best group of newcomers in the country \u2014 if they didn\u2019t already own that distinction. After four seasons with Oregon State, the two-time All-Pac-12 guard transferred to USC for her final season of eligibility on Monday, she told ESPN\u2019s Alexa Philippou. Her announcement comes just three days after Gottlieb\u2019s contract extension at USC through the end of the 2029-30 season, and two days after Iriafen\u2019s announcement \u2014 the duo did their official visits and committed together before leaving campus.\n\nVon Oelhoffen\u2019s other transfer finalist destinations following the collapse of the Pac-12 were Louisville, Colorado, and Kentucky. In her final season with the Beavers, von Oelhoffen averaged 10.7 points, 5.0 assists, 4.1 rebounds, and 1.0 steals per game. Her contributions helped lead the Beavers to a fourth-place finish in the Pac-12 regular season after being selected 10th in the preseason poll and the program\u2019s third Elite Eight in its history.\n\nAs USC gears up for its first season in the Big Ten, von Oelhoffen will look to be a leader alongside Iriafen and Watkins. Her versatility as a guard \u2014 she can play both on and off the ball \u2014 will greatly benefit the Trojans, especially depending on which freshman recruits shine early on next season. In addition, her status as a college basketball veteran will be an asset to USC, as von Oelhoffen said that she also hopes to help mentor the incoming freshman class as they adjust to playing at the collegiate level.\n\nVon Oelhoffen\u2019s commitment brings the Trojans to 15 players, meaning the USC roster is likely set for the upcoming season. Still, a starting five that will likely consist of Watkins, Iriafen, von Oelhoffen, Marshall, and one of the freshman recruits listed below will already be as dangerous as any in the nation, with plenty of talent available on the bench.\n\nHigh school recruits (7)\nKennedy Smith, 6-foot-1 guard\nHigh School: Etiwanda HS (CA)\nESPN Ranking: Five star (No. 6 overall)\n\nOca\u00f1as: If USC\u2019s backcourt couldn\u2019t get any more dangerous, the Trojans are adding a five-star McDonald\u2019s All-American in Kennedy Smith to pair with Watkins. Playing for Etiwanda all four years, Smith showcased her versatility as a wing through her scoring and playmaking ability. To wrap up her senior season, she finished as a back-to-back CIF Open Division state champion, averaging 20.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 1.9 steals, and 1.8 blocks per game.\n\nGottlieb will love what Smith brings to the table for the Trojans next season. Her dynamic play at the guard position allows her to play anywhere on the court. Alongside Watkins, Smith is a perfect replacement for Forbes. Smith doesn\u2019t need to have the ball in her hands to make an impact, as she can be a reliable option as a catch-and-shoot threat. Around the rim, she can finish efficiently with her polished footwork and touch. Smith will likely see many minutes in her freshman season.\n\nKayleigh Heckel, 5-foot-9 guard\nHigh School: Long Island Lutheran HS (NY)\nESPN Ranking: Five star (No. 13 overall)\n\nOca\u00f1as: Another All-American, Kayleigh Heckel, will bring lighting-quick speed to the USC backcourt next season. The New York native led her high school to a 21-2 record, earning the No. 4 spot in MaxPreps\u2019 final Top 25 high school women\u2019s basketball rankings. As the team facilitator, she averaged 16.6 points, 8.3 assists, and 3.1 steals a game. Her senior season play earned her Third-Team Naismith All-America honors.\n\nIn her senior season, Heckel demonstrated that she can score at all three levels of the floor. Her quick first step and speed allow her to blow by defenders in the open court and attack the basket. Heckel possesses great creativity around the rim, finishing with various moves. She is a proven 3-point shooter and will make defenses pay if they don\u2019t respect her ability beyond the arc. But her impact goes beyond just scoring, as Heckel has great vision of the court, fitting her passes in tight windows. She is a highly confident ball-handler under pressure and should help take some of those duties off Watkins next season.\n\nAvery Howell, 6-foot guard\nHigh School: Boise HS (ID)\nESPN Ranking: Five star (No. 16 overall)\n\nCollier: A two-time recipient of Idaho\u2019s Gatorade Player of the Year, Avery Howell averaged 21.2 points, 10.6 rebounds, 2.3 assists, and 3.0 steals per game in her senior season at Boise High School. The top-20 recruit and McDonald\u2019s All-American helped lead her team all the way to the Idaho 5A semifinals, posting a 24-2 record in her final year of high school.\n\nAs the highest-rated recruit to ever come out of Idaho, Howell now looks to bring her talents to a USC team that is already reloading around Watkins. With her impressive high school resume and ability to play well at both ends of the court, Howell could vie for one of the three vacancies in the Trojans\u2019 starting lineup left by Forbes, Padilla, and Davis from last season\u2019s Elite Eight squad.\n\nVivian Iwuchukwu, 6-foot-3 forward\nHigh School: Montverde Academy (FL)\nESPN Ranking: Four star (No. 47 overall)\n\nCollier: Vivian Iwuchukwu helped lead Montverde Academy to a 26-1 record during her senior year, when she put up an average of 11.4 points and 7.1 rebounds per game. Iwuchukwu adds more depth to the USC frontcourt as the Trojans prepare for their first season in the Big Ten. The 6-foot-3 forward\u2019s presence in the paint could cause trouble for opposing defenses, as Iwuchukwu is very aggressive with the ball in her hands.\n\nIwuchukwu is a player who will be relentless on offense and wear down opponents late in the game. Joining Marshall and Akunwafo in the post, Iwuchukwu\u2019s size and strength will help the Trojans win conference games that are going to be very physical and competitive this upcoming winter.\n\nRian Forestier, 5-foot-11 guard\nHigh School: Brandeis HS (TX)\nESPN Ranking: Four star (No. 54 overall)\n\nSchofield: Forestier\u2019s unconventional training regimen \u2014 including sessions in the boxing ring with former World Boxing Champ James Leija \u2014 speaks volumes about her approach to the game. Her dedication extends beyond personal improvement; she\u2019s also the brains behind \u201c4ward,\u201d a charity initiative that provides gym shoes to underprivileged young athletes.\n\nForestier\u2019s on-court performance is also impressive. With a remarkable 62-point game under her belt, her scoring prowess is undeniable at 25.8 points per game in her senior season. But it\u2019s her all-around game that sets her apart. Forestier also averaged 13.9 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 4.1 steals, and 2.5 blocks this past year, so be ready for her to make an impact in several ways at USC.\n\nLaura Williams, 6-foot-1 forward\nHigh School: Paul VI HS (VA)\nESPN Ranking: Four star (No. 92 overall)\n\nSchofield: Standing tall at 6-foot-1, Laura Williams is a formidable force on the basketball court. Hailing from Virginia, Williams boasts an impressive track record, contributing significantly to her team\u2019s 16-year state title streak. During her summer stints with the Fairfax Stars AAU and Nike EYBL circuit, she averaged 11.8 points and 5.9 rebounds per game.\n\nIn a USC press release, Gottlieb praised Williams\u2019 tenacity and adaptability, making her a perfect fit for the Trojans\u2019 fast-paced style. She\u2019ll be another important addition to USC\u2019s frontcourt depth in the future to pair with an endless number of talented guards.\n\nBrooklyn Shamblin, 5-foot-9 guard\nHigh School: Oaks Christian HS (CA)\nESPN Ranking: Three star (not ranked)\n\nSchofield: Brooklyn Shamblin, a dynamic 5-foot-9 guard, is set to make a resounding impact at USC. Gottlieb described Shamblin in her signing announcement as a playmaking combo guard with a knack for scoring and facilitating. Initially a recruit in the 2025 class, Shamblin reclassified to move up a year and will enroll with the Trojans in 2024.\n\nThough not quite as highly rated as other USC recruits, Shamblin still has plenty of accomplishments despite dealing with injuries during high school. She was the 2022 CIF Southern Section Player of the Year as just a freshman, and earned a spot at the USA Basketball U16 trials and a McDonald\u2019s All-American nomination in 2024.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/05/02/the-silver-shield-vol-22-looking-at-the-losers/", "response": "```\nThe Silver Shield, Vol. 22: Looking at the losers\n\nThe first round hasn\u2019t concluded quite yet, but some teams will start the offseason a bit earlier than the true contenders.\n\nCarolina Hurricanes' Jalen Chatfield (5) battles with New York Islanders' Anders Lee (27) for the puck during the first period in Game 5 of an NHL hockey Stanley Cup first-round playoff series in Raleigh, N.C., Tuesday, April 30, 2024. (AP Photo/Karl B DeBlaker)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner May 02, 2024 at 2:32 pm PDT\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d is a column by Kasey Kazliner about the National Hockey League. The first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs has seen a mix between lopsided series wins and nail-biting matchups thus far. While three series are still yet to conclude, nearly half the bracket has already started making offseason plans as the second round approaches. Nashville, Vegas and Toronto all stand on the brink of elimination but are still alive. However, Winnipeg, Los Angeles, Washington, Tampa Bay and the New York Islanders all saw their campaigns get cut short by superior opponents. So, what went wrong for the defeated, and what lies ahead for them?\n\nWinnipeg Jets (4-1 loss to Colorado Avalanche)\nThe Jets were simply unprepared for the Avalanche, a team that is always a dangerous threat in the postseason. It didn\u2019t matter that Winnipeg\u2019s 110-point season \u2014 its second-best in franchise history \u2014 put the team in position to make a deep run in the playoffs. It also didn\u2019t matter that the Jets had swept Colorado in the regular season; the Avalanche are simply built differently when the weather starts to warm up. The Jets, lacking true deep-playoff ability, fell flat-footed. Colorado\u2019s depth shined in the series win. Winnipeg\u2019s defense and superstar netminder Connor Hellebuyck couldn\u2019t handle the likes of skaters Cale Makar, Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen on the top lines; other impact players like Artturi Lehkonen also stood out for the Avs. Lacking consistent offensive production in Games 2-5, the Jets were susceptible to surrendering pucks in their own zone, which proved costly. The Avalanche appeared one step ahead of them, punishing Winnipeg\u2019s distraught defense with their star-studded cast.\n\nLooking ahead for the Jets, while the team has its cornerstone players locked down on contracts, certain pieces like defenseman Brenden Dillon will need to negotiate new deals. With a top goalie and plenty of prime talent \u2014 there\u2019s no reason why Winnipeg shouldn\u2019t still be in win-now mode \u2014 but in a stacked Central Division after falling short once again, it should be an interesting offseason for the men of Manitoba.\n\nLos Angeles Kings (4-1 loss to Edmonton Oilers)\nIt\u2019s now been 10 years since the Kings won a playoff series, which was their magical Stanley Cup season in 2014. L.A. fell to the Oilers for the third consecutive year in the first round, as Edmonton proved once again that its electric offense headlined by forwards Connor McDavid and Zach Hyman was too overwhelming for the Kings\u2019 weak special teams. Poor discipline plagued Los Angeles in the series. The Oilers ended up finishing 9-for-20 with the extra man across the five games, while the Kings had trouble scoring on the power play themselves, going 0-for-12 when it was all said and done. L.A.\u2019s offense was inconsistent as the series went on, only tallying a combined four goals in the final three games. The Kings also allowed 12 points from McDavid and seven goals from Hyman across the five-game set.\n\nThe Kings\u2019 biggest question mark for the offseason is goaltending; the team doesn\u2019t have a single netminder signed for next season. Los Angeles will also want to take a deep look at how it can improve its offensive production as its Cup-winning core ages. For one, the Pierre-Luc Dubois trade \u2014 a move that was supposed to spearhead an uptick in goal-scoring for the team \u2014 is retrospectively looking like a disaster. The Kings promoted assistant coach Jim Hiller to lead the squad following the firing of Todd McLellan, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see if L.A. keeps Hiller as head coach or if it looks in another direction. But if one thing is for certain, the Kings will need to find a way to either avoid playing Edmonton in the playoffs or gain the tools to defeat the Canadian foe to avoid continued suffering in the postseason.\n\nWashington Capitals (4-0 loss to New York Rangers)\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll go as far as saying that the Capitals were undeserving of a playoff spot, but it certainly wasn\u2019t surprising to see them get demolished by the Presidents\u2019 Trophy winners. Winger Alex Ovechkin\u2019s Stanley Cup-winning pedigree simply didn\u2019t matter, as the Rangers showed why they are worthy of snapping their 30-year Cup drought. New York simply dominated the series on both ends. Washington\u2019s defeat leaves it in a tough position, as the team doesn\u2019t appear weak enough for an overhaul but not in a position to win a title anytime soon. After all, the Caps still have some hefty contracts and a 39-year-old future Hall of Famer in Ovechkin, who is still hoping to shatter Wayne Gretzky\u2019s goal record. The Capitals have some framework for future success, but fans shouldn\u2019t be too excited just yet. The team will look to continue to bolster its prospect pipeline and will have to deal with limited cap room as the offseason approaches, so decisions will have to be made about the direction of the franchise as its best player continues to slow down and age.\n\nTampa Bay Lightning (4-1 loss to Florida Panthers)\nThe stepchild of the Sunshine State finally got revenge on the Lightning, who are not the perennial Cup contenders they once were. Team captain Steven Stamkos might\u2019ve skated in his last game in a Tampa Bay uniform, which if the case, inches the Lightning toward a new era following two Stanley Cups in the last five seasons. The Panthers exposed Tampa Bay\u2019s defense in the series. The Lightning struggled to protect goalie Andrei Vasilevsky and couldn\u2019t display offensive prowess like it had done in the regular season. Tampa Bay\u2019s power play unit was quiet in the series, despite leading the league in extra-man production prior to the playoffs. The main issue for the Lightning is that they don\u2019t have a strong future in hand. It makes sense because they were a win-now team for so long, but now it\u2019s coming back to bite them. Also, trading valuable draft capital for winger Tanner Jeannot is now looking like a costly move; the team\u2019s depth is nowhere near what it once was. What Tampa Bay has going for it, though, is its top-heaviness; Nikita Kucherov, Brayden Point and Victor Hedman are still elite players, and a first-round series loss shouldn\u2019t discourage fans from believing that the Lightning could be great again. Letting Stamkos walk could open up the door to signing new free agents \u2014 but losing him could also leave gaps to be filled \u2014 so the front office will have to look at the big picture this coming offseason.\n\nNew York Islanders (4-1 loss to Carolina Hurricanes)\nThe Islanders are another team that consistently qualifies for the playoffs but can never truly perform when it matters most. This season, New York particularly struggled to hold leads and showed this weakness against the Hurricanes in Game 2, when Carolina scored five unanswered goals to take an important 2-0 series lead. Netminder Ilya Sorokin didn\u2019t man the crease after Game 3, which was concerning, considering that his eight-year deal will kick off starting next season. Overall, for the Isles, a largely up-and-down year capped off with a playoff appearance should induce mixed emotions. While the team surged following a coaching change and accomplished something half the league couldn\u2019t, the road ahead appears rocky. Longtime Islanders Matt Martin and Cal Clutterbuck are facing expired contracts and keeping the core together might be difficult for New York\u2019s front office. Addressing the lackluster penalty kill should be another priority for the Islanders, as the team finished toward the bottom in limiting power plays yet again. Like Tampa Bay, the Isles don\u2019t have a flashy prospect pool to work with, which is never a good sign for the future. Tightening up consistency issues that were abundantly present in 2023-24 will be a tall order for New York, a team that found an identity with Patrick Roy at the helm, but couldn\u2019t climb over the hump of the Hurricanes.\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

Throughout NBA history, the team who wins Game 5 when the series is tied at 2-2 goes on to win the round nearly 83% of the time. Not only did the Los Angeles Clippers lose Game 5 at home, they lost in blowout fashion, giving the Dallas Mavericks nearly all of the momentum they\u2019ll need to end the Clippers\u2019 season in Game 6.\n\nIt was a back-and-forth scoring battle to begin the night, with Los Angeles finding themselves trailing 25-24 at the end of the first quarter. With Kawhi Leonard still sidelined with a knee injury, the Clippers needed big performances from their other two star players in Paul George and James Harden. But George and Harden combined for just six points at the end of the first quarter, and on the other side, Luka Don\u010di\u0107 alone had eight points, four rebounds and three assists for the Mavs.\n\nThe Clippers offense didn\u2019t improve in the second quarter, as Los Angeles found themselves down by double digits near the end of the period. With 1:17 remaining in the half, Kyrie Irving tossed up a lob pass from halfcourt and Mavs center Daniel Gafford finished the play at the rim to give the Mavericks a 54-44 lead. Los Angeles\u2019 deficit remained at 10 entering halftime.\n\nThe third quarter was not much better for the Clippers. With 7:21 remaining in the quarter, Don\u010di\u0107 found himself isolated against Ivica Zubac and took advantage of the mismatch by hitting Zubac with a crossover and stepback jumper. The two-pointer gave Dallas a 14-point lead and the play was a sign of things to come for Don\u010di\u0107 in the second half.\n\nThe Clippers had no answers for Don\u010di\u0107 as he scored 20 of his 35 points in the final two quarters. Even though the Mavericks owned the third quarter, there was a stretch where it looked like the Clippers could potentially make the game competitive again. With 57 seconds remaining, George hit his first three-pointer of the night to trim Dallas\u2019 lead to 19. With 31 seconds left in the quarter, George hit another three pointer, this time a stepback over P.J. Washington. But just when it looked like the Clippers were riding some momentum, Mason Plumlee fouled Josh Green on a three-point make and Green finished the four-point play at the foul line.\n\nAfter three quarters, the Clippers were down 89-69 and George was Los Angeles\u2019 leading scorer with just 15 through three quarters. The Mavericks took the momentum from Green\u2019s four-point play into the fourth quarter and cruised to a 123-93 victory.\n\nFollowing a masterful display of offense in Game 4, no Clipper was able to find a groove offensively in Game 5. George and Harden shot a combined 6-25 from the field for 22 points and no starter for the Clippers had a positive plus-minus. Russell Westbrook continued to struggle off the bench, going just 2-11 from the field and scoring just six points. Since the Clippers\u2019 blowout victory in Game 1, Westbrook is shooting just 17% from the field and is averaging below five points per game.\n\nEven though Westbrook struggled again mightily, the Clippers as a team could not create and make easy opportunities in Game 5. Los Angeles shot 38% from the field and 26% from the three-point line. Defensively, the Clippers allowed the Mavericks to shoot 54% from the field and 36% from three-point range.\n\nDon\u010di\u0107's 35 points are certainly the headline, but he did not do it alone, as the Mavericks received big contributions from Maxi Kleber and Dereck Lively II off the bench. Kleber hit five three-pointers and Lively II was a perfect 5-5 from the field and scored 12 points in total.\n\nWith the Clippers moving to the Intuit Dome next year, it is possible that Los Angeles just played its last game in Crypto.com Arena. If the Clippers want to end their tenure in Downtown LA on a high note, their stars will have to show up in Dallas and force the series to go to a seventh game. Although it seems like the Mavericks possess all the momentum, the Clippers have been in this position before. When these two teams matched up in the 2021 postseason, the Clippers won in seven games after trailing 3-2 and winning Game 6 in Dallas.\n\nThe Clippers will need history to repeat itself Friday night at the American Airlines Center at 6:30 p.m., as Los Angeles will play to keep their season and title hopes, however tenuous they may be, alive.\n```"}

(AP/William Liang)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner May 02, 2024 at 1:19 pm PDT\n\nEDMONTON, Alberta \u2014 For the third consecutive year, the Kings fell to the Oilers in the first round. Following the Game 5 loss, LA still hasn\u2019t won a playoff series since hoisting the Stanley Cup back in 2014. The Kings knew they had their backs against the wall and gave it all they had down the stretch, but as shown for most of the series, they just couldn\u2019t contain Edmonton\u2019s elusive, electric offense in a 4-3 loss.\n\n\u201cI thought the guys did what they could do,\u201d said interim head coach Jim Hiller. \u201cIt just comes down to special teams.\u201d\n\nGame 5 was a rollercoaster for both sides. For Los Angeles, the night began with starting defenseman Mikey Anderson sustaining an injury following a collision with center Connor McDavid. While Anderson would return later in the period, Edmonton had already set the tone, as winger Evander Kane beat flat-footed netminder David Rittich midway through the first period for the first goal of the contest.\n\nHowever, the Kings were able to head into the intermission with some life, as winger Alex Laferriere scored his first career postseason goal with under a minute to go\u2014LA\u2019s first in two games. The play was unusual; a seemingly benign dump-in from blueliner Vladislav Gavrikov was played on by goalie Stuart Skinner, who left the crease. But the puck took a strange hop, leaving Skinner dead in his tracks and Laferriere capitalized on the miscue to put Los Angeles on the board.\n\nIn the second period, the Kings seemed to finally find an offensive rhythm, sparked by a beautiful backhand pass from winger Viktor Arvidsson to center Blake Lizotte that concluded with a wrist-shot goal to give the away side a 2-1 lead.\n\nBut the resilient Oilers weren\u2019t going to let the underdog visiting Kings enter their building and walk all over them. Following Lizotte\u2019s lamp-lighting, Edmonton proceeded to score three unanswered goals to close out the second period, two of which were courtesy of superstar center Leon Draisaitl. Winger Zach Hyman also scored his seventh goal of the series, which gave the Oilers a 4-2 advantage heading into the final frame.\n\nUnlike in Game 4, discipline was an issue for the Kings. While Los Angeles only surrendered one power-play goal\u2014Draisaitl\u2019s equalizer\u2014the stat sheet was a bit deceiving. Although Edmonton only went one-for-five with the extra man, it scored mere seconds after the conclusion of its power plays on two occasions, suggesting the Kings\u2019 possible failure to adjust back to 5-on-5 pacing.\n\nIn the third period, the Oilers\u2019 defense locked down LA before Hiller decided to pull Rittich in the dying minutes. On the 6-on-5 chance, winger Adrian Kempe netted his fourth goal of the series to bring the game within one, making for an exciting one-score game with just about two minutes to go.\n\nBut as the clock ticked toward zero, the Kings couldn\u2019t find the equalizer and Edmonton secured a close victory. Over its five games, the series painted the dichotomy between strong even-strength defense for both sides and uneven special teams efforts. Los Angeles finished zero-for-12 on the power play in the series, while the Oilers went nine-for-20\u2014almost a 50% success rate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super frustrating,\u201d said defenseman Drew Doughty. \u201cProbably just needed some more guys to step up, play better, all of us, every single game.\u201d\n\nSkinner finished with 18 saves on 21 attempts, meanwhile Rittich went 22-for-26. The Edmonton netminder started in all five games for his team, while Rittich played in the final two games, both losses. McDavid and center Ryan Nugent-Hopkins each tallied two helpers and blueliner Evan Bouchard posted three. McDavid brought his playoff point total to 12, which leads all players.\n\n\u201cDefinitely a disappointing feeling, obviously for the third year in a row,\u201d said center An\u017ee Kopitar.\n\nThe Oilers will wait for the winner of the Canucks versus Predators series to be decided, as Vancouver currently leads 3-2. Edmonton would have home ice against Nashville but would start on the road against the Canucks. Following a second-round loss to the Golden Knights last year, Edmonton hopes to finally make a Cup push with a star-studded cast.\n```"}

The questions were answered in three sections: the cancellation of Asna Tabassum\u2019s valedictorian speech, the calling of LAPD on the pro-Palestinian encampment and what is next for the university community.\n\nThe meeting kicked off with a discussion of the agenda and opening the floor for remarks from Folt and Guzman before the moderators represented some faculty questions. In their opening remarks, Folt and Guzman addressed the issues of disruption to commencement and their willingness to work toward a \u201cpeaceful\u201d solution.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing it from people who are very directly involved in the horror that\u2019s taking place in Gaza, in Israel and in other places around the world,\u201d Folt said. She reiterated that she cares deeply about the students and faculty before Guzman took over to address the same issues, stating how \u201cheartbreaking\u201d it has been to see the way events have unfolded.\n\nOver 50 members of USC\u2019s faculty gathered to watch the webinar moderated by Professors Dan Pecchenino, Margo Apostolos and Rima Jubran, who partially comprise the Academic Senate Executive Board.\n\nThe following is a summary of the questions posed at Folt and Guzman and their responses.\n\nQ: What can you share with us about the concerns that the move to cancel commencement was a way to please donors and avoid scrutiny from government officials?\nA: Guzman said the claims are \u201cuntrue,\u201d and that \u201cthere has not been pressure from donors.\u201d \u201cThere has not been pressure from donors.\u201d \u2014 Andrew Guzman, USC Provost\n\nGuzman also re-confirmed that the decision to cancel Tabassum\u2019s speech was based on threats, and not to please donors, explaining that the USC security team received \u201ca very substantial, \u2018unprecedented,\u2019 was the words of security used, influx of emails and phone calls and social media postings. That created a security concern.\u201d\n\nGuzman continued by explaining that \u201cIt was a threat to the valedictorian, her family and to everyone coming to commencement.\u201d\n\nQ: Will you reconsider holding the larger commencement ceremony and reinstating the valedictory address in some format? And if not, would you issue an apology to the valedictorian, the graduating class and the campus community?\nA: Folt and Guzman both reaffirmed the university\u2019s decision to cancel the main stage commencement ceremony, citing safety concerns at USC as well as across the nation. He went on to say that, \u201cin some ways, the answer is outside in front of Doheny right now.\u201d\n\nGuzman then confirmed that the administration\u2019s focus is on the school-specific commencement ceremonies and other events, \u201cthe heart of the commencement every year.\u201d\n\nFolt stated that she does \u201cfeel terrible\u201d about the cancellations. \u201cI think I could issue an apology that [the commencement ceremony] has become a target even though I didn\u2019t create it,\u201d she said of the increased scrutiny.\n\nQ: You must know that many people are very upset with the decision to bring in the LAPD to control the protest last week. Who was involved in making that decision and what USC policies exist governing when police with weapons are called onto the campus?\nA: Folt stated that in situations in which violent arrests seem possible, the LAPD has the authority to come to campus. She stated that she \u201cagreed\u201d to their presence on campus on April 24, but did not state that she or anyone else specifically called them.\n\n\u201cI would have gone out there myself,\u201d Folt said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t, I regret that.\u201d\n\nFolt and Guzman emphasized \u201cde-escalation\u201d in the future. \u201cI would have gone out there myself,\u201d Folt said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t, I regret that.\u201d \u2014 Carol Folt, USC President\n\nQ: How many of the 90 plus individuals arrested were USC affiliated students? Have charges or other sanctions been dropped against the USC students, faculty and staff who were arrested?\nA: Guzman confirmed 93 total arrests, stating that 51 were USC students and 36 were not affiliated with USC, and the information they have about the latter group is limited.\n\n\u201cI do not know the status of the criminal charges at the city and state level,\u201d Guzman said. \u201cWe have not moved forward with disciplinary proceedings against these students at the present time.\u201d\n\nGuzman did not say whether the other 6 detainees unaccounted for were faculty or staff. \u201cWe have not moved forward with disciplinary proceedings against these students at the present time.\u201d \u2014 Andrew Guzman, USC Provost\n\nFolt also stated protesters were given three opportunities to disperse before arrests were made. \u201cYou always want to give people an opportunity to walk away, and a significant number did and they had decided in some ways amongst themselves, some would choose to be arrested and in some ways that was a very orderly decision,\u201d she said.\n\nFolt then explained that \u201cwhat we\u2019re trying to do now is really deescalate [...] We\u2019ll try to deal with some of the things that are separating us right now once we get it de-escalated.\u201d\n\nFolt also mentioned that she\u2019s received \u201cmuch more mail right now, from families, students and some faculty saying that they continue to be very disturbed that the encampment is allowed to exist.\u201d\n\nQ: Will you commit to allowing peaceful demonstrations and expressions of free speech on campus and pledge that DPS and/or LAPD will not interrupt them unless clear and proven signs of violence have occurred?\nA: Folt began by stating that \u201cI am very hopeful that we\u2019re going to find a peaceful resolution.\u201d\n\nThen, Folt discussed the \u201cquite lovely\u201d free speech zone on campus located near Leavey Library that is a possible new location for the encampment which is \u201cfive minutes from\u201d the current location, in a \u201cgrassy\u201d area, and has sanitation facilities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to talk to the students that are in the encampment right now if that could be a place they would be willing to go because it could allow us to do things a lot more peacefully and open up the rest of the campus in a different way,\u201d Folt said.\n\nQ: Based on one of your statements yesterday, it does not sound like discussions with protesting students are leading towards a clear resolution yet. What is your plan if the students currently occupying Alumni Park refuse to leave and going forward, how do you plan to handle potential protests, counter protests and other disruptions, especially at our commencement ceremonies?\nA: Folt said, \u201cWe are acting in good faith to find a peaceful solution. We\u2019re reaching out and will continue.\u201d\n\nFolt then stressed her desire to move the encampment away from the center of campus, given its proximity to four different commencement ceremonies, saying \u201cThat would, of course, be the best resolution.\u201d\n\nHowever, there has not been \u201cany traction\u201d on that idea yet. Folt and Guzman also discussed the security measures that will be implemented at commencement ceremonies.\n\nQ: We\u2019ve heard some common frustrations from faculty with very different perspectives on the protests, and the larger geopolitical issues prompting them. One theme, a loss of trust is captured in this question from one faculty. How will both of you work to restore faith in your abilities to do your jobs effectively?\nA: Folt emphasized the importance of earning the trust of faculty and that to earn trust is \u201cyou continue to try to do the things that are going well, you continue to try to talk to people, you continue to try to listen, you try to listen without emotion so if it\u2019s critical, you can hear it.\u201d\n\nGuzman echoed the importance of listening, saying that the only way he knows about building trust \u201cis to listen. To meet with people as broadly as possible. To try my level best to approach everything I\u2019m doing both in a forward-looking way and in a backwards-looking way with as much humility as I can, recognizing my own fallibility, recognizing the fact that just because I\u2019ve done something doesn\u2019t make it right.\u201d\n\nFolt also mentioned that she \u201crespected\u201d the Advisory on Muslim Life Committee for stepping down and that \u201cevery day I want to try to restore the faith that people come back and work with us on it.\u201d\n\nQ: We\u2019ve heard concerns from faculty and students and you\u2019ve touched on them a bit here about both increased anti-semitism and Islamophobia on campus. We\u2019d like to know who you\u2019re meeting with to address these concerns beyond maybe the established groups that exist and what needs to change going forward, whether in terms of policy or culture.\nFolt said she was meeting with people from different groups such as Hillel and Chabad, and hearing from students on anti-semitism and Islamophobia, which she said have no space on campus. She said the conversations with different groups have been instrumental in coming up with major changes.\n\nStressing the importance of faculty participation in these conversations, she said, \u201cI also do encourage you to work through the cultural spaces.\u201d \n```"}

(AP/Kyusung Gong)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner May 01, 2024 at 11:13 pm PDT\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 The end of the regular season saw the Ducks prepare for a long offseason ahead, but in the final handful of games, prospect winger Sam Colangelo had the opportunity to make his first NHL marks after a high-scoring NCAA season with Western Michigan University. The senior tallied 24 goals and 19 assists in 38 games played with the Broncos during the 2023-24 NCAA season, which earned the attention of the Anaheim organization that had picked him back in 2020 with the No. 36 overall pick in the NHL Entry Draft.\n\nColangelo had originally signed on a professional tryout with the Ducks\u2019 American Hockey League affiliate San Diego Gulls following the end of his collegiate season, where he immediately made an impact. On top of posting two points in his first AHL game, he continued his point-per-game trajectory over the next few, scoring a goal and adding three helpers in four total appearances.\n\nGiven that San Diego was well out of the playoff race and Colangelo was on a hot streak, the Ducks had little reason to keep him in the AHL. The 22-year-old earned a two-year entry-level deal with the Ducks just 10 days after beginning his professional tryout. From there, he suited up in the Ducks\u2019 final three regular season games and even lit the lamp in his NHL debut against Calgary.\n\nColangelo\u2019s path to the NHL saw him play for a handful of programs and adapt well to multiple changes of situation. His junior career began with the United States Hockey League\u2019s Chicago Steel, where he put scouts on notice in his second campaign. During the 2019-20 USHL season, the Stoneham, Massachusetts native registered 58 points on 28 goals and 30 assists in 44 games to catch the eye of then-Ducks general manager Bob Murray early in the second round of the 2020 draft.\n\nColangelo then took the NCAA route in further developing his game. He spent three seasons with Northeastern University, truly breaking out during his sophomore and junior years. He recorded at least 20 points in both seasons following a shortened freshman campaign. Wanting a change of scenery, Colangelo set his sights on Western Michigan, which ended up being a wise choice for his final collegiate season.\n\nAt the international level, he also represented Team USA in the 2021 World Junior Championship, scoring one goal in seven games alongside future NHL teammates Trevor Zegras and Jackson LaCombe en route to the country\u2019s fifth gold medal.\n\nStanding 6-foot-2 and 210 pounds, the right-handed forward is constantly goal-hungry. While not an elite skater by any means, Colangelo\u2019s NHL-caliber build and accurate eye give him an edge on weaker defenders. He\u2019s also quick with his hands and is efficient with and without the puck. Colangelo\u2019s strongest asset, however, is his awareness. He can do it all in the offensive zone, from helping his teammates by dishing accurate passes or getting to the slot himself to develop dangerous chances. His frame also allows him to play the puck on the boards or in the open ice and he\u2019s always a threat when handling it. His game doesn\u2019t require him to do too much or make excessive plays; and he\u2019s not afraid to leave it all on the ice to help his team succeed.\n\nOnce his skating ability adapts to the professional level, Colangelo will have the capacity to be a full attacking force. His goal-scoring prowess already makes him notable, but crispier mobility could elevate his game to unseen heights. Colangelo is one of the many stout forward prospects in the Ducks\u2019 deep and polished prospect pipeline. Now on an entry-level deal, he\u2019ll fight for a roster spot among the other youngsters once the season turns around again into what the Ducks hope will be a more competitive 2024-25 campaign.\n```"}

Under his artist name, IDG, Gallegos is a singer, songwriter, producer, and composer. His music derives from his upbringing and experiences. Born and raised in East Los Angeles, California, he tells of his experience in his single, \u201cLA ZONA,\u201d representing a point where he is ready to go for it and flourish.\n\nThroughout his childhood, Ivan navigated the realities of both his parents\u2019 involvement in gang activities, leading to their intermittent incarceration. Despite growing up in an environment saturated with drugs, gangs, and prostitution, he focused on music and sharpened his skills to become a multifaceted instrument and vocalist. IDG embarked on a musical journey at nine years old, showcasing his talents. He mastered multiple instruments, including the guitar, vihuela, bass, piano/keys and tenor saxophone.\n\nHe later secured a role at USC\u2019s student-run record label \u201c840 West Creative\u201d as an A&R intern. Gallegos also joined the Mariachi Los Troyanos at USC, where he continues to contribute to the Mariachi community. He began performing in venues like USC\u2019s Songfest, a student-run philanthropic organization and even performed for the Black Eyed Peas.\n\nAs he began his musical journey, he made a name for himself in the community. A prime example is the non-profit Project Dream (If I Don\u2019t, Who Will) that he founded, which provides guidance and resources to marginalized communities impacted by gang violence, substance abuse and poverty. The non-profit is more significant than the provisions; it is about showing love to the community, instilling the youth a sense of purpose, fostering talents, equipping them with the tools and guidance, to empower the next generation to become future leaders.\n\nFrom this non-profit his devotion to his community strengthened, prompting him to venture outside the state. After a trip to Cuba, Gallegos started \u201cHerencia Los Angeles,\u201d with the goal to foster a vibrant and inclusive community.\n\nBesides giving back to his community, Gallegos is now experimenting with genres like EDM and corridos/reggaeton fusion. He hopes to expand his producing approach into other genres and create an impact on the famous music scene. Moreover, he envisions blending Latin Drill, infusing reggaeton drums, corrido melodies and Caribbean percussion into Drill music with trap lyrics. Emphasizing the unique role of 808 basses in Drill, IDG combines this characteristic with Latin music elements, creating a distinctive sound.\n\nAdditionally, Ivan aims to blend Brazilian funk with reggaeton, incorporating a mix of Spanish and Portuguese languages into his musical gallery.

(Photo by Michael Gribbon)\n\nBy Angelina Hicks May 01, 2024 at 7:06 pm PDT\n\nNikki Haley offered the 150 gathered at the Hollywood American Legion veteran\u2019s center in L.A. one quick mention of her goals of \u201cdefeating a dozen of the fellas\u201d she was running against. It was the Republican\u2019s lone reference to her gender, leaving the topic out of her stump speech. She didn\u2019t need to \u2014 the music that followed the speech did it for her.\n\nAs Haley handed off her microphone and got ready to start shaking hands with voters during her visit on Feb. 7, the first song to follow her speech was \u201cAmerican Girl\u201d by Tom Petty. When that song from 1976 \u2014 about a small-town girl who\u2019s dreaming about finding something greater in life \u2014 came to an end, it was followed by the 2012 country anthem \u201cWoman in the White House\u201d by Sheryl Crow.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s time we put a woman in the White House / With a whole new attitude,\u201d the song\u2019s opening lyrics rang out. \u201cWe could use a little female common sense / Down on Pennsylvania Avenue / After 230-something years of waiting / It\u2019s way past overdue.\u201d\n\nCrow rerecorded the song in 2020 to reiterate her original message of getting a woman in the White House. \u201cThere\u2019s always been amazing women out there that are fully capable of leading our country, and in a more mature fashion than we\u2019ve seen in the last few years,\u201d Crow said in a 2020 interview with NME Magazine. \u201cKamala Harris, Susan Rice and Stacey Abrams would all do a wonderful job. I\u2019m just hoping that, at this moment, when a woman comes in, that we see her become president eventually.\u201d\n\nWilliam E. Pascarella Jr. \u2014 a 63-year-old resident of San Gabriel \u2014 waited in a line that snaked around the entire room after Haley\u2019s speech for a chance to talk with her and shake her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was anything [she said] that I didn\u2019t agree with,\u201d Pascarella said after meeting Haley. \u201cWe need to change, and maybe it might take a woman.\u201d\n\nLess than a month later, she became the first woman in history to win a Republican presidential primary by earning 62.8% percent of the vote in Washington, DC on March 3. A few days later, on Super Tuesday, she won a second state \u2014 Vermont with 50.2% percent of the vote.\n\nBefore her state primary wins, she went on record with a confident claim about this year\u2019s election: \u201cThere will be a female president of the United States,\u201d she said repeatedly while campaigning across the country to emphasize the advanced ages of Trump and Biden. \u201cIt will be either me or Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nBut on March 6, the road to the nation\u2019s first female president hit another roadblock. Haley suspended her campaign the morning after Super Tuesday.\n\nA t-shirt featuring a picture of Nikki Haley sits on the floor during her campaign event in L.A. on Feb. 7. (Photo by Michael Gribbon)\n\nNearly eight years after Hillary Clinton famously lost the Electoral College to Donald Trump in 2016, reaching that milestone feels even farther away for many women. That includes Kelly Dittmar, director of research and scholar at Rutgers University\u2019s Center for American Women and Politics. She said seeing failed attempts at a female president is even more difficult after how close Clinton came in 2016. The former secretary of state and senator won the popular vote by three million votes.\n\n\u201cWe had a woman who effectively won, were it not for the Electoral College,\u201d Dittmar said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a strong opinion about the Electoral College \u2014 you\u2019ve got to win by the rules as they are, and she didn\u2019t. But in terms of generating votes, she did. The reaction to that could have been, \u2018Hey, a woman can beat Trump.\u2019 But instead, it was, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready.\u2019\u201d\n\nDittmar and her colleagues at the Center for American Women and Politics recently put out a report exploring women\u2019s political representation and political power across five states \u2014 Georgia, Illinois, Nevada, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. The report, titled \u201cRethinking Women\u2019s Political Power,\u201d includes nearly 200 interviews with different officeholders in these states.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to better interrogate women\u2019s political power, and to do so we knew we needed to go beyond numbers and really take a qualitative look within the state political ecosystems,\u201d Dittmar said.\n\nIn the 117th Congress, there were 24 women in the Senate and 122 women in the House, with 106 Democrats and 40 Republicans represented. That\u2019s an all-time high. For municipal officeholders in 2024, including mayoral positions and city councils, women held 32% of the roles.\n\nDittmar said sheer representation doesn\u2019t always equate to political power. \u201cIn Nevada, you see the examples of where women are, yes, a majority of the state legislature, but then you have women state legislators telling us the patriarchal dynamics in this place are real, the racism within this institution is real,\u201d Dittmar said. \u201cFolks in Nevada are saying, \u2018And by the way, the legislature is not the most powerful political body in the state. It\u2019s actually the Clark County Commissioners and there\u2019s only one woman on it.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn California specifically, about 40% of municipal offices are held by women \u2014 slightly higher than the national average. There\u2019s a big change coming regarding female representation in California, which has a long record of female senators. Rep. Adam Schiff and former Dodger Steve Garvey received the most votes in the Super Tuesday Senate primary and clinched the top two spots, meaning that for the first time in over 30 years, California won\u2019t be represented by a woman in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cWe have a record number of women just leaving Congress,\u201d Dittmar said. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with that in California. All of those things are worrisome because stasis is a lack of progress.\u201d\n\nClose the Gap California has worked since 2013 to get more women elected to office across the Golden State. The group\u2019s goal is to completely close the gender gap in the California Legislature by 2028. With just a few years left to go to reach the state\u2019s first \u201cmotherlode\u201d \u2014 a term the organization has re-purposed to represent the potential 50/50 gender split in the Legislature \u2014 the gap is getting smaller. In less than a decade since the organization\u2019s founding, the state Legislature has jumped from 22% women to 42%. There are currently 50 women in the 120-person legislature \u2014 just 10 away from the goal to completely split the gender representation.\n\n\u201cJust because our magic number of 60 women is possible \u2014 and we are closer than ever \u2014 does not mean it is inevitable,\u201d Close the Gap\u2019s Executive Director Susannah Delano wrote in the organization\u2019s 2023 end-of-the-year report. \u201cWe refused to settle for yet one more decade of incremental progress (at best),\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe have shown that California can do better.\u201d\n\nFor others, especially right-leaning voters, gender identity isn\u2019t as important when it comes to what they want from their elected leaders. For Jennifer Bryant, a registered nurse from Marshalltown, Iowa who participated in the caucus process earlier this year, what\u2019s more important is the candidates\u2019 values.\n\nBack in January, Bryant was split in her support for Haley and Trump. Now, the choice has been made for her. \u201cI just know how hard Trump works, so he\u2019ll stand up for the truth,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cHe won\u2019t compromise, and it\u2019s really important. We need that right now.\u201d\n\nVoters in some states \u2014 like Florida, Maryland and New York \u2014 will see abortion on the ballot this year. In Arizona, organizers have said they\u2019ve surpassed 500,000 signatures, more than enough to get a citizen-led initiative on the ballot. The effort is meant to put a constitutional amendment on the state\u2019s ballot in November that would protect the right and access to abortion.\n\nAlthough reproductive rights don\u2019t just apply to women, it\u2019s largely a female-focused issue. When it comes to the election, Dittmar said it can mobilize voters and increase turnout. \u201cUnlike in 2016 where the abortion issue mobilized Republicans because of a Supreme Court appointment, this year it\u2019s about the regressive loss, taking away abortion rights,\u201d Dittmar said. \u201cDemocrats are using that as a launching pad to make the case for protections and fighting them. And of course, then in the states where abortion-related amendments have been on the ballot, we\u2019ve seen Democrats do better.\u201d\n\nSince Haley suspended her presidential campaign, she\u2019s announced that she\u2019s joining the Hudson Institute, a Washington DC-based conservative think tank that specializes in foreign policy affairs. She\u2019s joining as the institute\u2019s Walter P. Stern chairperson, a position named for Hudson\u2019s former chairperson who died in 2022.\n\n\u201cWhen our policymakers fail to call out our enemies or acknowledge the importance of our alliances, the world is less safe,\u201d Haley wrote in an email blast announcing her new job. \u201cThat is why Hudson Institute\u2019s work is so critical. They believe the American people should have the facts and policymakers should have the solutions to support a secure, free, and prosperous future.\u201d\n\nWith Haley \u2014 and any hope for a female president in 2024 \u2014 out of the race, that leaves Haley\u2019s donors and voters wondering who to back. Trump has been vocal about his distaste for Haley\u2019s support. The Biden-Harris campaign was quick to launch ads targeting Haley voters. One ad used imagery and audio clips of Trump bashing Haley to convince her supporters to consider Biden.\n\n\u201cIf you voted for Nikki Haley, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want your vote,\u201d one ad says. \u201cSave America. Join us.\u201d```"}

Among the crowd, a father stood separated from his daughter, a student at USC. He wore a keffiyeh and showed unwavering support for his daughter and the anti-war movement.\n\n\u201cPalestinian parents crying, kids crying, women crying and all those buildings destroyed,\u201d Lazaro Aguero, 51, said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that we are seeing all this destruction and death without saying anything, so I just started going to protests.\u201d\n\nAguero, a Los Angeles resident working in construction, moved to the U.S. from Peru 35 years ago. Activism is nothing new to him. He said he has consistently advocated for social justice, including fighting against the war in Iraq. Aguero said he has known about Israel\u2019s apartheid since he was a child in Peru.\n\n\u201cThere are parallels to Palestinians being oppressed, such as with us immigrants, so as a Latino, we have to be there to fight against this genocide,\u201d Aguero said. \u201cIsrael, one of the most powerful countries with advanced technology, is attacking a small society. We can\u2019t ignore that.\u201d\n\nFor Aguero, it\u2019s also about being there for his daughter and supporting the other students in their fight. He said he wants more parents to help their kids, especially in their activism.\n\n\u201cI learned what I could so that I can better understand what my daughter is fighting for, so I say \u2018support\u2019 to all the parents who can go or cannot go protest,\u201d Aguero said. \u201cParents who want the best for their children, need to know our young people fighting from Wednesday to now are on the right side of injustice and those parents who are fearful, should trust them as a parent.\u201d\n\nAguero\u2019s daughter, a 20-year-old sophomore and international relations major at USC, preferred to stay anonymous, pointing to The Canary Mission, a website dedicated to doxxing people accused of anti-Semitism, including pro-Palestinian protestors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really grateful to have the support of my parents because I know many of these students don\u2019t feel the support from their parents,\u201d Aguero\u2019s daughter said. \u201cAlthough what we\u2019re doing may not seem like much or may not seem fruitful to some people, hearing those of Palestinian descent, I think that even the little bit we\u2019re doing is worthwhile.\u201d\n\nAguero\u2019s daughter remembers that she called her dad in a shaky voice during the encampment to let him know what was happening at USC. Though Aguero was worried, he told his daughter, \u201cI want to go support, you all need more numbers and you all need more parents out there.\u201d\n\nAguero even brought his father, a former teacher in Peru, who stressed the importance of being educated by unbiased information. As the demonstrators continue throughout this week, tensions are high and students remain steadfast in their advocacy.\n\nAguero\u2019s daughter empowers herself as a Chicana by thinking about her ancestors. \u201cThe government has shown it will not support indigenous people and their fundamental rights, and that has instilled in me to not always believe in our system and to always question what I think is wrong,\u201d Agueros daughter said. \u201cMy ancestors fought to keep their rights, their language and their land against colonizers, I am fighting in the best way I can for Palestinians to keep theirs.\u201d\n\nAgueros\u2019 daughter was disappointed in USC\u2019s decision to call LAPD on the protestors, which made her rethink her views on the university. She said she feels naive to think the university wanted a diverse body of students with different views. However, although the university doesn\u2019t support them, \u201cthe diverse student body they created has shown support.\u201d\n\nAguero and his daughter want people to understand the strength of generational advocacy and the struggle to accomplish it within the Latino community.\n\n\u201cI want to encourage the Latino community and Chicano community and the indigenous community here in the U.S., in the Americas to fight for the indigenous populations in Palestine,\u201d Aguero\u2019s daughter said. \u201cBecause all indigenous struggles are our struggles.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Mohammed Zain Shafi Khan)\n\nBy Mohammed Zain Shafi Khan and Lyla Bhalla-Ladd May 01, 2024 at 4:31 pm PDT\n\nThe USC campus will require metal detectors for access for commencement, President Carol Folt and Provost Andrew Guzman announced in the Academic Senate meeting Wednesday. \u201cGetting those metal detectors up fast is really important to me,\u201d Folt said while addressing faculty gathered for the webinar-style session. Also needed to enter commencement, according to Folt, will be a USC student ID. She added it\u2019s the first time the school has ever required tickets for commencement.\n\nEarlier Wednesday fences were erected all over campus to control traffic flow ahead of the May 8-11 events. The goal of these security measures is to \u201cprevent any explosive events like last night,\u201d Folt said, in reference to the violent events that occurred Tuesday at the University of California, Los Angeles, when pro-Israel protestors allegedly threw fireworks, pepper spray and tear gas inside the pro-Palestinian encampment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a fortress,\u201d Folt said in response to why commencement security measures this year are additional and unexpected. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t just move it to the Coliseum. It wasn\u2019t available.\u201d The 2024 main stage commencement was canceled following controversy surrounding the decision to not allow the valedictorian to speak. The university cited security concerns as a reason to both cancel the commencement and rescind the valedictorian\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ticketing the commencement, we\u2019re limiting access to USC people, plus guests, obviously, in an effort to make those activities work or run more smoothly,\u201d Guzman said. This year\u2019s commencement is limited to 8 ticketed guests per graduate and is projected to draw more than 65,000 guests. Guzman added that he is meeting with deans of all schools multiple times each week to discuss \u201cplanning strategies to respond if there are disruptions,\u201d and praised the commencement planning team which have been \u201cpivoting at lightning speed.\u201d\n\nAnother hurdle of hosting commencement, every year and especially in introducing new security measures, is compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). \u201cClose to 20% of the people that come, that\u2019s well over 10,000, are ADA. They\u2019re elderly people,\u201d Folt told the Senate. In the case of an emergency, ADA compliance and general crowd control is a major concern for the security team. \u201cIt is a nightmare to control a large crowd if even one thing goes wrong.\u201d\n\nWhile the Divest from Death encampments continue, the USC community remains unclear on whether protests will last through the commencement ceremonies. Guzman noted that \u201cyou don\u2019t have the right to protest to the point where it\u2019s impossible to continue with the [commencement] ceremony. We hope people will respect the desire on the part of graduates and families who may have traveled a great distance, to see those events and to have a day of celebration for their students.\u201d He continued that the priority is to get students through finals and to graduation. \u201cThe thing where I think we all agree is we want to get our students through the final exam period in a way that allows them to be successful,\u201d Guzman said. \u201cAnd then have the kind of commencement that celebrates our graduates in the right way.\u201d\n\nThe multiple ceremonies will be held May 8-11 at various locations according to school or student group. Folt expressed her disappointment in the structure of commencement this year, and her desire to have the 48 separate ceremonies run smoothly. \u201cI\u2019m pretty optimistic about our commencement events,\u201d she said.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of USC VGSA)\n\nBy Zack Lara and Kim Ly May 01, 2024 at 2:34 pm PDT\n\nRising above the clash of machinery and heavy weights in the Village Fitness Center, the voice of trainer Scott Teves echoed through the Center Room, demanding a final effort from an ensemble of breathless attendees. They pushed through a final speed round of weights, sitting down the whole time in a row of seats and wheelchairs.\n\nViterbi Graduate Student Association (VGSA) hosted USC\u2019s first-ever seated workout class on April 23rd in collaboration with USC Recreational Sports (Rec Sports). The class welcomed wheelchair users, people with lower body injuries and anyone wanting to work out from a seated position.\n\nNatalie Fung, a graduate student studying communication data science, organized the hour-long event. She leads the Accessibility Initiative at VGSA, which aims to strengthen relationships among students with disabilities by hosting accessibility events around campus.\n\nThe class was taught by Scott Teves, a senior fitness programs advisor at Rec Sports. \u201c[Fung] wanted to do a class where [wheelchair users] could come together and do something that was accessible,\u201d Teves said. \u201cSo we met and got to collaborate, and we decided that this was the day.\u201d\n\nTeves divided the class into a series of arm exercises, using body weight and weights to work up strength and endurance. \u201cFor a lot of wheelchair users or people with disabilities, the gym can be a little intimidating,\u201d Fung said. \u201c...They usually work out in their dorm or apartment, so I think it was nice to get people out and show them that they can come to the gym.\u201d\n\nFor Fung and many other wheelchair attendees, the event was their first time entering the USC gym. While the Village Fitness Center offers wheelchair accessibility options like folding seats and the ability to roll wheelchairs into machines, Fung says most people are not aware of these features.\n\nRachel Miller, a sophomore studying biochemistry, considered using the USC fitness center before but felt like there were easier, less-intimidating options. \u201cI\u2019m not used to exercising beyond physical therapy. It was amazing to have someone do the extra research and make a class that\u2019s adaptive to stuff that I\u2019m able to do,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMyles Molnar, a senior studying applied math and data science, was equally impressed with the event. He appreciated the opportunity to exercise outside of his apartment where he mainly does upper body routines with resistance bands. \u201cI came into this with apprehension about things that I could or could not do, but the instructor seemed very well educated in making it accessible and I could do as much as I wanted or could do. It was a very successful class,\u201d Molnar said.\n\nFung said she typically uses YouTube videos for at-home workout routines, but with a limited selection, it\u2019s nice to have a change of pace and scenery with a real gym instructor. The classes aren\u2019t only restricted to wheelchair users or students with disabilities. People with injuries big and small are welcome, as well as beginners who want to start off with something less scary.\n\n\u201cWe made [these classes] for people with disabilities and people in wheelchairs, but it\u2019s open to anyone,\u201d Fung said.\n\nHowever, accessibility is still a work in progress at USC. Molar notes that the Village Fitness Center doesn\u2019t have any buttons that allow for easy access inside. Some doors on campus also lack a button and are rather heavy making it difficult to open. \u201cI\u2019ve had to kind of alter my schedule around like those doors, for sure,\u201d Molar said.\n\nDespite the challenges, Miller appreciates what USC has done so far in terms of accessibility but also believes their work isn\u2019t finished yet. \u201cIt\u2019s tough because accessibility is different for so many different people, but I think USC has been doing a great job and listening to our concerns,\u201d Miller said. \u201cObviously it\u2019s hard to implement things without adequate funding, but I think we should have stronger advocacy or a board that allows students to improve accessibility.\u201d\n\nGroups like the Accessibility Initiative at VSGA are helping advocate for students with disabilities alongside promoting events catered toward them. Events like a seated workout class is one step in the right direction toward making USC a more inclusive and accessible campus.\n\n\u201cIt was really cool. We had a lot of people with different skill levels, so people were pushing themselves,\u201d Teves said. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to see that, especially if it\u2019s their first time in the gym. Everyone can get together and have a good time, laugh, and smile.\u201d\n\nTeves said clubs and organizations can contact Rec Sports to organize classes and book instructors. The Graduate Student Association recently hosted a pilates event and instructors led pilates in quads to celebrate Black History Month.\n\n\u201cWe offer about 70 to 80 classes a week,\u201d Teves said. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a class for someone ... We have a variety of classes so that students have a way of expressing their way through fitness.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of Paul and DelBianco)\n\nBy Maria Vittoria Borghi May 01, 2024 at 1:15 pm PDT\n\nUSC students Julia Paul and Lena DelBianco just set up the last plate at their picnic table. They are used to preparing assortments of their favorite vegan and gluten-free snacks and gut-healthy drinks, but this act has never meant as much as today. It\u2019s April 7th, and the pair is about to host an intimate gathering to celebrate the latest milestone of their health journeys\u2014the launch of their business Wholistic Renewal.\n\nBoth Paul and DelBianco are set to graduate this May. Paul, 21, is a senior at USC Marshall, studying business administration with an emphasis in entrepreneurship. DelBianco, 22, is a senior at USC Annenberg studying public relations with a minor in consumer behavior. But this is not what they\u2019re celebrating. If you had met them a few months earlier, you\u2019d have assumed that Julia Paul and Lena DelBianco would be toasting to their new jobs in corporate finance and PR respectively; but instead of accepting their return offers, they decided to take a chance on founding a business in the holistic wellness space.\n\nBacked by entrepreneurial parents and a growing client waitlist, the pair has decided to ditch the corporate world and help people access \u201cnatural ways to optimize ... hormone and gut health through functional lab testing and lifestyle choices that address root causes.\u201d\n\nOne Company, Two Tough Medical Journeys\n\nBut Wholistic Renewal wasn\u2019t born out of chance. Paul was only ten years old when she started experiencing symptoms that New York\u2019s best doctors couldn\u2019t diagnose or treat. She fought debilitating fatigue, gut issues, and hormonal imbalances well into her teenage years, which led to many school absences and a poor quality of life.\n\nMaria, Paul\u2019s mother, soon realized that her ability to find another way of healing would determine her daughter\u2019s future. In 2015, the year before Paul entered high school, her mother\u2019s research led them to Europe, where they ordered a functional lab test for diet-induced sensitivities, known as a Mediator Release Test. The results showed an extremely high sensitivity to dairy and gluten which remains undetected with conventional tests, and changed Paul\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cThe first summer that I was healing I was in bed all day long with no energy to do anything else and I started watching a lot of YouTube and got obsessed with fitness influencers,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI made it my goal ... to feel strong after feeling weak in my body for so long, build muscle and to get stronger physically and mentally.\u201d\n\nWholistic Renewal now offers this same sensitivities test to its clients.\n\nDelBianco would face similar hardships in her early college years despite living a healthy lifestyle. Her regular workouts and mindful eating couldn\u2019t prevent severe hair loss, brain fog, and joint pain, which are atypical at the age of 19. The doctors were as clueless as she was\u2014until she started looking into breast implant inflammation. Unbeknownst to her, the breast implants she got at the age of 18 were triggering a reaction that compromised her whole immune system. After taking them out, she regained control of her life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still on my healing journey ... but feeling so much better, I feel like myself again,\u201d DelBianco said. \u201cAnd I can honestly say I\u2019m so grateful that I went through all of that because now I feel like I\u2019ve almost gotten a taste of all the issues you can have [and] I can put myself in our clients shoes.\u201d\n\nA Promise of Wholistic Renewal\n\nPaul and DelBianco founded Wholistic Renewal to provide others with the guidance they wish they had on their healing journeys. This includes providing their clients with a thorough analysis of their symptoms in the context of their health choices and medical history. The founders, who are certified Functional Diagnostic Nutrition (FDN) Practitioners, can order the necessary functional lab tests and interpret them, then devise a customized protocol to guide their clients through a 90-day program of supplements and lifestyle changes to improve their health.\n\n\u201cOne of our clients was having a full body histamine reaction, which is essentially due to a compromised immune system in her gut, and dealing with horrible hives, swelling, food intolerances, inflammation, and histamine reaction,\u201d DelBianco said. \u201cDoctors had her on six allergy medications a day and a steroid shot, and she was like, \u2018There\u2019s no end in sight, like, what is going on?\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to DelBianco, the client saw a drastic difference in her skin and cut back most of her medication within a month of working with Wholistic Renewal.\n\nClient's histamine reaction on her arms before and after working with Wholistic Renewal. (Photo courtesy of Paul and DelBianco)\n\nReaching as Many People as Possible\n\nPaul and DelBianco wanted to make accessing holistic health services easier. That may explain why Paul and DelBianco opted for a fully virtual company and bundled their services in eight different packages, with prices ranging from $350 to $3500, tending to different needs and income groups. Each package is based on the expertise they gained when they studied to become functional diagnostic nutrition practitioners, and will be improved upon as soon as they gain further insights and access to new research.\n\n\u201cThe end goal is using all the hardship and all the health struggles that we\u2019ve been through and turning them into something good,\u201d DelBianco said.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan May 01, 2024 at 12:25 pm PDT\n\nIt\u2019s all about tennis. Until it\u2019s not. Auteur director Luca Guadagnino\u2019s latest film follows the lives of three tennis players engaged in a tenuous love triangle for over a decade. Zendaya, one of the film\u2019s producers in addition to being the star, plays Tashi Duncan, a former junior tennis star in the same vein as a Williams sister or Coco Gauff, Duncan suffers a career-ending injury that stops her from becoming a Major-winner but cannot quell her competitive nature. Mike Faist assumes the role of Art Donaldson, Tashi\u2019s husband and a bona fide star of U.S. men\u2019s tennis. When the film opens, Donaldson finds himself in a poor run of form after an injury heading towards the U.S. Open. In order to regain his confidence before the signature tournament, Tashi registers him for a Challenger event, a low-level tournament where Art discovers that his former best friend and doubles partner \u2014 as well as Tashi\u2019s ex-boyfriend \u2014 Patrick Zweig (Josh O\u2019Connor) is also competing.\n\nThe film uses non-linear storytelling to its advantage throughout, as it begins in medias res with Art and Patrick\u2019s match, then works to fill in the trio\u2019s history at a thoughtful and sumptuous pace. But a story that covers around 15 years of the characters\u2019 lives brings an obvious obstacle with it: Zendaya, Faist and O\u2019Connor have to look 18 in the earliest flashbacks and early 30s in the contemporary timeline. The stars\u2019 performances, as well as the hair, makeup and costume design teams, make this aspect not just believable but tasteful and effective.\n\nIn the 2006 sequences, O\u2019Connor imbues Patrick with all the cockiness of a rising tennis phenom, for whom stardom awaits. And when the audience sees him a decade and a half later, now a middling tennis pro living out of his car as he goes from tournament to tournament, Patrick has a grimier look with a half-groomed beard and mismatched tennis clothes that pale in comparison to Art\u2019s pristine Uniqlo whites. Meanwhile, Art \u2014 supposedly the less talented player in their youth \u2014 has transformed from the shier teenage boy into a steely and battle-hardened (and also a bit tired) veteran.\n\nThat contrast from a sporting perspective sets up an already tense dynamic between the pair that the film only builds on with their romantic history. Any conversation between Tashi and Art, or Art and Patrick, or Patrick and Tashi, could equally be about tennis, or the trio\u2019s interpersonal dynamics, or both. Every one-on-one conversation feels cut like a tennis match, whether it takes place on the court or off, playing into the (admittedly obvious) metaphor that a tennis match and a relationship aren\u2019t all that different.\n\nThe visceral tension between the trio also wouldn\u2019t be possible without the contributions of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross\u2019s score. The duo, who\u2019ve won a pair of Academy Awards for their work scoring \u201cThe Social Network\u201d and the animated film \u201cSoul,\u201d take their work to new heights in \u201cChallengers.\u201d With a series of synth-soaked and clubby EDM tracks, this score stands out relative to their previous work not necessarily in its quality, where the pair never disappoints, but in its riskiness. It was a bold choice for Guadagnino, Reznor and Ross to score the film in this manner, but it pays off gloriously, giving the on-screen action the pace and intensity of a great rally.\n\nThe score often stays loud and propulsive even over the non-tennis, more dialogue-heavy scenes, making for a limited number of quiet moments. While that choice can almost make some lines of dialogue hard to hear, it ultimately works in the film\u2019s favor, allowing writer Justin Kuritzskes\u2019s script to shine through when the score takes a backseat.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Kuritzskes \u2014 for whom \u201cChallengers\u201d is his first movie credit \u2014 is married to the writer-director of the 2023 breakout hit \u201cPast Lives,\u201d Celine Song, which also happens to be a film about a love triangle. Kuritzskes has another collaboration with Guadagnino lined up titled \u201cQueer,\u201d which will star Daniel Craig as the American Beat Generation author William S. Burroughs and will also adapt the Don Winslow crime novel \u201cCity on Fire\u201d into a film starring Austin Butler. With \u201cChallengers\u201d off to a $15 million debut at the domestic box office, Kuritzskes appears to have established himself as one of Hollywood\u2019s hottest writers.\n\nIt\u2019s exciting for film fans that Guadagnino and Kuritzskes have another project in the works because the Italian director truly extracts the most from what\u2019s on the page in \u201cChallengers.\u201d In collaboration with Thai cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, Guadagnino designs some breathtaking and hilariously creative shots in this film \u2014 particularly for its tennis match scenes \u2014 that put other sports movies to shame, including one tracking shot that glides up from below the tennis court and another from the perspective of a tennis ball.\n\nReferring to \u201cChallengers\u201d loosely as a sports movie might sound reductive, but the film manages to put its thumb on exactly what makes sports compelling: narrative. Whether it be a game between rivals or friends (or lovers), \u201cChallengers\u201d captures a compelling dynamic for sports- and non-sports-watching film fans alike on the backs of its exceptional performances and style.\n```"}

(Photo by Aditya Thiyag)\n\nBy Mohammed Zain Shafi Khan, Kelsey Goldbach and Anusha April 30, 2024 at 7:47 pm PDT\n\nA second round of negotiations between the USC Divest From Death Coalition and President Carol Folt concluded at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Tuesday, once again ending with demands from both sides unmet. While Folt reaffirmed the university\u2019s dedication to freedom of speech on campus, the encampment organizers were unable to receive a satisfactory update about their goals, the largest of which being divestment and transparency on USC\u2019s endowments.\n\nIn the first round held on Monday, the coalition and the administration put forward their asks, reaching no middle ground. The coalition said the overall discussion was \u201cfrustrating.\u201d A day later, Folt\u2019s team was ready to meet a second time, with demands like moving the encampments to avoid disruption at commencement among others.\n\n\u201cWe listened. We had a lot of conversations back and forth and I feel like that\u2019s very meaningful. And I hope we continue to have meaningful conversations. I think it\u2019s interesting and important,\u201d Folt said to Annenberg Media after the hour and a half long meeting. \u201cI also feel very grateful to everyone for keeping the campus so that people can continue to go about [safely].\u201d\n\nFolt did not address whether there would be another meeting at the time of the interview. Annenberg Media spoke to Gould School of Law Professor Jody Armour who attended both meetings. Armour stated that he acted in a supportive role for the USC Divest From Death Coalition organizers as an observer.\n\n\u201c[The students] are doing all the heavy lifting, they acquitted themselves extremely well,\u201d Armour said. \u201cThey really repped powerfully for the camp and the people who are participating in this particular anti-complicity, anti-war effort.\u201d\n\nAlthough he said he does not believe much progress has been made as a result of the most recent meeting, Armour highlighted that it is a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cI think it will depend on what the follow up is,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to have to see if there is \u2013 after the students look at the divestment possibilities and the information about where investments are going, etc. \u2013 something that can help [the organizers] find some sense of having them believe that there\u2019s real disclosure going on.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, Folt posted a statement to her social media accounts reiterating the \u201crespect\u201d she holds for the organizers\u2019 \u201cpassion\u201d to their cause. She went on to say she recognizes the \u201cpain and suffering\u201d taking place in USC\u2019s community as well as in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, they seemed more interested in having me issue a political statement in support of their viewpoint as opposed to coming up with practical solutions to resolve the situation,\u201d her statement read.\n\nAnother statement was issued via email Tuesday evening, where Folt addressed the dissatisfaction with the outcomes of the meetings and outlined new changes to the commencement ceremony. An important addition to the day will be a \u201cdesignated Free Speech Area\u201d for peaceful protestors and student journalists. The area was created as a solution to avoid obstruction, harassment, threats, or discrimination.\n\nReiterating \u201cunshakeable commitment to free speech\u201d, the email stated that USC will continue the \u201cimportant outreach to all members of our community \u2013 including our Jewish and Israeli communities, our Palestinian and Muslim communities, as well as others.\u201d\n\nArmour stated that a point of contention during the meeting was the subject of moving the encampment. While, according to Armour, the university wants to move the students from their current location at Alumni Park during commencement preparations and ceremonies, the encampment organizers believe it is antithetic to their goal.\n\n\u201cOne of the students\u2019 responses, of course, was that \u2018business as usual\u2019 is what you\u2019re resisting and fighting against. We\u2019re trying to resist complicity in evil and injustice,\u201d Armour said.\n\nBoth Folt and Armour stated that it was relatively productive that both the administration and protesters are engaged in a dialogue.\n\n\u201cIt was important for both sides to hear very clearly what their fundamental concerns are. And those were expressed very clearly,\u201d Armour said.\n\nThe USC Divest From Death Coalition has yet to issue a statement. There are no plans for another meeting and it is unclear whether any action will be taken by the university to move the encampment.\n```"}

The goal was the 24-year-old\u2019s first of the postseason, and forwards Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid assisted the eventual game-winning goal. McDavid\u2019s helper brought him to double-digit points in the postseason thus far. It marked the fifth time in his career that he posted at least 10 points in a playoff series.\n\nSelf-inflicted wounds and complacency continued to plague the Kings in Game 4. The goaltending improved, as Rittich left it all on the ice just for his team to let him down, and LA even stayed more disciplined than in previous games, only allowing one extra-man chance, but at the end of the day, it didn\u2019t matter. The Kings also created multiple dangerous opportunities on which they didn\u2019t capitalize, causing continuous desperation as the clock ticked until the horn.\n\n\u201c[Rittich] was awesome, and he\u2019s been that way for us all year,\u201d said winger Trevor Moore. \u201cHe gave us a really good chance tonight.\u201d\n\nLA went zero-for-one on the power play, and is still yet to score on special teams this postseason, now at a zero-for-11 total in the series. As Rittich\u2019s stout performance was simply wasted, Los Angeles now finds itself down 3-1 and heading back to Edmonton with its back against the wall. Through last season\u2019s playoff results, 32 teams all-time have recovered from a 3-1 deficit and have won their respective series. On the flip side, the 301 other teams down 3-1 have ended up losing, so the Kings\u2019 outlook isn\u2019t too optimistic.\n\nLA had shut out the Oilers way back on Feb. 10, but since then, up until Sunday, any similar defensive showing had come at a premium. Edmonton\u2019s offense didn\u2019t look like its normal self in Game 4, but still eked out a win against the lifeless Kings offense. Tallying just 13 shots, the Oilers\u2019 tied a franchise record for their fewest in a postseason match.\n\nEdmonton will play for a chance to move on to the second round in Game 5; a win will take the Oilers to face either the Canucks or Predators. Los Angeles will aim to extend the series and avoid three straight years ending in a first round series loss to Edmonton.\n\n\u201cBacks against the wall, nothing to lose,\u201d said center Phillip Danault. \u201cJust gotta go all out, give it all you got.\u201d\n\nGame 5 will commence Wednesday at Rogers Place in Edmonton at 6 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo: Weiwei Huang)\n\nBy Sarah Arencibia April 30, 2024 at 1:02 pm PDT\n\nJayna Dias, an undergraduate Roski School of Design major, is working to carve out a space for cisgender women like her in the drag world, a space popularly dominated by gay men and transgender women. Dias\u2019 drag persona, May Glove, embodied hyperfemininity in her performance at USC Queer and Ally Student Assembly\u2019s (QuASA) annual drag show this January.\n\n\u201cI feel like, at times, femininity can be very constricting in your day to day life, sometimes it\u2019s not taken seriously,\u201d Dias said. \u201cBut when you deliberately decide, I\u2019m going to be as hyper-feminine as possible, and everybody\u2019s going to love it, I think that\u2019s very powerful.\u201d\n\nWith drag being a niche and safeguarded community, cisgender women entering this space come with a lot of scrutiny, according to Saneel Sharma, director of the drag show. However, Sharma believes this scrutiny to be unwarranted.\n\n\u201cCisgender women have always been supporters of drag, and it would feel wrong to exclude them in the community, since they\u2019ve always been our number one supporters,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cIn Jayna\u2019s case, it felt like not only was she a fan, but she was an active member.\u201d\n\nDias wholeheartedly believes drag is an avenue for expression, and that the art form cannot and should not be contained or relegated to any specific notions as to what it is supposed to be. \u201dSome people just have so much talent, it feels so wrong to try to stifle that,\u201d Dias said.\n\nNot only did Dias perform, but she also served as assistant director for the drag show. She interned for the show the year prior, and was thus recruited by Sharma to help direct. Dias put in months of work directing the show, beginning to plan the show\u2019s theme, \u201ca freak show\u201d, the summer before it even took place.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to get into the idea of drag as being kind of underground, often seen as strange or freaky, and we wanted to embrace that,\u201d Dias said.\n\nSharma and Dias auditioned more than 40 people before selecting 16 performers, held numerous individual and group practice sessions, and scoured for a venue that could seat over 600 people, eventually securing Bovard Auditorium on USC\u2019s main campus.\n\nThis was Dias\u2019 first time both performing in drag and directing a drag show. \u201cFor that to be your first time performance, it left every other first time drag queen out of business,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cShe just understands the art, and even though it was her first time, it didn\u2019t look like it.\n\nDias, who has participated in gymnastics for more than 12 years, carried her athleticism with her onto the stage. \u201cDuring my performance I was like I\u2019m on stage, this is kind of like a score, it\u2019s a competition, and I\u2019m going to perform it that way,\u201d Dias said.\n\nDias performed a vintage burlesque number under her drag name, May Glove \u2014 her character and name were inspired by Hollywood starlet Mae West. She sampled from a lot of 1950s artists and singers for the musical component of her number, like Rita Hayworth and Dorothy Dandridge. Dias also incorporated a lot of lines from Mae West to help her embody the witty, sexy bombshell of the starlet herself.\n\n\u201cShe brought an energy to the show that was absolutely needed,\u201d said Sam Starlov, a close friend of Dias who was impressed with her performance.\n\nGetting into the character of May Glove was a task in itself. During her number, Dias wore a size F breastplate and due to the size of the breastplate, she had to wear a bodysuit, corset, and bra, all to secure the faux breasts. Along with these pieces, she adorned a couple of tear-away items and a shoulder length, voluminous, orange wig.\n\n\u201cI needed the biggest hair, the biggest tits, the tiniest waist,\u201d Dias said. \u201cBecause, in my day to day life, I don\u2019t have that relationship with femininity as much, so I need to take drag as a platform and segue for me to tap into that.\u201d\n\nDias said she chose to wear such a large breastplate to ensure she was on the far end of the scale of femininity. She said she wanted to exemplify an inflated, almost cartoony version of a woman, in order to fully realize a transformation.\n\n\u201cShe went for the route of being almost provocative and really challenging the gender norms of what cis women could do with drag,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t do just any other average size breastplate. She did one that was ginormous, the most exaggerated size, which is what drag is, [an exaggerated form] of gender.\u201d\n\nAlong with practicing drag, Jayna expresses herself through other forms of art. She recently opened her first solo exhibition titled \u201cClarity and Opacity\u201d through the Roski School of Design. Her exhibit cataloged her travels in Senegal and stands as an homage to her familial lands and ancestral country. It also explores the nuances of experiencing life as a Black American and feeling distanced from her Senegalese culture.\n\n\u201cI consider [the] exhibition a testament to myself and the two sides of my identity coming together,\u201d Dias said.\n\nStarlov said he was impressed and proud that she completed this exhibition all while working as a full time student, assistant directing, as well as performing in the drag show.\n\n\u201cI really cannot wait to see what Jayna does in her future. I have never met anyone like her. Her dedication to her craft is truly something that inspires me. Whether that be in drag or in painting, in sports, she is truly a jack of all trades,\u201d Starlov said. \u201cI believe that she\u2019s really going to go far. I hope people at USC really take notice of what a special person and artist that we have in Jayna.\u201d\n\nThis story is part of Flare, an Annenberg Media initiative that focuses on women and queer stories.

(Photo by Desirae Ridley)\n\nBy Terence Holton April 30, 2024 at 12:03 pm PDT\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d is a column by Terence Holton discussing the latest college basketball headlines. The transfer portal has once again wreaked havoc on the college basketball landscape, just as it did college football. The USC men\u2019s basketball team in 2024 will be practically entirely made up of transfer players, as once again the portal is filled to the brim with talent. Even with so much player movement yet to happen, it\u2019s important to take a look into some of the most talented or intriguing players who have entered the portal, and where they are ending up.\n\nOumar Ballo: Center, Arizona \u2192 Indiana\nBallo had been a beast his entire career at Arizona, but the Wildcats had a disappointing postseason for the second year in a row, and Ballo then entered the transfer portal. However, Ballo\u2019s destination of Indiana is an absolute head scratcher. The Hoosiers are a historic program, but their head coach Mike Woodson is underwhelming. Indiana will have all the pieces to succeed next year as, along with Ballo, the Hoosiers added an underrated in former Washington State guard Myles Rice. Ballo is probably the best center in college basketball next year, so it will be exciting to see what he can do, but Indiana has too many question marks and moving on from Arizona is truly puzzling.\n\nKiki Iriafen: Forward, Stanford \u2192 USC\nKiki is coming home. The top available player in the women\u2019s transfer portal is taking her talents south, as she moves from Stanford back to her home city of Los Angeles and USC. Iriafen was the Pac-12\u2032s Most Improved Player for the 2023-24 season, as she nearly tripled her numbers in every statistical category. She averaged 19.4 points and 11 rebounds per game on one of the best teams in the country. This move made too much sense after Stanford\u2019s legendary coach Tara VanDerveer announced that she was retiring. Iriafen is a strong addition to an already stacked Trojans roster, which is bringing in the No. 1 recruiting class and returning two starters \u2014 freshman guard JuJu Watkins and junior forward Rayah Marshall. Watkins and Iriafen is an easy candidate as one of the deadliest guard-forward duos in the country. Let\u2019s not discredit Marshall and Iriafen as a forward-center duo, though. Big Ten guards will have to think twice before they enter the paint with the twin towers lurking. USC easily has one of the most talented rosters in all of college basketball next season; it will likely be the favorites to win the Big Ten and dethrone South Carolina at the top.\n\nA.J. Storr: Guard, Wisconsin \u2192 Kansas\nStorr was the best player on a fifth-seeded Wisconsin Badgers team, which had its ups and downs all year. While he is talented, it is not his basketball ability that is most intriguing. Storr is a great player, as he averaged 16.8 points this past year. However, what is so interesting about him is that Kansas will be his seventh school in seven years of basketball. Storr went to four high schools: Kankakee in Kankakee, Illinois; Bishop Gorman in Las Vegas, Nevada; Arizona Compass Prep in Chandler, Arizona; and finally, IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. In college, Storr started off his career at Saint John\u2019s before transferring to Wisconsin, and now he finds himself at Kansas. It is one of the most interesting stories in college basketball, and it is hard to make sense of. This is not a judgment of Storr \u2014 especially since he is only 20 years old \u2014 but it is a bit strange how he can\u2019t seem to stay put. Storr will likely be one of the most talented guards in all of college basketball next season, but Kansas head coach Bill Self should only consider this a one-year loan type of situation. If Storr is off to the NBA after his time at Kansas, it will be interesting to see if teams take into account his inability to stay attached to one place.\n\nWith that being said, and this being the final edition of College Basketball Catch-Up this semester, here are some way-too-early national championship picks.\nMen\u2019s: Kansas\nWomen\u2019s: USC \u2014 Up to the reader\u2019s interpretation to which one. Unfortunately, a year will have to pass before these picks inevitably prove to be true! \u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

Stereotypically, sports focus on physical prowess, while art centers on emotional impact. Uniting these two specialties can deepen our appreciation for both \u2014 we can see the physicality of artistic expression and emotional dynamics on the playing field. So, how can we connect these two worlds? Sports media professional LJ Rader answers that question with Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) accounts  @artbutmakeitsports . Rader creatively matches significant athletic moments with pieces of artwork and vice versa, drawing solely from  memory and personal experience . He blends the two worlds together and emphasizes the mutual relationship between these two seemingly disparate disciplines. Rader shows us how both arts and athletics provoke similar, powerful reactions from us even though they seem to occupy different spaces and attract different audiences.\n\nThis past year was full of endeavors in USC athletics deserving of artistic parallel. Using images from our incredible Annenberg Media photographers, here is my Trojan edition of \u201cart, but make it sports.\u201d\n\nThe Trojan horse Traveler is a beloved staple of USC home football games. I first saw the painting above at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena and instantly was reminded of Traveler making triumphant rounds in the Coliseum. I found similarities in the viewer\u2019s perspective in seeing the subject. Traveler exactly mirrors Henri\u2019s \u201cwhite horse.\u201d\n\nThis photo of senior outside hitter Skylar Fields screams victory. It was a daunting task to find a piece of art that could match the intensity and sensation that I felt when I looked at the Fields moment. Ultimately, nothing compares \u2014 but I tried to come close. What is a better embodiment of her achievements than a sculpture with wings?  After all, the sky\u2019s the limit.\n\nThe early season showed promise for USC\u2019s football team. It effortlessly breezed past its first few games,  including a home Stanford game , as depicted above. I like how the two images resemble physical domination. The movement between redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd and his fallen Cardinal opponent is steeped in thick tension, as the USC sideline and Coliseum crowd watch in the background. Lloyd and Cain stand out in the backdrop of the rest of the whole world, as the viewer is drawn to these individual battles.\n\nThis women\u2019s soccer photograph featuring freshman forward Maribel Flores is terrifically ambiguous. Initially, I couldn\u2019t decide whether it is a picture of triumph, anxiety, ambition, or a combination of all three. Regardless of tone, I matched Flores with Brownell\u2019s painting because they both share a solitary focal point of stillness in contrast to the vast background. In my opinion, both photographs exude optimism, as the bright colors give the scene a dreamlike quality.\n\nYoung freshman outside hitter  London Wijay has already cemented her status  as a reliable scorer and key to the women\u2019s volleyball team\u2019s success. What can I say? She doth striketh thee ill as pestilence.\n\nUSC\u2019s defensive line arose from a season-long slumber  to topple the Louisville Cardinals  in their final game of the 2023 season. I like the balanced composition of the two images \u2014 looking at them side-by-side almost convinces me of a mythological power and battle-readiness in the Trojans.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a punt, pirouette, or pass, there is an undeniable shared grace in each motion.\n\nThe men\u2019s volleyball team had much to celebrate in the photograph above, namely the 100th win of head coach Jeff Nygaard. The composition of these two images evoke skyward awe from the subjects within the frame. Kulmbach may have done it first, but really, who did it better?\n\nBefore America\u2019s pastime , there were America\u2019s pastures. I appreciate how these two images present tension and tranquility in a parallel way. Even though the Trojan baseball player is reaching out with a more aggressive intention as his Boucher counterpart, both frames feel like such an intimate moment between the two figures in the foreground.\n\nIn any piece of artwork, hands are subject to scrutiny and attention. Their depiction \u2014 face-up, face-down, illuminated, shadowy, closed, open \u2014 communicates a thousand words. Hands are just as purposeful in the athletic world.  WNBA-bound guard and court general McKenzie Forbes  speaks with her hands in the photo above, which serves as a meaningful snapshot of her veteran leadership. Forbes\u2019s outstretched gesture, much like that of Pujol\u2019s, has a deliberate gravity, communicating trust in her teammates.\n\nOnce again, I found a link between the contemporary and classical. Ly\u2019s photograph and Blake\u2019s painting are determination personified. The angel\u2019s classical pose mirrors the Trojan\u2019s movement, drawing attention to the top of the frame and beyond the eye can see.\n\nAbove, USC graduate Jared Feikes demonstrates how the precision of an excellent pitch is a Herculean task. The dynamic movement of the main subjects \u2014 the Trojan athlete and the Greek hero \u2014 displays their respective strengths and control.\n\nSuspended in motion. While Volodymyr Iakubenko of USC men\u2019s tennis conveys a vigorous action, Alexander\u2019s figure in \u201cRepose\u201d is in languid rest, as its name suggests. But the curved posture of the subject\u2019s body suggests there is potential energy and some urgency underneath the stillness.\n\nImmediately, the bright orange basketball grabs my visual attention. The focus is so narrowed on the ball as a beacon, and the daisy is similarly compelling to me.\n\nIn perhaps the most exciting occasion of the past year\u2019s athletic calendar, freshman sensation JuJu Watkins is palpably excited after the women\u2019s  basketball team took home the Pac-12 championship . The right hand of Tiepolo\u2019s figure raised arm and gaze echoes Watkins\u2019 pose, but within an ethereal setting. Both images illustrate the spectrum of greatness. Striving for achievement spans eras and cultures, transcending the boundaries of modern sports and renaissance art. These illustrated moments, whether by an athlete or an artist, encapsulate the essence of all collective narratives \u2014 stories of adversity, endurance, and the reach for something greater.\n```"}

The team will be led by sophomore Catherine Park and senior Amari Avery, who were both recently named to the Pac-12 All-Conference First Team. They will be competing alongside senior Brianna Navarrosa, senior Christine Wang, junior Xin (Cindy) Kou and freshman Bailey Shoemaker.\n\nPark and Shoemaker recently made history for the Trojans, with record-low rounds in big tournaments. Shoemaker made history with a historic final round \u2014 a six-under-par 66 \u2014 that led to her second-place finish at the Augusta National Women\u2019s Amateur (ANWA) on April 6. The first two rounds of the tournament were held at Champions Retreat Golf Club, where Shoemaker went 70-73.\n\n\u201cIt [was] my first time making the cut and being able to play in the final round,\u201d Shoemaker said. \u201cJust knowing that I was able to get through and put myself in position, I knew my game was in the right spot to hopefully take it deep at Augusta. And I did, so that was exciting.\u201d\n\nShoemaker competed in the tournament alongside Avery, Park and incoming freshman recruit Jasmine Koo, who all made the cut as well. Shoemaker\u2019s final round marked the lowest final round in ANWA history and put her only one shot short of winner Lottie Woad of Florida State. Woad took home the tournament title after securing birdies on holes 17 and 18 to finish eight under par.\n\n\u201cShe plays really well in the bigger events, and when the golf courses get nastier, she gets better,\u201d USC head coach Justin Silverstein said of Shoemaker. \u201cSo I guess we should have seen it coming, but I don\u2019t think we saw it as clearly as maybe we should have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI finished like birdie-par-birdie-par-par, so it was a strong finish. I thought posting seven under would be enough, but Lottie played very well down the stretch, so it is what it is,\u201d Shoemaker said.\n\nShoemaker described what it felt like walking up to the historic 18th hole, which so many greats had done before her.\n\n\u201cI could really feel that the crowd was on my side. The gallery had gotten pretty big, and I love a good crowd,\u201d Shoemaker said. \u201cTiger [Woods] has done it so many times, everybody\u2019s done it, and at that moment I thought I\u2019d won.\u201d\n\nPark and Avery had finished their rounds before Shoemaker, so they were able to watch her finish her historic final round.\n\n\u201cIt was technically my first time watching [Shoemaker] play, because when we play, we\u2019re all separated,\u201d Park said. \u201cBut watching my teammate [compete in] one of the biggest amateur tournaments, in my opinion, at one of the most prominent golf courses was great to watch.\u201d\n\nShoemaker explained how the entire tournament was a surreal experience for not only herself but for women\u2019s golf, saying how \u201cit\u2019s a blessing for women to finally be able to play at Augusta,\u201d and how this event is almost like the women\u2019s version of The Masters.\n\nThis is just the beginning for Shoemaker, as her long-term goals are to win championships on the LPGA Tour.\n\n\u201cI, of course, want to turn pro and give that a run and hopefully win the US Open,\u201d Shoemaker said. \u201cWe have so many major winners that have graduated from here, a lot of really good LPGA pros that are all sweethearts and all love this university so much, so I\u2019ll hopefully follow them.\u201d\n\nJust weeks after Shoemaker\u2019s historic round, Park secured her third individual win of the season at the Pac-12 Championship on April 23 in Pullman, Washington. She shot 15 under par (70-64-67) and posted the lowest tournament score in Pac-12 Tournament history.\n\nBut the first day of the tournament was challenging for Park due to the weather.\n\n\u201cThe first day, it was very hard because it was so windy, so a lot of adjustments needed to be made,\u201d she said. \u201cThen the last few rounds, the weather was much nicer, so it was just going back to what the game plan was, and everything went well from there.\u201d\n\nPark\u2019s second round of 64 was tied for the lowest score she has ever shot in tournament play. She went on to sweep the entire competition by five strokes, finishing with a birdie and an eagle on the final two holes in her third round.\n\n\u201cIt was a nice way to secure the win,\u201d Park said. \u201cThe entire round was pretty steady, and I was trying to be patient because I was missing some putts I had for birdie.\u201d\n\nShe said the most memorable moment of the tournament was her final putt on the 18th hole. Park had about a 33-foot eagle putt and was simply trying to get it near the hole. She thought she hit her putt past the pin, but it fell instead.\n\n\u201cIt was the cherry on top, so that was probably the one hole I\u2019ll forever remember,\u201d Park said.\n\nOn the same day, Golf Channel announced that Park will represent Team USA for the Arnold Palmer Cup at the Lahinch Golf Club in Ireland on July 5-7. The Palmer Cup is a Ryder Cup-style event featuring men\u2019s and women\u2019s collegiate golfers.\n\n\u201cPlaying for USA, of course, that\u2019s a big thing, and also playing with other amazing golfers since it\u2019s boys and girls, I\u2019ll be meeting new people, too,\u201d Park said. \u201cThis is a tournament that I\u2019ve been looking forward to playing in college since I came to USC, and I\u2019m happy that I get the honor to play and go all the way overseas.\u201d\n\nPark is now ranked No. 23 in the Women\u2019s Amateur Golf Ranking with teammate Avery at No. 22 and Shoemaker at No. 110.\n\nAfter finishing second as a team at the Pac-12 Championship, USC hopes to ride off the momentum of its top performers moving into NCAA Regionals next week.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to get our ticket to nationals and get that team ring secured to end this good postseason,\u201d Park said.\n\nThe Trojans have advanced to the NCAA Championship finals every year since 1998 and they hope to continue that achievement this year.\n```"}

Annenberg Media reached out to a media liaison of the encampment who confirmed the recording\u2019s existence but did not share it. The university has not yet responded to a late night question about the claim.\n\nSpeakers also said they wished the meeting would have addressed their demands in a more substantive way. They said that they felt Folt spoke \u201ccondescendingly.\u201d \u201cWe need tangible steps,\u201d said one of the speakers. \u201cWe need [the administration] to come to the table and have some sort of response, not just \u2018what are you talking about?\u2019\u201d\n\nFolt acknowledged their dissatisfaction in her own statement after the meeting, and that she can \u201cfully appreciate\u201d that organizers did not consider the meeting to be \u201ca win from their perspective.\u201d\n\nOne of the speakers said Folt noted that she had been in touch with the Advisory Committee on Muslim Life at USC \u2014 and had to be reminded that the majority of that committee\u2019s members had resigned a week before.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be connecting folks with attorneys,\u201d a speaker said. \u201cWe have some of the most amazing attorneys in LA who are going to work on this.\u201d\n\nThe speaker mentioned that they were frustrated with Folt\u2019s generalizations with regard to USC\u2019s commitment to diversity, like her supposed reference to the Advisory Committee on Muslim Life or the claim that Folt tried to \u201cweaponize\u201d a USC building being named after an indigenous person.\n\nOn her end, Folt had issued a statement saying she thinks this meeting was a vital starting point. The meeting was attended by four student representatives and one faculty member who the coalition identified as Jody Armour, a Gould professor. Folt was joined by Beong-Soo Kim, senior vice President and general counsel as well as Monique Allard, vice president for student life.\n\nArmour specializes in relationships between \u201cracial justice, criminal justice, and the rule of law\u201d and has been active at the site since it started last week.\n\n\u201cThe students acquitted themselves eloquently, forcefully, & honorably,\u201d Armour posted on X on Monday following the meeting.\n\nThe speaker concluded the Q&A session by saying, \u201cAt this moment, right now, we should be grounded in a reason for being here, which is fighting for a liberated Palestine.\u201d\n```"}

They left without interacting with protestors at the encampment on Alumni Park. (Photo by Aditya Thiyag)\n\nBy Mohammed Zain Shafi Khan, Katie Simons, Tamara Almoayed, and Aditya Thiyag\nApril 29, 2024 at 1:46 pm PDT\n\nStudent groups were left displaced and scrambling over the weekend when USC administration revoked all event permits for on-campus functions, including end-of-semester celebrations and performances, amid campus unrest. This came just as a citywide tactical alert was issued by LAPD Saturday from 6:30 to 11 p.m. in response to USC Divest From Death Coalition\u2019s ongoing encampment, as reported by City News Service.\n\nMonday, at least one school department\u2019s event to recognize students for their achievements was scrapped. Student groups who had an event scheduled on campus for Sunday received an email late Saturday informing them of the cancellation. The email, which was signed by Adam Rosen, associate vice president of Cultural Relations and University Events, stated that \u201cdue to the current campus closures,\u201d the event \u201cmust be canceled.\u201d\n\nThe USC Sirens A Cappella group was informed around midnight that the events permit for its spring show \u2014 which was scheduled for Sunday evening \u2014 was canceled. Prior to the cancellation, the group had been working closely with the school to adhere to the guest registration policy put into place Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe had been in close contact with both DPS and the provost office to make sure that we could still host the event on campus,\u201d said Kaitlyn Huamani, senior journalism major and member of Sirens. \u201cAnd, as of Friday and Saturday morning, they had been very clear that there wouldn\u2019t be any problems because we had registered each non-student guest officially through the university.\u201d\n\nSirens scrambled to find a new performance space, and the group was ultimately able to perform in the USC Village. However, not all groups have been as fortunate and reports were coming in all weekend of students left stranded.\n\nAnother student in Sirens, who goes by the name Nations, said she believes that the acapella group\u2019s permit being pulled was a result of police escalation on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe had obtained a permit to hold our Sirens concert at the BCI from DPS, but this was revoked after things had \u2018escalated\u2019 Friday night,\u201d said Nations, a sophomore theater major and Sirens board member. \u201cIt was very obviously a response to police presence and not what was going on in the protest. There had not been escalation at the protest, as far as I know, and as soon as the convoy arrived was when the cancellation occurred.\u201d\n\nHearing the news was particularly upsetting for Huamani, whose parents had flown in from New Jersey for her final performance.\n\n\u201cI started freaking out, because I was worried that they flew all this way for nothing, and I got really emotional,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, this year has already been hard enough on seniors with the changes to commencement and the lack of transparency [from] the university, it\u2019s been very frustrating and hard to handle. So this was just like, a whole new level of frustration and sadness.\u201d\n\nBreak Through Hip Hop \u2014 a student-run dance organization \u2014 had their show in Bovard Auditorium shut down Saturday night around 8 p.m. after audience members had already been seated. The show had already been rescheduled once before from Wednesday night while pro-Palestine protesters were being arrested in Alumni Park.\n\n\u201cI felt sad for the dancers and their families that traveled a long way to see them dance and sad for the seniors who experienced another tarnished graduating memory,\u201d said Daeshylyn Satcher, a junior architecture major who was attending the show to support a friend.\n\nSatcher believes that the show would not have been disrupted by the encampment.\n\n\u201cWe were across the way from Alumni Park, so the two events seemed pretty separate,\u201d Satcher said. \u201cEven walking through campus I felt safe, until LAPD showed up in great force.\u201d\n\nThe cancellation of events has continued Monday. The political science and international relations department (POIR) wrote an email to students that its POIR Student Recognition Dinner will not move forward on May 8 as planned.\n\n\u201cIt is with a heavy heart that we inform you that the Department of Political Science and International Relations (POIR) Student Recognition Dinner has been canceled,\u201d the email read.\n\nThe email asked students to instead come and collect their certificates between 9 a.m and 5 p.m. between May 6 and May 10.\n\nMia, a POIR student who was to be honored at the student recognition dinner, said that she is \u201coverwhelmingly disappointed\u201d and \u201cdisgusted\u201d at the behavior of USC over the past days.\n\n\u201cUSC seems to be making the wrong decision at every opportunity,\u201d she said, hoping for the university to reverse its decision. \u201cStudent protesting is not only a right, it is a necessity, and USC punishing students who have worked hard their entire time at this university because the administration refuses to engage with demonstrators in good faith only makes the university look worse.\u201d\n\nThe POIR email suggested more sad notes are to come.\n\n\u201cUniversity administration has requested all private department events being held on campus to be canceled during the week of commencement,\u201d it read.\n\nUSC PR has not confirmed if this department\u2019s statement is accurate.\n```"}

Nine frames depict the felled trees paired to the noise of chainsaws. (Photo: Ming Leng)\n\nBy Amy Wang April 29, 2024 at 1:22 pm PDT\n\nWhat was the inspiration behind the making of this short film? Initially, the film \u201cFastidiosa\u201d was produced for another class, IML288 - Critical Thinking and Procedural Media, from media arts and practice. It\u2019s the introduction to creative coding and people mostly learn about processing. It\u2019s a kind of sub-library based on JavaScript that\u2019s mostly used for visual creative coding. In general, that short film is about a kind of plant epidemic that\u2019s caused by a kind of bacteria called Xylella fastidiosa, spread mostly in southern Italy\u2019s Puglia areas. My inspiration for the topic came from a photo book that I found two years ago, also called \u201c Fastidiosa \u201d. It\u2019s just composed mostly of archival photos, research and field research, so it\u2019s a really beautiful collection. Based on that collection, I used the photos from them to produce my short film \u201cFastidiosa\u201d and the meaning of it is mostly about calling for the attention of that kind of topic of how the plant can also have epidemics and how we can help them. Another point I want to highlight is how plant culture has a really deep relationship with human culture, especially in southern Italy. For instance, the farmer there relies heavily on the production of olive trees, olive oils and related products. When trees are getting infected, humans are also getting infected. So that is a really interesting relationship.\n\nWho are the artists or architects that inspired you, and what media trends do you follow? Olafur Eliasson! He has been my favorite artist of all time. He is an artist who focuses on environmentalism through artistic installations. He did paintings, installations, projections; he also collaborated with Sebastian Behmann to make some really fascinating building projects such as the Kirk Kapital\u2019s corporate headquarter located in Denmark. I was very inspired by him. So I went into USC and took architecture and have a minor inside specialization. What intrigues me the most is spatial curation\u2014how artists use virtual space to create different experiences for people inside of it. Because that\u2019s the intersection point of both architecture, which is more specialized, and media arts, which focuses on storytelling across different mediums. In \u201cFastidiosa,\u201d the short film that I made, it isn\u2019t a typical virtual city space because my initial inspiration was to make a digital storybook, but in a more elegant way. I did try to curate a journey in five minutes. And I\u2019m personally really satisfied with the end result.\n\nYou are a double major in Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies and a Bachelor of Art in Media Arts + Practice at USC. How did you arrive at this decision? How do you find that combining the two curricula gives you what you want for your education at USC? Initially, I enrolled as an Architecture major with a minor in Science Visualization. It was a really small, cross-interdisciplinary minor between the animation department at SCA and Viterbi. I started with the minor and discovered that I really like exploring science and visualization through different media. Then in my third year, I turned my minor, Science Visualization, into my co-major, Media Arts and Practice. I officially began my journey as a double major student at USC and I found it to be really pleasing to me, because I see doing media artwork as a kind of relaxation or taking a break from architecture studio. I can explore some of the interests that I don\u2019t really have a chance to explore in architecture and study them in the arts. When I was in architecture, we studied a lot about materials, like physics and materiality. One of the materials that I was really interested in was wood. So I combined my interest in wood and Fastidiosa and just had a lot of exploration about them in my creative coding class. I\u2019m really interested in a more logical and creative representation of science.\n\nMany Architecture major students find themselves pressed for time through the 5-year program. You took a gap year from USC. What motivated that choice and how was that experience? I found myself in that year and it really was fantastic! In the spring semester of my third year, I continued taking all the [architecture] courses but just not architecture studio, which gave me a lot of freedom and time to explore. I started to take required courses in Media Arts like introduction to graphic design. I took Languages of Digital Media (IML 201) and learned a lot about video editing. Last year, I took an Architecture elective ARCH599 - BIODESIGN: Animal Architecture, it was a course of a more media or perspective. We studied the nesting logic of birds and made sculptures and installations about that. We collaborated with USC Visions and Voices for an installation about the LA River and the vanishing birds in the LA area. Then in my senior year fall, I did a sonic art course, created projects on the sound of earthquakes and the sound of whales in Adobe Audition. In my media arts studio course about board game design, we produced a board game about the human organs and it\u2019s a really interesting project because personally, I\u2019ve been really fascinated about not only the ecosystem but human biology as well. So that\u2019s one of my favorite projects. It is set in the hospital in a futuristic world. There are four surgeons throughout them who are human beings. One of them is a cyber human being and there\u2019s a patient lying on his back. And for humans, their goal is to treat the sick patients, but the cyber one is trying to turn the sick into robots. My role was the designer of the game board, then also the arts producer for the whole game.\n\nYou are also working with the USC Landscape Futures Lab. What drove you to get involved and what kind of projects are you working on? The professor of the animal architecture course is the leader of the lab. She is an SCA Media Arts and Practice PhD student and she\u2019s currently teaching landscape architecture as well. I deeply resonated with her because I am also doing two degrees. We were working on a project about the artificial production of kelp tech. Now, humans are mostly growing kelp in plastic tubes, which is not so eco-friendly and kind of expensive. So our lab looks for more eco-friendly and cheaper alternatives. In my role as a 3D-modeling student worker, I mostly used Rhino and Grasshopper to model the way the sea kelp could form and translate the research into the design. I\u2019m also currently creating diagrams to better explain the design to research groups or audiences who have never learned about this topic before. We are hoping to have our exhibition about our current findings and design by this May.\n\nArtistically, what are some of the mediums or projects that you\u2019re excited to start or continue? I want to learn more about coding and TouchDesigner, which is more of a spatial coding direction as well. Another project in my web coding classes is a web page design project about the Three Gorges Dam in China and I\u2019m using 10 pages of HTML to talk about the advantages and the disadvantages of that dam from the perspective of a drop of water in the Yangtze River. So, it\u2019s a story of you as a drop of water, floating through a river. If you get trapped, then you see, maybe the human villages and how they\u2019re being developed, or being moved to other places because of the development of the dam.\n\nWhere do you see yourself post-graduation? I want to start with a career as an architect, then explore my interests through media arts, because life as a professional media artist doesn\u2019t really fit with my personality. I want to have at least one career related to architecture.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: some quotes have been edited for clarity.\n```"}

Now she lives in Los Angeles and is making a name for herself in the city\u2019s busy music scene.\n\n\u201cNo one knows how it\u2019s gonna play out really when they\u2019re an artist... month to month, it\u2019s so different...[but] one day like it\u2019s gonna pay off,\u201d said Forte, an aspiring singer-songwriter and USC alum. Forte isn\u2019t new to the music scene; she joined the jazz band at the age of 11 and played the saxophone until middle school. Her parents supported her love for music by putting her in singing and guitar lessons. Eventually, she began writing songs \u2014 initially loving writing short stories which then transferred into her music. She wrote her first song \u201csmall town\u201d at the age of 12.\n\nFollowing her first song release in 2020, \u201cI Was Wearing Green,\u201d Forte recalled, \u201cI had so many people DMing me \u2014 well not so many but enough for my first song \u2014 [saying], \u2018I really liked this. I love your sound. I love your lyrics.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Wow,\u2019 people are listening,\u201d she said. She always knew that Los Angeles was where she wanted to be for her career, but the timing was never right. After a push from a fellow Trojan, she applied and then transferred to USC, finishing her last two years in the music industry program. She gained insight into the workings of the industry and met a supportive community that uplifted her throughout this journey.\n\n\u201cI feel like, anywhere you go, it\u2019s gonna be hard to make your way, but I like how L.A. is filled with everyone trying to follow their dreams,\u201d Forte explained. Forte\u2019s music has strong rock and roll influences complimented by her rich voice. Some of her musical inspirations include Lana Del Rey, Amy Winehouse and Jeff Buckley. These influences are evident in her new single \u201cLifeline,\u201d which is set to be released this summer.\n\n\u201cMy earlier stuff is a little more bright...I see [it] more as pastel colors. This new era is more dark a little more grungy, but still with those pastel tones,\u201d said Forte when describing her upcoming single. This new era in her career stems from finding her style and leaning back into the music she grew up listening to like Janis Joplin, The Beatles and Led Zeppelin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more than proud,\u201d said Forte\u2019s mom, Heidi Forte, in a TikTok video. \u201cShe\u2019s a singer-songwriter and she\u2019s doing amazing out here.\u201d Her commitment to her passion doesn\u2019t come without hard work. Outside of music, she waitresses on the side to support herself. Three times a week, she\u2019s in the atmosphere of a busy restaurant, escorting customers to their tables, taking orders and bringing out food. Her desire to succeed keeps that drive and passion alive, and it\u2019s a bonus that she likes the music they play.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be exhausted, and I just gotta push through and it will happen,\u201d said Forte. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to figure out the balance, but ultimately, music is the most important thing right now.\u201d With graduation approaching, many soon-to-be graduates are scared about the uncertainty that comes along with this milestone. If being a USC graduate isn\u2019t enough to tell you how far you will go, take it from a recent graduate like Forte, who is showing up every day and writing her future into fruition.\n\n\u201cI feel like the time I\u2019ve taken to work on the project has allowed me to try new things lyrically and sonically and honestly have more fun with my sound,\u201d said Forte. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m using my voice and I\u2019m more expressive than ever before in these new songs.\u201d```"}

(Creative Commons license via Flickr/Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine)\n\nBy Sarah Arencibia April 29, 2024 at 12:43 pm PDT\n\nLast November, DPS reported that a Lyft driver sexually assaulted a female USC student in the early morning of November 1 when she was returning to her apartment near campus from West Hollywood. This incident sent waves of shock and terror through the student body, especially among those who identify as female. Since then, female students at USC have reported heightened anxiety and fear surrounding Lyft rides near campus and around the LA area, even though USC\u2019s Free Lyft program was created precisely with the intention of protecting students\u2019 safety.\n\nWe interviewed several students on campus about similar experiences. Betty, an undergraduate student, was one of the students willing to share her experience with us. \u201cWhen I actually arrived at my destination, he didn\u2019t unlock the doors,\u201d said undergraduate USC student Betty, who asked to be identified only by her first name in fear of retaliation from her harasser. \u201cAt that point, I realized something was off.\u201d Betty\u2019s trip was to the South LA Animal Shelter in Chesterfield Square, which is about a 20-minute drive from the University Park campus. It was then that she experienced unwanted advances from her Lyft driver.\n\nThroughout the entirety of the trip, Betty\u2019s driver kept telling her they should hang out, asking her to dinner, and asking for her phone number. \u201cHe kept insisting, \u2018Oh, but I\u2019m a local, I\u2019m older. I\u2019ve been here for a while, I can help you. I can show you around,\u2019\u201d Betty said. Once they arrived at her destination, he kept her in his locked car for five to 10 minutes. He wouldn\u2019t let her leave until she finally conceded to giving him her number, even calling to check she gave out her real number. Before she blocked him, Betty\u2019s driver ended up texting her later that day and asked her to grab dinner.\n\n\u201cMy alert level is always so high,\u201d Betty said. \u201cI\u2019m just always kind of nervous the whole way until I\u2019m around campus, [because] then if I have to jump out of the car from that distance, I can still walk home.\u201d Betty said she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable taking Lyfts or public transportation anymore, and often uses rides from friends as her primary method of transportation. \u201cI\u2019m kind of just trapped a little bit around campus,\u201d Betty said. On the rare occasion she does have to take a Lyft, Betty said she shares all her trips with her best friend so her location is known at all times. Even with her location shared, Betty said she can\u2019t shake that nervous feeling. \u201cI\u2019ll always just stare at the routes like all the time to make sure that nothing goes wrong,\u201d Betty said.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not an uncommon experience for many young women. \u201cResearch generally shows that anytime there\u2019s this major transition for young women going to college, women joining the military, women moving to another city or another country, they\u2019re at risk for being sexually assaulted or raped, because they don\u2019t know anyone, they don\u2019t know who to trust,\u201d Carl Castro, professor of social work at USC and an expert on the issue of sexual harassment said.\n\nIn Lyft\u2019s Community Safety Report, released in 2021, the ride-share company documented a stark number of 4,158 incidents of sexual assault during Lyft rides, with the majority reported by passengers. The Association of American Universities (AAU) Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct, published in 2018, reported that 26.4% of all undergraduate females surveyed experience rape or sexual assault. Only 20% of female student survivors of rape or sexual assault, ages 18 to 24, report to law enforcement.\n\nAmong the 33 participating universities are UCLA and Stanford University, yet not USC. \u201cThe universities don\u2019t want to know the truth; this includes USC. USC is not unique; no university wants that data to be right,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place in America that women are safe, no place, and college campuses refuse to collect the data because they don\u2019t want parents to know the answer.\u201d\n\nOut of all the colleges and universities across the US, 89% reported zero incidents of rape, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). It is often claimed by universities that it\u2019s difficult to report sexual assault because students don\u2019t report, either in fear of retaliation by authority figures and their perpetrators or simply to protect their privacy. While these reasons are credible, they still do not account for the complete absence of data from the majority of the nation\u2019s universities.\n\nCastro\u2019s comments, as well as the BJS\u2019 data, reflect the lack of a university response following the rape of a USC student in a Lyft near campus that rocked the entire USC community. Michelle Garcia, senior associate director of USC Transportation, said the department was informed of the alleged rape, yet was not made aware that the Lyft driver who committed the rape was banned from the platform.\n\n\u201cNothing came back to us through university channels,\u201d Garcia said. Even with the magnitude of impact this incident had on the USC student community, Garcia said that the one rape case, along with the other issues involving sexual harassment or assault in Lyfts her department had been informed of, was not significant enough to raise broad concern.\n\n\u201cWe do millions of rides a year. We have not been made aware of many issues where we would say \u2018Hey, we need to take a look at doing something else,\u2019\u201d Garcia said. Garcia did note that her department is looking to incorporate Lyft\u2019s Women+ Connect program into USC\u2019s Lyft service, yet could not confirm a date as to when they might add this service, which would allow students to be paired with solely female drivers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m almost always in a Lyft by myself, so I would be relieved using a female-only driver function, especially at night,\u201d Betty said. While this potential addition to the Lyft services available to students inspires hope for safe modes of transportation around campus, until it is incorporated, female students will continue to live in fear.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know how to treat women. It\u2019s appalling. We stick our heads in the sand because we don\u2019t want to, as a society, and sometimes as institutions of higher education, to acknowledge that it\u2019s unsafe for women in many of these environments,\u201d Castro said.\n\nThis story is part of Flare, an Annenberg Media initiative that focuses on women and queer stories. The goal of this beat is to immerse our audience in the culture, identity, and issues surrounding women and queer communities.\n```"}

(Photo: Shruthi Narayanan)\n\nBy Shruthi Narayanan\nApril 29, 2024 at 12:22 pm PDT\n\nIn February 2024, The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) announced last year to be their highest ridership since 2019, before COVID-19 hit, suggesting that transportation ridership is beginning to stabilize. In Fall 2023, the U-Pass program at USC expanded, offering free access to all Metro trains and select buses. Previously, the program was only available to graduate students as a paid, opt-in service. However, starting in Fall 2023, the U-Pass became free for all students, including undergraduates. This expansion likely contributed to the increase in ridership.\n\nDavid Donovan, Associate Director for USC Transportation at the Health Sciences campus, discussed U-Pass usage rates during the fall semester. He notes that while graduate students had an 87% usage rate among those who picked up their U-Pass cards, 80% of undergraduates used their cards at least once.\n\nRobert Binder, a fifth-year urban planning and development PhD student, received the U-Pass in August of last year and found it significantly useful. He had commuted to campus on the metro in previous semesters as well, but had paid for it. \u201cHaving the U-Pass is pretty great because I don\u2019t have to worry about paying for transit,\u201d Binder said. \u201cI don\u2019t have that extra stress of needing to pay for transportation.\u201d\n\nThis year, Binder comes to campus four times a week, a frequency he said would be less without the U-Pass. Lyr Colin, a fifth-year PhD comparative literature student, has used the U-Pass since arriving at USC as an exchange student six years ago, only stopping for a few semesters between 2020 and 2022. \u201cI come from Paris, where the Metro is the main way of moving around,\u201d Colin said. He elaborated on how he found out about the U-Pass right away. \u201cMy program... [was] really helpful in pointing me in the right direction for this.\u201d\n\nEddie Soule, USC Transportation\u2019s rideshare coordinator, aims to reduce single occupancy vehicles at USC, with the U-Pass program aligning with this goal. \u201cThe main benefit of the program is that students have a very reliable way to get around. It connects them to all sorts of things that they want to do from visiting family to exploring LA to going to internships,\u201d Soule said. \u201cSomeone can pick up a U pass today, activate their card, and automatically, their mobility increases exponentially.\u201d\n\nDespite being available to undergraduates, many still don\u2019t utilize the U-Pass. Lohit Nambiar is a freshman computational neuroscience major and USC Transportation student worker. He believes that sustainable transportation is important, but suggested that people should be able to opt out of the transportation fee for the U-Pass. \u201cFor example, if you have a car, you\u2019re probably not going to use the U-Pass. So why would you have to pay like the extra money for the U pass, if you\u2019re not going to get any use out of it in the first place?\u201d Nambiar said. \u201cIf students knew about the U-Pass and being able to take public transportation [for free], I feel like more students would be open to doing that.\u201d\n\nThe L.A. Metro system has had a negative reputation in the past, with passengers feeling unsafe due to attacks being one of the reasons. But last year, that reputation started to see a positive shift. German journalists praised the metro in an editorial posted in the Los Angeles Times. Binder, whose field is public transit, is optimistic about the future of the LA Metro and the U-Pass, advocating for further expansion of the rail system to enhance livability in LA. \u201cThe bus system is great, but the rail system, we need to expand that more for sure,\u201d Binder elaborated on the planned expansions to specific rail lines. \u201cI want USC and the other universities in the region to keep supporting [people] riding transit... In order for LA to become a more livable place, we need to keep investing in it.\u201d\n\nDonovan believes that the U-Pass is too popular a program to go away now that has been fully expanded to all students. \u201cIt\u2019s too popular, too many students are using it, and we\u2019re putting too many resources into publicizing it and to making sure people know about it,\u201d Donovan said.\n```"}

Explore the eco-friendly features and future potential of USC\u2019s newest Computer Science building.\n\nRendered image of Ginsburg Hall, picture courtesy of USC Viterbi School of Engineering.\n\nBy Serena Li April 29, 2024 at 9:03 am PDT\n\nOn Downey Way en route to Taco Bell, a LEED Platinum certified, modern glass building is coming into shape \u2013 the Ginsburg Hall, the future home for USC Viterbi School of Engineering\u2019s Computer Science Department. Victoria Oge-Evans, a Green Technologies Masters student, toured the building last semester for her class in Sustainable Design and Construction. She recalls the feature that stood out to her being a sunken garden that \u201c[helps] manage rainwater, which would be really helpful in reducing run-off that causes flooding when it rains heavily.\u201d\n\nLEED Platinum is the highest rating in the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification. Projects applying for the certification can earn points on different criteria related to sustainable designs and constructions. To be LEED Platinum certified, all parties must be unified around the concept of sustainable achievement - from designers to engineers, consultants to contractors, everyone is required to track and control the impact of the building on the environment.\n\nThe Ginsburg Hall project focused on three major points for LEED Platinum certification: \u201c[the building\u2019s] energy performance, the embodied carbon of the building, and also the sort of health and wellbeing - that indoor environmental quality credit,\u201d Sean Quinn said, the Director of Regenerative Design at HOK, the company responsible for designing the Ginsburg Hall.\n\nOne unique feature built to facilitate better indoor environmental quality is the buffer facade. It is an indoor buffer that provides an outdoor experience, giving a chance for students to catch a breather in between vigorous researching and learning sessions. The outdoor experience is cleverly mimicked by taking exhausted air from laboratories as well as individual rooms and then recycling it into the buffer facade. This process generates natural ventilation, reducing the need for additional cooling.\n\nThe space invites students from different disciplines to interact and collaborate with one another and is designed to be \u201cconsistently available, consistently comfortable, and creates this sort of threshold of activity,\u201d Quinn explained.\n\nThe sustainability effort does not stop at the construction of the building. Once the building is put into use, it enters the \u201cLiving Laboratory\u201d stage, which provides learning opportunities for the university in the long term. Professor David Gerber, the leader of the process, introduces the concept of the Living Laboratory and its implementation through a \u201cDigital Twin\u201d in a statement to Annenberg Media: \u201c[Ginsburg Hall] will have a digital twin enabling researchers across many disciplines from architecture, to engineering, to computer science, to health to innovate through the use of data and AI. It is a Living Lab and a first for our campus community. It is a building that will learn and a building that help teach through a novel digital twin technology. It is a building that has been sustainably designed and engineered and one that will continue to share its lessons towards our [campus\u2019s] sustainable future.\u201d\n\nBeing a \u201cfirst\u201d in LEED Platinum Certification and a \u201cfirst\u201d in the Living Lab technology, the Ginsburg Hall will act as an example for all future buildings on campus as USC strides toward its 2028 sustainability plan. \u201cTo achieve sustainable and regenerative outcomes is not merely a technical design solution. It requires intense collaboration and ultimately commitment,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nThe building is envisioned not only as a versatile space for the Computer Science department but also as a catalyst for inspiring further research in sustainability across engineering and architecture.\n```"}

(AP/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Matt Kim April 28, 2024 at 2:15 pm PDT\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 Coming off a series loss against the Rays, the Angels looked to rebound against the Reds in a three-game set. However, their offense sputtered throughout the series, as they failed to record more than five runs in any game.\n\nGame one of the series featured a pitching duel early on, with LHP Tyler Anderson playing fantastically for the Halos. Through seven innings, the lefty allowed three hits and only one earned run, lowering his season ERA to 1.42. This has been a bounceback season for Anderson after posting a 5.43 ERA in a rough 2023 season.\n\nOn the other side, the Reds\u2019 LHP Nick Lodolo navigated through a couple of jams, allowing seven hits but only surrendering one run through his six innings of work. The Angels then handed the ball to RHP Adam Cimber and the righty allowed four runs in just 0.2 of an inning. The bats couldn\u2019t muster up a late rally against the Reds bullpen, and even though they outhit the Reds 7-5, the Angels lost the ballgame 7-1.\n\nLHP Patrick Sandoval took the mound against the Reds in game two coming off of his best start of the season. However, Sandoval imploded against the Reds, surrendering seven earned runs on six hits while walking five. Most of the damage came in the first inning, in which the Reds put up five runs, capped off by a Tyler Stephenson grand slam.\n\n\u201cSandy\u201d had been steadily improving after a shaky Opening Day start against the Reds, but couldn\u2019t manage to find the strike zone in Saturday\u2019s matchup. On the hitting side, the Angels offense looked much better than the night before, as DH Miguel Sano finished with a three-hit night, one of those being a two-run homer. However, the rest of the lineup failed to string together a collective offensive streak and the Halos lost the second game of the series by a final score of 7-5.\n\nIn the series finale, the Angels turned to RHP Jose Soriano and the righty looked excellent through his first five innings of work. The Reds countered with RHP Frankie Montas, but he exited in the first inning after an arm injury. The game stayed scoreless until the sixth inning, where Soriano would run into trouble, surrendering three runs in the frame. The largest blow was a two-run double off Christian Encarnacion-Strand\u2019s bat that was all the Reds needed to win the game. All three runs scored in the inning were unearned, so Soriano\u2019s final line was seven strikeouts throughout his six innings of work, allowing only three hits.\n\nThe Reds bullpen posted 8.1 scoreless innings of work after Montas departed. The Angels once again out-hit the Reds 6-5, but their lack of clutch hitting\u2014especially with runners in scoring position\u2014cost them in the latter stages of the game. RHP Alexis Diaz pitched a clean ninth inning to complete the sweep over the Angels.\n\nLos Angeles returned home to play the Orioles, looking to start the homestand off strong. LHP Reid Detmers, who has had a phenomenal start to the 2024 season, took the ball for the Halos and looked vulnerable for the first time this year. Through seven innings of work, the lefty allowed six hits and four runs. Detmers also allowed three walks and only struck out four in his outing.\n\nThe Orioles sent out RHP Albert Suarez, making his second start for the O\u2019s after a long absence from MLB. In 5.2 innings, Suarez held the Angels scoreless and it took until the seventh inning for the Angels to put a run on the board. Adell broke up the shutout with a solo blast, followed by a Nolan Schanuel RBI single.\n\nIn the bottom of the ninth against RHP Craig Kimbrel, the Angels loaded the bases for their superstar Mike Trout, but the slugger went down looking to end the game, leaving the Angels a 4-2 loss. Trout has been exceptional at the plate this year, but his one struggle has come with runners in scoring position, as most of his home runs have been solo shots.\n\nThe main struggle offensively for the Angels hasn\u2019t necessarily been the lack of total offense, but specifically hitting with runners in scoring position. Looking to end their skid, the Angels came out firing in game two of the series against RHP Grayson Rodriguez. Manager Ron Washington moved Trout into the leadoff spot for the first time since 2020 and it paid off. The centerfielder went deep to lead off the bottom of the first.\n\nThe Angels continued to apply pressure, scoring in each of the next three innings as well. Rodriguez finished the game with an ugly line of 4.1 innings pitched, 11 hits and seven earned runs. RHP Griffin Canning got the start for the Halos and provided a solid outing. He fired five innings of three-run ball, allowing five hits and striking out four.\n\nTrout\u2019s leadoff homer aside, the bottom half of the lineup were the main producers in Tuesday\u2019s game, as Logan O\u2019Hoppe, Jo Adell, Luis Rengifo and Zach Neto all finished with multi-hit games. This was especially relieving for Neto, as he\u2019s had a slow start to the season and the Angels hope this will be the boost of confidence that will propel him to a strong sophomore season.\n\nRHP Carlos Estevez came on to close, and pitched a clean ninth, striking out two and sealing the 7-4 victory for the Angels. Looking to take the series from the powerhouse Orioles, the Angels turned to Anderson and he once again delivered in his turn through the rotation. Although the lefty didn\u2019t pitch deep into Wednesday\u2019s game, Anderson hurled five innings and surrendered just two earned runs to the O\u2019s, in addition to striking out seven.\n\nOnce Anderson exited, the Angels went to LHP Jose Suarez out of the bullpen and he surrendered three runs right out of the gate to put the Orioles up 5-0. The main headline for the series finale was RHP Dean Kremer for the Orioles. The righty struck out 10 Halos in his 5.1 innings of work, allowing only two runs in a dominant start.\n\nThe lone hiccup came against Mike Trout, in which the centerfielder went deep for his tenth homer of the year. Taylor Ward continued his hot streak as well, clubbing a home run off of RHP Jacob Webb in the sixth. The Angels added another in the eighth, with a solo homer from Zach Neto to make it a 6-4 game.\n\nIn the bottom of the ninth, the Angels would come within one off an O\u2019Hoppe RBI groundout and put the tying run on base in the form of Jo Adell. In a controversial ending, Adell was caught stealing to give the Orioles a 6-5 win, but replay review showed that Adell had clearly beaten the throw to second.\n\nA tough ending to Wednesday\u2019s game booked another series loss for the Angels, their second in a row. On Friday, the Angels will welcome the Twins into town, in which Patrick Sandoval will get the start for game one. The lefty currently sports a 6.45 ERA and he\u2019ll face a Twins lineup that has plenty of power.\n\nIf the Angels want to stay competitive, they\u2019ll have to start hitting consistently with runners in scoring position. The AL West continues to look like an open door for any team, and if the Angels can ride a hot streak into May and June, they can look to add another piece at the deadline to hopefully make them a true playoff contender.\n\nUntil then, the starting pitching will also have to pick up the slack, as outside of Anderson and Detmers, this rotation has struggled to eat innings and give the bullpen a day off.\n```"}

(AP/David J. Phillip)\n\nBy Tripp Carrington April 28, 2024 at 2:05 pm PDT\n\nIt\u2019s not too early to start talking about next year\u2019s college basketball season, right? Right? Granted, the transfer portal is still active and teams aren\u2019t close to finalizing their rosters, but we now know enough to make an educated guess of how things will play out... either that, or I\u2019m looking for any excuse to keep talking about college ball. Here\u2019s a 100% accurate list of who will make next season\u2019s Final Four:\n\nSouth Region - Duke Blue Devils\nThe last time the Duke Blue Devils made the Final Four was in 2022, when Coach K lost to arch-rival North Carolina in his final game. Fans of most programs would still be celebrating a trip to the Final Four as recent as two or three years ago, but the clock is already ticking for blue-blooded Duke and Coach K\u2019s replacement, Jon Scheyer. Despite winning the ACC Tournament in his debut season and advancing to the Elite Eight in year two, Scheyer will need to win national titles to appease his school\u2019s fanbase.\n\nThe Blue Devils are losing their two leading scorers (Kyle Filipowski and Jared McCain) to the NBA Draft, and their third and fourth leading scorers, Jeremy Roach and Mark Mitchell, are committed to new schools (Baylor and Missouri, respectively) after entering the transfer portal. However, Duke\u2019s incoming freshman class features an absurd five top-20 recruits, including the No. 1 ranked freshman in the country: Cooper Flagg. The projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft won\u2019t turn 18 until December, but his 6-9 frame paired with his guard-like shooting and handles firmly place him in the mix to be one of the most impactful players in the country next season.\n\nIn Paolo Banchero\u2019s lone season with Duke, he was named All-ACC, took Duke to the Final Four and went No. 1 in the NBA Draft. Flagg, who will be joined by 7-1 freshman center Khaman Maluach, will be the next one-and-done freshman to lead Duke to great success.\n\nMidwest Region - Houston Cougars\nUnlike Duke, the Houston Cougars would theoretically reach the Final Four based on roster continuity. The Cougars will likely lose Big 12 Player of the Year, Jamal Shead, to the NBA Draft. However, Coach Kelvin Sampson retained eight major contributors from last year\u2019s squad and secured a commitment from junior guard Milos Uzan from Oklahoma.\n\nMore importantly, Sampson\u2019s Houston teams are consistently the best on the defensive side of the ball. In their first year in the Big 12, the Cougars won an outright regular season title and dominated a difficult schedule. Starting guard LJ Cryer averaged 15.5 points per game last season. If he doesn\u2019t have to share the backcourt scoring load with Shead, look for Cryer\u2019s scoring output to increase while he maintains his absurd defensive impact. Cryer won the national title with Baylor in his freshman year. Can he cut down the nets with Houston as a senior?\n\nWest Region - Connecticut Huskies\nCan Connecticut reach three Final Fours in a row? The Huskies made history this season by becoming the first team to win back-to-back NCAA Tournament titles since Florida in 2006 and 2007. If they advance to the Final Four in 2025, they would be the first team to play in three consecutive national semifinals since Michigan State from 1999-2001.\n\nCoach Dan Hurley is bringing back Alex Karaban, who averaged 13.3 points and 5.1 rebounds per game last season. Karaban\u2019s experience in the last two championship runs makes him an invaluable returner and the Huskies will be bolstered by some new faces, too. Namely, Tarris Reed, a transfer from Michigan. Reed only averaged nine points per contest in his sophomore campaign, but he is one of the best defensive forwards in the country. He has the speed and length to fit perfectly into Connecticut\u2019s high energy style of play.\n\nThe Huskies have looked so dominant in the past two years that another Final Four seems more likely than not.\n\nEast Region - North Carolina Tar Heels\nNorth Carolina\u2019s exit from the 2024 NCAA Tournament was as heartbreaking as they come. In the Sweet Sixteen against Alabama, the Tar Heels\u2019 ACC Player of the Year, RJ Davis, had the coldest shooting night of his career, going 0-for-9 from beyond the arc. Still, North Carolina only lost by two points behind late-game heroics by Alabama\u2019s Grant Nelson.\n\nLegendary Tar Heel Armando Bacot is out of college eligibility, but Davis will return to try and avenge his critical off-night. In addition, Coach Hubert Davis is bringing in one of the best recruiting classes in the country. Ian Jackson and Drake Powell are both McDonald\u2019s All-Americans and their presence on the roster will give North Carolina a lethal blend of young talent and experienced leadership.\n\nHad they avoided just one of their mistakes against the Crimson Tide, it\u2019s likely that the Tar Heels would have won their region in 2024. Next season, they have a great shot at returning to the Final Four for the first time since 2022.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/28/kings-oilers-dismantle-la-in-disastrous-game-3/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Home ice was a nonfactor for the Kings in Game 3, losing to the Oilers in a 6-1 blowout. Edmonton\u2019s offense, which has been electric all series, scored three times in the first period, putting the game out of reach from the moment the puck dropped from the referee\u2019s hands. Winger Zach Hyman scored twice in the game, including the first goal, bringing his total up to six in the series. Two more goals followed Hyman\u2019s initial lamp-lighting, as centers Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid hammered the Los Angeles defense to help Edmonton run away with the game. The Kings\u2019 penalty kill struggled throughout the game, allowing three power-play goals. Drew Doughty finally put LA on the board in the second period, catching goalie Stuart Skinner out of position to bring the deficit back to two. But the Oilers knew that they couldn\u2019t become complacent and continued to overwhelm netminder Cam Talbot and company. Drew Doughty with goals in back-to-back games. \n\nEdmonton proceeded to score three unanswered goals, including two on the power play. Hyman and Draisaitl each tallied their second goal of the game in the third period. Winger Evander Kane also connected for his first goal of the postseason just two minutes after Doughty\u2019s, which kick-started another wave of momentum that the Oilers rode. \u201cWe were not there, and they were more hungry and they had more chances,\u201d said winger Kevin Fiala. The Oilers\u2019 power play is now a whopping seven-for-15 in the series, as the Kings\u2019 special teams, which was a strong suit for the team during the regular season, just hasn\u2019t been able to contain Edmonton\u2019s high-functioning and deep offensive unit. \u201cWe have to stay out of the box, obviously, and we just need to play our game,\u201d said defenseman Matt Roy. McDavid\u2019s three-point night brought his series total to nine, with one goal and eight assists. Five Oilers have tallied at least four points in the series thus far, as the team\u2019s offense has been able to exploit Los Angeles\u2019 lacking defense with ease. LA also went zero-for-five in Game 3 on power play chances. While the Kings\u2019 offense came alive in the first two games, in Game 3, Edmonton was simply one step ahead of interim head coach Jim Hiller\u2019s bunch. The Kings have yet to score on the power play this postseason. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find a way,\u201d said Hiller. \u201cI thought we did a pretty good job in Game 2, so we\u2019ll just have to make sure we do that same job in Game 4.\u201d Game 4 will also be at Crypto.com Arena and will be a must-win game for the Kings with the series shifting back to Edmonton afterwards. But LA will need to adjust to the Oilers\u2019 offense early if it wants to even the series. The Kings\u2019 forechecking was not up to par in Game 3, which proved costly. The Kings\u2019 offense will also need to wake up and produce at an even higher level than it did in Games 1 and 2 to avoid a series loss to the Oilers for the third straight year. Good discipline will also be an important factor in limiting the Oilers\u2019 extra-man chances. Game 3 was captain An\u017ee Kopitar\u2019s 95th career playoff game, which is a Kings franchise record. The team will need his veteran leadership to help right the ship in Game 4, which will begin on Sunday at 7:30 p.m. as Los Angeles tries to recover from a blunderous first postseason performance in front of its home fans.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/28/clippers-la-falls-in-game-3/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 After the LA Clippers dominated Game 1 of their first-round series against the Dallas Mavericks last Sunday, the team seemed to be just fine without Kawhi Leonard in the starting lineup. Even though both Luca Doncic and Kyrie Irving had 30-point games, five Clippers scored 13 or more points as they went on to a double-digit win to open the series. In Game 2, both teams put on a defensive showing, as neither team surpassed 100 points, and the storyline was practically the same. Doncic and Irving led the Mavericks offensively, and the Clippers got significant contributions from several players. Both teams scored the same number of field goals, but the Mavericks had the edge from beyond the arc as they recorded six more three-pointers than the Clippers and bested LA 96-93. The series then headed to Dallas, where the Mavericks took Game 3 by a score of 101 to 90. In Leonard\u2019s return to the lineup after being out for nine games due to knee inflammation, the Clippers scored 25 fewer points than their season average, which can be chalked up to the Mavericks\u2019 solid defense. Paul George struggled offensively after getting himself in foul trouble and even though Norman Powell contributed 21 points off the bench, the loss proved just how much the Clippers need their star players to contribute. \u201c[Leonard\u2019s] trying to find his way back,\u201d said Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue after the loss. \u201cWe\u2019re just managing. He has knee inflammation, and so being smart, making sure we\u2019re doing right by Kawhi and seeing how he feels and managing from there. He\u2019s still trying to find his rhythm.\u201d Compared to previous seasons, the Clippers have been fortunate with injuries this year up until recently. Besides when Ivica Zubac missed about a month starting in mid-January, the Clippers\u2019 starting lineup has been healthy for practically the entire regular season. James Harden and George have both played in 70 or more games. Leonard played in more games this year than he had since his second-to-last season with the Spurs back in 2017, but the timing of his injury forced the Clippers to make adjustments that haven\u2019t gone too well thus far. Leonard\u2019s injury has put more pressure on the rest of the team to score, and most of that burden has fallen on George and Harden. George\u2019s early foul trouble in Game 3, which forced him to sit for extended periods, increased that pressure even further. \u201cHe\u2019s one of our best players, so we can\u2019t have those fouls, we gotta keep [him] on the floor,\u201d said Lue. \u201cIt\u2019s like a trickle down effect, if he gets early fouls, now James [Harden] has to play 44 minutes, now he\u2019s not [himself].\u201d The Clippers are loaded with veteran talent, but have struggled this year against some of the league\u2019s youngest teams, like the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Oklahoma City Thunder. Those teams are able to get out quicker in transition and expose the Clippers by forcing turnovers from which LA often can\u2019t recover. The Mavericks\u2019 youth combined with their solid defensive efficiency is making it tough for the Clippers offensively as they forced LA into 19 turnovers in Game 3. \u201cThose are things we got to get better with but with the game having 19 turnovers for 29 points, especially on the road, it\u2019s hard to win a game like that in the playoffs, especially when you\u2019re struggling to score,\u201d said Lue. \u201cSo we got to be better with that and we got to play faster.\u201d The Mavericks also dominated the interior, scoring lob after lob while also outperforming the Clippers in paint scoring 52-38. Dallas has multiple options at the 4 and 5 spots and Mavericks\u2019 head coach Jason Kidd has found a solid rotation between Daniel Gafford, Dereck Lively and PJ Washington. The Clippers struggle to match up against those players, and when players like George get into foul trouble that opens up the floor for the Mavericks even more. The Game 3 loss makes Game 4 a must-win for the Clippers, as they cannot afford to return home down 3-1 in the series. The series has been as tight as was expected, as Game 2 was decided by just three points and even though Game 3 was ultimately decided in the second quarter, when the Clippers were outscored 36-18, the game was tight for the entire second half. Now that Leonard has been given the time to readjust and the Clippers can reset heading into Game 4, Lue remains optimistic about the Clippers\u2019 chances. \u201cWe got to understand that we got to play different than what [we\u2019ve] done in the past,\u201d said Lue. \u201cThe way they\u2019re playing us, we have the blueprint of how they\u2019re playing us so we got to do things differently and we got to do things better. I wasn\u2019t questioning our guys\u2019 fight and what they\u2019re trying to do but when things get hard you can\u2019t take it on yourself and try to do it another way.\u201d Tip-off for Game 4 is set for 12:30 p.m. on Sunday in Dallas.\n```"}

So, it just felt normal to be a part of that sort of scene.\u201d\n\nWith a support system of her family and hometown backing her alongside a strong love and ambition for basketball \u2014 the world was her oyster. Things started getting serious for Padilla later in elementary school, as she began traveling across the U.S. for tournaments.\n\n\u201cBut I think, you know, as I grew up, [I] obviously thought more about my future. I thought basketball is not only a way to obviously express my love for the game, but to get me to some incredible places like [going] to an Ivy League school,\u201d Padilla said.\n\nHowever, Padilla also faced certain challenges surrounding her identity. Growing up as an Asian American athlete, she had to deal with unconscious bias playing a role during the recruiting process.\n\n\u201cI feel like myself and probably a lot of other Asian American basketball players don\u2019t necessarily pass the eye test. I think subconsciously, that affects a lot of how coaches and schools perceive you,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cNot to say that maybe my process would have been any different if I was someone else, but you just never know.\n\nPadilla didn\u2019t let these challenges get to her and simply focused on herself. She worked hard \u2014 and her hard work definitely paid off. Padilla was a four-year starter and three-time team captain at Bishop Montgomery High School, where she racked up 1,907 total career points and numerous All-League and All-CIF awards. Alongside her basketball career, Padilla graduated with a 4.5 GPA and was valedictorian of her class.\n\nAfter high school, Padilla ventured off to the East Coast, where she spent four years at Penn. She finished her time at the program with 1,355 points\u2014ranking her as the seventh all-time top scorer in Penn history \u2014 over 1,000 minutes played, three First Team All-Ivy selections and two Big 5 First Team selections.\n\nPadilla made her way home to Los Angeles in 2023, spending her final season of eligibility at USC. She made it to 1,500 total career points, won a Pac-12 Championship and helped USC to its first Elite Eight appearance since 1994.\n\n\u201cLooking back, obviously, only one team really ends their season on a high note. And that\u2019s if you win the championship, so obviously a little disappointed that we couldn\u2019t get to go any further. But just, like, what an amazing season,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cI\u2019m sad it was only a one-year thing, but I made memories for life. And I just [have] nothing but gratitude about this whole experience.\u201d\n\nBeyond the court, Padilla has made waves in the Asian American community as a Filipina basketball player. She has been featured on pages revolving around Asian Americans in sports like @amaznhq and @filipinosinthe6ix, alongside publications like Complex Philippines. In the comments, fellow Filipinos and Asian Americans have showered her with support.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably one of the most underrepresented demographics in college basketball. So I think, obviously, you kind of stand out in that sense and from that, I think I got a lot of exposure. [Through] the pages like AMAZN [HQ], people were able to learn more about my story,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cFilipinos and Asian American communities really rally behind players in that sense, and I think that gave an extra layer to playing; it was not only to compete, but to also represent something that was bigger than myself.\u201d\n\nBeing able to serve as a voice for Filipinos and Asian Americans as a basketball player means a lot for Padilla, who grew up without seeing that much representation in the sport.\n\n\u201cI think because growing up there were not a lot of people to look up to. I remember really looking up to Jamie Hagiya, who was a basketball player here [at USC] in the 2000s ... but there\u2019s a very small minority,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cI think the game is really changing. There\u2019s a lot more recognizable Asian talent, especially in the Ivy League and in Division I in general ... I\u2019m glad because I think it\u2019s changing the narrative as to what we can do and what we can achieve.\u201d\n\nPadilla has also dedicated herself toward giving a voice to student athletes all across America. Inspired by Derek Jeter\u2019s website, The Players\u2019 Tribune, Padilla created The Sideline Post, where student-athletes at the collegiate level are able to use their own voice to tell their own stories. The stories touch on topics such as mental health, stereotypes, coach-player dynamics and more.\n\nAs she goes onto the next step of her life, Padilla maintains her love of the game, along with countless accolades in both basketball and academics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known for a while that this season was going to be the closing chapter of my basketball career. And what a way to go out. I think a lot of things on my bucket list \u2014 basketball-wise \u2014 were checked off, and I felt really fulfilled in this entire experience,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna start working, but I hope to stay involved in the basketball community in any way. It\u2019s been a big part of my life and I don\u2019t want it to leave.\u201d\n\nFor aspiring Asian American athletes and student athletes in general, Padilla emphasizes the importance of being true to yourself.\n\n\u201cAlong this whole process, embrace who you are. I think a lot of the time, it\u2019s easy to look over, but embracing your culture, embracing who you are plays a big role in how you stand out,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cI think at the end of the day, everyone who\u2019s trying to get to the Division I level is talented ... [But how] you can be as a teammate, who you can be as a friend is also super important.\u201d\n\nWhile Padilla will no longer be making 3-pointers in the Galen Center, there\u2019s no doubt she\u2019ll make it in life.

{"key": "/2024/04/26/why-you-might-not-see-your-favorite-player-in-the-wnba/", "response": "```\nWhy you might not see your favorite player in the WNBA\n\nAs WNBA teams gear up for the season, recently drafted players \u2014 including a pair of former Trojans \u2014 face intense competition and minimal roster spots.\n\nDespite getting drafted in the third round of the 2024 WNBA Draft, McKenzie Forbes might not make it on the opening-day roster. (Photo by Shantala Muruganujan)\n\nBy Mia Nu\u00f1ez April 26, 2024 at 5:28 pm PDT\n\nA boom in women\u2019s college basketball is making WNBA ticket prices soar. Fans are eager to see their favorite players playing professionally, but what they don\u2019t know is that they might not get the chance. Players got drafted to their new teams during the WNBA Draft on April 15, creating exciting moments for fans and players alike across the country. But there\u2019s a quick turnaround, because that spot isn\u2019t guaranteed and the draftees need to fight for it at training camp, which starts almost two weeks later on April 28. It\u2019s possible that half of the draftees won\u2019t make a team. Last year, only 15 of the 36 draftees made a roster.\n\nThis is because of the lack of teams and the small number of players that can be on a roster. Additionally, the WNBA doesn\u2019t have a developmental league like the G League in the NBA. The 12 WNBA teams are only allowed a maximum of 12 roster spots. All teams are expected to have their final rosters in by May 13. So, tensions are high and competition is hard, as draftees not only compete against the players who were on the team last year, but also with other new draftees and those who got invites to training camp.\n\nThere\u2019s so many reasons a player gets cut; it doesn\u2019t mean that a player isn\u2019t good. When players get cut, they still have the chance to get signed by another team or they can play overseas. Many WNBA players already play overseas in the offseason to supplement their meager league salary. Some players choose not to play overseas and take the year off to keep developing, like former South Carolina guard Brea Beal. She was the No. 24 pick in the second round by the Minnesota Lynx in the 2023 draft. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t make the team, but her comeback is anticipated this year, as she got a training camp invite with the Las Vegas Aces.\n\nThe competition is steep, though. Not only will Beal be competing for a spot on the reigning champions, but she\u2019s competing against amazing players like Syracuse guard Dyasia Fair, Iowa guard Kate Martin and nine-year veteran Bria Hartley. Looking at the Aces roster, there are 10 players who are most likely going to make the team. These are their stars, like Kelsey Plum and A\u2019ja Wilson, or other players who have proven they\u2019re crucial to the team. That means that there\u2019s only two open roster spots.\n\nMaking the cut for a WNBA team isn\u2019t as easy as being a good shooter or a dominant defender. For a team like the Aces, they prioritize team chemistry above all. So, they might take a player who needs some more development but has chemistry with the team.\n\nOther notable players who face not making a team are USC\u2019s very own McKenzie Forbes and Kaitlyn Davis. Forbes got drafted to the Los Angeles Sparks, and Davis is headed to the New York Liberty. It\u2019ll be an uphill battle for both of them if they hope to make their rosters. The Sparks barely missed the playoffs last year, so they\u2019re looking to get back to a championship-contending team. They proved how serious they were by drafting Stanford forward Cameron Brink and Tennessee guard Rickea Jackson.\n\nForbes\u2019 case to make the roster revolves around her two-way impact. Forbes is a clutch defender and a great scorer coming off her best season yet, averaging 14.3 points per game. She has shown that she can fire up a crowd as well, so she would be a great addition to the squad. If she doesn\u2019t make it, it\u2019ll likely be because of the other first-round draftees.\n\nDavis will be battling as well. The Liberty were the runner up for last year\u2019s championship, so they want players that are ready to contribute right now. Davis will be battling with players signed to training camp \u2014 one of them a former Trojan guard in Okako Adika. Additionally, she\u2019ll go up against the three other draftees. There\u2019s optimism for Davis making the team, since she\u2019s already an older and more experienced player than some of the others. If selected, she can make an impact for the Liberty off the bench and can help them finally win a championship.\n\nThere have been proposed solutions to fix the issue of having a lot of star power, but nowhere for the players to go. The most common solution is to expand the rosters and create more teams. Good news is, the WNBA is already adding a new team next year in Golden State, and the league hopes to have 16 teams by 2028. While it\u2019s not known what cities are getting a team, some cities that commissioner Cathy Engelbert has been throwing around are Philadelphia, Toronto, Nashville and Oregon. Still, 2028 is years away and there needs to be a faster expansion for the WNBA, which is growing at a fast pace. The addition of teams is long overdue and, hopefully soon, the commissioner signs off on bigger rosters to prevent talent from leaving the WNBA.\n```"}

Or, for university students, it's the celebration marking the formal end to their rigorous college experience and the beginning of their post-graduate lives. Whether they are starting a full-time job, continuing their education or unsure of what is coming next, commencement ceremonies are traditionally a rite of passage for undergraduate students to be recognized for their four years of hard work. But this year's graduating cohort at USC will receive no such closure.\n\nThe university announced via email on Thursday that the main commencement ceremony would no longer take place as scheduled. The ceremony, which according to the announcement, sees around 65,000 graduates and their families in attendance each year, will instead be replaced with a performance by the Trojan Marching Band and various other small events \u2013 unspecified as of Friday, April 26 \u2013 throughout the day.\n\nThe announcement closely follows other major restructuring choices, with the valedictorian, Asna Tabassum's, speech cancellation and no external speakers or honorary degrees to be awarded. The lack of a main commencement ceremony has turned the \"normal\" USC graduation experience \u2013 a dream for many \u2013 on its head.\n\nThe decision to cancel the main event comes after members of USC pro-Palestine organization Divest From Death were forcibly expelled from campus Wednesday by Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and Department of Public Safety (DPS) personnel. The multi-hour long standoff resulted in close to 100 arrests.\n\nThe satellite ceremonies, during which students will get the opportunity to walk across the stage and collect their commemorative diplomas, are still slated for May 10. But many are still dismayed by the most recent news.\n\nThe lack of a proper commencement comes as a particular 'disappointment' for the class of 2024 \u2013 composed of students who did not have normal high school graduation ceremonies due to Covid-19 restrictions. Taylor Marie Contarino, a pre-law track progressive degree candidate who is graduating in May 2024 with her bachelor's degree in journalism and a minor in music industry, said her high school graduation in 2020 was particularly upsetting. She graduated through a pre-recorded Youtube video.\n\n\"I was raised by a single mom, so, it's just difficult because I was so excited for my mom to see me graduate. I was so excited for my grandma to see me graduate,\" Contarino said. \"Graduating high school meant a lot to me. I know it's not the biggest deal to other people, but it meant so much to me.\"\n\nSoley Liati is a business major, emphasizing on economics and finance, graduating in May 2024. Similar to Contarino, her high school graduation ceremony was a Zoom slideshow.\n\n\"It was so anti-climatic. [...] It was on Zoom, and all they did was a slideshow [and] each student got a slide,\" Liati said. \"It felt very sad, but we still tried to make the best out of it.\"\n\nJournalism student and graduating senior Zifei Zhang had a drive-through high school graduation ceremony, a style of commencement popular during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in spring 2020.\n\n\"It was just really disappointing because I wanted it to be like a moment where I got to celebrate with my teachers, to celebrate with my peers and actually get to feel a sense of community after four years of suffering, and [...] getting through it together,\" Zhang said of the experience.\n\nAlthough Liati was unsure if she would be attending the main commencement at USC, the decision being made for her by the outright cancellation was upsetting.\n\n\"You only graduate college once, at least [for] undergrad. Of course I want to [enjoy] our special day. The main commencement is going to make you feel special, from all the speeches to just seeing everyone come together,\" Liati said. \"It's very emotional and beautiful, because you're like, 'all my hard work is finally paying off!' So, it's kind of sad that there's less events that [will] celebrate the graduating seniors.\"\n\nSome students continue to speak out in support of all groups who are still protesting on campus amid additional campus safety measures; they believe that commencement should not be canceled due to the \"security concerns\" expressed by the university.\n\n\"Just because there are students who are exercising their right to free speech [...], it doesn't mean that everybody should be punished,\" Zhang said. \"Students deserve to have their right to free speech [...] and students also deserve to have a beautiful graduation that celebrates who they are.\"\n\nIn his April 15 announcement, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Andrew T. Guzman stated that the decision to cancel Asna Tabassum's speech was not related to freedom of speech, going on to say \"there is no free-speech entitlement to speak at a commencement.\" Other students have taken issue with this.\n\n\"I want to acknowledge all of my peers who are out there standing up for what they believe in [...] I want to just say that first, I know that there's people on the other side of the world dying and it would be naive of me not to acknowledge them,\" Contarino said addressing the decisions having been influenced by controversies around 'free speech on campus.'\"\n\n\"At the end of the day, [...] I would love to have a commencement ceremony. Because it does mean a lot to me as, again, I'm [my mom's] first kid to go to school and one of the first in our family to go away to college.\"\n\nGiven the speed with which USC has announced changes to the commencement day schedule \u2013 with the rescinding of valedictorian and honorary degree recipients' respective speeches, and, most recently, the outright cancellation of the main ceremony all coming within only two weeks \u2013 some graduates are concerned that the satellite ceremonies could be in danger as well.\n\n\"I just hope they don't cancel our satellite graduations because that is what is most important to me, especially because I missed out on my high school graduation,\" Liati said.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, USC President Carol Folt released a statement in support of the university's collaboration with LAPD and DPS on protesters \u2013 and doubled down on the decision to cancel the main commencement ceremony.\n\n\"[...] We remain focused on what commencement means for all our graduates. This is especially true for our seniors who did not have a high school graduation and spent their first university year online,\" Folt wrote. The statement went on to say that \"new activities, surprises, and celebrations\" are being planned ahead of May 10 without diving into specific details.\n\nDespite the seemingly concrete changes to the commencement docket, some still hold out hope that the main commencement ceremony will be reinstated.\n\n\"I want [the] main commencement to come back. And you know, if there's protests, even better! Student voices deserve to be heard. Also, the valedictorians and salutatorians, I don't know if they'll be able to speak, and that's even worse, because they've worked so hard,\" Zhang said.\n\nThe second graduation ceremony snub in four years has left many 2024 graduates disillusioned with the administration; some students are directing their frustration with the university's recent choices toward Folt and Guzman.\n\n\"You have not served the needs and the wants of the student body. [...] You have enacted violence against the students. And that is not your job \u2013 you should step down,\" Zhang said.\n\nUSC's recent manner in handling dissent has also negatively affected students' personal relationship with the university.\n\n\"I don't think I will ever be active as an alum, ever. I've already had problems with USC [...] but seeing what has happened on campus [now], I'm never going to donate,\" Zhang said.\n\n\"This is not an institution that I believe in anymore.\"```"}

A DPS officer told me when I questioned what the ID\u2019s were for, [...] \u2018it was in case they decided to take academic action.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis afternoon around 200 people came together for a prayer and peaceful demonstration. Unlike the events on Wednesday where 93 protestors were arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department, there were no DPS or LAPD officers present on site.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve all been released. I believe they have trials in mid May. The charge I believe is trespassing, criminal trespassing,\u201d according to a media liaison for the divestment coalition who requested anonymity due to safety concerns.\n\nSome protestors encircled around Founders Park to shield Muslim students who chose to conduct their weekly Friday prayer ritual at the site of the encampment today. \u201cTo the people that are around us right now, that was the most beautiful thing,\u201d said a protester speaking through a megaphone after the prayer ended. \u201cThis is the real America.\u201d\n\nFollowing the prayer, those involved continue calling for USC to divest. These chants included \u201cUSC what do you say? How many kids have you killed today?\u201d and \u201cThe students united will never be defeated.\u201d Signs were scattered across the perimeter. Some read \u201cStudents and workers unite,\u201d and \u201cFree Palestine: Disclose Divest Defend.\u201d\n\nOne person standing at the protest held up a piece of paper with an emergency contact QR code in case students were arrested again. \u201cI felt compelled to join because I want to.

The members informally resigned April 19 after penning a letter that urged USC President Carol Folt to reinstate valedictorian Asna Tabassum\u2019s commencement speech commencement after it was revoked over \u201csafety concerns.\u201d The committee said it was not told ahead of time about the decision or given a meeting after it was announced that Tabassum would not be allowed to speak.\n\nThey were granted a Zoom meeting with Provost Andrew Guzman along with safety and risk assurance administrator Erroll Southers who said in an April 15 email that the decision to axe Asna\u2019s speech was necessary to \u201cmaintain the safety\u201d of the campus. According to Dr. Sherman Jackson, a professor of religion, ethnicity and American studies, the meeting provided no other insight into the university\u2019s decision, which Jackson and the other committee members say did not have satisfactory reasoning behind it.\n\n\u201cThe substance of this decision totally undermined the purpose of the committee,\u201d Jackson said at the press conference. \u201cThe manner in which this decision was taken suggested that the committee itself had no real standing with the university.\u201d\n\nCommittee members, faculty, students and members of the media attend a press conference held by the resigning members of the Committee on Muslim Life at USC. (Photo by Zain Khan)\n\nPresident Folt refused to acquiesce to the demands of the ACML, leading to the majority of the committee\u2019s resignation. Jihad Turk, a now former member of the ACML who resigned Friday, said the committee had a meeting with Folt about reinstating Tabassum\u2019s speech where she refused their request.\n\nThe ACML was founded in January of 2023 by USC administration as a way to \u201cbe in conversation with the USC administration about how to create a more inclusive campus environment for Muslims,\u201d according to Dr. Evelyn Alsultan, an associate professor of American studies and ethnicity at Dornsife. Less than a year later that board, which was made up of 19 members including students, staff and faculty, is now in jeopardy.\n\nThe committee had been working on providing university administration with recommendations to address Islamophobia across campus, however after the announcement that Tabassum would not be allowed to speak, the committee quickly turned its attention. The school\u2019s subsequent decision to uninvite the other mainstage commencement speakers, proved to only compound the issue according to the committee.\n\n\u201cThis moment of representation made [Muslim students] understand the meaning of Trojan pride and made them feel seen as a Muslim at USC,\u201d Jackson said, referencing a letter from a student. \u201cUnfortunately, that moment was quickly taken away.\u201d\n\nThe former committee members said Muslims across USC have felt uncomfortable since the war broke out in October, and the revocation of Tabassum\u2019s speech was the last crack in an already deteriorating relationship. Lack of funding for the ACML, and professors\u2019 \u201cignorance\u201d towards Muslims were said to be lingering issues affecting the community.\n\nAlvin Makori, a PhD student studying urban education policy at the Rossier School of Education, said he was opposed to how USC treated its larger Muslim community. \u201cI stand by them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I stand for acknowledging and correcting the injustices that USC has put on specifically us, Asna and the Muslim community on campus as a whole.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Asna\u2019s] cancellation, I think, is a violation of so many things,\u201d said Sarah Gualtieri, a Dornsife professor who attended the press conference in support of those resigning. \u201cA violation of free speech, but also a violation of the ethics of the university.\u201d\n\nGualtieri, who has been with USC for many years, said she has seen a pattern of the school with regard to the Palestinian cause. \u201cI have been here for many years at USC,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I feel like everything that has happened is really part of a long standing pattern, particularly around the suppression of Palestinian human rights on campus.\u201d\n\nJackson went on to say that without communication and a free flowing discourse, a university loses its meaning. \u201cWe fail our students, we fail their parents, we fail our faculty, and we fail everyone who was invested in this university,\u201d he said.\n```"}

(Photo by Nina Moothedath)\n\nBy Nina Moothedath\nApril 26, 2024 at 12:49 pm PDT\n\nThis 1916 song was inspired by Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, and it\u2019s far from the first piece to build off the famous novel. Here at USC, a competition called the Wonderland Awards encourages students to continue drawing inspiration from the author and his works.\n\nTyson Gaskill: We\u2019re in the Horton rare book room and one of the winning entries is right here and it is a sculpture of Queen Victoria made out of playing cards. That\u2019s Tyson Gaskill, executive director of communications and events for USC libraries. We\u2019re in a small reading room in Doheny Library with wooden bookshelves, tables for reading and many books related to Carroll. It\u2019s where anyone can see items in the Cassady Collection, which contestants have to use.\n\nBut despite the common starting point, students take their entries in very different directions. Gaskill: You will have a video going up against a poem against an artwork against, this year, a croquet game. This year, I saw the entries when they came in, and I just started giggling. I was like, where do they come up with this? I mean, never in a million years, would I think to do what they do.\n\nThe Cassady Collection began in 2000 with a donation from George Cassady. I met with the creator of the Wonderland Awards and Cassady\u2019s wife, Linda Cassady, in her L.A. apartment. She remembers how the dedication her late husband had for USC motivated him to create the collection.\n\nLinda Cassady: He felt that he owed them everything, that he\u2019s the person he is because of USC. He wanted to pay that back. No one has done the type of work that he did.\n\nShe turns on a lamp to flip through a thick stack of pages. It\u2019s a catalog they worked on with details about each item for the collection, down to how the pages were cut.\n\nCassady: And so this is about 2,800 pages. In the apartment, there are bookshelves of materials waiting to go through the full cataloging and donation process to join the collection at USC. There\u2019s items ranging from Alice books in every color to illustrations and marionette dolls.\n\nCassady: Oh these are great, let me see if I can get them out. So we have a collection of postcards. OK what do we have here, we have a Japanese book ... woodprints ... calendar. These are plates that were used to produce Alice books.\n\nAfter so much work building the collection, Cassady wanted to make sure students knew about it and used it.\n\nCassady: We were in the Horton Rare Book Room and I said, you know, the students are out there, the books are in here. How do you get them in here? You pay them. And so, the Wonderland Awards began in 2005 and since then, the library has received around 20 to 40 submissions each year.\n\nJudges use a point rubric to narrow those down to two winners, with $3,000 awarded to first place and $1,500 for second place.\n\nCassady: And you think you\u2019ve seen it all, but you haven\u2019t. Every year there\u2019s something that you go, \u201cI have not seen this before.\u201d But we still go through every one of them because people can die on the sword for the one that they love. And we\u2019ve asked the students, should we have categories instead of making the haikus go against 120 page script, and they go no, they like going one on one. They want to be the winner.\n\nAt this year\u2019s award reception students looked through the many entries, such as a colorful, illustrated tarot deck; a set of themed stamps and postcards; and VR art piece students could step through.\n\nThe winners were a mini-golf course designed by themed entertainment students and an essay annotating one of Carrol\u2019s poems from a legal perspective. The author of the first-place essay, Elijah Granet, said he began work on it back at the beginning of the school year.\n\nGranet: I thought, here\u2019s an area where I can find depths and layers and bring them out. Actually show that there\u2019s these jokes and brilliant little humor in it.\n\nContestants come from many academic fields, and don\u2019t even have to be from USC. For some, working on submissions is a welcome break from coursework.\n\nGranet: So it helped that because I\u2019m in law school, there was always something more boring I had to do and this became my carrot whenever I had the stick of, oh, gosh, I\u2019ve got to read about civil procedure, but then I get to do pig law.\n\nIn addition to the two winners, each year a third student receives the Bellman Award, for an entry with creative risks or qualities the point system doesn\u2019t recognize. Will Domke won it this year for a short film of performance art where actors dressed as chess pieces in the neighborhood around USC.\n\nDomke said mishaps like getting lost only added to the art.\n\nWill Domke: In the book, like, I revisited passages from it and she gets lost a lot. That\u2019s literally something that happens, so it\u2019s not like, presentational, it\u2019s sort of a lot of it is about accepting just what happens as what happens. I honestly feel like, really fulfilled by it.\n\nBefore research for the film, Domke was very familiar with Carroll\u2019s writing, but not as much with his puzzles and mathematics. Granet also felt his research gave him a new perspective.\n\nGranet: We have original work by Carroll that just keeps you going for hundreds of years, and will never be exhausted, and so I never would have gone to Special Collections in my life if it wasn\u2019t for this, so I\u2019m just really grateful it existed.\n\nFor those behind the award, seeing the interest and dedication students have is a highlight of the competition.\n\nGaskill: That\u2019s what\u2019s so gratifying for us here in the libraries is that we\u2019re seeing students use this collection, doing it in creative academic ways and then, you know, winning. Winning some money for it, which is awesome.\n\nWith this year\u2019s awards over, the libraries will soon start preparations for next year, open to whoever wants to fall down the Lewis Carroll rabbit hole.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Nina Moothedath.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ronda Churchill)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner April 26, 2024 at 12:40 pm PDT\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d is a column by Kasey Kazliner about the National Hockey League. The playoffs this year have been nothing short of exciting so far. From road wins to overtime finishes, the quest for the Stanley Cup is brewing. Although the road ahead is still long and treacherous, it\u2019s never too early to think about the themes materializing amid it all.\n\nTwo star netminders struggle in different ways\n\nThe first round has featured high-flying offense and an abundance of goals. But should offensive units take all the credit, or should they thank certain goaltenders who might be suffering from postseason fatigue? Take Connor Hellebuyck for example. The Jets may have won Game 1 against the Avalanche, but Winnipeg\u2019s Vezina-worthy veteran has allowed 10 goals through two games. With Avs netminder Alexandar Georgiev responding from a blunderous first game and winning Game 2, all of a sudden, Jets fans have a reason to be worried with the series tied and shifting to Colorado. This also comes as a surprise considering Winnipeg swept the season series, blanked the Avalanche 7-0 during the last week of the regular season and won eight straight to close out its schedule. Nonetheless, the playoffs are a whole different landscape, and Colorado might\u2019ve figured out the Jets.\n\nIn Vancouver, the Canucks\u2019 goalie room is insecure, but for a different reason: Thatcher Demko is injured again. The injury is detrimental because Vancouver\u2019s 28-year-old backstop has been a catalyst in the team\u2019s newfound success this season. Without Demko in Game 2, the Canucks allowed four goals \u2014 including three against Casey DeSmith, who posted a lackluster .800 save percentage in the game. Although the series is tied, Vancouver heads to Nashville with major inconsistency between the pipes. During the regular season, the Canucks, who finished with a record of 50-32-9, went a mere 15-9-7 without Demko and didn\u2019t play well without him down the stretch. If the Canucks want to beat the Predators and even sniff a path to the Stanley Cup, they\u2019ll need their offense to carry the load. That didn\u2019t happen in Game 2, when they only posted one goal.\n\nIs Vegas back?\n\nThe hockey world is livid because the Golden Knights are up 2-0 against the West-leading Dallas Stars. Fans have the right to be upset, but Vegas doesn\u2019t care what they think; the Knights have been taking advantage of a cap loophole to bolster their roster and are in position to upset Dallas with the series shifting to Sin City. Both games have been decided by two goals or fewer. Captain Mark Stone, a renowned playoff workhorse, has conveniently returned from long-term injury reserve and hasn\u2019t missed a step. Stone\u2019s lengthy absence allowed Vegas to free up cap room to acquire Noah Hanifin, Tomas Hertl and Anthony Mantha at the trade deadline, which has provided depth and firepower to the team. Hanifin and Hertl have already recorded goals in the series along with Stone. The point is, the Knights look to have brand-new life after finishing the season off rocky. Center Jack Eichel has posted four points in the series thus far and looks to be continuing his success from the end of the regular season into the playoffs. But the Stars should\u2019ve known that Vegas would be a tough matchup. The Golden Knights knocked out Dallas last year and have made significant roster updates since last season\u2019s Cup run. The Stars were able to force a Game 6 following a 3-0 deficit last year, but they\u2019ll need to find a way to light up their deep offense if they want to flip the script this time around.\n\nThe Panthers take command\n\nThe Lightning have owned their upstate rivals in the playoffs for multiple years, so the Panthers going up 3-0 in the series is definitely surprising. And with a Game 4 matchup in Tampa on the horizon, the Lightning\u2019s six-game playoff home skid could continue into a Florida sweep. The chilling part of this series is that Tampa Bay could very well be up 3-0 instead. The first two games ended in one-goal finishes, and while the third concluded in a two-score victory for the Panthers, the Lightning put up a good fight and fell apart in the third period. Game 2 also finished in overtime.\n\nThe series has really come down to Florida netminder Sergei Bobrovsky playing lights-out and making key saves when called upon.\n\nSERGEI BOBROVSKY WITH THE SAVE OF THE PLAYOFFS SO FAR \n\nThe Panthers have a heated history with Tampa Bay and have an additional chip on their shoulders from falling in the Stanley Cup Finals last season. If Florida can make it out of the first round unscathed, it could be a massive threat to whoever comes its way. The Panthers wouldn\u2019t play the New York Rangers next, but if both teams eventually make it to the conference finals, which seems likely, don\u2019t count out Florida to continue the tradition of ruining the Presidents\u2019 Trophy Winner\u2019s season.\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

They spoke about yesterday\u2019s demonstrations, and how the police disbursed them and arrested some 90 people. The faculty at Tommy Trojan made clear that they stand with the students\u2019 right to exercise free speech.\n\nOne speaker talked to Annenberg Media, but only on the condition of anonymity. They do not like the recent decisions, such as canceling the valedictorian\u2019s speech, made by USC leadership.\n\n\"Our group, which is wide ranging and representative of all faculty from different schools, knew what to expect, I think, from the administration, and we\u2019re concerned.

The Jewish holiday of Passover is taking place now and these students set up a large Passover Seder table. It was surrounded by empty chairs, each one to symbolize the hostages whose photos were placed at the table.\n\nRena Harcombe is a student who helped organize this display. Harcombe: \"I\u2019ve been a little more hesitant to spread talking about my views, even though I\u2019m usually very vocal.

I think like if we like speak, and like communicate with each other, like will understand that we\u2019re all we all want the same thing.\"\n\nAnother student, Sabrina Jehan, says there have been some uncomfortable times on campus recently. Jehan: \"It was ostracizing as a Jewish student to pass by and get yelled at. Honestly, it was apparent, I was shocked. So, I think today, we realized after in the wake of what happened yesterday, this display was all the more necessary for our community.\"\n\nOutside of Taper Hall, about 50 students put on what they called a Die-In.

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Susan Nyirenda and Shadi Angotti\nApril 25, 2024 at 9:35 pm PDT\n\nThe NFL\u2019s annual draft is taking place in Detroit today! 257 college football players are hopeful to get drafted into the league, and about 5 or 6 Trojans are expected to become Trojans by the end of Saturday. The biggest Trojan prospect of all is quarterback Caleb Williams. You just heard one of the many amazing plays that Williams made en route to winning the Heisman Trophy in 2022... and now he is widely expected to be the number one overall pick in today\u2019s draft - which belongs to the Chicago Bears - and boy are they excited!\n\nA total of sixteen USC Draft prospects showed off their skills at the Trojans\u2019 Pro Day on March 20 at the Allyson Felix Field. This event was attended by 32 scouts, and represented every NFL team in the league. A few other Trojan prospects are Calen Bullock, Brenden Rice, MarShawn Lloyd, Christian Roland-Wallace and Tahj Washington. Bullock and Roland-Wallace are defensive backs who were a part of a USC defense that was heavily criticized all season long for their tackling woes. Washington and Rice are wide receivers who helped the Trojan offense score 37 passing touchdowns this past season. Rice is the son of NFL Hall of Famer Jerry Rice, who is widely regarded as the best to ever do it at his position. Lloyd was the Trojans\u2019 starting running back this past season and contributed to USC\u2019s 33 rushing touchdowns.\n\nMany expect this to be the most watched NFL draft ever, and you can be a part of the record-breaking viewership. The draft starts tonight at 5 PM Pacific Standard Time but make sure you listen to the rest of what we have to say first.\n```"}

She\u2019s one of the faculty who resigned from the Advisory Committee on Muslim Life at USC, or ACML.\n\nDr. Evelyn Alsultany: If we have no bearing on decisions that impact Muslims at USC, then what is the point of the committee, those of us who resign and refuse to be window dressing for diversity at USC.\n\nUSC President Carol Folt established the ACML was created about a year and a half ago supposedly to help provide solutions for campus Islamophobia and to generally support Muslim students and faculty. The council had 19 members including three students. Of those, 11 members resigned last week to protest the university\u2019s decision to cancel the valedictorian speech slated for graduation by Asna Tabassum, who happens to be Muslim.\n\nDr. Sherman Jackson holds a USC chair in Islamic thought and culture. Dr. Sherman Jackson: The substance of this decision totally undermined the purpose of the committee, which was to promote the general welfare and dignified existence for Muslims across this campus free of discrimination.\n\nJackson, who is one of those ACML members who resigned says the committee was not even notified of the University\u2019s decision before the general public. Jackson: Meanwhile, the manner in which this decision was taken suggested that the committee itself had no real standing with the university.\n\nTo follow up, the committee requested an emergency meeting with President Folt. She could not attend. In her place was Provost Andrew Guzman. Jackson says Guzman just reiterated the points made in the all-University email that announced Tabassum would not speak and said it was because there were security threats.\n\nDr. Jackson says that any threats USC might have received - Jackson: - as a university must be met with a resolve that is at least equal to that of those who have threatened that mission. Otherwise, the bullying mob prevails, the free and robust exchange of ideas dies, and with it, the very reason for our existence as a university, as well as our effectiveness as an educational institution, we fail our students, we fail their parents, we fail our faculty, and we fail everyone who has invested in this university.\n\nLast week, those eleven disheartened members of the Advisory Committee on Muslim Life at USC emailed President Folt that they would resign if Tabassum was not reinstated at valedictorian speaker. They say they received no response.\n\nEx-committee member Professor Alsultany says she and her fellow former committee members will not give up. Evelyn Alsultany: We remain committed to supporting a vibrant Muslim community on campus. We are committed to standing by them and other students, when they speak out against the genocide that has killed over 34,000 people 72% of whom are women and children. We remain committed to stand by them when they are silenced, slandered and being for advocating for Palestinian human rights.\n\nPHD student Alvin Makori studies with some of the faculty who were on the ACML. Alvin Makori: I stand with them, I stand by them. And I stand for acknowledging and correcting the injustices that USC has put on specifically us, Anna, and the Muslim community on campus as a whole ... So I think the community will be stronger than ever in the face of these injustices.\n\nAnd one day, maybe, the Advisory Committee on Muslim Life at USC could come back together. But only if USC makes tangible changes, says Dr. Jackson. Jackson: There\u2019s a really steep incline of trust, rebuilding, to get me for example, to be convinced that it would be worth my while to rejoin the committee. So I\u2019d have to think about exactly what the symbolic or the actual measures that the university could take to prove that trust.\n\nAt today\u2019s press conference, the committee said that today was the first time they had heard from President Carol Folt. They said she emailed that she admires and respects them and she hopes they will reconsider their decisions.\n```"}

Memorial Colisseum as a Heisman Trophy winner for the first time since it was forfeited in 2010. His words at an announcement press conference today were triumphant.\n\nReggie Bush: I\u2019ve always felt like football is the game of life.\n\nBush\u2019s forfeiture closely followed an NCAA investigation that found he had accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars while in college. Collegiate athletes were barred from collecting merchandising or game revenue until 2021 - when the Supreme Court stepped in - and ruled that players could be compensated for their service.\n\nThe Heisman Trust, a governing body in charge of the reward, rolled back their decision Wednesday following what they called, \u201cfundamental changes in college athletics.\u201d\n\nBush spoke about the importance of integrity for high-level athletes after taking the podium at the conference.\n\nBush: You can\u2019t get to this or a national championship by cheating. You can\u2019t. It takes a team of strong-minded people fighting for the same goal, working together. It takes coaches, it takes players, front office. It\u2019s an entire team that goes into winning and being successful on the football field.\n\nBush also explained how the trophy mirrors the conflicts of his football career, and how the field conditioned him for the fight to clear his name.\n\nBush: Even through fighting for this Heisman trophy - knowing that I just had to keep fighting, keep going, keep believing, never give up - you know all the things that they teach you in football. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s unique about this situation. You learn so much of how to fight on that football field, you learn how to come back. We had to fight to come back.\n\nBush expressed gratitude for those who stood with him through his Heisman exile, and reaffirmed his belief that hard work will always bring the game home.\n\nBush: I want to thank my beautiful wife... for just being my stress reliever whenever I needed to just talk about the things that were bothering me, the things that were keeping me up late at night.\n\nTrojan football fans can look forward to a strong season next year and look back to a newly restored legacy.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/25/maria-sanchez-joins-san-diego-wave-fc-in-record-trade-with-houston-dash/", "response": "```\nMaria S\u00e1nchez joins San Diego Wave FC in record trade with Houston Dash\n\nFrom the South to the West Coast Maria S\u00e1nchez is changing the game and breaking records\n\nMar\u00eda Sanchez takes photos with fans (Photo Courtesy of San Diego Wave)\n\nBy Michelle Chavez April 25, 2024 at 7:25 pm PDT\n\nJust a day before the National Women\u2019s Soccer League\u2019s transfer portal closed, Mexican international winger Maria S\u00e1nchez\u2019s team officially requested a trade from the Houston Dash. The trade was confirmed Friday before the league\u2019s midnight deadline ensuring that S\u00e1nchez could move teams before the next trade opened in August. Later that day, official confirmation of a record-breaking deal between the Houston Dash and the San Diego Wave was announced.\n\nS\u00e1nchez\u2019s new contract to join the Wave is the latest addition to her record-breaking contract. This recent contract sees Sanchez joining the Wave in exchange for a whopping $500,000 being paid to the Dash\u2014the largest amount of intra-league funds exchanged in NWSL history, according to ESPN. The fee will be divided into three main parts: $300,000 in Intra-League Transfer Funds, $200,000 in Allocation Money and an international slot for the Dash to utilize in 2024 and 2025. The spot likely will be used for Brazilian defender Tarciane dos Santos de Lima as she is set to sign with Houston.\n\nS\u00e1nchez had international headlines last December for signing an outstanding continuation $1.5 million dollar contract meant to keep her in Houston until 2026 and allow her to extend it through the 2027 season. The contract was significant for a multitude of reasons. First the contract was the biggest one signed in the NWSL at the time. Second, it serves as a reminder that Mexican players are at the same caliber as those in the U.S., and an inspiration for rising young female players. Third, since her contract is with the league and not directly with the Houston Dash, the Wave must take on the remaining portion of the $1.5 million contract, which includes any bonuses granted and S\u00e1nchez\u2019s exercised fourth-year option.\n\nMaria\u2019s departure from the team comes after contributing one assist and three shots during her four games and 348 minutes played this season. \u201cLa Bombi,\u201d as affectionately referred to by fans, was an essential part of the Dash after joining the team in 2022. However, this year, Houston finds itself at the bottom of the league, sitting in 12th place on the 14-team table.\n\nLeaving Houston means Maria will return to her collegiate roots as she spent her two final years of college playing at Santa Clara University. She scored 13 goals in 42 games and led all Division 1 players in assists with 16 at her peak. She had joined the sunny coast after playing at Idaho State University where she scored 22 goals in 37 games.\n\nAside from her success in the leagues, S\u00e1nchez has found tremendous acclaim as a regular player on the Mexican Women\u2019s National Team. She has been instrumental in leading la selecci\u00f3n to the victories and triumphs. Since making her national debut at age 19 in 2015, she\u2019s made over 60 senior team appearances including the 2015 Women\u2019s World Cup where she was the second youngest player on the roster and the 2016 U-20 Women\u2019s World Cup. She also served as the captain for El Tri during all five matches of the 2023 Pan American Games, where Mexico outscored opponents 17-2 in pursuit of the gold medal. It was during this tournament that she made history, becoming the first Mexican player to tie for the Golden Boot award at the tournament with four goals. She most recently led the team to the 2024 Women\u2019s Gold Cup semifinals after beating the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team and Paraguay.\n\nMaria\u2019s childhood saw her compete against older kids, mainly boys, in Idaho as she tried to turn her passion for the beautiful game into something greater. She finished high school with a career record of 178 goals, ultimately becoming one of the best players in the state. She often recounts the machismo and barriers she faced while playing as a Latina in Idaho and the expectations of her parents.\n\nS\u00e1nchez continues to advocate for equity in sports, the dismantling of machismo, and more importance and significance to be placed on women and girls in soccer and sports. As she evolves into a new chapter of her career, let\u2019s take a look at what this move might mean and how she\u2019ll fit into the Wave.\n\nS\u00e1nchez played mostly as a left winger for Houston where there had been five different head coaches since 2021 however she\u2019s been shifted into a wingback role in a 3-5-2 under head coach Fran Alonso. When she joins, she\u2019ll be the ninth forward on the Wave\u2019s roster. San Diego is currently playing three forwards under Alex Morgan; Sofia Jakobsson, Savannah McCaskill and Jaedyn Shaw, utilizing the 4-2-3-1 formation the Dash used in their loss against the Wave in September. The current set up would require changes to fit in a pure winger like S\u00e1nchez, but it\u2019s not impossible. If they were to have McCaskill drop deeper that would allow S\u00e1nchez to join Shaw in playing wide of Jakobsson. All this would come at the cost of benching some players. Shaw and Morgan have sustained injuries, meaning minutes will be limited. So far, Shaw\u2019s playing time has been limited to make sure she can play for the USWNT during the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. Morgan was taken off the pitch in a recent game due to an ankle injury, which may provide the space for better depth with S\u00e1nchez as she brings experience from both NWSL and Liga MX Femenil leagues and international competition.\n\nMaria\u2019s contract represents a new change in both the league and the culture. As the NWSL continues to grow and more eyes are tuned in to matches, players will have the opportunity to gain larger contracts and be paid their worth. With so many new eyes on women\u2019s sports and women\u2019s soccer, future generations of girls will grow up knowing that their dreams of playing professional soccer are achievable. With S\u00e1nchez and countless others serving as inspiration, the sport will only continue to diversify and grow.\n\nThe Wave will face off against Bay FC this Saturday at the Snapdragon Stadium. So far no lineups have been released but there is a possibility fans could see S\u00e1nchez take the field.\n```"}

(Photo by Solana Espino)\n\nBy Solana Espino, Anthony Bottino and Krystle Ehara\nApril 25, 2024 at 7:00 pm PDT\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, speakers from the USC Divest From Death Coalition, responsible for organizing a protest the previous day, re-shared their platform, demands and aims during a press conference held at the corner of the entrance to the USC Village. Pro-Palestinian protesters set up an encampment on campus early Wednesday morning with the intention of occupying Alumni Park.\n\nA few hours later, a TrojansAlert stated there was \u201csignificant activity at the center of the UPC campus due to a demonstration.\u201d Following DPS\u2019s request to remove the tents and their attempted arrest of an organizer around noon that was thwarted by protestors, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) was called to campus, as reported by Annenberg Media.\n\nAt about 1:30 p.m., USC made another announcement through the TrojansAlert system that the middle of campus was still experiencing \u201csignificant activity.\u201d As a result, gates were closed and USC IDs were required to enter campus. Metro officers in riot gear began surrounding campus and the demonstrators at Alumni Park with batons, shields and \u201cless-than-lethal\u201d weapons around 4 p.m.\n\nRoughly two hours later, another TrojansAlert went out warning students that anyone at the center of campus would be arrested. As evening fell, LAPD pushed students off school grounds and fired a single rubber bullet at the crowd. A full timeline from the perspective of the demonstrators can be found on the group\u2019s news release.\n\nLAPD confirmed with Annenberg Media that 93 arrests were made, of which the coalition approximated 50 to 60 were students. Those arrested were charged with misdemeanor trespassing and were processed at the Metropolitan Division in Downtown Los Angeles and the 77th St. Community Police Station, according to LAPD. As of Thursday morning, everyone detained had been released.\n\nSenior Olivia Eskenazi, one of the students arrested at the protest, said officers were not transparent about where they were taking her, were unnecessarily rough during her pat down and seemed confused about how to book protesters.\n\n\u201cWhen I initially got arrested, they put on my cuffs so tight that my wrists turned blue and purple,\u201d Eskenazi said. \u201cAnd I had to beg the officer to cut them off because I literally couldn\u2019t feel my hands.\u201d\n\nWhen she was giving her information to the officer on campus, Eskenazi saw his additional notes on the sheet referred to her as \u201cfat girl.\u201d She called the experience awkward, uncomfortable and dehumanizing.\n\nIn the group\u2019s original press release, the Divest From Death Coalition had a list of six demands, including full transparency of USC endowment and investments from \u201ccompanies and institutions that profit from Israeli apartheid, genocide, and occupation in Palestine\u201d and to protect free speech on campus. The group said its demands remain the same.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that students, once again, are a voice of justice and a voice of reason,\u201d said the Jewish-American and USC Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) representative, who declined to provide their name citing concerns for their safety. \u201cAs we are here at these elite universities... we are so grateful and we are so honored to be standing in solidarity with all these universities... that are using their voices to speak out most fundamentally for Palestine and the Palestinian people.\u201d\n\nAlongside the press conference Thursday, protesters set up a second demonstration at Alumni Park called the Gaza Solidarity Occupation. They laid on the ground silently for a die-in, which they said symbolized the more than 30,000 Palestinians killed so far in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nA media liaison for two pro-Palestine groups organizing the demonstration said it was planned with a different goal than the previous day\u2019s protest.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this die-in specifically is to maintain the safety of all students,\u201d said the junior, who would only speak to Annenberg Media on the condition of anonymity citing safety concerns. \u201cThis die-in complies with all [the university\u2019s] requirements. It is a way to continue our occupation to ensure the safety of everyone involved.\u201d\n\nPro-Palestinian demonstrators hold a die-in at Alumni Park. (Photo by Solana Espino)\n\nIn accordance with university guidelines, there were no tents set up and no decorations were hung from the trees. Students involved either declined to speak to Annenberg Media during the event or only spoke on the condition of anonymity. Protesters held signs, banners and flags in support of Palestine, with some wearing keffiyehs.\n\nHowever, students were not the only people involved. Plenty of faculty and at least one retired professor were there in support of the cause as well as concerned local residents who had no USC affiliation.\n\n\u201cWe are here to support Palestine, but also to support our students who were attacked by LAPD for trying to exercise their political right to speak,\u201d a faculty member with the Palestine Justice Faculty Group said. \u201cPalestinian solidarity doesn\u2019t threaten anybody. It\u2019s the police and administration that threaten people, including faculty for fear of retaliation from administration. Many fear for their careers when they speak out.\u201d\n\nThe media liaison for the coalition claimed that despite how the protest the day before ended, those at the die-in were happy to be able to peacefully hold USC accountable and continue the occupation.\n\n\u201cWe hope to show USC that this extreme act of aggression will not affect our commitment to the liberation of the Palestine people which we believe can be achieved through USC disclosing investments and defending their students.\u201d\n\nWhile the press conference was happening, a group of Jewish students held a demonstration and memorial across the street in front of the Trousdale entrance as an opportunity for \u201canyone that felt marginalized, or ostracized during yesterday\u2019s protests, Jewish students or otherwise, to be able to come and eat lunch with us.\u201d\n\nAn organizer hangs an Israeli flag at a symbolic Seder to honor hostages held in Gaza. (Photo by Solana Espino)\n\nThe demonstration mimicked a Passover Seder, a family meal including traditional foods, prayer and recitation of the story of Exodus with students setting up a dinner table and taping pictures of hostages held in Gaza to each chair.\n\n\u201cThis is in honor of those people who could not be at their Seder table this year,\u201d Sabrina Jehan, a senior Marshall student, said. \u201cIt\u2019s about showing that the Jewish community stands together in honor of the hostages, as should the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nWhile the Jewish demonstration remained on the crosswalk until 4 p.m., a die-in that started at noon in Founder\u2019s Park will continue the coalition\u2019s occupation. The solidarity occupation schedules can be found on the S.C.A.L.E. at USC Instagram account.\n\nMyriam Alcala contributed to this report.\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Will Simonds and Nick Charles Currie\nApril 25, 2024 at 5:19 pm PDT\n\nThe time has come for the 2024 NFL Draft, and a few Trojans are expected to hear their name called by the end of the three-day event in Detroit. Follow along here for live updates on the USC players taken in this year\u2019s NFL Draft from Will Simonds and Nick Charles Currie.\n\nDay 1: Round 1\nChicago Bears, Pick No. 1: Caleb Williams, QB\nAfter months of waiting, Caleb Williams is the No. 1 overall pick of the 2024 NFL Draft. USC\u2019s latest Heisman-winning quarterback will head to Chicago, the only team he visited in the pre-draft process. Williams will join fellow former Trojan Velus Jones Jr. in the Windy City, where he will aim to be the franchise\u2019s first 4,000 yard passer in the franchise\u2019s 105-year history. Williams transferred to USC from Oklahoma, moving with head coach Lincoln Riley. In his first year as a Trojan, he threw for 4,537 yards, 42 touchdowns and only five interceptions on his way to USC\u2019s first Heisman Trophy since the newly-reinstated Reggie Bush. He also ran for 382 yards and 10 touchdowns. Williams was long-presumed the No. 1 overall pick, widely touted for his ability to throw with a wide variety of arm angles, impressive arm strength and athleticism, as well as his talent to escape from difficult situations. He\u2019s got plenty of hype going into his rookie season, but Williams is entering into a pretty good situation with a Chicago squad coming off a 7-10 season in 2023.\n\nDay 2: Rounds 2 & 3\nHouston Texans, Pick No. 78: Calen Bullock, S\nCalen Bullock is the second USC player off the board, heading out to an up-and-coming contender in the Texans. Bullock started at USC for three years and was a rare consistent piece for a defensive backfield that has struggled mightily over the past few seasons. The Pasadena native has been praised for his range in coverage and penchant for finding the ball, with nine career interceptions. Ranked as one of the top safety prospects in the class, Bullock will have the chance to develop under head coach DeMeco Ryans and veteran safety Jimmie Ward. His tackling will need to improve, but Bullock\u2019s ball skills give him the chance to be an important piece of the Texans\u2019 defense of the future.\n\nGreen Bay Packers, Pick No. 88: MarShawn Lloyd, RB\nMarShawn Lloyd is the third USC player off the board and the second on day two of the draft \u2014 he\u2019s heading north to Green Bay. The transfer from South Carolina ran for 7.1 yards per carry and nine touchdowns last year in his only season with the Trojans. He\u2019s also a threat as a pass catcher, adding another 232 yards on the ground to get him over 1,000 yards from scrimmage. Lloyd is the fourth running back off the board and has been praised for his burst and ability to avoid tacklers. With the departure of Aaron Jones, Lloyd could contribute right away as a third-down back on a young, but talented Packers offense. He\u2019ll be competing for snaps with free-agent signing Josh Jacobs and AJ Dillon.\n\nDay 3: Rounds 4-7\nSan Francisco 49ers, Pick No. 215: Jarrett Kingston, OL\nOffensive lineman Jarrett Kingston is the fourth USC player off the board and the first to go on day three. The Washington State grad transfer has been praised for his movement skills and athleticism, but there are concerns about his arm length. He may project at center for the 49ers, who are weak along the interior, but Kingston did not play the position in college. He joins fellow Trojan Talanoa Hufanga, who became a first-team All-Pro for the Bay Area team.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers, Pick No. 225: Brenden Rice, WR\nWide receiver Brenden Rice is the fifth USC player off the board and the second on day two of the draft. Rice, the son of NFL legend Jerry, transferred from Colorado after the 2021 season. He started at receiver during both of his years at USC. Rice has been praised for his play strength and contested catching, as well as his red zone success \u2014 Rice scored 12 touchdowns for the Trojans in 2023. He was largely expected to be off the board by the fourth round, but fell \u2014 likely due to struggles generating separation. The Chargers receiving corps is a very thin group, so Rice may have a chance to contribute early in Jim Harbaugh\u2019s first season in Los Angeles.\n\nHouston Texans, Pick No. 238: Solomon Byrd, EDGE\nEdge rusher Solomon Byrd is the sixth USC player off the board and the third on day three of the draft. He will join teammate Calen Bullock on DeMeco Ryans\u2019 defense. Byrd has a variety of pass rush moves in his arsenal and used them to great effect. He notched ten sacks in his two years with the Trojans, following his transfer from Wyoming. Byrd also forced four fumbles in 2023 as one of the team\u2019s most impactful defenders. Although Byrd was effective on the football field, his athletic testing likely put many teams off. As an undersized edge rusher, he only ran a 5.01 second 40-yard dash and managed 10 bench press reps of 225 lbs at USC\u2019s pro day.\n\nMiami Dolphins, Pick No. 241: Tahj Washington, WR\nWide receiver Tahj Washington is the seventh USC player off the board and the fourth on day three of the draft. The Memphis transfer spent three years at USC and never dipped below 50 receptions in a season, culminating in a 1,062-yard, eight-touchdown season in 2023. He heads to the Dolphins \u2014 a team which places heavy emphasis on its receiver talent, with the offense operating on the speed and talent of Tyreek Hill and Jayden Waddle. Concerns have been raised about Washington\u2019s size, but he has been praised for his contested catching, willingness to block and toughness. Tahj was not the only receiver named Washington to go to Miami this draft, with Virginia\u2019s Malik Washington coming off the board in the sixth round.\n\nTrojans signed as Undrafted Free Agents:\nAustin Jones, RB \u2014 Washington Commanders\nChristian Roland-Wallace, CB \u2014 Kansas City Chiefs\nJustin Dedich, OL \u2014 Los Angeles Rams\nDL Kyon Barrs was invited to the Tennessee Titans rookie minicamp for a tryout.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/25/for-better-or-worse-are-movie-marketing-trends-creating-a-problem-for-studios/", "response": "```\nFor better or worse, are movie marketing trends creating a problem for studios?\n\nStudios risk \u201cmis-marketing\u201d to audiences to ensure a film\u2019s box-office success.\n\nBy Elise Hernke April 25, 2024 at 4:41 pm PDT\n\nThere is a familiar joy of sinking into your seat with a fresh, overpriced pail of popcorn and a giant soda, ready to be immersed in a movie you\u2019ve been eager to see for a while. Then it is suddenly disrupted when that movie starts and the lead character...starts singing. The highly anticipated films \u201cWonka,\u201d \u201cMean Girls\u201d and \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d all shocked theatergoers with the fact that they were musicals. Even beyond musicals, \u201cCivil War\u201d has erupted mixed reactions from an atypical marketing rollout.\n\nIt is a strange phenomenon that has been noticed by audiences everywhere, increasingly frequently in the past several years. But, you wouldn\u2019t know that from any marketing materials strategically designed to veil the genre from the masses. The bygone era where musicals were everyone\u2019s cup of tea, the Golden Era of the Hollywood musical, is long gone. Musicals by today\u2019s standards are one of the most polarizing genres, seeing a steady decline in popularity in the latter half of the twentieth century.\n\nIn an IMDB study created in 2024, in the 1930\u2032s the musical genre made up about 10% of all films released whereas in the past two decades that number sits at below 1%. With this touch-and-go genre, it seems incredibly risky to trick audiences into watching when there is a high probability that these songs will fall on deaf ears.\n\nNotably, this has happened before. When Tim Burton\u2019s \u201cSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\u201d was distributed in 2007, it was billed as a horror film rather than its musical origins. With Johnny Depp at the helm and Helena Bonham Carter at his side, audiences flocked to the theater expecting a gothic thriller like the blood-splattered trailer indicated. When the first round of moviegoers realized that the dialogue was delivered by a ballad, the backlash was swift. Complaints were made to the Advertising Standards Authority, citing misleading ads.\n\nLike \u201cMean Girls,\u201d this was based on an already popular Broadway musical with a following, but that was not obvious to the general public. There is a long history in Hollywood of movies that market themselves differently than the experience of actually watching them. This year, \u201cCivil War\u201d was marketed by A24 using iconic American institutions under siege, including visuals of tanks encroaching on various West Coast locations like Echo Park Lake, none of which appeared in the final product. It was marketed as an action horror, but the experience of watching it was that it was a contemplative and somber drama more than anything else.\n\nBut it can be difficult to convey the complexities of a genre-bending film in a trailer that is also aimed to avoid spoilers. Amy, an unnamed project manager for a film marketing agency, worked on some of the \u201cMean Girls\u201d print marketing materials. She spoke to me about the behind-the-scenes discussions around the new release and provided some context about the competing priorities.\n\n\u201cThere were iterations of that which were much more obvious [that it was a musical],\u201d she said. \u201c[The marketing materials] start so detailed, beautiful, creative, very niche and then by the end of the campaign, it\u2019s always generalized and formulaic.\u201d\n\nWith studio film budgets running from $36 million to $125 million, studios have to prioritize box office metrics above everything else. \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly common these days. It\u2019s jarring for a viewer to go to a movie that was sold to them one way then getting something completely different, but from a business perspective, they know that [musicals] aren\u2019t as wide of a sell. Studios will tell us based on the script to start off to the races, try everything and anything with no restrictions. But as we get closer, they start pulling back as more executives and test audiences get involved,\u201d she said.\n\nAmy suggested that they are willing to take more backlash. \u201c[For studios], any press is good press. At least people are talking about it and [the backlash] doesn\u2019t feel significant enough to deter people from watching. It\u2019s a subset of the internet and entertainment news cycles so quickly, so the backlash is superseded by the box office stats.\u201d\n\nFor \u201cMean Girls,\u201d Amy also explained that it was created as a piece of content expected to go straight to streaming before Paramount pivoted and decided to pump money into a theatrical release. It was a gamble, but they recognized that they could capitalize on the nostalgia factor, as well as the fans of the Broadway musical version and get some commercial success.\n\nIn the end, it is exactly what they did. Despite receiving mixed reviews, the \u201cMean Girls\u201d musical which cost only $36 million to make, raked in over $100 million worldwide, establishing it as a commercial hit. Paramount shared data about the opening weekend numbers which acknowledged that 16% of audience members left the theater after realizing the genre.\n\nMarc Weinstock, Paramount\u2019s president of global marketing and distribution, seemed unbothered by this percentage when speaking to Variety. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to run out and say it\u2019s a musical because people tend to treat musicals differently. This movie is a broad comedy with music. Yes, it could be considered a musical but it appeals to a larger audience. You can see in [trailers for] \u201cWonka\u201d and \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d they don\u2019t say \u2018musical\u2019 either. We have a musical note on the title, so there are hints to it without being overbearing,\u201d Weinstock told Variety.\n\nTed, an anonymous entertainment marketer, worked on marketing materials for studios such as A24, Netflix and Neon. He thought it was a ridiculous move for a musical not to be marketed as one, but acknowledges how it can be a successful strategy. \u201c[Netflix was] very adamant about discluding as much of that as possible because musicals just don\u2019t make as much money and when it comes to marketing, according to testing and whatnot, audiences are turned off by musicals\u201d\n\nThey aren\u2019t wrong. \u201cWhat sucks is that information is actually backed by a lot of data on their end with previous projects they have mentioned...the audience tested significantly lower and were less interested if there was dancing and singing,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, he asserted that studios take audience response very seriously. He spoke about a movie the company had worked on for the last year, which had lots of hype around it based on the director\u2019s previous Oscar win. When it finally premiered at a film festival, it got panned. \u201c[The studio] had a whole strategy that the demographic who would love this movie would be the artsy, indie, arthouse, niche, Letterboxd [crowd], then those people reviewed it and they were like \u2018this sh\u2014 is shallow.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cSo, they rethought the campaign and said, \u2018If this movie wasn\u2019t deep or weird or shocking enough for the arthouse indie film community, then maybe we need to reposition this as a more commercial four-quad movie,\u2019 and so that\u2019s what they ended up doing and it worked.\u201d\n\nThe theatrical release, targeted to the wider audience, was released and that audience loved it.\n\nThere are other, seemingly more effective tactics that studios have been using for movies that might benefit the musical genre. Scott Mendelson for Puck News wrote about Paramount\u2019s marketing strategy for \u201cBob Marley: One Love.\u201d The studio made it work by \u201cleveraging outside-the-box marketing ideas similar, perhaps to \u201cM3GAN\u201d dolls doing TikTok-friendly dances, folks flashing scary \u201cSmile\u201d grins on the baseball jumbotron or even those sexually suggestive \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d popcorn buckets.\n\nFor \u201cOne Love,\u201d there were several so-called grassroots-type marketing swings, including street painting, marketing-specific graffiti, viral communal events at professional soccer games and quite a few orchestrated singalongs like the global event that took place in June 2021.\n\nKeri Moore, the co-president of marketing at Lionsgate, spoke at the Wrap\u2019s Women\u2019s Summit about the unique tactics the studio has taken to promote their major franchise, the \u201cSaw\u201d movies. Over the years, they have drummed up tons of conversation around their bizarre and risky marketing campaigns, including mailing bags of fake limbs to invite the press to screenings and blood drives.\n\nDuring the recent SAG-AFTRA strikes, Moore said they had to return to some of their more experiential marketing efforts to get the word out since they couldn\u2019t rely on actors to do press for the new release.\n\nIn the end, the job of the studio heads is to make money, which means that the marketing team is responsible for getting people into the theater. The longevity of a movie\u2019s success certainly depends on reaching the right audience and having a quality film in the first place, but the priority is always to avoid a flop, where a project fails to see a return on investment.\n\nWe will likely continue to see experimental campaigns deployed across social media platforms, in traditional print materials and trailers, on billboards and in press junkets as the media landscape continues to evolve. The best-case scenario is that the film delivers such a celebrated, exceptional film that we forget what expectation had brought us to the theater in the first place.\n```"}

(Photo by Alan Mittelstaedt)\n\nBy Ethan Huang\nApril 25, 2024 at 2:12 pm PDT\n\nThe incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II is widely known as a moment of infamy in American history. But what is often overlooked are the approximately 33,000 Japanese Americans who served in the U.S. Army as a means of proving their loyalty to a country that alienated them. The story of the Nisei (second generation Japanese American) soldier has gone under the radar of most people, including David Ono.\n\nPeople might recognize him with his distinctively round glasses and smooth voice from ABC7 Eyewitness News, appearing every afternoon from 4pm to 6pm to report on the happenings in Los Angeles and beyond. Ono, a Japanese American himself, was completely unaware of this piece of history, but would later become engrossed in telling it.\n\n\u201cI wanted to bring people to these battlefields where these guys fought in World War II, because they\u2019re considered the greatest fighting unit in American military history for their size and length of service, yet nobody knows about them,\u201d Ono said in an interview with Annenberg Media. \u201cIf they\u2019re so celebrated and so accomplished, why don\u2019t we see more about them when it comes to movies and shows, books, history books, etc.?\u201d\n\nThis fascination took Ono across Europe and Asia for a project that transcends the journalistic medium. \u201cDefining Courage\u201d was born from Ono\u2019s curiosity. It is a performance that combines different media for an experience that transports audiences into the shoes of the Nisei soldier. Now, he will be bringing the show to a university for the first time.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 30, \u201cDefining Courage\u201d will play at USC\u2019s Bing Theatre as the closing event to the school\u2019s celebration of AAPI Heritage Month. The \u201cdeconstructed documentary,\u201d as Ono describes it, mixes drone footage of former battlefields, from forests of France to the cliffs of Okinawa, with interviews with veterans alongside a live choir, original music, and Ono himself on-stage narrating.\n\nWhile Ono primarily works within the bounds of traditional journalism, this project allowed him to do something completely new. \u201cIt is the melding of entertainment and journalism, which I love because I\u2019m strictly a journalist,\u201d said Ono. \u201cHowever, I\u2019ve learned a lot in the process when it comes to the entertainment side of it. We wrote our own music, every word I say, I\u2019ve written, which is normal for my journalistic side... but the cadence is a little bit slower because the audience is live, and so you want them to absorb every word.\u201d\n\nIn balancing the creative and journalistic voices, Ono was able to create something one-of-a-kind within the realm of nonfiction storytelling. \u201cIt was really scary and fun at the same time,\u201d said Ono. \u201cWe\u2019re proud and also we\u2019re excited to be able to do it because for once it is like two different realms simultaneously: telling a story accurately, steeped in deep, deep research, but also bringing the emotion of music and video and other elements to hold the audience\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefining Courage\u201d is ambitious and risky to say the least. Like with any piece of art, Ono was not sure what the reception would be until that first performance. \u201cThe first obstacle is, \u2018Am I out of my mind? Am I way off, because now it\u2019s not just me that pays the price. I brought in musicians, editors, [videographers], I\u2019ve flown all over the world to shoot these stories,\u201d said Ono.\n\nAnother part of that challenge is finding an audience for the work. Ono was anxious that some people may be turned away simply because they see it as just \u201can Asian story.\u201d And although it is an \u201cAsian story,\u201d Ono believes that \u201cDefining Courage\u201d could resonate with anyone watching, not just members of the Asian American community.\n\n\u201c[Some audiences] feel like that\u2019s not part of [their] story, and we don\u2019t want them to think that,\u201d said Ono. \u201cWe want them to see it and then understand that there are so many elements in the show that are universal when it comes to courage, when it comes to sacrifice, when it comes to overwhelming adversity and still fighting. Those are all elements that we can all learn from.\u201d\n\nBy wandering into those uncharted waters, Ono\u2019s efforts have paid off. \u201cDefining Courage\u201d has been performed 15 times now in venues ranging from the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. to the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, to the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Orange County. All of these shows were sold out, according to Ono.\n\nHe hopes that by performing it in a university like USC that students will be able to educate themselves on a side of history even he, a professional journalist, did not know about. \u201cUnderstand your ignorance, embrace your ignorance, fight your way out of ignorance, but don\u2019t beat yourself up over being ignorant, your ignorance is largely not your fault,\u201d said Ono. \u201cUnderstand that we have many blind spots as Americans, we don\u2019t talk about a lot of these chapters in our history that we need to talk about.\u201d\n\nFor aspiring journalists, Ono encourages them to be willing to try something new and explore unique means of telling a powerful story while maintaining a sense of journalistic integrity. \u201cA pet peeve of mine is \u2018that\u2019s not the way we do things,\u2019\u201d said Ono. \u201cYou always will have to innovate... don\u2019t be intimidated by the way the world is today. You will own the way it is tomorrow as long as you stay in front, keep your eyes open, be creative, be open minded, learn as much as possible, but then you want to have your own input on how it should be done in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefining Courage\u201d serves as a first step for Ono, as he now looks to find other stories to tell utilizing this distinct journalistic format.

(AP/Alex Gallardo)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner April 25, 2024 at 1:51 pm PDT\n\nEDMONTON, Alberta \u2014 The Kings faced a potential 2-0 series deficit when overtime began, but veteran center An\u017ee Kopitar made sure Los Angeles would head home with a win when he notched the walk-off goal two minutes into the extra frame against the Oilers. LA won 5-4 in what was the teams\u2019 closest matchup since Dec. 30\u2014their first head-to-head game of the year\u2014when Edmonton beat the Kings in a thrilling shootout.\n\nGoalie Cam Talbot got the call in net once again and stayed strong down the stretch, making key saves. The 36-year-old stopped 27 shots on 31 attempts.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to beat [Edmonton] playing one or two lines, we\u2019re gonna need our depth to win us hockey games,\u201d said Talbot. \u201cEveryone contributed tonight, it was a big team win.\u201d\n\nThe Kings were coming off a rough Game 1 in which they allowed seven goals and an electric power-play performance from the Oilers, but on Wednesday, LA tightened up its penalty kill. The Kings silenced Edmonton\u2019s power play early in the first period and twice in total, only surrendering one goal to it.\n\nLos Angeles thrived in the first period thanks to winger Adrian Kempe, who scored twice within the game\u2019s first 15 minutes to give the Kings an early lead. Kopitar, the game\u2019s eventual hero, assisted both goals, before Oilers defenseman Brett Kulak put his team on the board just minutes later.\n\nHowever, blueliner Drew Doughty helped Los Angeles retake a two-goal lead, as he received a pass from winger Viktor Arvidsson near the blue line, rushed up the ice, collided with netminder Stuart Skinner and forced the puck through the five-hole for the score.\n\nThe second period saw the Kings surrender two goals, including one while on the penalty kill. With Edmonton down by one and center Blake Lizotte serving a hooking call, Zach Hyman took advantage of the Oilers\u2019 extra-man opportunity to even the game with a slick one-timer from the nearside circle.\n\nThe goal was the winger\u2019s fourth of the young postseason and breathed new life into the Oilers\u2019 offense, which had been a bit stagnant to that point.\n\nAlmost two minutes into the third period, though, winger Kevin Fiala answered the call and flung the puck from the boards into the net to give Los Angeles the lead again. But winger Dylan Holloway continued Edmonton\u2019s fight as he posted his second goal of the game nearly two minutes later, setting up a chippy overtime period.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t take long for Kopitar and the Kings offense to light up again when it mattered most. The two-time Stanley Cup winner broke free following a touch-pass from winger Quinton Byfield and went top-shelf to allow Kings fans to breathe a sigh of relief after a rollercoaster of a game.\n\nIf the Kings have further proven one thing, it\u2019s that Kempe is a force to be reckoned with when he plays the Oilers. The 27-year-old tallied career head-to-head playoff points 17 and 18 against Edmonton in Game 2, dating back to the 2022 series. The point total includes 10 goals.\n\nLA also finally figured out Skinner, who has been largely lights-out in head-to-head games this season. And, even though he\u2019s posted six assists in the series, center Connor McDavid hasn\u2019t lit the lamp yet\u2014a big plus for the Kings.\n\n\u201cWe checked way better, I knew we would, we had to,\u201d said interim head coach Jim Hiller. \u201cWe just did a good job in the neutral zone.\u201d\n\nBoth teams will head south for a pair of crucial games at Crypto.com Arena. The Kings had a regular-season home record of 22-12-7 and turned up their intensity in LA following the firing of former head coach Todd McLellan.\n\nWith the series tied 1-1, Game 3\u2032s opening puck drop will be at 7:30 p.m. on Friday.\n```"}

Times\u2019 Festival of Books had crowds flocking to campus, but the question of whether people are still reading remains.\n\nBy Krystle Ehara April 25, 2024 at  1:39 pm PDT\n\nHundreds of vendors, thousands of people, millions of words. Last weekend, the  Los Angeles Times\u2019 Festival of Books  drew massive crowds to USC\u2019s University Park Campus. Crowds of book lovers, young and old, crowds of representatives from bookstores, libraries, and small businesses and crowds of people eager to attend L.A.\u2019s \u201cpremier book festival.\u201d So, books are back, then? Maybe not quite.\n\nLast December,  a YouGov poll  showed that nearly half of Americans didn\u2019t read any books in 2023. Reading just two books puts you above 51% of the American population. Reading rates amongst certain groups also significantly dropped, with a  Gallup poll  revealing that college graduates averaged six fewer books per year in 2021 compared to 2002 through 2016. And it\u2019s not just an issue in the U.S. A 2023 report from the National Literacy Trust  (NLT), an English charity focused on promoting literacy, found that only 2 in 5 children and people aged 8 to 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time, based on more than 70,000 survey results. It\u2019s the lowest level reported since the NLT began collecting surveys in 2005.\n\nIn Canada,  a 2022 report from United for Literacy  showed that 49% of adults scored \u201cbelow the literacy levels expected of high school students.\u201d And down in Australia, 44% of Australians have low or very low literacy rates according to the  Australian Bureau of Statistics .\n\nNone of this comes as a surprise to Faith Snyder, a junior international relations and global business major. Books were a crucial part of her childhood and development. Becoming president of USC\u2019s Give-A-Book Club, an organization dedicated to collecting and donating books, was her way of passing on that experience. But over the years, whether due to rising book prices or other forms of media taking over, she\u2019s noticed a shift.\n\n\u201cI think that there are still communities, especially in academics, and even on social media, like the rise of BookTok [...] out there that keep reading alive,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cBut the world as a whole has also started to turn away from reading.\u201d\n\nKristin Peers, the manager at the Pico Union Branch Library, said she sees things differently. \u201cThere\u2019s some of us that might argue against libraries, and just physical books, in general being something that might be obscure in the future, but just from my experience, there\u2019s more and more users every year,\u201d Peers said.\n\nPeers said initiatives like adding digital media (audio books, e-books, etc.) to libraries have expanded patron usage, but ultimately, physical books and libraries will always be desired and needed. \u201c[Books are] just gonna be more interactive [...] there\u2019s going to be more warmth. It just creates connections,\u201d Peers said.\n\nThese connections are what USC\u2019s Women in Management (WIM) organization hope to foster in its monthly virtual book club. Stacy Patterson, previous president of WIM and current program manager for the Division of Media Arts + Practice, has been an avid participant since 2015 when the club first formed.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m reading a book, I\u2019m taking in from my point of view, but I\u2019m also challenged in that hour together to maybe see it a little differently,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cThis notion of how quickly community gets built around the reading of a book \u2014 it still startles me in the most engaging and thankful, grateful, happy place.\u201d\n\nIn her eyes, the ability that books have to open conversations is one of their everlasting benefits. \u201cThe book club has always started with the presumption that there are people who like to read [...] the written word [is] a medium, it\u2019s here to stay,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cBut are there also some generational issues here \u2014 like with newer technologies, are people as inclined to sit down and read a book?\u201d\n\nFor Marvyn Kyi, a freshman accounting major, technology, especially social media, has actually reinvigorated reading in younger generations. \u201cAt the book [festival] I saw a lot of young adults. The romance sections, where popular TikTok books are, were the most populated stands,\u201d Kyi said. \u201cSo, I think it\u2019s mainly social media bringing books back into society.\u201d\n\nBookTok, or the subsection of TikTok solely for readers to share and bond over books, has indeed increased reading rates, especially amongst Gen Z. Chief Executive of Barnes & Noble, James Daunt,  credits social media trends  like this as \u201chugely positive,\u201d and surveys of TikTok users in the United States show that  62% of people  said they read at least one book based on BookTok recommendations.\n\nBut whether this new wave in reading is indeed simply a trend or is indicative of a larger shift back to physical books remains to be seen. In junior lifespan health major Carissa Liu\u2019s opinion, while reading in all forms is important, the draw that the physical media has is unparalleled. Based on her three years worth of experience with volunteering at the Festival of Books, she said the relevancy books have, especially for niche communities, is clear.\n\n\u201cI would say that the festival holds a lot of value because you really get to explore so many different ways you can read [...] people are promoting audiobooks, their own podcasts, or other different mediums,\u201d Liu said. \u201cBut [paper] books have always been with us [...] they kind of have that undying legacy, in a way.\u201d\n\nUndying legacy or fading relevancy is the question for the larger public \u2014 but for those dedicated book lovers, the answer is clear: books are never going away, and they never even left.\n```"}

But, that is not to say it doesn\u2019t come without certain checks and balances regulating how far that speech can go. Earlier today, hundreds of Pro-Palestine protesters set up tents on USC\u2019s main campus joining other University\u2019s in a nationwide protest demanding a cease-fire in the Middle East. Tensions have risen following USC\u2019s announcement declaring they would no longer allow valedictorian, Asna Tabassum, to deliver her speech at this year\u2019s commencement.\n\nAttorney at the federal public defender in the northern district of Indiana, Chad Pennington, shared some of his professional insights surrounding the matter of free speech on college campus\u2019s.\n\nChad Pennington: As a concept it\u2019s just a sliding scale you know. A person has first amendment rights and there\u2019s certain designated government areas where those protections of free speech are particularly strong, designated public forum, public forum whatever it may be. And so the question becomes not so much whether the person has first amendment rights its to what extent is the University of Southern California authorized to limit those rights.\n\nPrivate universities often do not receive the same level of scrutiny when it comes to restricting freedom of speech, despite the Leonard law which forbids all private, non-religious universities in California from disciplining students for speech that is protected by the First Amendment or the California Constitution.\n\nPennington: Generally to limit those rights it has to make a pretty strong justification for doing so. So I think that the way you want to think about the issue is not so much...can a person speak, but can the government entity regulate it.\n\nAs Pro-Palestine protests continue to unfold throughout the nation, especially on college campuses, many are afraid of the potential infringement on their First Amendment Rights.\n\nFor Annenberg media, I\u2019m Sophie Ignon.\n```"}

Students can expect to endure a six month job search after their initial application, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The job market is also more competitive today than ever, with applicant pools being larger than ever. In 2022, there was a job opening for every applicant. Today, there are at least two applicants per job opportunity, meaning students and post-graduates need to search harder than ever to secure both full-time employment and temporary summer positions.\n\nAs summer approaches, Solana Espino, a sophomore journalism major, is feeling the pressure to find a summer internship. Solana Espino: I think just I wasn\u2019t prepared and I didn\u2019t know when things were opening or closing and I kind of missed deadlines for a lot of stuff this summer. So now I\u2019m kind of just doing like a Hail Mary like to things that are still open. Espino says of her experience that she would advise other students to begin their job search early. Espino: If you have somewhere that you\u2019re looking for a position like, make sure you get all the information for it ahead of time and you know, just put yourself in the best place for success.\n\nEric Yeh, a junior journalism student, agrees with Espino. Eric Yeh: I would say like definitely my sophomore year when I was applying I feel like it was pretty late in the game. And then maybe like not casting a wide enough pool like apply to as many as you can, like, sophomore it was very little and I don\u2019t know like below 10. And I will say this, I applied to like close like to 20. So like I doubled the number and a year but yeah, just keep applying and start early. Yeh is spending his summer working for TEGNA at their Fox 43 station in Pennsylvania. He said that his biggest advice to other students would be to follow up with the companies they\u2019ve applied to. Yeh: Like, after I applied, I would find whoever the news director was, you can find the emails online. And then just like email them directly be like, Hey, I just applied to your thing. Something or just express your interest. And if they don\u2019t get back to the week follow up, we can Hey, just let us know I\u2019m still really interested in, in this position I applied to because that way, you build a connection, and then they can help bump you up.\n\nZach Rigney, the Career Advisor at Annenberg Career Development, says that the biggest mistake Annenberg students make is, quote \u201cwaiting on that one perfect opportunity.\u201d Rigney says that this is what prevents students from applying to more jobs and broadening their job choices. Zach Rigney: Different processes have different timelines as well as different needs, we wouldn\u2019t want you to be so focused on one that it prevents you from still looking still applying to other things. And that usually really delays people in their process, especially if you\u2019re like applying to a bunch of things and not hearing back. That\u2019s usually what it is, is that you\u2019re waiting too much for certain ones and not applying to others because you\u2019re really hoping on one, just keep applying as soon as you see something . Rigney emphasizes that students looking for jobs tend to get discouraged after seeing their peers get \u201clucky.\u201d Rigney: Sadly, as helpful as LinkedIn is seeing, hey, my 20 friends already have full time jobs. And I\u2019m still looking or I\u2019m still interviewing, am I behind and that\u2019s not the case at all. He says that everybody has their own timeline, and that students worried about not finding a job should remember that different opportunities hire at different times. Rigney: Our colleagues at UCLA and other schools that have more a quarter system, they get out for the summer or graduate later. So there are going to be plenty of jobs still posted later. That means there\u2019s hope for any students that don\u2019t have a position locked down yet.\n\nWith the semester nearly over, many students are still in the process of applying and interviewing. For all students, congratulations on finishing their degree or the semester -- and good luck on the job hunt!\n```"}

Denim Day occurs every year on the last Wednesday of April, Sexual Assault Awareness Month. People around the world wear jeans on this day to support survivors and raise awareness. This fashion statement is a visible protest against misconceptions surrounding sexual violence, and many showed their support throughout Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to the CDC, over half of women and about one in three men have experienced sexual violence involving physical contact. In the United States, one in five women have experienced completed or attempted rape. The campaign started in 1999 after an Italian Supreme Court overturned a rapist\u2019s conviction. The court claimed the victim was wearing tight jeans and therefore must have helped the attacker remove her jeans, which implied consent.\n\nFollowing the verdict, women of the Italian parliament protested by wearing jeans to work. Protests spread to Los Angeles where Peace Over Violence began organizing the campaign nationally. California legislators joined them by wearing jeans on the steps of the California State Capitol building in Sacramento. Denim Day is now observed in over 100 countries.\n\n\u201cThe importance of participating in this campaign is just kind of demonstrating in a simple way that you see people and you understand them,\u201d said sophomore Gala Trubint who studies social science and communications. \u201cYou\u2019re here for them in support of those who maybe won\u2019t ever speak up about sexual assault they might have experienced.\u201d\n\nPatti Giggans, Executive Director of Peace Over Violence, organized the first Denim Day in 1999.

He\u2019s the best college football player of all time in my opinion,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cThe whole reason they took it from him in the first place was ridiculous, harsh, and unfair.\u201d\n\nOther students agree that the reason the Heisman was taken wasn\u2019t very clear. \u201cThey took his Heisman for receiving compensation when all players should have been compensated in my opinion,\u201d said Kai Hines, a sophomore international relations major. \u201cAnd he wasn\u2019t the only one getting compensated at the time either.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s Heisman season he ran for 1,740 total yards and rushed for 16 touchdowns on the ground on only 200 attempts. In the air, Bush collected 37 receptions for 478 total yards and two touchdowns. That year USC went 12-1. All of Bush\u2019s records were stripped by the NCAA. On top of that, 14 games Bush played in and the 2004 National Championship win were vacated.\n\n\u201cI hope this means that USC is getting its wins and Reggie gets his records reinstated by the NCAA soon,\u201d said Herrera. \u201cEveryone knows what happened, it\u2019s not like Reggie cheated like the Astros. But still the NCAA needs to reinstate all of that.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his records being stripped, the 2011 USC team was caught in the crosshairs of the sanctions. The NCAA didn\u2019t let USC into the postseason as part of the punishment. A member of that 2011 team, Dion Bailey, tweeted \u201cSo we missed being the Pac-12 champs and playing in the Rose Bowl in 2011 for nothing essentially.\u201d\n\nA hope that students expressed is not only the reinstatement of Bush\u2019s records, but USC\u2019s records as a whole. \u201cThe 2004 national championship and those wins need to be reinstated as well,\u201d said Hines. \u201cNot to mention, Reggie Bush is the greatest football player ever.\u201d\n```"}

And now, Angel City FC, LA\u2019s National Women\u2019s Soccer League club, is reaching out directly to the city\u2019s universities to hold its first-ever \u201cCollege Night\u201d during Friday\u2019s match against the Kansas City Current.\n\nThe promotion is available for students and alumni of Los Angeles area universities and features a discounted ticket and a club-branded pint glass. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited to engage the large college community in LA,\u201d Angel City\u2019s director of marketing and experience, Whitney Hallock, told Annenberg Media. \u201cUSC is essentially our neighbor at BMO Stadium, and so we wanted to offer an opportunity that speaks directly towards college students and alumni.\u201d\n\nHallock traced the idea for a \u201cCollege Night\u201d back to when USC\u2019s now-former star quarterback Caleb Williams attended an Angel City match during the 2023 season. \u201cIt was really cool to see the reaction on our social channels, him interacting with our fans,\u201d Hallock said, suggesting there was potentially more room for the club to activate a college sports audience.\n\nFans who will now be introduced to the club through \u201cCollege Night\u201d will likely be experiencing an Angel City matchday for the first time. Angel City vice president of ticketing Bianca Henninger said she hopes the matchday atmosphere at BMO Stadium will make new fans feel welcome. \u201cWe\u2019re really looking and hoping to create a unique experience at Angel City games,\u201d Henninger said. \u201cFirst and foremost, we want everyone to be able to show up and feel like they can be who they are at our games, and [we] want it to be the most inclusive experience you can find in professional sports.\u201d\n\nShe also expects a particularly fun night on Friday. \u201cWe hope that everyone who comes through our doors at BMO Stadium is ready to party. ... College students are really familiar with that experience and creating a really fun Friday night, so I think they\u2019ll be all set without any further instruction from us,\u201d she said.\n\nJunior economics major Blake Hampton, who closely follows European soccer but hasn\u2019t been to an Angel City or Los Angeles FC match at BMO Stadium, said he finds the \u201cCollege Night\u201d concept intriguing. \u201cIt could be something that would encourage me to go to a game,\u201d Hampton said. \u201cIf the tickets were very cheap... I\u2019d definitely be more inclined to go, and if they\u2019re giving stuff away to students, I would have a stronger appeal to go.\u201d\n\nAngel City\u2019s current squad features two former Trojans in defender Elizabeth Eddy, who also played lacrosse at USC, and forward Katie Johnson. Johnson scored twice in USC\u2019s 3-1 victory over West Virginia in the NCAA tournament championship game, helping to earn the program its second national title. Both players have appeared in three of Angel City\u2019s five matches so far this season.\n\nAfter going winless in the team\u2019s first three matches, Angel City has rebounded in the past couple weeks, beating the Chicago Red Stars 1-0 and the North Carolina Courage 2-1, a game in which Scottish forward Claire Emslie scored both goals. The club currently occupies seventh place in the NWSL table, which is now sufficient to earn a playoff spot after the league added two expansion teams ahead of the 2024 season \u2014 Bay FC and the Utah Royals.\n\nAt the very least, fans can expect an exciting game against the first-place Current, who lead the NWSL in goals scored with 17.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful to do this maybe two or three more times this season, offering a student discount,\u201d Hallock said, suggesting that this promotion be more of a season-long initiative than a one-off event. Friday\u2019s \u201cCollege Night\u201d match against the Current kicks off at 7 p.m. And while USC may have the closest physical proximity to BMO Stadium, the Trojans won\u2019t be receiving any unearned favoritism. The club plans to cap off College Night festivities with an on-field picture for the students and alumni of the university that purchased the most tickets, with the school\u2019s logo featured on the video board in the background. And, according to Hallock, USC is not in pole position for the signature picture. \u201cAs of earlier this week when I asked, UCLA does have a bit of an edge,\u201d she said. USC fans in attendance will surely be hoping for the win-win of a \u201cFight On\u201d photo and three points for Angel City.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson, File)\n\nBy Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier April 24, 2024 at 12:48 pm PDT\n\nReggie Bush finally got back what he rightfully earned. The 2005 Heisman Trophy was officially reinstated to the two-time All-American running back, the Heisman Trophy Trust announced on Wednesday. The reinstatement occurred 14 years after Bush voluntarily forfeited the award in September 2010, following an NCAA investigation that concluded the star running back had accepted improper benefits near the end of the 2004 USC football season.\n\n\u201cWe are so thrilled to welcome Reggie Bush back into the Heisman family in recognition of his collegiate accomplishments,\u201d Michael Comerford, the president of the Heisman Trust said in a statement. \u201cWe considered the enormous changes in college athletics over the last several years in deciding that now is the right time to reinstate the Trophy for Reggie. We are so happy to welcome him back.\u201d\n\nWhile it will be a day for all Trojans to celebrate, the path to victory was not an easy fight for Bush. Bush\u2019s campaign to have his Heisman reinstated began in 2021 after the Supreme Court ruled that it was legal for college athletes to be compensated for their Name, Image and Likeness. He condemned the Heisman Trust in a statement in July 2021 for its decision not to reinstate him sooner, after the Trust would only agree to reinstate his trophy if the NCAA agreed to reinstate all his vacated records and accomplishments.\n\nDespite the Heisman Trust\u2019s decision, the NCAA has not announced any plans to reinstate any of Bush\u2019s vacated USC records or statistics. However, under pressure from fellow Heisman winners, including 2012 Heisman recipient Johnny Manziel, among other supporters of Bush\u2019s campaign, the Trust ultimately decided to return the Trophy to Bush.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m thrilled to reunite with my fellow Heisman winners and be a part of the storied legacy of the Heisman Trophy, and I\u2019m honored to return to the Heisman family,\u201d  Bush said to ESPN in a statement.  \u201cI also look forward to working together with the Heisman Trust to advance the values and mission of the organization.\u201d\n\nThe decision was warmly welcomed by USC President Carol Folt, athletic director Jen Cohen and head coach Lincoln Riley,  all of whom issued statements following the Heisman Trust\u2019s reversal , with Riley calling the occasion a \u201chistoric day.\u201d\n\n\u201cReggie\u2019s reintroduction to the Heisman Family is a special moment for every person that has been associated with USC football,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe are thrilled that Reggie\u2019s athletic accomplishments as one of the greatest to ever play the game can officially be recognized. For a long time, the Heisman and USC have been synonymous and being able to acknowledge all eight of our winners is extraordinary.\u201d\n\nWith his Heisman now reinstated, USC once again officially has the most Heisman Trophy winners of any school with eight. Bush is now also welcome back at the annual Heisman Trophy Ceremony each fall, where many expect him to be in attendance for the 90th ceremony in December.\n```"}

Riot police are said to be gathering at 36th and Vermont and waiting for DPS call to enter.\n\n11:43 A.M.: Members of the USC community received a DPS text alert reading: \u201cThere is significant activity at the center of the UPC campus due to a demonstration. There may be difficulty accessing that area.\u201d\n\n11:40 A.M.: DPS detained one protester, whose identity or student status is unclear. The crowd of protesters chanted \u201clet him go,\u201d while standing in the way of the car\u2019s path. Annenberg Media witnessed one officer with an LAPD badge and \u201cLAPD Southwest Detective\u201d shirt outside the car saying, \u201cIf the crowd is minimal, I can let him go.\u201d Annenberg Media also witnessed officers asking students for the name of the person detained. The officers have now reportedly let the protester go, receiving cheers from the crowd.\n\nAt 7 a.m. Wednesday, students from the USC Divest From Death Coalition began its occupation of Alumni Park in solidarity with Gaza. This occupation comes after USC\u2019s recent decision not to allow valedictorian Asna Tabassum to speak on campus. They join a growing number of college campuses nationwide.\n\nWhat began as a peaceful demonstration has now escalated. Neither DPS nor USC has yet responded to requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement, the coalition said it intends to continue the occupation until its demands are met. These demands include a \u201ccomplete academic boycott of Israel\u201d and to \u201cprotect free speech on campus,\u201d providing \u201cfull amnesty to all students, staff, and faculty disciplined, penalized, or fired for their pro-Palestine activism.\u201d\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, student protestors hung signs listing their demands and referring to the space as a \u201cliberated zone.\u201d Soon after, Alumni Park was flooded with DPS officers and students, with DPS attempting to drive a car through the crowd as students blocked it.\n\nIn an Instagram post, the USC Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation called for community members to join them in telling USC that \u201cwe will not stand for complicity in genocide.\u201d The post"}

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan April 24, 2024 at 11:48 am PDT\n\nEnglish Premier League viewership has grown tremendously across the U.S. in the past decade, and with it, so have fan clubs who brave pre-dawn treks to the pub to watch their favorite team.\n\nTaylor: Hey everybody, my name is Taylor, I am a Gooner \u2018til I die. I am the branch manager of Arsenal Los Angeles.\n\nBenjamin Vishaga: I\u2019m Benjamin Vishaga, I\u2019ve been an Arsenal fan since about 4 or 5 years old. Originally from the Netherlands but moved to London when I was 4.\n\nTaylor: Our group was officially founded in 2018, but the pub we meet at for our games \u2014 The Fox and Hounds in Studio City, California \u2014 has been an Arsenal pub for many, many years.\n\nVishaga: When I first moved to the US, it was actually the 2000s, so it was in the prime years of Arsenal. I didn\u2019t know how to watch the matches so I would follow the league in the newspaper. Eventually, I saw it was getting popular on NBC and starting to be able to watch the matches then, and I thought to myself \u2018there has to be a place where I can watch,\u2019 so, I found this pub.\n\nTaylor: Yeah, I mean, I think the pub we go to is a particularly special place. It\u2019s an English pub that was originally, to my knowledge, owned by an Arsenal fan. And if you talk to people around the world that have traveled to the United States and have traveled to Los Angeles and they\u2019re Gooners, they\u2019re familiar with The Fox and Hounds.\n\nVishaga: It\u2019s just like a family and all Gooners, we come here every week to watch the matches. And we\u2019re all texting each other throughout to see if we\u2019re gonna be there or not gonna be there, and if one of us is not gonna be there and something\u2019s happened, we\u2019re always there for each other. This group has become a real family and this place and the people makes it what it is.\n\nTaylor: Coming here, one of the things that\u2019s really special is that you will meet and mingle with Arsenal fans from all walks of life, from different age groups, from different locations. Ben, who\u2019s again to my right, is from North London. We have fans here from Jamaica, we have fans here from other parts of Europe and from all over America.\n\nVishaga: England... football is all about the banter, especially with the fans, we banter with each other. My initial thought coming here to America was that the Americans didn\u2019t banter like we do. However, the group that we have here at the pub, we banter like we do in England. That\u2019s another reason I love this place is that, everybody, no matter if you\u2019re American, you\u2019re European, you\u2019re British, you\u2019re an Arsenal fan and we\u2019re bantering together. We\u2019re chanting, we\u2019re singing and whether we win, whether we lose, we\u2019re there together supporting our team. When we say Arsenal \u2018til we die, I feel like this group is the Arsenal \u2018til we die group.\n\nTaylor: Football fandom in the United States and I think particularly the West Coast in a city like LA, it\u2019s very unique. I woke up at 3:30 in the morning today and I was here at 4:45 in the morning today, to hang out with some of my best friends. People that adore and that I see more than I see some of my own family and some of my best friends that I\u2019ve had since I was kids. I see these guys every single week and I love being here with them for the highs and for the lows. We\u2019re here every single week, no matter what time, big matches...\n\nVishaga: Rain or shine...\n\nTaylor: Rain or shine. We have like a little catch phrase, but it\u2019s \u201cup with the sun,\u201d and that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s special about West Coast fixtures, is we are quite literally \u201cup with the sun,\u201d it\u2019s not even out yet.\n```"}

(Photo by Kassydi Rone)\n\nBy Victoria Laursen April 23, 2024 at 7:50 pm PDT\n\nThe 2024 LA Times Festival of Books was held at USC this weekend, and while there was a wide range of genres featured, the children\u2019s book stage was a definite highlight of the event. The children\u2019s stage lineup was filled with authors and some illustrators doing live readings of their books and answering questions from the curious audience (mostly kids), who were eager to learn more about these must-reads. While all the books that were featured on stage offered a creative way to deliver their respective impactful message, there was a commonality among them. These novels shared a goal of introducing readers to the principle of appreciating diversity along with other significant life lessons.\n\nPhillipa Soo and Maris Pasquale Doran, authors of \u201cPiper Chen Sings\u201d\n\nActress and singer, Phillipa Soo \u2014 best known for originating the role of \u201cEliza\u201d in \u201cHamilton,\u201d \u2014 partnered with her sister-in-law, Maris Pasquale Doran to write a children\u2019s book that is inspired by a younger version of Soo. Soo\u2019s love for singing and music, and tendency to get nervous before performing in front of people led her to tell a story about a young girl, \u2018Piper,\u2019 and how her mentors help her overcome the butterflies in her stomach. The book also features a snippet of Chinese culture, exploring themes of immigration and the importance of learning family history. When asked what Soo hopes readers take away from the book, she says two things, \u201cFirst, I hope you enjoy reading this book. Second, I hope this book is used as a tool, and something that sparks conversation about emotions and how to handle them.\u201d\n\nShannon Hale and LeUyen Pham, author & illustrator of \u201cBubbly Beautiful Kitty-Corn\u201d\n\nThis superstar duo takes inspiration from their real life friendship, and shared their latest book in the \u201cItty-Bitty Kitty-Corn\u201d series, \u201cBubbly Beautiful Kitty-Corn.\u201d Hale and Pham talked about how this series has been a passion project for them, and has been in the works for about a year. The overall takeaway from this series is about celebrating the importance and magic of friendships, and letting those friends love you for exactly who you are. Pham gives a special nod to this message as the illustrator by ending every book with the characters, Kitty and Unicorn, somehow forming a heart. This book was a crowd favorite, with seats full of young readers who were excited and overcome with laughter hearing the latest Kitty-Corn adventure.\n\nTodd Parr, author & illustrator of \u201cBe Who You Are\u201d\n\nThe book that jumpstarted Parr\u2019s career, \u201cIt\u2019s Okay To Be Different,\u201d celebrated its 23rd anniversary. This book pushed boundaries for children\u2019s literature for its time of release in the early 2000s, by emphasizing that there\u2019s nothing wrong with needing a wheelchair, and broadly speaking to have a disability. In 2016, Parr released \u201cBe Who You Are,\u201d where he comforts readers on common insecurities. Reassuring that it is easier to be yourself and not pretend to be somebody else. \u201cSpeak your language\u201d and \u201cLearn your own way\u201d are mantras that appear to be straightforward, but these lessons are among the most forgotten when in a mindset of self doubt. As a bonus, Parr did a reading from one of his more recent books, \u201cThe Monster Mac and Cheese Party.\u201d This is one of Parr\u2019s more lighthearted books, and there is an inclusion to a plant based mac and cheese dish since Parr is a vegan. This quick mention encourages children to alternative ways to enjoy a kid friendly dish, and raises awareness about the plant based community.\n\nBess Kalb, author of \u201cBuffalo Fluffalo\u201d\n\nIn a charming story about a buffalo that learns the value of not suppressing your emotions and leaning on your community who will be there for you no matter what. Kalb noted that the character \u2018Buffalo\u2019 should act as a mirror for however the reader wants to see him, adding, \u201cWhatever lesson you take away from the story is the right one.\u201d The author mentioned that this book\u2019s purpose is to additionally transport readers to a scenic world filled with nature. Kalb grew up in a city environment and wishes to give other children growing up in the city a chance to envision the beauty nature has to offer.\n\nElle Duncan, author of \u201cFor You I Will\u201d\n\nSports journalist Elle Duncan took the opportunity to challenge herself by writing a children\u2019s book. Inspiration struck Duncan while writing a letter for her newborn daughter to read in the future. For Duncan this book is a pledge, the promises she made as a mother to her child. The book is more geared towards parents due to its elevated language. When asked how she envisioned her book affecting children who read it, and what should the reader take away, she said, \u201cI wrote this book with the intention of the parent reading this book to their children, then eventually the child will read it back to the parent.\u201d Duncan added, \u201cI cry when I read this book, so I imagine other parents cry as well.\u201d Historical Black figures are weaved into the story, making it another learning moment. This book pays noteworthy attention to Black parents raising Black kids, which Duncan said was important to her personally.\n\nRaj Haldar, author of \u201cThis Book Is Banned\u201d\n\nThe beloved children\u2019s book, \u201cP is for Pterodactyl\u201d was released by Raj Haldar in 2018. The book was loved by many, becoming one of the top two books on Amazon the week it was released (the number one book that week was \u201cBecoming\u201d by Michelle Obama). However, concerned parents quickly called for Haldar\u2019s book to be banned since it mentioned a Oujia board. This prompted Haldar to write his second book, \u201cThis Book Is Banned.\u201d The title of this book says it all, the story has no ending since everything got banned. Haldar made a public outcry to stop book banning, saying \u201cbans are on the wrong side of history,\u201d and \u201cbooks should be a window to others, not a mirror of ourselves.\u201d The overall message of the book is: \u201cEven if a book isn\u2019t for you, it could be perfect for someone else. If we only read books that we all agree on, we won\u2019t learn anything new.\u201d\n\nMeera Sriram, author \u201cThe Spice Box\u201d\n\nThis book transports readers into the different spices and flavors of traditional Indian culture in the U.S. The main character, \u201cRishi\u201d and his father share family stories through a spice box, handed down from generation to generation, in this tender picturebook. The author Meera Sriram grew up in India and moved to the U.S. as an adult. She drew from personal childhood experiences when it came to writing this story. Even though this story is rooted in Indian culture, Sriram wants readers to recognize that \u201cwe are more similar than different, we all share the same human fundamental experiences.\u201d Sriram\u2019s latest book not only acts as an accurate representation regarding Indian culture, but also educates others about the intricacies of spice boxes and family history.\n\nThese books mentioned above are just a small portion of the current books available for children now. An increasing amount of stories incorporate characters that are diverse and raise awareness about a certain specialty that\u2019s a part of their identity. Data conducted by the Cooperative Children\u2019s Book Center (CCBC) shows in 2023 that of the thousands of kids and teens books they reviewed, about 48 percent had a non-white author, illustrator or compiler, up from 24 percent in 2014. Close to all modern children\u2019s novels contain a message that is important to learn and practice at a young age.\n\nTessa Michaelson Schmidt, director of the CCBC said, \u201cThere are just so many more choices of books [reflecting] the multifaceted complexity of individual lives.\u201d\n\nOne of the leading publishing companies, Penguin Random House is doing their part to advance the diversity among all of their books that they publish. Their mission statement as a company is, \u201cWe make books for everyone, because a book can change anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy students are primarily Latino and African-American. I definitely have noticed that students are more inclined to read books if they see themselves represented in them,\u201d an avid attendee of the festival and a L.A. elementary school teacher, Mayra Tellez, said. \u201cI absolutely feel that representation matters in all stages of a reader\u2019s life, starting with board books for babies. When children see themselves represented in books, they are able to appreciate it on a personal level. I believe people should be exposed to all different types of lives in books, including your own.\u201d\n\nTeachers and readers have spoken. Readers respond well to stories that focus on different cultures and characteristics and spread positive messages. Although these books are intended for younger readers, the overall message is ageless. It\u2019s important to remind yourself of the simple life lessons that tend to be forgotten, but are the basis of a functioning society.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/23/tot-scouts-two-round-nfl-mock-draft/", "response": "```\nTOT SCOUTS: two-round NFL mock draft\n\nTalk of Troy\u2019s scouting team delivers their final two-round NFL mock draft.\n\nWith just two days remaining until the 2024 NFL Draft, the Talk of Troy\u2019s team of scouts have finished compiling their reports and are ready to present their final two-round mock draft. This mock draft was conducted with no trades, with individual members of the scouting team making each pick in the interest of the respective team. Descriptions were written by TOT writers and do not necessarily reflect the member of the scouting team responsible for said pick.\n\nRound 1\n\n1) CHI - Caleb Williams, QB, USC\nMALEY: No explanation is needed here. This pick has been all but guaranteed since the offseason began, and that sentiment was only bolstered by the Bears moving quarterback Justin Fields to the Steelers last month. The Bears make their second attempt at drafting their franchise passer in three years, although this time with a much-improved skill core.\n\n2) WAS - Drake Maye, QB, UNC\nLONDO\u00d1O: There\u2019s been incessant smoke marrying Heisman winner Jayden Daniels to the Commanders with this pick, but in this scenario, Washington stays put and selects the best quarterback on the board. With his intriguing combination of size, athletic ability, and arm strength, Maye has all the tools to develop into one of the league\u2019s top passers in the coming years.\n\n3) NE - Marvin Harrison Jr., WR, OSU\nHALLINAN: New England may need a quarterback, but drafting one would require the Patriots to let Marvin Harrison Jr. \u2014 perhaps the best wide receiver prospect since Calvin Johnson \u2014 slide down the board. Harrison is the complete package of size, agility and refined route running. Don\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s a Pro Bowler year one, even if New England\u2019s quarterback situation remains murky.\n\n4) ARI - Rome Odunze, WR, WAS\nKEVORKIAN: With Harrison off the board, Arizona turns to Rome Odunze, giving Kyler Murray his first big time weapon since DeAndre Hopkins. The Washington Huskies product will provide a much-needed spark to the Cardinals\u2019 passing attack with his diverse route tree and impressive contested catch ability.\n\n5) LAC - Joe Alt, OT, Notre Dame\nMALEY: The Chargers have a lot of options here, but with the best two receivers in the class off the board, Jim Harbaugh will go with the best available player. The Bolts could bump Rashawn Slater out to the right tackle spot (where he started 26 games at Northwestern) and let Alt stay at left.\n\n6) NYG - Malik Nabers, WR, LSU\nKEVORKIAN: While quarterback is in play for New York, they are in dire need of a true No. 1 receiver. Nabers brings elite speed, body control and ability to adjust at the catchpoint to an offense which lost its most explosive skill position player in Saqoun Barkley.\n\n7) TEN - Taliese Fuaga, OT, Oregon State\nKEVORKIAN: With Joe Alt off the board, the Titans select the Oregon State product. Not to be overshadowed by Alt, Fuaga possesses an elite frame, great hands, good pad level and is an explosive tackle who can be a franchise cornerstone in Tennessee for years to come.\n\n8) ATL - Dallas Turner, DE, Alabama\nMALEY: Atlanta takes the first defender in what will be an offensively-heavy first round, taking perhaps the most athletic defender in the draft. First-year head coach Raheem Morris will count on the Alabama product, who recorded 10 sacks and 53 total tackles in 2023, to bring a spark to his defense.\n\n9) CHI - Olumuwiya Fashanu, OT, Penn State\nKEVORKIAN: With a new franchise quarterback in town, it\u2019s vital for Chiago to protect his blindside. Fashanu is a freak athlete who possesses great hands and incredible fluidity throughout reps as Chicago adds yet another piece to its offense this offseason.\n\n10) NYJ - Brock Bowers, TE, Georgia\nKEVORKIAN: The Jets give Aaron Rodgers yet another weapon in Bowers, who could work as a security blanket due to his exceptional athleticism, YAC ability and high motor. Adding him to an offense that already features weapons like Garrett Wilson, Mike Williams and Breece Hall will surely provide Rodgers with enough firepower to command an elite offense.\n\n11) MIN - Jayden Daniels, QB, LSU\nMALEY: With Washington taking Maye and New England going receiver, the Heisman winner falls out of the top 10. Minnesota stays put despite the trade rumors and still grabs their franchise passer.\n\n12) DEN - Terrion Arnold, CB, Alabama\nKEVORKIAN: The Broncos pair Patrick Surtain II with a fellow Crimson Tide cornerback product. Arnold\u2019s impressive frame, tackling and aggressive playstyle will give Denver one of the most intriguing young cornerback duos in football.\n\n13) LV - Michael Penix Jr., QB, Washington\nKEVORKIAN: Vegas looks past Penix\u2019s age and injury history, taking a swing at him in hopes of finding their franchise quarterback. His deep ball accuracy, arm strength, pocket presence and underrated athleticism have all the makings for a very good pro-level quarterback.\n\n14) NO - JC Latham, OT, Alabama\nLONDO\u00d1O: The Saints badly need a tackle, with the Trevor Penning experiment not working out and long-time right tackle Ryan Ramcyzk struggling with major injuries in recent seasons. The Saints address their need with JC Latham, a mountain of a man with great size and rare power. Latham projects as the ideal right tackle but could also slide inside to guard if needed.\n\n15) IND - Brian Thomas Jr., WR, LSU\nLONDO\u00d1O: In recent years, the Colts\u2019 draft philosophy has been clear: bank on traits. The trend continues with the selection of LSU wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr., who, at 6030 and 209 pounds, posted a 4.33 forty and 38.5 vertical jump at the combine while accounting for over 1000 yards and 17 TDs in 2023. Thomas can stretch the field, generate YAC, and has the athleticism to consistently beat NFL-caliber corners.\n\n16) SEA - Byron Murphy, DT, Texas\nLONDO\u00d1O: After hiring a defensive head coach in Mike MacDonald earlier in the offseason, the Seahawks boosted their D with their first pick and took Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy, the best interior defensive lineman in the draft. While slightly undersized, Murphy\u2019s combination of burst, wiggle, and power is too intriguing to pass up.\n\n17) JAX - Adonai Mitchell, WR, Texas\nHALLINAN: While his ability to separate and route-running leave something to be desired, Mitchell has a combination of size, speed and ability at the catch point that few receiver-needy GMs can afford to pass up. At 6-foot-2 and 205 pounds, Mitchell wowed scouts with his 4.34 40-yard dash at the Combine and, in Jacksonville, he could immediately be Trevor Lawrence\u2019s top target.\n\n18) CIN - Troy Fautanu, OT, Washington\nKEVORKIAN: It seems Cincinnati has had it all offensively during the Joe Burrow era besides a consistent offensive line. Fautanu\u2019s athleticism, power and length will help protect Burrow\u2019s blindside for years to come.\n\n19) LAR - Jer\u2019Zhan Newton, DT, Illinois\nMALEY: Newton will step into big shoes in Los Angeles following Aaron Donald\u2019s retirement. The standout tackle recorded 7.5 sacks for Illinois in 2023, production the Rams will hope he can reproduce at the next level.\n\n20) PIT - Amarius Mims, OT, Georgia\nLONDO\u00d1O: With other-worldly potential due to his size and athleticism but lack of experience (he only has eight collegiate starts), Amarius Mims is best served going to a team that won\u2019t feel the need to start him immediately. The Steelers thus make perfect sense; former teammate Broderick Jones, who was also a mid-first-round selection in 2023, was allowed a redshirt year. In this scenario, project Mims to sit and develop into one of Pittsburgh\u2019s tackles of the future.\n\n21) MIA - Laiatu Latu, DE, UCLA\nKEVORKIAN: Miami strikes gold with the highest touted pass rusher of the draft. With Jaelan Phillips and Bradley Chubb coming off of significant knee injuries, Latu adds incredible quickness, body control and a high motor to the Dolphin\u2019s defensive line.\n\n22) PHI - Quinyon Mitchell, CB, Toledo\nKEVORKIAN: With Darius Slay only getting older and James Bradberry seeing a major falloff, Philly gets some much-needed help in the secondary. Mitchell\u2019s athleticism and physicality should bring more production and youth to an Eagles defense that struggled to defend the pass last year.\n\n23) MIN - Jared Verse, DE, FSU\nKEVORKIAN: With Danielle Hunter leaving for Houston, Minnesota brings in some young juice to an otherwise uninspiring set of pass rushers outside of Jonathan Greenard. Verse\u2019s athleticism, bend and explosive first step should make for a productive rookie season.\n\n24) DAL - JJ McCarthy, QB, Michigan\nOCA\u00d1AS: It is no secret that Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott and the front office are mulling a new contract. After eight years with the organization, the three-time pro bowler has only coughed up three playoff wins. Coming off a national championship run with Michigan, McCarthy brings championship pedigree to an organization that hasn\u2019t scratched a championship game since 1995.\n\n25) GB - Nate Wiggins, CB, Clemson\nMALEY: Green Bay came into this offseason in desperate need of some help in the secondary. After filling the safety spot by signing Xavier McKinney last month, Green Bay gets it from the fastest DB in the class.\n\n26) TB - Jackson Powers-Johnson, OC, Oregon\nKEVORKIAN: With Ryan Jensen retiring after last season, Tampa selects his successor in Powers-Johnson. His athletic ability and power should seamlessly fill in the void Jensen left for a team that found major success running the football late last year.\n\n27) ARI - Graham Barton, OT, Duke\nKEVORKIAN: After grabbing him a weapon in Rome Odunze, Arizona\u2019s top priority should be to protect Kyler Murray coming off of an ACL tear. Barton should slide in nicely opposite side of 2023 first-round pick Paris Johnson Jr.\n\n28) BUF - Troy Franklin, WR, Oregon\nKEVORKIAN: With Stefon Diggs\u2019 seemingly inevitable departure from Buffalo finally coming to fruition, the Bills add a speedy receiver with underrated route running ability to help Josh Allen stretch the field.\n\n29) DET - Kool-Aid McKinstrey, CB, Alabama\nKEVORKIAN: Detroit pairs newly signed corner Carlton Davis with the Bama product who shows great length, fluidity and quickness to strengthen a secondary that struggled against the pass in 2023.\n\n30) BAL - Kingsley Suamataia, OT, BYU\nKEVORKIAN: After trading Morgan Moses to the Jets, Baltimore adds to its offensive line. Suamataia\u2019s athleticism and size allows him to get to the second level and create running lanes, something Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry will surely appreciate.\n\n31) SF - Chop Robinson, DE, Penn State\nLONDO\u00d1O: Robinson makes ideal sense for the 49ers, who love to line up their rushers as true, wide-nine edges in their staple 4-3 front. While developmental due to his below-average run defense ability, Robinson has bottomless potential thanks to his rare first step and bend.\n\n32) KC - Tyler Guyton, OT, Oklahoma\nKEVORKIAN: The Super Bowl champions saw inconsistency at the tackle position all season with Jawaan Taylor seemingly accounting for a penalty every other snap. Guyton provides an elite frame and exceptional power, helping protect Patrick Mahomes for years to come.\n\nRound 2\n\n33) CAR - Ladd McConkey, WR, Georgia\nMALEY: In a stacked class, McConkey is one of a number of talented receivers who will make it out of the first round. Carolina will hope for McConkey to fill an aging Adam Thielen\u2019s (33) shoes.\n\n34) NE - Bo Nix, QB, Oregon\nKEVORKIAN: After passing on a quarterback at No. 3, New England takes a swing at Nix in the second.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nBy Quinten Seghers, Dylan Luden, and Keira McNamara\nApril 23, 2024, at 6:33 pm PDT\n\nWith the spring semester winding down, pro-Palestinian encampment protests are popping up on university campuses across the U.S. In California, there are now encampment demonstrations at UC Berkeley and Cal Poly Humboldt. The encampments at various universities started over the past two weeks, with students at Columbia University being among the first to protest. Columbia asked police to disperse the encampment and 113 people were arrested, according to NBC News. The arrests, however, were not successful in getting Columbia students to disband their encampments. After the arrests, students rebuilt the encampment and made it even bigger, according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cIf administrations [arrest their students], they\u2019re feeding fuel to the fire,\u201d said Nitya Kashyap, a second-year transfer student majoring in computer science. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing more attention to it, which is exactly what the students want ... If they\u2019re going about it peacefully, I don\u2019t see a problem there.\u201d\n\nKrupa, a 2021 USC alumna who declined to give her last name due to privacy concerns, said Generation Z is \u201cnot pleased\u201d with the world they are inheriting. While protesting in support of Black Lives Matter in 2020, she said she was shot by a police officer\u2019s rubber bullet.\n\n\u201cI think police departments are notoriously extremely violent,\u201d Krupa said. \u201cTo call them on your own student body is pathetic. And I think they\u2019re not being subtle about who they actually work for, these institutions are not for the student. They don\u2019t want to protect the students.\u201d\n\nThe pro-Palestinian encampments have rapidly spread to other college campuses. Students at UC Berkeley, New York University, and Cal Poly Humboldt have held impassioned protests in support of both Palestinian rights and those who have been arrested for protesting, according to Time. There have been numerous protests at USC since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, but no encampments so far. The campus hasn\u2019t been without controversy though, as many protests have been held to protest the University\u2019s decision to cancel 2024 Valedictorian Asna Tabassum\u2019s commencement speech. The decision, announced via a campus-wide letter by Provost Andrew Guzman April 15, made international headlines. In the letter, Provost Guzman cited security threats as the sole factor behind the decision and doubled down on that stance in a meeting with the Academic Senate Wednesday. Tabassum, who has given numerous interviews to news outlets, told CNN that \u201cthey did not tell me about any specific threats.\u201d\n\nMany believe that this decision resulted from Tabassum\u2019s pro-Palestinian activism in combination with backlash from pro-Israel groups at USC. Trojans for Palestine and USC Graduate Students for Palestine, alongside four other accounts, issued a joint statement in support of the Columbia encampments and the arrested students on Instagram Sunday.\n\n\u201cWhile witnessing the violence Columbia students are enduring in their just cause, we at USC are fighting our university\u2019s unprecedented decision to revoke Class of 2024 Valedictorian Asna Tabassum\u2019s commencement speech,\u201d their post reads.\n\nKrupa commented on the Instagram post and said that just releasing a statement in solidarity with Columbia\u2019s students is not enough, and that Trojans need to start an encampment on campus as well.\n\n\u201cI think more west coast schools need to [make encampments],\u201d Krupa said. \u201cUSC is notoriously a school that is shrouded in scandal and wrapped up in always being on the wrong side of things ... I don\u2019t think they\u2019re not going to do it, it\u2019s a matter of when.\u201d```"}

Many have criticized the album, saying it\u2019s \u201cboring\u201d and \u201ctoo long.\u201d\n\nFirst year econ major Lena Hwang offers her perspective on the album.\n\nLena Hwang: I\u2019m not gonna lie, I listened to it and I thought it was pretty mediocre. I could not tell you any of the songs that stood out to me, which is kind of sad I am a huge Taylor Swift fan. I usually like a lot of her albums. I did Defend Midnight. Um, but this one, none of those songs made it onto any of my playlists.\n\nOn campus many self-proclaimed \u201cSwifties\u201d have not listened to the album yet, but sophomore public relations major Cal Miller shares why you should.\n\nCal Miller: I think it\u2019ll break streaming records, but she\u2019s definitely not trying to appeal to like, her like Fearless, 1989, Folklore, Midnight\u2019s audience anymore. Um, I think it just feels very different than the first ten. ... I think that she\u2019s just writing what feels authentic to her and then like letting the world hear what she\u2019s been making ... I think that she\u2019s just going to start publishing albums that are more authentic to where she\u2019s at and like less what the world wants to hear.\n\nFans are criticizing Swift\u2019s vinyl release because she promised 4 exclusive songs on the record, but ended up releasing the exclusive songs on her double album for the public to hear. Some fans feel ripped off, but Miller respects her marketing technique.\n\nMiller: I mean, I already bought the vinyl. At the end of the day, she knows that people are probably going to buy them anyways, so I don\u2019t really, I don\u2019t know, I think that the marketing tactic is really smart and I feel like she\u2019s kind of at a point where it\u2019s not like people are going to send back the original, um, that they bought. So, I don\u2019t know. I think she\u2019s in a very different level where she doesn\u2019t really have to follow the rules of everybody else and she can kind of just put out what she wants.\n\nAnnenberg radio sat down and interviewed longtime music and culture journalist Rachel Brodsky and got her opinions on the album\n\nRachel Brodsky: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an example of Taylor Swift\u2019s best work but I can see how this is where we would arrive in terms of her output. ... I just I find it long, unedited with like moments of true brilliance, like I think, like two of the best songs on the album are \u201cI Can Do It With A Broken Heart,\u201d and \u201cBut Daddy, I Love Him.\u201d I think those are two really great songs. But like, in general it\u2019s, it\u2019s, I think it\u2019s kind of a trudge and a slog.\n\nBrodsky relates Swift\u2019s starpower to the rise of internet, and compares her to some of the great music entities in pop culture.\n\nBrodsky: It\u2019s just that I think in Taylor world right now, more is more, more will guarantee more record sales more streams, because that\u2019s the economic ... formula for success now is to release more. However, I think it\u2019s very tricky. Overall, like, there, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real precedent for a pop star of of Taylor\u2019s stature, at this point in history. I think like, you have the Beatles, you\u2019d have Michael Jackson, you have Madonna, but I think with the sort of the power of social media and the internet, like Taylor has harnessed something that has never really existed before, and I think that\u2019s brought up new, new challenges for her as she writes about.\n\nShe explains the pros and cons of having such a wide grip through her online presence.\n\nBrodsky: But as someone who has become enormously successful, just in part because she\u2019s such a savvy business person and harnessed social media and the Internet to like, create the biggest fan army that\u2019s I think ever existed that they are with that comes the good and, and the bad. I mean, the good is you get this enormous economic power and but at the same, by the same token, you also land in this place that no one\u2019s ever know, no one\u2019s ever experienced, like, I don\u2019t think anyone can really claim to know what it\u2019s like to be her because no one\u2019s ever been her.\n\nAnd she has the chance to add more broken records to her collection. According to Billboard, \u201cIf the Tortured Poets Department debuts atop the billboard 200, it will mark Swift\u2019s 14th no. 1 album, extending her record for the most among women. She would also tie Jay-Z for the most no. 1s among soloists.\u201d\n\nAs the finals frump looming over campus reflects the feelings of the album, just remember to have a cruel summer.\n```"}

Over the years USC has sent over 500 players to the NFL, with this year\u2019s draft having the potential to make USC history. USC has had five players be the first pick in past drafts, and Caleb Williams is showing signs of being the sixth to do so.\n\nDaniel Steiner, a sophomore majoring in business, expressed his excitement for Williams\u2019 potential. \u201cI think he\u2019s a great player, obviously. Coming to [USC] is fun, watching him play in person. I think he\u2019s gonna be a great quarterback,\u201d Steiner said.\n\nDespite overall excitement for this year\u2019s draft potential, some controversy surrounds Williams, ranging from character issues to his father\u2019s management of his career. USC professor and Fox Sports radio host Rob Parker argued that a player\u2019s ability to play on the field far outweighs what he does off the field.\n\n\u201cThere has been too much over-analyzing of him,\u201d Parker said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to like everything that he\u2019s done. I just think sometimes people are looking for something, and they want to push a different narrative. It\u2019s ultimately about your tape,\u201d he said, referring to his ability on the field.\n\nIf Williams is drafted with the first overall pick on Thursday, USC would beat out Oklahoma, Notre Dame, and Georgia for the most No. 1 draft selections by a school in NFL history. Williams would be the second former USC quarterback to be selected with the first pick after Palmer was picked by the Cincinnati Bengals in 2002.\n\n\u201cIt is a rich draft class coming from USC,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWhenever you get the [potential] number one pick to lead the way, that speaks volumes for your program.\u201d\n\nWilliams, as well as the other 10 Trojan prospects, will look to join 27 other Trojans who are currently on NFL rosters. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see where they land and see how they perform in the NFL,\u201d said Tristan Rinko, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering.\n\nSome notable former Trojans who were picked number one in the draft include Keyshawn Johnson, Carson Palmer, and OJ Simpson.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see where everyone ends up,\u201d said current USC linebacker and redshirt sophomore Roman Marchetti, who majors in journalism. \u201cThis year, there is still a lot of talent across the board, especially from USC. We got a lot of guys going [to the draft], and I am just pumped up to see where they end up.\u201d\n\nMarchetti said told Annenberg Media that he feels grateful for what he has learned from those who have declared the draft. \u201cJust great guys on and off the field,\u201d Marchetti said. \u201cIt\u2019s just fun being on the same field as them just because of how talented they are.\u201d\n\nKeep your eyes peeled for when these Trojans get their names called this week: quarterback Caleb Williams, running back MarShawn Lloyd, wide receiver Tahj Washington, wide receiver Brenden Rice, safety Calen Bullock, defensive end Solomon Byrd, running back Austin Jones, offensive tackle Jarrett Kingston, center Justin Dedich, linebacker Shane Lee and cornerback Christian Roland-Wallace.\n```"}

After USC announced it would cancel Valedictorian Asna Tabassum\u2019s commencement speech, the committee switched focus. The committee was originally scheduled to meet to finish drafting a cover letter for their report. This changed into a meeting with Provost Andrew Guzman, according to Jihad Turk, who served on the committee before resigning on Friday.\n\nIn an hour-long meeting, according to Turk, committee members questioned Guzman about the specific safety concerns that led to the speech\u2019s cancellation and whether the university had attempted to provide adequate security for commencement before finalizing the decision. Eleven members resigned in protest on Friday, including all of the committee\u2019s Muslim members. Resigning members of the committee informed the university of their decision through a direct email to the president, according to Turk.\n\nThe 10 members other than Turk who resigned have not yet been identified by Annenberg Media. \u201cIt was clear that there was no support for the student in terms of giving her a platform and investing in measures that would need to be taken to ensure that there was a secure commencement for her and everybody else,\u201d said Turk, who received his doctorate from the Rossier School of Education last year.\n\nThe resigned members will release a full letter providing more information on their decision during a press conference on Thursday, according to an Instagram post from USC\u2019s Muslim Student Union. The university declined to comment until after ACML shares more details about the resignation.\n\n\u201cThe provost indicated to [Tabassum] that they do have the capacity to create a secure environment, but they chose not to because it would send the wrong message,\u201d Turk said. \u201cWe felt that rescinding the offer for her to speak is sending the wrong message.\u201d The committee asked what the exact safety concerns were but no details were provided on \u201cany specific threats,\u201d according to Turk. \u201cThey just said that there was a large volume of vitriolic responses.\u201d\n\nThe ACML was convened by President Carol Folt in the spring of 2023 to combat Islamophobia on USC\u2019s campus and better support Muslim students, faculty and staff, according to USC\u2019s website. At its inception, the committee had 19 members. During the spring and summer of 2023, the committee held five meetings, developing \u201ca set of actionable recommendations to support Muslim life on campus across disciplines and domains,\u201d according to its website.\n\nFatema Bhaiji, a sophomore majoring in narrative studies, said she thinks that committees like the ACML are vital at USC but also supports the members\u2019 decisions to resign. \u201c[The committee] is definitely necessary because it allows for students\u2019 and faculty\u2019s voices to be heard. It\u2019s hard to go through five different layers of admin to get something done,\u201d said Bhaiji, a member of the Muslim Student Union. \u201cWhen there are faculty advocating for you, it\u2019s much easier.\u201d\n\nBefore resigning, Turk said that one committee member had a one-on-one conversation with President Folt, in which she indicated the decision on the valedictorian\u2019s speech would not be changed. After this phone call, members of the committee decided to resign. Turk questioned why an alternative method for the speech had not been provided, like a pre-recorded message, if the only concern is with security and not with the content of the valedictorian\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201c[The committee] was extremely disappointed in what seems to be a complete lack of interest in showing support to the valedictorian in the face of criticism from those who wanted to silence her,\u201d Turk said.\n```"}

Lawmakers contend the app's owner, ByteDance, is beholden to the Chinese government, which could demand access to the data of TikTok's consumers in the U.S. (Photo courtesy of AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nBy Curran Rastogi April 23, 2024 at 5:16 pm PDT\n\nArija Martin, a junior studying international relations, has to limit her TikTok use to once or twice a week to prevent herself from scrolling through the app for hours. Siena Woolf, a freshman studying business administration, uses TikTok to decompress from a long day of classes and distract herself from work. Greg Martinez, a freshman studying biochemistry, uses TikTok to watch the latest sports highlights and learn a little more about the world around him. However, if a bill \u2014 which some political experts believe is likely to pass the Senate this week \u2014 is placed on the desk of the president, Martin, Woolf, Martinez and more than 170 million Americans are going to have to find a different social media platform to use.\n\nOn April 22, the House of Representatives passed a bill stating that Chinese company ByteDance would have nine months to sell TikTok or be banned in the U.S. This bill is a revised version of one that the House passed on March 13. It proposed to ban the social media app if ByteDance did not find a seller in 180 days after the bill was passed. On March 8, President Joe Biden told reporters that if the bill passed through Congress he would sign it. The new bill extends the time to sell the company with an option for the president to extend the timeframe to a full year and was combined with aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, The bill was added to \u201csweeten the deal\u201d for conservatives and pass the larger aid package. Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI), one of the bill\u2019s main sponsors, said in an address to Congress on March 13 that TikTok\u2019s Chinese owners could threaten the security of American data and influence its citizens. \u201cTikTok is a threat to our national security because it is owned by ByteDance, which does the bidding of the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cWe know this because ByteDance leadership says so and because Chinese law says so.\u201d\n\nProfessor Clifford Neuman, the director of USC\u2019s Center for Computer Systems Security, said the ban is not the most effective way to reduce the risk of Chinese interference in American data. \u201cThere are other ways that people get at this data. In particular, we\u2019ve had data breaches at all of the other social media sites,\u201d Neuman said. \u201cThey could find it on the dark web or could have their hackers break into any of these other sites or things like that, so [the bill is] not really an effective solution to that particular problem.\u201d\n\nNeuman agrees that TikTok\u2019s ranking algorithm is concerning. He said Chinese control of the app could lead to a situation \u201cwhere [TikTok] has more authority to censor things within the U.S. than even the federal government does.\u201d\n\nBanning TikTok could create a host of its own problems, whether it be hurting small businesses that advertise on the platform or the free speech concerns that students and experts have raised. Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-CA) cited small businesses as a reason he voted against the first bill in a statement released on X (formerly Twitter). \u201cSmall businesses and creatives across L.A. make their livelihoods out of content creation,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nTikTok and other social media platforms have been widely used as tools for sharing breaking news or information on world events for young people. \u201cThis ban always seems to come up when there\u2019s been a mass spread of information about the U.S. government or other government systems,\u201d said Martin, who watches dance videos and consumes nostalgic content on TikTok. \u201cI could be wrong, but I feel like this came right after people were advocating so heavily for Palestine and showing what\u2019s actually going on... versus what\u2019s being shown on the news.\u201d\n\nSarah Neff, a content strategist at the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative said that TikTok has also helped humanize certain events, allowing them to learn more about the world. \u201cI think you could learn more about lived experiences than you could in a more educational context,\u201d Neff said. \u201cPeople, they cut up videos to be shorter, so it\u2019s more consumable.\u201d\n\nNeuman disagrees with ByteDance citing free speech and information as reasons to keep the app operating in the U.S. \u201cWhile the argument might, in my view, make sense in sort of the constitutional framework here within the U.S., it\u2019s disingenuous in that already most U.S. social media apps are banned in China,\u201d Neuman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit funny, them crying foul on the free speech issue, but it\u2019s the fiction of trying to separate the company from the government that has control over the company.\u201d\n\nOne added benefit of banning the social media app could be alleviating some of the mental health concerns that the app brings. Lisa Dittmer, a researcher for Amnesty International, revealed in a report that TikTok can create problems in children\u2019s mental health. \u201cThe platform\u2019s algorithmic content recommender system, credited with enabling the rapid global rise of the platform, exposes children and young adults with pre-existing mental health challenges to serious risks of harm,\u201d Dittmer said.\n\nWoolf, who used to post on the app regularly, sees this content and these issues on her and her sister\u2019s For You pages as well. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve experienced, also through COVID, you can fall into a niche,\u201d Woolf said. \u201cAnd what young girls generally tend to fall into in the negative sense could be eating disorders, and it just bounces off of each other because of the algorithm.\u201d\n\nByteDance has said they will fight the ban in court if the bill were to pass, but if TikTok wasn\u2019t sold and the ban was to go into effect, what would it look like? The ban would not remove TikTok from all devices in the U.S. but would instead prevent the app from continuing to be downloaded and improved within the country. The bill prohibits \u201cproviding services to distribute, maintain, or update\u201d through an electronic marketplace (the App Store) and \u201cproviding internet hosting services to enable the distribution [and] maintenance\u201d of the app.\n\nThose who already have the app could keep it in its current form, but the company would not be able to fix any of the app\u2019s potential problems or update any features. Neuman said that in order to better protect American data, the industry as a whole needs to be better regulated, rather than singling out one company. \u201cWe need stronger regulations on what can be done and what can be collected and how that data is processed across the board, not just by TikTok, but by all social media sites, by data brokers and everything else,\u201d Neuman said.\n\nNeuman cites the GDPR as what the U.S. should do to better regulate big data companies. The General Protection Data Regulation (GDPR) is a sweeping piece of legislation that, among other things, limits the collection of personal data by entities and enforces transparency between data collectors, users and regulatory bodies.\n\nWhile the future of TikTok and other foreign-controlled apps is unclear, the banning of TikTok would be historic and likely an issue in the upcoming election.

(Photo by Kim Ly)\n\nBy Suzanne Schofield April 23, 2024 at 3:55 pm PDT\n\nZachariah Branch\u2019s progression and spring outlook\n\nUSC sophomore wide receiver Zachariah Branch has been making significant strides in his game this spring. Reflecting on his personal growth since joining the team, Branch highlighted the evolution of his game cognition.\n\n\u201cJust my football IQ, just understanding defenses and being able to pre-snap read certain things and basically change my route based off of certain coverages,\u201d Branch said.\n\nThis development signifies a crucial transition from merely executing plays to orchestrating them with finesse, a testament to his dedication to mastering the intricacies of the game.\n\nDespite his initial plans to pursue track and field alongside football, Branch ended up prioritizing football this spring. This decision underscores his understanding of the importance of cohesion and chemistry within the team, recognizing that every interaction \u2014 whether on the field or in the weight room \u2014 contributes to the collective strength of the unit.\n\n\u201cFootball is my primary sport,\u201d he affirmed. \u201cI wanted to make sure I was fully dialed in with the team this year. Getting chemistry with the right guys, the quarterbacks, the receivers, and just growing the camaraderie in the weight room.\u201d\n\nA year after winning the Jet Award \u2014 given to the top return specialist in the nation \u2014 Branch is continuing to refine his skills on special teams as well.\n\n\u201cSpecial teams, they actually have me on punt right now,\u201d he revealed. \u201cSo that\u2019s something I definitely want to get better at.\u201d\n\nHis willingness to embrace unfamiliar roles underscores his versatility and commitment to contributing to the team\u2019s success in any capacity.\n\nBranch\u2019s humility shines through as he deflects praise onto his teammates.\n\n\u201cI feel like all the guys are pretty much being developed properly,\u201d he stated. His focus remains steadfast on collective improvement, embodying the ethos of teamwork and shared success.\n\nIn Branch, fans glimpse the future of the team \u2014 a young talent driven by ambition, humility and a lot of speed.\n\nEarly high school graduates making their mark\n\nUSC\u2019s spring game served as an important debut for several Trojan newcomers, including a few true freshmen that enrolled early this semester.\n\nJarvis Boatwright, a promising safety, has impressed coaches and teammates alike with his rapid progression. USC secondary coach Doug Belk praised Boatwright\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still a high school kid right now that\u2019s going to prom and all those type of things,\u201d Belk said. \u201cHe\u2019s done a really good job getting acclimated from Florida to the West Coast. He\u2019s progressed tremendously throughout the spring.\u201d\n\nDespite his youth, freshman wide receiver Xavier Jordan\u2019s dedication to learning the playbook and honing his skills has not gone unnoticed by his coaches and teammates.\n\n\u201cXavier, he\u2019s tremendous every time,\u201d Belk said. \u201cComing in here a young guy ... just learning the plays and continuing to improve on every part of his game.\u201d\n\nWhile Jordan may need to add muscle mass to his frame, his advanced route-running capabilities position him as a formidable threat on the gridiron.\n\nA name consistently brought up throughout spring practice is Marcelles Williams. Known for his confidence and adaptability, the cornerback has quickly acclimated to the college level.\n\nAccording to teammate Makai Lemon, Williams has displayed a high level of confidence and has left behind any remnants of his high school days.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a solid dude, he came in as a real confident player,\u201d Lemon said. \u201cCame into college and he\u2019s putting on a great show every time he steps on the field.\u201d\n\nIn a statement reflecting on the potential of rising star Williams, head coach Lincoln Riley expressed optimism about the young cornerback\u2019s prospects for the upcoming season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s mature beyond his years. He is very calm. He never panics. He plays with great technique. He\u2019s the youngest of three brothers and a coach\u2019s kid,\u201d Riley said of Williams\u2019 background.\n\n\u201cGoing against everybody, I think he holds his own. So I\u2019m really happy with where he\u2019s at.\n\nThese early enrollees represent the future of USC football, as Saturday\u2019s spring game was just the beginning.\n\nUSC\u2019s defensive evolution\n\nAs the Trojans wrap up their spring practices, all eyes are on the defensive unit under the leadership of defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn.\n\nWith a new scheme in place, Lynn is focused on developing a cohesive identity for his defense.\n\nOne of the standout features of Lynn\u2019s defensive approach is its versatility and aggressiveness. According to redshirt junior cornerback Prophet Brown, Lynn\u2019s scheme incorporates disguises and various coverages akin to NFL-level defenses.\n\n\u201cI feel that versatility of being able to switch it up and keep the offense on their toes,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re not letting them dictate what we\u2019re running... we\u2019re coming after the offense.\u201d\n\nLynn\u2019s emphasis on attacking the ball and creating turnovers has resonated with the players, who have embraced their roles with enthusiasm.\n\nRedshirt sophomore safety Kamari Ramsey and redshirt senior safety Akili Arnold have emerged as leaders in the secondary after transferring during the offseason, embodying the staff\u2019s vision for a relentless and cohesive defensive unit.\n\nBelk explained how Ramsey and Arnold have risen to the top of the list in the safety room.\n\n\u201cThey just do everything the right way, he said. \u201cAkili and Kamari are both veterans, especially Akili \u2013 he\u2019s kind of asserted a large part of the leadership role.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Riley\u2019s commitment to fostering a close-knit team culture has been instrumental in building camaraderie among the players.\n\nDespite the turnover in coaching staff and roster changes, the team has come together with a shared sense of purpose and determination.\n```"}

The NBA has awarded the 2026 All-Star Game to the Los Angeles Clippers' new arena, which is set to open in time for the 2024-25 season. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nBy Victor Kevorkian April 23, 2024 at 3:36 pm PDT\n\nThe Intuit Dome, future home of the Los Angeles Clippers, is set to open its doors to basketball at the beginning of the 2024 NBA regular season. Bruno Mars will headline the first event in the arena with two shows on August 15 and 16. The 18,000-seat, $2 billion arena constructed by AECOM-Hunt Turner is just over a mile south of the Rams\u2019 and Chargers\u2019 home venue SoFi Stadium. The 26-acre site will include a practice facility, sports medicine clinic, team offices, retail space and a large outdoor plaza with basketball courts that will be open to the public.\n\nThe construction of Intuit Dome marks a landmark for the Clippers franchise, which has never technically owned its own stadium. The team has continuously rented its previous venues, dating back to its time as the Buffalo Braves in the 1970s. The organization has been a tenant of its current venue, Crypto.com Arena \u2014 formerly known as Staples Center \u2014 since 1999.\n\nWhile the opening of this extravagant arena may jumpstart an exciting new era of Los Angeles Clippers basketball, Inglewood residents feel it will only add to the ongoing gentrification of the area. Liliana Trejo, a lifelong resident of the city, said she felt \u201coverwhelmed\u201d since the announcement of Intuit Dome.\n\n\u201cMy reaction was like, \u2018Damn, we don\u2019t even have room to breathe,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe just got this one stadium [SoFi], and we\u2019re seeing the effects of having a billion dollar venue and what was happening to the city...so on top of that, it\u2019s like, boom, here\u2019s another stadium.\u201d\n\nTrejo explained that Inglewood residents felt they had no say in the arena\u2019s development. She recalled that during the preliminary discussions for SoFi Stadium\u2019s construction, community meetings were advertised to give residents a chance to voice their concerns and opinions. This time around, however, such meetings were not promoted, Trejo said.\n\nShe also expressed that she feels the Intuit Dome should fund projects that benefit the stadium, such as the upcoming Inglewood transit connector, an estimated $2 billion dollar plan.\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you pitching in to this thing?\u201d Trejo said. \u201cYou\u2019re the beneficiary but the mayor is securing federal funds. So it\u2019s like, pay your fair share, be a good neighbor like you claim you want to be.\u201d\n\nInglewood residents are not the only group to oppose construction of the Intuit Dome. Back in 2018, Madison Square Garden Co. filed a lawsuit against the city of Inglewood and Mayor James T. Butts Jr. The company, who owned the Forum at the time, claimed it was tricked into surrendering its lease to use vacant city-owned land for overflow parking at the Forum. Murphy\u2019s Bowl LLC, the company behind the Intuit Dome project, would countersue. Eventually, all disputes would come to an end after Clippers owner Steve Ballmer purchased the Forum from MSG for $400 million.\n\nTrejo is not the only resident who disapproves of the construction of Intuit Dome. Yaritza Gonzalez serves as co-founder and co-director of operations for the ING Fellowship, a local initiative that aims to guide and inform the local youth community about issues pertaining to Inglewood.\n\nWhen describing the ING Fellowship, Gonzalez said, \u201cWe\u2019re a grassroots organization that was founded by residents from Inglewood that were born and raised there that saw that there was a lot of changes happening to their hometown.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe realized that we wanted to have a space where young people, ages 18 to 30, can be able to organize and advocate around different social justice issues that are happening in Inglewood,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cIncluding, you know, gentrification...and to be able to advocate and find ways of learning how to do so.\u201d\n\nGonzalez shared her initial reaction to the announcement of Intuit Dome\u2019s opening in 2017.\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t understand why they needed so many stadiums in one location,\u201d she said. \u201cGiven that we already had the forum as a space and then the SoFi Stadium as another entertainment space, having another stadium given all the impacts that the other two were already having...I just didn\u2019t understand the logic behind it.\u201d\n\nGonzalez said she expects traffic and rising rent in Inglewood to worsen.\n\n\u201cSome people that live in that neighborhood can\u2019t even get to their houses in time, just because of how bad the traffic is,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents\u2019 house, which is where I used to live, is about five blocks away from the SoFi stadium. The freeway exit from the 405 is right by the stadiums...so to get out of the freeway and get to my house is just really difficult sometimes.\u201d\n\nGonzalez explained that residents and business owners have seen a rise in rent since the stadium\u2019s opening was announced.\n\n\u201cAs someone that would love to live in their own neighborhood, it\u2019s very challenging to do so when rent is so high,\u201d she said. \u201cI had friends that had to move out to other neighboring cities or further away because they just couldn\u2019t afford to live there anymore.\u201d\n\nThe city of Inglewood does have rent control. Rent can rise between three and 10% per year.\n\nGonzalez explained that she feels that residents of Inglewood are an afterthought when it comes to the construction of these massive venues.\n\n\u201c[I have] mixed feelings about the stadiums, just given the fact that there\u2019s just been a lot of false promises,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re the people, the residents that had lived there for years, and we are not able to reap the benefits that were supposedly promised by the city. It\u2019s really frustrating to see all these false promises of like, oh, like the community is going to benefit from all this like revenue that\u2019s gonna come in because of these stadiums.\u201d\n\nShe expressed that the ING Fellowship is continuously working to amplify residents\u2019 voices, particularly pertaining to this issue.\n\nErin Aubry Kaplan, a columnist who contributes to the Los Angeles Times opinion pages and lives in Inglewood, emphasized the detrimental effects stadiums in the city have had on people of color.\n\n\u201cThe people who are most vulnerable are the black and brown people who live here,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cInglewood was, for as long as I\u2019ve known it, a working-class city. Affordable. But it\u2019s no longer that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the city in LA county that has the largest Black population. It\u2019s like 40%, now it\u2019s dropping...it\u2019s like the symbol of the future of communities of color,\u201d Kaplan said.\n\nKaplan touches on the negative effects major stadiums have on Black communities in Inglewood in her recent column titled, \u201cWill \u2018all that glitters\u2019 turn L.A.\u2019s last solidly Black city white?\u201d.\n\nHer piece highlights the rise in housing in Inglewood since the stadiums began to roll in, with the median price of a home reaching $900,000.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s harder to pay rent in some instances than to buy a house [in Inglewood] because they just keep spiraling up,\u201d she said.\n\nKaplan also said that these billion-dollar stadiums are harming the schooling system in Inglewood.\n\n\u201cOur school district is imploding,\u201d she said.\n\nKaplan said that the Inglewood Unified School District has been receiving funding from the state since 2012 because of a decrease in student population. As a condition of that yearly loan, the school district is required to sell its land. She explained that more often than not, these sold land plots are used for developments that harm the community.\n\n\u201cMorningside High School sits less than a mile from Intuit Dome...that\u2019s land that\u2019s already being prepared for new housing. It doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d she said.\n\nKaplan expressed hope for the future, saying she wants to see development, but in partnership with the people of Inglewood.\n\nShe explained that gentrification is business-driven and is dictated by the market.\n\nSimilarly to Gonzalez and Trejo, Kaplan expressed her disapproval of the city\u2019s local government.\n\n\u201cYou know, the biggest cheerleader for all development is our own city government,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cOur city officials are telling us this is all wonderful for us, but we\u2019re experiencing something very different.\u201d\n\nIntuit Dome officials declined to comment for this story. Inglewood City Hall did not respond to request for comment.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/23/lakers-los-angeles-squanders-20-point-lead-nuggets-take-a-2-0-series-lead/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 The Los Angeles Lakers can\u2019t stop being tricked by the Joker and his henchmen. After the Lakers jumped out to a 20-point lead with 10 minutes left in the 3rd quarter, Jamal Murray capped the Nuggets\u2019 comeback by sinking a fadeaway jump shot at the buzzer to seal a 101-99 victory and give Denver a 2-0 series lead. British rapper Skepta puts it best for Lakers fans when he raps, \u201cbut it\u2019s like watching the film and you already know the ending,\u201d in his song \u201cSame Old Story.\u201d The team suffers from all the same issues that head coach Darvin Ham has failed to fix.\n\nSure, the Lakers had intensity from the tip off and they looked like a completely re-energized team compared to Game 1. Plus, D\u2019Angelo Russell\u2019s return to form as a three-point shooter made a huge difference. Eighteen of his 23 points came in the first half, with all of those first-half points coming from his six threes. In the first half, Anthony Davis cooked Nikola Jokic inside on offense and shut him down on defense. Davis was the leading scorer for both teams in the first half, dropping 24 on an outstanding 92% from the field, while Jokic was held to just 12 points in the opening 24 minutes, only making one shot from inside the arc.\n\nThe Lakers also had the requisite defensive intensity in the first half, applying pressure on almost Nuggets\u2019 every shot and not allowing them to find a rhythm. One of the fruits of the Lakers\u2019 first half defense was Jamal Murray\u2019s atrocious shooting performance. He had four points in the opening quarters while shooting 20% from the field.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s the NBA Playoffs; We know that Jokic and Murray thrive in late game situations and the duo stepped up once again. Murray and Jokic combined for 31 points in the second half, with both of them shooting a rock-solid 50%. Despite his lackluster start, Jokic finished with a historic performance, a triple-double consisting of 27 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists and two steals. It\u2019s the fourth time Jokic has dropped a 20/20/10 triple-double in the playoffs, which tied Wilt Chamberlain for the most in NBA playoff history.\n\nAnd the Lakers made the same mistake they\u2019ve been making all season long in the second half, especially the 3rd quarter: They took their foot off the gas when they needed to keep it on the pedal. When Davis had to be subbed out for a rest, Ham went with the same small ball lineup he played in Game 1 that consisted of Russell, LeBron James, Rui Hachimura, Gabe Vincent and Austin Reaves. That lineup should have considerable offensive firepower, but they obviously don\u2019t have the size to guard the Nuggets. This lineup is out there against Jokic, Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon\u2014three players with size who have the fluidity and shooting to absolutely punish a smaller lineup.\n\nAs such, the Lakers\u2019 defense kept faltering without a natural center, as James and Hachimura allowed Jokic to score with relative ease. Ham\u2019s lineup during the 3rd quarter is also perplexing when a seven-foot Jaxson Hayes stays on the bench, playing only six minutes.\n\nIn the post game press conferences,  Ham  and  James  blamed the refs for how the game ended when really they should blame themselves. Ham needs to figure out when to rest Davis and how his team should guard Jokic when Davis is out. Even though James had a fantastic fourth quarter with 12 points, he missed a wide open three-pointer that would\u2019ve given the Lakers the lead with 16 seconds left.\n\nA reasonable basketball fan could argue that even though the Lakers had a 20-point third quarter lead, the Nuggets are simply the better team and deservedly won the game despite the Lakers\u2019 best efforts. But as Ham\u2019s unimpressive defensive schemes show, the Lakers choked away a sizable lead when they should\u2019ve returned to Los Angeles with the series tied 1-1.\n\nThe Lakers\u2019 only saving grace is that their stagnant bench could potentially be revived with forward Christian Wood returning from injury and forward Jarred Vanderbilt targeting a return for Game 3. The potential addition of Vanderbilt in particular would help the Lakers in their desperate quest to slow Jokic down.\n\nThe Lakers will try to break the Nuggets\u2019 10 game winning streak against them on Thursday, April 25 at 7 p.m., back home in LA.\n```"}

But the media didn\u2019t cover these accomplishments. There is an issue of not only the lack of media coverage for Black players, but the way they\u2019re portrayed when they are covered. The disparity between the way Black and white players are covered was seen as clear as day in an LA Times article written by Ben Bolch.\n\nBolch\u2019s article was supposed to be about the LSU and UCLA March Madness game, but it just diminished the LSU women\u2019s basketball team instead. Bolch\u2019s article consisted of a bunch racist remarks on the predominantly Black LSU women\u2019s basketball team. He called UCLA \u201cAmerica\u2019s sweethearts\u201d while calling LSU \u201cdirty debutantes. Additionally, he compared UCLA to \u201cMilk and cookies\u201d and LSU to \u201cLouisiana hot sauce\u201d Also, he asked, \u201cDo you prefer the team that wants to grow women\u2019s basketball or the one seemingly hellbent on dividing it?\u201d His claim that LSU is diving women\u2019s basketball is completely false and he offers no explanation for this.\n\nIt\u2019s especially degrading that Bolch would say this when LSU star Angel Reese has been one of the most influential players growing the game. Reese used her stardom to shed light on other players as well, like Syracuse player Dyaisha Fair. When she was asked about what player she thinks is underrated, Reese called out the media for not giving Syracuse guard Dyashia Fair the recognition she deserves. \u201cShe didn\u2019t get a lot of publicity this year... [third] all time scoring and she didn\u2019t get that for whatever reason, but I think she deserved that and she played amazing this year,\u201d  Reese said.\n\nWhile her accomplishments weren\u2019t celebrated there were white players whose accomplishments were covered. The media loves to uplift white accomplishments, while ignoring Black ones. Bolch\u2019s article was a a perfect example of the incorrect way the media portrays Black female athletes. He compared Iowa guard Caitlin Clark and Reese asking if people prefer, \u201cThe tender star player or the one who taunts?\u201d Last year during the final four game against Iowa and LSU, Reese mocked Clark by using her hand-waving gesture and giving her the ring finger. This instance sparked outrage on social media.\n\nBecause athletes like Clark and many others are praised for trash talking. The media quickly painted Reese in a negative light saying that it was classless of her, but the real issue was apparent. Their issue isn\u2019t the trash talking, their issue is that she\u2019s Black. Black women aren\u2019t allowed to act the same way white women do and are continuously being reprimanded for the same actions their white counterparts are lauded for.. Clark can trash talk and is seen as a fierce competitor. Reese trash talks and is seen as classless and lacking sportsmanship.\n\nIowa has been portrayed as superior to teams that have predominantly Black players. Most recently, the South Carolina Gamecocks won the National Championship, an amazing feat that one would think would be covered vastly especially because of the boom in women\u2019s basketball this year. But, if I were a casual basketball fan and looked at the media, I would think the predominately white Iowa team won. Iowa got covered much more than any of the South Carolina team or players. Social Media accounts like ESPN and Bleacherreport have made more posts centered around the Iowa team and not talking about the real champions.\n\nWhile Iowa does deserve their flowers for a great season, it\u2019s no coincidence that they\u2019re being covered more than the South Carolina team. Moreover, South Carolina was being led by a generational talent in Coach Dawn Staley. With the championship win, she became the first Black coach with three Division 1 championship titles. Under Staley, not only did the Gamecocks win the national championship, they did it undefeated. They went 38-0, the 10th team in women\u2019s basketball history to achieve this. Staley deserves her flowers, just as much as any other coach, if not more.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame these Black players and coaches aren\u2019t portrayed in the media accurately or as much because Black women are the ones who have pioneered the game for a long time. Cheryl Miller, Maya Moore, Sheryl Swoops, just to name a few, are all Black women who have grown the game. Paige Bueckers, UCONN guard, acknowledged just how much Black women have paved the way in her 2021 ESPY\u2019s speech by saying, \u201cThey don\u2019t get the media coverage that they deserve. They\u2019ve given so much to the sport, the community and society as a whole and their value is undeniable.\u201d She continued, talking about the WNBA the season before: \u201c80% of the post-season winners were Black, but they got half the amount of coverage.\u201d\n\nThe media tells us who to pay attention to. It\u2019s time for the media to pay attention to the phenomenal Black players because they deserve it. If you\u2019re investing in women\u2019s basketball, make sure to invest in the Black players as well because that\u2019s who has been running it.\n```"}

(AP/Alex Gallardo)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner April 23, 2024 at 1:15 pm PDT\n\nEDMONTON, Alberta \u2014 The Kings trekked up north to try to steal Game 1 from the Oilers in the two teams\u2019 third-straight first-round matchup, but Edmonton had other plans. Winger Zach Hyman, who had the league\u2019s third-most regular-season goals with 54, posted his first playoff hat trick and center Connor McDavid notched a whopping five assists to give the Oilers a sound 7-4 win. Defenseman Evan Bouchard also helped lead the charge, tallying four helpers for Edmonton.\n\nPenalties plagued Los Angeles as the Oilers managed to convert three power plays into goals and racked up a flurry of shots to pressure goaltender Cam Talbot, who made 38 saves on 44 attempts. The Kings initially faced a 4-0 deficit heading past the midpoint of the second period before blueliner Mikey Anderson, whose last goal came way back on March 23, put LA on the board. Winger Adrian Kempe then scored off a deflection to cut Edmonton\u2019s lead in half with limited time remaining in the second to give the Kings much-needed momentum heading into the final frame.\n\nHowever, the Oilers came out swinging to begin the third and regained their four-goal lead just over six minutes after the period\u2019s start. The Kings attempted a comeback, with center Pierre-Luc Dubois wristing the puck at defenseman Darnell Nurse\u2019s skate, which skipped into the net, and winger Trevor Moore lighting the lamp with just over a minute left to make it a two-goal game, but Edmonton scored on the empty net and secured a three-goal victory.\n\n\u201cWe gave up too many rush chances,\u201d said Kempe. \u201cYou just can\u2019t be 1-for-4 on PK against such a dangerous power play.\u201d\n\nKempe led Los Angeles with two points, as he also assisted Dubois\u2019 goal, but the team suffered in its own end, allowing McDavid and Bouchard to create opportunities at will and set up the Oilers\u2019 stacked offensive front for chances. Besides Hyman, the team had four other goal-scorers: forwards Leon Draisaitl, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Adam Henrique and Warren Foegele. Netminder Stuart Skinner stopped 33 shots on 37 tries.\n\nLA and Edmonton\u2019s respective goal totals were each the highest in head-to-head matchups this year, as both teams had scored as many as four goals against each other in the prior games. In case the Kings were superstitious, they won Game 1 in both 2022 and 2023 against the Oilers, but lost both series, perhaps signaling a different outcome this time around.\n\nIn all seriousness, though, the Kings still have plenty of work to do to flip the script this year. Los Angeles\u2019 defense, which is usually its strong suit, completely broke down and will need to step up the rest of the way to allow the offense to perform.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to put that game in the past and get back to doing what we do best, and that\u2019s good two-way hockey,\u201d said defenseman Drew Doughty. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have a short memory and be ready to win the next one.\u201d\n\nGame 2 will also take place at Rogers Place, and Los Angeles will need to find a way to shut down the Oilers\u2019 offense to avoid a 2-0 start to the series. The action will commence at 7 p.m. on Wednesday.\n```"}

(AP/Rui Vieira)\n\nBy Marco Haynes April 23, 2024 at 12:11 pm PDT\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d is a column by Marco Haynes about the English Premier League in which he breaks down the week\u2019s three most consequential results.\n\nMartin \u00d8degaard\u2019s intelligent finish earns Arsenal a vital three points\n\nArsenal battled out a tense 2-0 victory over the Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux Stadium to climb atop of the Premier League table, at least until Manchester City plays its game-in-hand. In the first half, Wolves came close to taking the lead through midfielder Joao Gomes\u2019s shot inside the 18-yard box that Gunners\u2019 goalkeeper David Raya had to parry onto the crossbar. Just before the halftime whistle had blown, Arsenal forward Gabriel Jesus managed to keep hold of the ball after being surrounded by three Wolves players in the penalty box. The Brazilian played a pass to his teammate, Leandro Trossard, who slashed the ball past Wolves goalkeeper Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1's fingertips and hit the inside of the right side post to score.\n\nThe second half saw Arsenal control the flow of the game, limiting Wolves\u2019 chances of scoring an equalizer. In the 95th minute, \u00d8degaard, at the edge of the 6-yard box, shot from a tight angle to put the finishing touches on Arsenal\u2019s victory. After the club\u2019s elimination in the Champions League last week, Arsenal rebounded with a win and have momentarily captured the Premier League\u2019s top spot with the Gunners\u2019 sixth consecutive away clean sheet in the league and their 15th in total this season \u2014 the most of all PL clubs. Arsenal have also scored the game\u2019s first goal in 25 Premier League matches this season, meaning they consistently set themselves up for success. Trossard scored his ninth league goal and is tied-second among Arsenal\u2019s top goalscorers with Kai Havertz. Only Bukayo Saka has more than either with 14 Premier League goals\n\nArsenal returns to action in a London Derby against Chelsea on Tuesday at Emirates Stadium. After the defeat, Wolves remain 11th in the table and without a victory in their previous five Premier League matches, last winning against Fulham 2-1 on March 9. They have now lost their last six Premier League matches against Arsenal. Wolves next play Bournemouth at Molineux Stadium on Wednesday.\n\nOut-of-form Liverpool bounce back with a crucial win at Craven Cottage\n\nDiogo Jota sealed a much-needed 3-1 victory for Liverpool over Fulham to sit in second place, level on points with Arsenal at the top of the Premier League table but behind on goal difference. At the 30-minute mark, Liverpool right back Trent Alexander-Arnold curled a stunning free-kick at the edge of the penalty box, swerving the ball into the top left corner. Consequently, Liverpool dropped off its tempo before the halftime break, allowing Fulham to find an equalizer through fullback Timothy Castagne, who side-footed a loose ball inside the penalty area after it rebounded off Reds centerback Jarrell Quansah to score his first goal for the Cottagers.\n\nIn the second half, Liverpool came out with a point to prove. Midfielder Harvey Elliot intercepted Fulham winger Alex Iwobi\u2019s cross-field pass and rolled the ball to midfielder Ryan Gravenberch, who, in quick succession, curled his shot onto the right side of the net, regaining the Reds\u2019 lead. Before the full-time whistle, Jota latched onto Cody Gakpo\u2019s through ball inside the left of the penalty box and hammered a shot past Bernd Leno\u2019s finger-tips to complete the victory for Liverpool.\n\nThe Reds earned an important win and kept their title-win chances alive after a recent loss to Crystal Palace and a frustrating Europa League elimination at the hands of Atlanta. Liverpool has now won seven of its last nine Premier League matches on the road. Jota scored his 10th goal of the season against Fulham. The Portuguese forward also scored his 100th goal for English clubs, having scored 44 with Wolves before reaching a tally of 56 for Liverpool.\n\nA Merseyside derby against Everton awaits Liverpool, as the club travels to Goodison Park on Wednesday. Fulham stayed in 12th in the Premier League table and suffered its 16th defeat of the season, equalling its total number of defeats from the 2022-23 season, when the Cottagers finished 10th. They now have only one win in their previous five Premier League matches. Fulham returns to Craven Cottage Saturday in a London Derby against Crystal Palace.\n\nIdrissa Gueye and Dwight McNeil pull Everton away from the drop zone\n\nEverton eased its relegation worries in a 2-0 victory at Goodison Park against fellow drop-contenders Nottingham Forest, who now sit 17th. In the first half, Toffees midfielder Idrissa Gueye struck a low, long-range shot from outside the penalty box and found the bottom left corner after intercepting Forest fullback Ola Aina\u2019s headed clearance. Following the halftime interval, Forest began dictating the game, but couldn\u2019t put the ball in the back of the net, with Morgan Gibbs-White coming closest in a moment where he had acres of space inside the penalty area, but sliced his shot wide of Jordan Pickford\u2019s goal.\n\nEverton winger Dwight McNeil effectively wrapped up the match in the 76th minute, playing a one-two with teammate Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 at the edge of the box and striking a low shot that hit the inside of the post and redirected into the goal. The victory lifts Everton to 16th, five points clear of the relegation zone. Sean Dyche\u2019s men have now won two successive home matches for the first time this season in the Premier League. McNeil scored his third goal of the season in his 200th Premier League appearance.\n\nNext, Everton plays back-to-back home matches with the Merseyside derby against Liverpool on Wednesday preceding a game against 15th-place Brentford, who the Toffees could potentially overtake. After suffering a huge dent in their survival hopes, Nottingham Forest have just a one point advantage on 18th-placed Luton Town. While the squad will be agonizing over missed chances, Forest also feels aggrieved from poor refereeing decisions. Everton defender Ashley Young was at the center of three potential penalty calls that the referee did not award Forest. Young appeared to commit fouls on Forest players Giovanni Reyna and Callum Hudson-Odoi and also a handball inside the penalty box, but all incidents were waved away by referee Anthony Taylor, meaning VAR could not intervene. Nottingham Forest then posted a controversial Tweet post-match, insinuating that Taylor\u2019s known Luton Town fandom affected his refereeing. Forest will look to overturn their misfortune against Manchester City on Sunday at City Ground.\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

(AP/Seth Wenig)\n\nBy Nicci Barron April 22, 2024 at 9:26 pm PDT\n\nThe 2024 MLB season is already racing against the clock, or so it feels like. Some teams have gained momentum (and some are severely lacking it) and every club is at least 20 games into the season, meaning we have a small sample size of action to examine. Thinking back to my rankings during spring training, a lot has changed and there appears to be some leaders I originally left out. Here are my updated rankings for the top 10:\n\n#1: New York Yankees\nThe New York Yankees have a 15-8 record and rank second for the most wins in the league this season, behind only the Cleveland Guardians, who have a 16-6 record. With a .652 winning percentage, the team has significantly improved its projected standings, especially compared to its winning percentage last season, .506. While everything seems positive in the Bronx, the Yankees have lost an overwhelming amount of players to the injury list so short into the season. The most impactful loss is that of ace Gerrit Cole, who suffered elbow nerve inflammation during spring training but will not require Tommy John surgery. Cole has steadily improved in rehab and is expected to return in May. His comeback will give a much-needed boost to the Yankees\u2019 rotation.\n\n#2: Atlanta Braves\nDespite the Braves losing their previously held No. 1 spot to the Yankees, Atlanta remains a battle-tested franchise and that is proven to perform at an elite level when push comes to shove. Losing their ace Spencer Strider was an extremely unfortunate loss for the team at such an early point in the season, but things still look bright moving forward for the Braves. Atlanta is No. 1 in the NL East with a 15-6 record after this weekend\u2019s series against the Texas Rangers in which they won two of three games. Second baseman Ozzie Albies is set to return this upcoming weekend after being added to the 10-day injury list due to suffering a fractured right big toe. The three-time All-Star was cleared for batting practice before the April 22 game against the Marlins. His expected return is April 26, which marks the beginning of a weekend series in Atlanta against the Guardians.\n\n#3: Los Angeles Dodgers\nThe Dodgers\u2019 main issues revolve around the bullpen rotation and their current batting order but they are still favored to win a vast majority of their games this season. However, the team has lost its last three series to the San Diego Padres (1-2), Washington Nationals (1-2) and the New York Mets (1-2). \u201cI think it\u2019s just a bad week, I really do,\u201d said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts. \u201cBut with that, even with bad weeks, we still usually find ways to carve up a couple wins. But this week, we haven\u2019t. We usually play well at home; this week, we haven\u2019t.\u201d It may not be a surprise to avid baseball fans that the Dodgers are struggling to find consistency, but it is disappointing nonetheless. Were the millions of dollars spent during the offseason not enough to launch LA into greatness? Is Shohei Ohtani not the answer to all their problems? Only time will tell.\n\n#4: Baltimore Orioles\nSpearheaded by ace pitcher Corbin Burnes, the Orioles boast top-five stature again this year as they look to build upon last year\u2019s successes and surpass 100 wins in consecutive seasons. The MLB\u2019s top prospect Jackson Holliday, son of former MLB outfielder Matt Holliday, was called up to the majors on April 10 against the Boston Red Sox. His debut fell short of expectations and he continues to struggle with a mere .033 batting average. More often than not, an organization is only as good as its weakest link. In Baltimore\u2019s case\u2014despite the rookie\u2019s poor performance\u2014weak links are few and far between, as their culture appears to be one of preparedness and developed professionalism.\n\n#5: Cleveland Guardians\nThe Cleveland Guardians are off to a hot start this season and moving up to an extremely impressive (albeit early) record of 16 wins and six losses. This unexpected success comes as a complete surprise; the Guardians could not be found in the top 10 of most preseason rankings. According to Sports Illustrated, the team was ranked No. 21 in November. We will see how these rankings change moving forward, as Cleveland sets out to prove that it can sustain such a spicy start.\n\n#6: Milwaukee Brewers\nFormer Brewers manager Craig Counsell\u2019s contract ended after the 2023 season and so did pitcher Corbin Burnes\u2019. The team\u2019s president of baseball operations, Matt Arnold, questioned whether the right-hander was a right fit for Milwaukee. Both Counsell and Burnes left the Brewers for the No. 8 and No. 4 teams respectively. The Brewers appear to be doing well under the new management with a 14-7 record and a No. 1 rank in the NL Central. No. 2 Prospect and 20-year-old Venezuelan-born Jackson Chourio is off to a hot start, and surprisingly, so are the Brewers. After posting several impressive performances already this season, Chourio has cemented himself in MLB history as just the 4th-youngest player since 1900 with at least four home runs in their first 17 career games.\n\n#7: Philadelphia Phillies\nAn 8-8 start is not what the Phillies may have wanted, but after recent wins against the Colorado Rockies and Chicago White Sox, Philadelphia is riding high and showing glimpses of past glory as they conclude a flawless week. They may not be a top-five team yet, but they are knocking on the door at 15-8.\n\n#8: Chicago Cubs\nAfter signing left-handed pitcher Sh\u014dta Imanaga out of Japan, the Cubs are confident that their slithery move to acquire such a hot commodity can hopefully nudge their organization in the right direction. With only four starts so far, he has a 0.84 ERA, 0.75 WHIP and 21 strikeouts to begin his MLB career. \u201cI thought Shota pitched well,\u201d manager Craig Counsell said of Imanaga\u2019s recent performance against the Marlins. \u201cHe did a nice job, got us six innings in the second game with a doubleheader, which was great, and kept runs off the board. So, another good start. That\u2019s four good starts for Shota.\u201d Imanaga looks ready to propel Chicago\u2019s dark horse project to the promised land.\n\n#9: Kansas City Royals\nKansas City has fallen a few spots on most power rankings in the aftermath of a disappointing series against the Orioles. The team lost 9-7 on Saturday and was crushed by a 5-0 shutout on Sunday that ended their nine-game home winning streak. Nonetheless, they currently are riding above .500 and have proven to have a more complete roster going into the 2024 season as opposed to 2023.\n\n#10: Texas Rangers\nFalling five spots from my preseason power ranking, the Texas Rangers are being treated like underdogs and rightfully so. The team has had a slow start to the season, but things could turn around pretty quickly with the hopeful return of starting pitcher Max Scherzer. It has been less than five months after he had surgery to repair a herniated disk, yet he plans to return much sooner than anybody would have expected. The 39-year-old has been loosening up in the pen and could potentially begin a rehab assignment as soon as next week. \u201cWe\u2019re not ready to say a date, but we\u2019re looking at early May in being able to come back,\u201d said Scherzer when the Rangers were in Detroit earlier this week. After a lukewarm start to the season, the defending champs are looking to show that it\u2019s not about how you come out of the gate, but how you close in the end.\n\nThe first month of the regular season has already seen plenty of intrigue, including former No. 1 overall pick Holliday\u2019s debut and some broken records, like Ohtani moving past Hideki Matsui for most home runs hit by a Japanese-born Major Leaguer. Will week four see Ohtani break another record? Will Holliday find his groove and stay in the big leagues? Will the Rangers continue to climb up the ladder? We\u2019ll have to keep watching to find out.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/22/actor-and-singer-edison-chen-on-reaching-the-next-generation/", "response": "```\nCanadian-born Hong Kong actor and musician Edison Chen came to USC on Friday to speak to students for an AAPI Heritage Month event hosted by USC\u2019s Asian Pacific American Student Services (APASS). The L.A.-based artist got his start doing commercials in 1999, but would later appear in several movies, television shows and even a video game. His first film was Takashi Miike\u2019s \u201cDead or Alive 2: Birds,\u201d and later achieved acclaim with the \u201cInfernal Affairs\u201d trilogy, \u201cInitial D\u201d and his cameo in \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d He also created a global fashion brand named CLOT in 2003, which has collaborated with major brands like Adidas, Nike and Disney. Throughout these endeavors, Chen released music from 2000 until 2018. Primarily a rapper who performed in Cantonese and Mandarin, he has recently begun working on a new album that will debut entirely in English.\n\nChen talks about his experimentation with English lyrics and the songs\u2019 themes. He hosted a private listening session with a group of USC students where he played his latest iterations of the upcoming songs. Although he has experimented with translating some of the English lyrics to Chinese, Chen mentions the difficulty in conveying the same depth of emotions and ideas. \u201cI write English super duper easy,\u201d Chen said in an interview with Annenberg Media. \u201cMy first few rap albums were written by other people, so I had to learn it. I\u2019m still learning it. So, my expressive range is much wider in English than in Chinese.\u201d He hopes that this potential album can also serve as a \u201ctime capsule\u201d for his daughter to listen to when she is older.\n\nChen came to USC because he is looking to break into the Western music scene and wanted feedback from young people who understand him as a Chinese artist to provide sincere feedback on the early development of these new tracks. He explained that he is always finding ways to take what he learns from others and incorporate it into his artistic expression, including people like students. \u201cRight after COVID, I went back to China and I saw a lot of the youth and I saw the kids, and I made it a point to go and meet the youngest rappers, the producers, the photographers and everything,\u201d Chen said to Annenberg Media. \u201cI was amazed... so when I came back to America because I live here with my family, I thought \u2018I need to talk to these guys too, because in my mind, they were the same people, but we have maybe been given a different perspective.\u201d\n\nAfter the listening session, Chen appeared in a public meet-and-greet event where students met with the artist for a photo. CLOT collaborated with USC for an exclusive line of clothing featuring both brands. Fans had the opportunity to have Chen sign their merchandise while they snapped pictures together at the USC Bookstore. All proceeds from the event would be used to benefit APASS.\n\nBeing an artist of many expressive mediums, from acting on screen, recording new tracks and designing new clothes, Chen says the best way to approach creativity is to be authentic. \u201cIt\u2019s unfiltered,\u201d he said to Annenberg Media. \u201cThere\u2019s no lens, I don\u2019t have a manager, I don\u2019t have a music producer, I don\u2019t have a boss behind me saying \u2018Hey, this is what you should do, what you should wear,\u2019 and I think that it\u2019s a rare thing, especially in Asian entertainment.\u201d\n\nIn connecting with students and supporting groups like APASS, Chen shared the message he hopes to impart on the next generation. \u201cHave a reason, have a purpose to do something, don\u2019t do something just to do something,\u201d Chen said to Annenberg Media. \u201cI\u2019m talking about purpose in life, of why we\u2019re here, and everyone has to find their own purpose... It\u2019s not really what university you go to, it\u2019s not what job you have, it\u2019s what you\u2019re here for. Like, right now, my purpose in life is to be the best father that I can for my daughter, sure I\u2019m still doing music and I\u2019m doing all these other things, but that trumps everything, and I wake up at 5 a.m. and I\u2019m making breakfast for her and I don\u2019t feel bad at all.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, between his personal life and balancing a multifaceted career, Chen hopes to continue inspiring others through his art and values.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/22/college-basketball-catch-up-terences-too-hot-takes/", "response": "```\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d is a column by Terence Holton discussing the latest college basketball headlines. College basketball is still sadly over, but that doesn\u2019t mean my mind has not been running rampant with thoughts on the season. There are a few hot takes I have thought about in particular, and I see no better place to explain the inner workings of my thoughts on the 2024 college basketball season.\n\nThe 2024 UConn men\u2019s basketball team was the greatest of all time While UConn came into the season as one of the favorites to win the national championship, no one truly expected them to go back to back, especially as they lost their three best players in Andre Jackson Jr., Adama Sanogo and Jordan Hawkins. However, the Huskies were statistically much better than their 2022-23 side, which did not lose a single nonconference game. UConn finished with the highest margin of victory in NCAA Tournament history, outscoring opponents by a total of 140 points and winning by an average of 23.3 points. This included a 25-point win over No. 3-seeded Illinois \u2014 a game where UConn went on a 30-0 run \u2014 and a 30-point victory in a 2023 national championship rematch over No. 5-seeded San Diego State. During the regular season, UConn was just as dominant, losing only three games. The Huskies were nearly perfect all year.\n\nTwo players are projected lottery picks in the 2024 NBA Draft in freshman guard Stephon Castle and the man with possibly the greatest nickname of all time, sophomore center Donovan \u201cCling-Kong\u201d Clingan. The Huskies\u2019 domination can be credited to head coach Dan Hurley, who has sneakily become the best head coach in college basketball after going back-to-back. Hurley\u2019s intensity is considered to be extreme by some , but his players love him and his team wins. He\u2019s the perfect coach in my mind. Because of the way this team performed, when it comes to all time programs, UConn is easily a top five, if not top-three program in all of college basketball, with six NCAA championships in the last 25 years. This team hammered home the message that UConn should be considered a blue blood in men\u2019s basketball.\n\nThe 2023-24 USC women\u2019s basketball team will be the worst team JuJu Watkins is a part of The 2023-24 season was historic for the USC women\u2019s basketball team, as the Trojans saw a rise in attendance, hype and wins, and USC made its first Elite Eight appearance since 1994. While this team was incredible, I think there is even more in store for the Trojans. USC is losing three of its starters in graduates Kaitlin Davis, McKenzie Forbes and Kayla Padilla, but the Trojans are replacing those three with the No. 1 recruiting class in the country, headlined by All-Americans Avery Howell, Kennedy Smith and Kayleigh Heckel. While it is unfair to wish for freshmen to dominate the way freshman guard JuJu Watkins did this past season, it is almost certain that at least one of them will turn into a star as early as next season. Likely, next year\u2019s team will be filled with raw potential. However, I bet head coach Lindsay Gottlieb has a few tricks up her sleeve when it comes to transfer additions. I personally have my eyes on the following year, as in the 2025-26 season. It will be the third season of JuJu Watkins at USC, and the 2024-25 freshmen will have had time to develop. I think USC could easily become one of the most complete teams in college basketball, from top to bottom. The depth the Trojans will have, paired with Watkins\u2019 G.O.A.T-level scoring ability and Gottlieb\u2019s strategies, can make USC one of the few teams in the country who can go toe to toe with South Carolina. This was a fantastic year for USC, but the future is brighter than ever for Gottlieb and the Trojans. The road ahead may lead to even more success in the next few seasons.\n\nThe era of one-and-done domination is over There once was a time where one-and-done prospects dominated college basketball, and you couldn\u2019t win without the best freshman in the country. That is no longer the case. Because of the transfer portal and NIL, good players are encouraged to stay longer and play winning basketball. You see more and more players who are fringe NBA players stick around and either transfer to a better program, or stay because they can make good money in college now. Because players are staying longer, there are a lot more experienced and physically older players who can contribute, thus making freshmen less effective. A perfect example of the shift in college basketball was this year\u2019s matchup between No. 3-seeded Kentucky and No. 14-seeded Oakland. Kentucky\u2019s philosophy for over a decade now has been to recruit the best freshman and win with them. However, they came up against a Golden Grizzlies team this year that was filled to the brim with older, more experienced players. Take Oakland graduate guard Jack Gohlke, who dropped 30 on the Wildcats. He was 24 years old playing against Kentucky\u2019s lineup of mostly teenagers. Gohlke was more experienced and physically much greater than the Wildcats\u2019 best players, which allowed him to go on one of the most insane scoring run\u2019s ever, hitting 10 3-pointers that game. While Oakland was a bit of an anomaly, more and more experienced teams are beating out talented freshmen-filled rosters, and it is because of this new era of college basketball. The likes of coach John Calipari and Jon Scheyer may need to rethink their strategies going forward.\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

The new schedule means a lot more flying to cities a lot farther away than USC teams ever had to deal with before. This coming year, the football team will play at least three games around 2000 miles away.\n\nUSC has chartered planes for its bigger teams, like football, but there could be a lot more charters now says the travel agent who handles USC Athletics\u2019 flights Kellee Gray.\n\nKellee Gray: \u201cBecause of the big 10 Move, if that\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s probably going to happen more with other teams. I think possibly. We\u2019re about to see.\u201d\n\nGray has been working on providing USC with a list of options for the fall\u2019s many cross-country flights, including that possibility of charters. Charters are more flexible and student athletes need to work around busy and rigid schedules. But this often means putting in the air and spewing out carbon from a plane that otherwise wouldn\u2019t need to be flying.\n\nInstitutions can try compensate for the privileged use of private travel. For example, they can pay for carbon offset fees but Gray says, in her dealings with USC, \n\nGray: \u201cNobody has brought it up to me. If they have to somebody else, I don\u2019t know. I know certain airlines like when you just go book a published ticket yourself like online, they can edit that combo allow you to, like check this box pay a certain fee to offset emissions or something like that. What that means I have no idea how they do that. But, but nobody has said anything about it.\u201d\n\nUSC football\u2019s debut in the Big 10 is months away. What Gray is working on at the moment are the official recruitment visits for prospective Trojan athletes. She is their first point of contact for travel. She plans everything from getting them to L.A. to touring the city and getting them back home. The athletics department spends a lot on these visits. And they too come with layers of carbon cost.\n\nGray: \u201cWe have official visits coming pretty much for football every weekend, April every weekend in May and every weekend in June and then it starts up again in September. And May 16 and 19 will be a bigger weekend like I\u2019ll generally booked like 20 premium SUVs for the football department and they\u2019ll be taking the kids all over.\u201d\n\nThe most energy efficient cars on the road aren\u2019t premium SUV\u2019s.\n\nGray: \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a certain look, you know, they\u2019re not gonna put them into like a Toyota Corolla sedan, you know. It\u2019s just the way they\u2019ve done it. And I\u2019ve only been here again, like, almost two years and so Annie\u2019s got her whole program and it\u2019s very effective.

(Photo by Nicki Berelson)\n\nBy Nicki Berelson, Makayla Idelburg and Malcolm Caminero\nApril 22, 2024 at 6:27 pm PDT\n\nWherever you go on campus, there are a multitude of trash bins, all separated into categories in order to be more friendly to the environment. As USC continues to celebrate Earth Day, we looked at how sustainable Trojans really are.\n\nFreshman Joy Wang has a few ways she is able to practice sustainability. Fellow freshman Egan Waklole chooses to change her diet in order to be more in tune with the earth. Other students, Like Sandy Cull feel that we still have more to accomplish.\n\nThe SC Garden Club is composed of a group of students, all with one goal: to maintain the Parkside garden. Oddly enough, this club is the only student-run green space on campus. While gardening takes up a huge portion of the club, there also host events, and the garden itself is always open for compostable drop-offs. A good rule of thumb is you can compost anything that was once living or is alive!\n\nAndrew Bawiec is an environmental studies student and the current Vice President of the SC Garden Club. They shared that the community welcomed them with open arms when they joined as a freshmen, and with the club, they have gained a better relationship with the Earth.\n\nAndrew Bawiec: My time in Garden Club has really helped me connect with nature more, which is something that is greatly lacking in a lot of modern society. People view nature either as a commodity, or as something foreign that they get to visit but having a garden space where you are tending to the plants and you\u2019re attending to the creatures here really helps you form that relationship between yourself and your place in nature.\n\nThe President of the SC Garden Club is Esther Jeon, she shares how it is important it is to think about the environment. Even though we are living in a city.\n\nEsther Jeon: Earth Day is, a great thing to celebrate. Recognizing that we do need to care about our Earth and, even when we live in the city, there\u2019s greenery that we do need to care about and that we rely on even if we don\u2019t see it as much and I think that the garden is a great place to just explore that in our campus.\n\nEllen Dux the Associate director of the Office of sustainability discussed how USC has nearly doubled their reduction of green house gases on campus over the last few years.\n\nEllen Dux: We just finished our greenhouse gas assessment for this past year and we are now coming in at around 45 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and that\u2019s all from a baseline of 2014. So, significant change, significant ramp up. What you\u2019re seeing is not just that we\u2019re going directionally in the right way, but we\u2019re getting there faster.\n\nIf there is any day to be kinder to our Earth, take advantage today!

L.A.\u2019s public transportation carrier Metrolink hosted its first sustainable fashion show today in honor of Earth Day. About a hundred people took part in Union Station this morning. The show featured sustainable fashion designed by Southern California high school and college students. They used recycled materials, giving a second life to otherwise unwanted items. In this show, creativity combined with the care of our Earth and the passion for sustainability. All designs in this show had to be 100% post-consumer, post-industrial recyclable materials. This put the audience in awe of how creatively these young fashion designers could use those materials.\n\nMetrolink CEO Darren Kettle says the fashion show is a unique celebration of the joint effort everyone makes to leave the planet in the best possible condition for the next generation. Darren Kettle: \u201cPlease join me in recognizing the hard work and creative energy that our incredible talented student designers have invested to make this event possible. You\u2019ll be seeing them later this morning, can we give a hand to those young people are emerging as a fearsome force in the fight to preserve our planet.

She says she is excited to see that many people are putting more effort into living sustainably. Kyra Godoy: \u201cI think just showing the world, that there are people willing to make the change. And reimagine the way our future and our present are. And the whole enthusiasm that goes with sustainability. Its just so exciting.\u201d\n\nA goal in sustainability should be pursued not only on Earth Day but really every day. It is this kind of collective effort that combines metro, fashion, and all other industries that can together make our Earth better.\n```"}

Sac State responded at the top of the sixth inning with three unearned runs after sophomore utility Jaxon Byrd hit a homer to right field. After walking in the home half of the seventh, USC freshman outfielder Brayden Dowd managed to steal second base and scramble to third after a Hornets throwing error. Freshman infielder Dean Carpentier singled to left field, as Dowd scored the Trojans\u2019 last run of the game. However, Sac State wasn\u2019t ready to call it a day and brought home two runs for insurance in the top of the ninth, finishing USC off 6-3.\n\nSaturday: Santa Clara, W 12-11\nThe Trojan offense led a momentum shift on Saturday against Santa Clara after trailing 7-1 by the bottom of the third inning and 10-5 by the bottom of the seventh. The Trojans and Broncos each scored a run in the first inning, but Santa Clara kicked it into gear in the third inning, scoring six runs on six hits. USC countered with four runs of its own in the inning, but didn\u2019t score again until the seventh. The seventh-inning stretch is just what the Trojans needed to turn the tide over. A series of doubles from sophomore infielder Ethan Hedges and Carpentier sent senior infielder Ryan Jackson, sophomore catcher Jacob Galloway, Hedges and freshman infielder Kevin Takeuchi across the plate. Freshman infielder Abbrie Covarrubias\u2019 single drove Carpentier in and squashed the Broncos\u2019 lead, making it a tie game heading into the eighth inning. But a Hornets run in the top of the eighth wasn\u2019t enough, as the Trojans notched two runs of their own to secure the 12-11 win and sent the Broncos home, just not to home plate. It was a great night for the Trojan offense, as its .405 batting average was USC\u2019s second-highest mark of the season in a game. But, on the other side of the field, the Trojans\u2019 defense struggled to capitalize on plays, sending six relief pitchers to the hill and recording their second-highest single-game ERA of the season.\n\n\u201cSometimes when the pitching staff\u2019s not going well, we need the offense to pick it up and vice versa,\u201d head coach Andy Stankiewicz said on Sunday. \u201cI think [Saturday] was a good lesson for our offense. Like, \u2018Hey, it doesn\u2019t matter. Just keep getting good at-bats together, and we\u2019ll get ourselves back into it.\u2019\u201d\n\nSunday: Sacramento State, L 5-4\nThe Hornets were the first on the scoreboard after a wild pitch from junior pitcher William Watson sent Sac State sophomore infielder JP Smith running home. As for USC, the Hornets\u2019 rotating list of pitchers kept the team off the board until the fourth inning. Carpentier started the home half of the fourth with a walk, but soon found himself on third after a series of throwing errors from the Hornet defense. Stankiewicz held off on the bullpen until the top of the sixth, sending in sophomore pitcher Michael Ebner for relief for the third time in the past week. The Trojans\u2019 pitching staff has had to adjust to junior pitcher Caden Aoki\u2019s injury absence and two five-game weeks in the past three weeks.\n\n\u201cGuys are stepping up,\u201d Stankieweiz said. \u201cThey understand that Caden\u2019s out. When you have your Friday night guy out, it kind of stretches out your bullpen a little bit more, but it can\u2019t be an excuse, and we won\u2019t let it be an excuse.\u201d\n\nUSC entered the fourth inning only down by one, but Watson\u2019s first walk of the game set the Broncos up for a series of lucrative plays. With Sac State senior infielderJorge Bojorquez on first and Smith on second, junior outfielder Matt Masciangelo\u2019s single to shortstop loaded the bases for senior outfielder Cesar Valero\u2019s at-bat. Valero and freshman infielder Cameron Sewell\u2019s back-to-back singles drove in three Hornets. At the other end of the fourth, hits by Takeuchi and Dowd set up batters on second and third base with Hedges up to bat. Takeuchi took Hedges\u2019 single as an opportunity to score, and Dowd trailed behind, scoring on the next play after Carpentier sent a sacrifice fly to center field. Freshman outfielder Riley Hunsaker and graduate catcher Connor Clift\u2019s back-to-back strikeouts were the first ones of the game for USC and closed out the inning. The Hornets stung one last time in the sixth inning. USC nearly caught up to Sac State\u2019s five runs, but a strikeout from Hedges left Takeuchi on third and the Hornets celebrating a 5-4 win.\n\n\u201cI think today\u2019s game, we should have a better offense,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cI just thought we had a lot of lazy fly balls today. ... When we hit the ball on the ground, we put pressure on the defense.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a season of adjustments for a Trojan team without a true home stadium to practice or play at, but Watson remains optimistic about the team\u2019s positioning at this point in the season.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re playing better ball than the first part of the season, for sure,\u201d Watson said. \u201cRight now, I think we\u2019re in a good spot to stay high in the conference rankings. ... We just need to stay more consistent on both ends, just hitting and pitching.

In fact, many students weren\u2019t even aware it was Earth Day.\n\n\u201cI feel guilty and kind of stupid that I didn\u2019t know [it was Earth Day],\u201d said Molly Glad, a senior studying health promotion and disease prevention studies. \u201cI feel like with the university being so pro-helping the environment...receiving an email would have been nice to put it out there.\u201d\n\nHistorically, USC has been an example of environmental awareness, organizing a multitude of events and initiatives to celebrate Earth Day. From campus clean-ups to educational seminars and awareness campaigns, the university was committed to sustainability efforts.\n\nOn the first honorary Earth Day in 1970, USC students strived to spread awareness about environmental causes by placing a gas mask on Tommy Trojan. Students also participated in a car engine burial ceremony on campus to signify the fight against pollution.\n\nThese different activities not only encouraged a sense of environmental leadership among students, faculty and staff, but also highlighted USC\u2019s commitment to addressing various global issues.\n\nHowever, recently there has been a decline in the level of enthusiasm and promotion surrounding Earth Day events across campus.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty much because of the emotions associated with it. The climate crisis is not something like, \u2018Oh, this is the crisis. This is the solution. Let\u2019s solve it.\u2019 It\u2019s actually a poly crisis, which means that it combines with so many different crises,\u201d said Shreya Agrawal, an independent climate journalist and engagement coordinator at the USC Annenberg Center for Climate Journalism and Communications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so many different things that go on with this crisis. And there\u2019s so many different solutions ... I think that stops people from even paying attention to what\u2019s happening around them,\u201d Agrawal said.\n\nThroughout April, USC has held various sustainability events to discuss burning environmental concerns. USC\u2019s Arts and Climate Festival and a talk between climate activist and actor Jane Fonda and Dean Willow Bay have been part of the university\u2019s attempts to educate students on sustainable practices on campus.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s so important for college campuses to put on events that kind of show students that they can make tiny changes ... It\u2019s so easy to feel alone. It\u2019s so easy to feel like you can\u2019t do anything like you can\u2019t make a change,\u201d Agrawal said.\n\nFor Earth Day, USC presented a \u201cHow to be a Sustainable Trojan\u201d talk with the USC Office of Sustainability, an Earth Day painting station and a workshop to celebrate Earth Day with SC Outfitters, a student-run outdoor adventure organization.\n\nNonetheless, many are left underwhelmed about the campus\u2019s involvement in climate-based projects especially during Earth Day.\n\n\u201cI think having a dedicated day or a month is important, because it can help people kind of re-evaluate how they are in terms of their own carbon footprint in terms of their own sustainability goals, and maybe set intentions for the rest of the year,\u201d said Shannon Michelle Gibson, an associate professor of environmental studies and director of Gibson Climate Justice Lab.\n\n\u201cYou know, no matter what you do in this world, no matter what job, what major you have, your gender, your age ... your life is in some way dependent on the planet that we live on, so it\u2019s still something that deserves focus and attention.\u201d```"}

There\u2019s shareholders, endowment and certain metrics that they have to meet.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the redesigning of the commencement ceremony in wake of pressure both on campus and from the general public, Latorre said he believes \u201cthey canceled guest speakers because they were panicking and had no idea what to do.\u201d The university declined to give an update past what was released last Friday.

His great uncle Herman Cherry opened a small gallery above Stanley Rose Bookstore in the 1930s where he eventually showed artists like Fletcher Martin, Reuben Kadish, and Phillip Guston (former, Goldstein) before their primes. In the 1950s, his grandparents owned a gallery and a bookstore in San Bernardino. Then in the 1990s, his mother opened a gallery with some friends on La Brea. \u201cThe idea of an artist opening a gallery wasn\u2019t foreign to me,\u201d said Tull in retrospect. It is all part of a cycle of inspiration to him, calling on artist-run spaces before him and hoping to catalyze the next generation as well.\n\n\u201cSo many people think you have to be at the center of everything, the center of culture or the center of a city, but really, historically, the interesting and unexpected things happen at the fringes,\u201d said Tull. \u201cYou can almost discover the true essence of something not by looking at the middle because the middle tends to get homogenized.\u201d\n\nThe instinct to find the untold, rare stories well before their time is innate to him. When he co-founded Odd Ark LA in 2018, it was more of the same. At that time, Tull described a robust, \u201chealthy ecosystem\u201d of mutually supportive artist-run spaces all over L.A. Odd Ark LA became a \u201cstepping stone\u201d for many emerging artists before getting picked up by larger galleries, according to Tull. \u201cI was thrilled about that,\u201d he said. The financial success of the gallery was a pleasant surprise to him, who was familiar with past generations of gallerists who had little financial support.\n\nSince last September, Tull has collaborated with his business partner and independent curator Jessica Gallucci, whom he met at a party while she was starting a new role for the L.A. outpost of The Hole. Now his business partner, they launched their joint curatorial project, Gallucci Tull, this February with an old friend\u2019s archived collection. \u201c[The art world] can be incredibly fraught and tough on the ego, tough on the nerves,\u201d said Gallucci. \u201cThe things I admire most about Dani are his sensitivity and the way he\u2019s able to remain even-keeled. He\u2019s got a real wisdom in the way he moves through this world.\u201d\n\nAccording to the project\u2019s inaugural artist, Nick Taggart, Tull thinks \u201cmore like the way artists think rather than like a gallerist...Everything he does involves community. He has a sense of people\u2019s history with the place...Absolutely genius.\u201d\n\nTull\u2019s identity as an artist first has informed all of his other work and distinguishes him from art dealers or curators launching similar projects. In total, Tull is an artist himself, the co-founder of Odd Ark LA, the co-owner of Gallucci Tull, a guitarist for The Spirit Girls and the upcoming co-curator at the Ed Ruscha exhibition at The Hole. With all of this multifaceted involvement, Tull has explored seemingly every artistic space, and that\u2019s how he noticed what was missing.\n\n\u201cEven though Los Angeles has a thriving international art scene, for whatever reason, compared to other major cities, it doesn\u2019t seem to have a healthy amount of artist residency programs,\u201d said Tull. \u201cOne thing I wanted to explore and prove, is that opportunities like this for artists can be created with very little support.\u201d\n\nWhen Dani Tull first stepped foot on the property up in Topanga Canyon (which some friends offered him a weeks-long stay at), he saw an artist\u2019s oasis, a true escape from the concrete and smog in L.A., complete with a geodesic dome built in the 1970s.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived, I was completely enchanted... I realized that being in the setting of nature with that canopy of oak trees, next to a creek, in the mountains, was what my soul needed.\u201d\n\nSince then, he has hosted six different artists at the same property as part of a retreat which he calls the Encina Artist Residency. He convinced those same friends to let him run a program that currently has no substantial funding or cost for visiting artists while they eat, sleep, and work in the dome. The only requirement: a parting gift from the artist to add to the owner\u2019s personal art collection.\n\nThis residency is heavily inspired by all of the greats who retreated out to those same hills. Tull draws on those like Wallace Berman, Chris Burden, Neil Young, and Joni Mitchell, who retired in the \u201cenergetically rich and inspiring\u201d canyon.\n\nThe residency property stands on a landscape over a creek and hills which house multiple cabins and an open horse stable, now turned artist studio. The cabins are separated by a flowing creek from the residency, which takes place in a white, geodesic dome equipped with a kitchen, bed, and heating for visiting artists to live while on retreat. Most residencies span a week, and the artists are encouraged to acquaint themselves with the landscape and only make art should they feel inspired.\n\nTull remarks that when he is on the property working on his own paintings, he no longer listens to music or podcasts, but rather opts for the natural hums. \u201cIt was so nice to be able to hear more voices of birds than of people.\u201d\n\nDani Tull's own outdoor artistic studio, also on the Topanga Canyon property.\n\nNow, he\u2019s looking towards opening the formerly invite-only residency to an application process. \u201cHonestly, all I really want to do is paint and focus on my own work, and I love collaboration. I love learning from what other people do. All of these things, whether it\u2019s playing music with other people in a band, or running the gallery, or doing this residency, it just feeds me. I really believe firmly in the value of the collective and the community.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of Sara Velas)\n\nBy Kate Stuzin\nApril 22, 2024 at 1:40 pm PDT\n\nNext time you venture to the movie theater to see Dune Part Two or whatever, maybe think of Sara Velas\u2019 panoramas. Velas, 47, is trying to keep alive an art form that predates the motion picture: the panorama. Once, meaning in the 19th century, the panorama was a very big deal. You\u2019d go to see a vast landscape painting and hear sound and take in faux \u2013 OK, fake \u2013 three-dimensional terrain. Way back when, it passed for total sensory immersion. Progress is inexorable. Wagon train, meet the Tesla. Panorama, meet the VR headset. Who in the year 2024 wants to keep something like the panorama alive, and why?\n\nSomeone who grew up fascinated with dinosaurs. Who runs a panorama museum, the Velaslavasay Panorama, in the film capital of the world. Whose diorama in the museum, the Nova Tushkut, is proclaimed the only Arctic trading post in the lower 48 states \u2013 please snuggle up on the bear pelt or check out the book on the wooden bookshelf by lantern light. Someone who, let\u2019s note, was born in Panorama City, California. At 8:08 p.m. on 1/8/77 \u2013 a numerological note she discovered on the phone with her mother as part of research toward her astrological chart for cosmic insight into her personality and life path.\n\nWe are far from done here. Who added her own twist to the tradition of 19th-century panoramas, which typically were named after their creators or proprietors. \u201cI invented the word \u2018Velaslavasay\u2019 to use my last name, which is Velas, and that came from my father\u2019s side,\u201d Velas said. \u201cAsay is my mother\u2019s maiden name, so I thought it\u2019d be nice to combine that. In the middle is Slav because I have some Slavic heritage.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes at the museum, located in Los Angeles\u2019 University Park neighborhood, Velas works with Ruby Carlson, 36. They met in 2008 when Carlson first visited the museum. Now they are close friends and collaborative partners. \u201cWe have this shorthand, and we really trust each other\u2019s sensibilities and styles, and we like the same things,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cWhat she thinks of is beyond me, beyond my brain, beyond most other people, and so it\u2019s like tuning to a very off-beat AM station: \u2018Wow, I didn\u2019t even know this was a frequency available to us all.\u2019 And it\u2019s very liberating.\u201d\n\nAll this zaniness began in the blandest place imaginable, the San Fernando Valley. Velas grew up in Reseda until age 3. Then it was off a few miles west to Woodland Hills. This, it would turn out, would prove fertile territory for a little girl\u2019s big imagination. Those dinosaurs in early childhood, Velas said, pulled her \u201cinto this dynamic world\u201d of immersive experiences. One birthday, her aunts and uncles surprised her with a makeshift PlayDoh diorama on a board with fake plants and little plastic dinosaurs. Then, during her first trip to Disneyland, on the Disneyland Railroad she sat, transfixed, as the train circled the perimeter of the park, then traversed a dark, narrow corridor that whisked visitors back in time through dioramas showcasing the Grand Canyon and the Land of the Dinosaurs.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at it now, I can see the relationship between the panoramas and dioramas tradition,\u201d Velas said. \u201cBut at the time, I just thought this was a really amazing train journey.\u201d\n\nIn college, she earned a bachelor\u2019s in fine arts at Washington University in St. Louis. Two years later, back in L.A., she founded the exhibition, considerably affected by her time in St. Louis. \u201cA lot of this had to do with a curiosity and almost obsession with 19th-century typography and the way that things were promoted,\u201d Velas said. \u201cI realized later that a lot of this had to do with a reflection on my time in St. Louis because St. Louis is a city that had so much kind of going for it in the mid-19th century.\u201d\n\nOnce a potential rival to Chicago, St. Louis\u2019s decline left abandoned and neglected areas with vacant lots and decrepit Victorian homes. Certain elements of Velas\u2019 panoramas are still tied to a 19th-century sensibility. Three years after opening the museum, she moved it to its current location. For $7, this is what you get, currently on display, the Shengjing Panorama. Ascending a creaky, winding staircase to the top floor, viewers enter a 360-degree painting of an early 20th-century Chinese landscape. Enhanced by a 40-minute ambient soundscape and a lighting cycle, visitors experience trains rushing by, church bells tolling and birds chirping while witnessing the city transition from warm, yellow daylight to nighttime\u2019s bluish-gray sky.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the completed installation, which in and of itself is immersive, but it\u2019s all the things leading up to it,\u201d Velas said. \u201cThe emails and the things that Ruby and I work on together, and the graphics that we create, and the way that we talk about the things we\u2019re going to share with people helps set a tone and set a mood that really changes the way people absorb them.\u201d\n\nMuseum volunteer Sloane Sandler, 37, said being there is like living within the mystery game Clue \u2013 akin to entering a room filled with intriguing individuals drawn by Velas, each with a unique identity, profession and interests. \u201cShe\u2019s such like a visionary and she does it so modestly,\u201d Sandler said. \u201cI feel so grateful to be one of her friends because all of her other friends are so special and unique and wonderful as well. To be chosen by Sara is quite an honor. But I think everything I get from the panorama I also get outside of the panorama in interacting with Sara.\u201d\n\nThen again, no one can live in the 19th century all the time. Not even Velas. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for an excuse to go on a field trip somewhere, even if it\u2019s just to see an old painted sign or a weird billboard somewhere in the desert,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go off, and it ends up informing an exhibit that we put together five years later. You never know. Visiting other panoramas and thinking of our work here in the canon of like panorama history is a really important aspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo much of doing this has been also about the impossibility of being a cultural space in L.A. that the funding for being a nonprofit is very prohibitive,\u201d Velas said. \u201cI still sort of can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve kept it going for this long, and I wouldn\u2019t keep doing this if I didn\u2019t feel like people were responding to it.\u201d```"}

At the moment, Lowery didn\u2019t quite understand what her mother was saying, but now it\u2019s clear that everything Heather touches really does turn into gold. Heather Lowery has dedicated her career to empowering women in music and entertainment. She is a Partner at Live Nation Entertainment, as well as the founder, president, and chief executive officer of Femme It Forward: a multi-faceted music and entertainment venture with a mission to celebrate, educate and empower women. Lowery is a strategist, creative visionary, and alchemist. Leading Femme It Forward, she\u2019s responsible for overseeing and executing a variety of missions including MUSE, Next Gem Femme, the Give Her FlowHERS Gala, the My Sister\u2019s Keeper Empowerment Summit, The High Tea Grammy event, the Big Femme Energy Volume 1 compilation album, and hundreds of concerts, festivals, and tours. Heather has been a trailblazer and pioneer within the music industry, and is responsible for notable programming across the industry.\n\nHeather Lowery shakes hands with a Bass Lab Fellow (Photo courtesy of Craig Stanley). \n\nAt her core, Heather Lowery is an advocate for women in music, and her philanthropy creates limitless opportunities for artists, executives, creatives, and more. She grew up in New Castle, DE, where she always knew there was something special about her. Writing a thesis in high school on the relationship between hip-hop music and misogyny with Questlove as a primary interviewee, her peers had always envisioned that she would go on to work in the entertainment industry. Many thought she would be on-screen, but that was never her intention. \u201cI wanted to be somebody. I knew I wanted to be a boss,\u201d explained Lowery.\n\nOriginally, Lowery had thought she had wanted to be an entertainment attorney. She held several internships, interning in the Legal Department at LaFace Records, FOX television stations, and with attorneys. At the end of her collegiate career at Spelman, Lowery was unsure of her future, and eventually decided against law school. After returning to Delaware from Atlanta, she was unsure of her exact whereabouts and considered becoming a teacher. Leveraging her connections to The Roots and Questlove, Lowery got introduced to Larry Gold, and she asked him for a job, telling him that she would be open to anything - answering the phones, organizing the studios, etc. \u201cI just needed my foot in the door,\u201d explained Lowery. She became a receptionist for him and his studio, and eventually the part-time job turned into a full-time job. Ultimately, she became the general manager of the studio.\n\nAfter working in management, Lowrey began her company, \u201cAgency For Artists,\u201d in 2005 and also joined Live Nation as VP of Talent and Touring at Live Nation Urban. She did this for two years before starting Femme It Forward as a joint venture with Live Nation. \u201cOh, this is why. It all makes sense,\u201d explained Lowery, reflecting on her career. got her to where she is now, as an entertainment executive. \u201cEvery single experience\u201d that Lowery had brought her to where she is now.\n\nLowery\u2019s empowering philosophy follows her everywhere that she goes, allowing her to leave a lasting legacy in every single thing that she does for every campaign, event, activation, or program she embarks upon. When it comes to Femme It Forward, Lowery has always been a passionate advocate of empowering and uplifting women in the music and entertainment industries. Her central mission is to get more women on stage together to cultivate community and to celebrate each other. Today, Femme It Forward is thriving. Lowery turned her passion into a career, and her entertainment industry legacy will live on for years to come through the connections that she makes with others and the activations she brings to life that empower, uplift, and honor women.\n\nHeather Lowery poses with Bass Lab Fellows (Photo courtesy of Craig Stanley). \n\n\u201cWhen I started Femme It Forward, it felt like everything I had done up until then was Femme It Forward,\u201d Lowery explains. \u201cI wanted to put more women on stage together.\u201d She went to the CEO of Live Nation Entertainment, and asked if she could make Femme It Forward a joint venture within Live Nation. Lowery is more than an entertainment industry mogul - she is also a mother, a friend, and a mentor. She ingrains her motherhood and family into her endeavors and wholeheartedly embraces being a mother who is also an executive. After her endeavors working in the studio industry, Lowery applied to William Morris Endeavor and ended up working there as an assistant for two years. After working at WME, she began working in artist management and found her strength was in booking artists. \u201cI look back at all of my experiences in my life and my jobs... I had to do all of these things in order to be here, right now,\u201d Lowery explains. \u201cNow, when I go through any hardships, I embrace it. I try to find the lesson in anything that I am going through,\u201d explained Lowery.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Wendi Lu April 21, 2024 at 9:59 pm PDT\n\nTensions were high at Uytengsu Aquatics Center Saturday afternoon as No. 4 USC women\u2019s water polo finished its regular season at home against undefeated No. 1 UCLA. Despite a head start and strong defense, USC fell short by two goals with a 7-5 loss, heading into the MPSF Tournament as the No. 4 seed with a 17-6 record.\n\nAfter a steal from freshman attacker Ava Stryker, senior attacker Alejandra Aznar broke the silent standoff between the Trojans and the Bruins five minutes into the game. The Trojans ended the first period with a 1-0 lead.\n\n\u201cIt was just a long game, not too many goals,\u201d Aznar said. \u201cFirst quarter was just up and down, so very tiring.\u201d\n\nThe match picked up in the second period. UCLA freshman utility Panni Szegedi tied the score with a six-on-five goal, then added another goal later in the period to give the Bruins a 3-2 lead. Less than a minute later, the Trojans bit back with a six-on-five from Aznar, tying the score again at 3-3 heading into halftime.\n\nThe third period was equally intense. Both parties were playing a chasing game \u2014 as soon as the Bruins gained a competitive advantage by staying one goal ahead, sophomore attacker Morgan Netherton shut it down with an assist from Aznar early in the quarter.\n\n\u201cWe rely on very young players. Because we had such a large senior class last year, some underclass players barely played any minutes,\u201d Aznar said. \u201cNow, freshmen are just playing almost a full game.\u201d\n\nYoung blood has become increasingly important and is taking on more crucial roles as the Trojans say goodbye to their seniors. For example, during the Trojans\u2019 last game \u2014 an 14-10 win against No. 10 Arizona State, the second-year Netherton contributed a career high four goals to lead the team.\n\n\u201c[Netherton] has a really high ceiling. We use her a lot more and let her make decisions for us. As her ceiling grows, her confidence is going to build,\u201d head coach Casey Moon said.\n\nThe chase didn\u2019t end there. With 2:36 on the clock in the third quarter, senior defender Abigail Hendrix sailed in a sweet shot to make it all even yet again at 5-5. However, UCLA quickly reclaimed its lead after another six-on-five, and Szegedi scored again less than a minute later for an insurance goal.\n\nThe fourth quarter sealed the Trojans\u2019 fate, as both teams locked down on defense. After two yellow cards and a full timeout on the USC side, no goals came from either end. UCLA remained unchallenged as it kept a tight grip, ending the game with a 7-5 win.\n\n\u201cWe did amazing defense, we had very good moments, very good steals. [UCLA] didn\u2019t know what to do in some situations, making them use the full block or bumping the ball out,\u201d Aznar said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not one thing that points to a loss. It\u2019s a group,\u201d Moon said. \u201cThe biggest thing is this idea of fighting amongst our players. We have this never-give-up attitude, and that\u2019s really important.\u201d\n\nFor the coming MPSF Tournament, Trojans will open up against No. 5 seed Arizona State at 12:30 p.m. PST on Friday in Bloomington, Indiana.\n```"}

From the rollout of a secret double release to candid name-drops, Swift has once again given her fans numerous tracks to pour over and memorize. Here\u2019s a glimpse into her lyrical web, where each song is a thread that connects thematic elements from the past and present.\n\n\u201cThis is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things\u201d & \u201cthanK you aIMee\u201d: Burned bridges stay scorched\n\n\u201cReputation\u201d is widely considered Swift\u2019s magnum opus because of how it resurrected her public image. In \u201cThis is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things,\u201d she hints at enemies far past the point of forgiveness. \u201cAnd here\u2019s to you / \u2018Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do. / I can\u2019t even say it with a straight face.\u201d In \u201cthanK you aIMee,\u201d with its conspicuous capitalization spelling out \u201cK-I-M,\u201d the lyrics read like a follow-through of the \u201creputation\u201d jab. \u201cBut I dreamed that, one day, I could say / All that time you were throwin\u2019 punches, I was buildin\u2019 somethin\u2019 / And I can\u2019t forgive the way you made me feel.\u201d Swift touches upon the theme of forgiveness again only to reject its possibility \u2014 but this time around, she\u2019s on the seven-year upend after massively rebounding from the controversial events, rumors and gossip that fueled \u201creputation\u201d in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe Lucky One\u201d & \u201cClara Bow\u201d: Cost of celebrity, gut-wrenching glory\n\n\u201cRed\u201d is largely characterized by its catchy, radio bops, but within the album is underrated gem The \u201cLucky One,\u201d a mellow piece compared to its preceding tracks. \u201cAnd all the young things line up to take your place / Another name goes up in lights / Like diamonds in the sky / And they\u2019ll tell you now, you\u2019re the lucky one.\u201d Fast forward over 12 years later to \u201cClara Bow,\u201d where Swift sings: \u201cThey all want to say / This town is fake but you\u2019re the real thing / Breath of fresh air through smoke rings / Take the glory, give everything / Promise to be dazzling.\u201d Both songs critique the entertainment industry\u2019s exploitative attitude towards young female stars. Both songs use a second-person perspective as if calling you, and only you, to the limelight. Swift\u2019s ambiguous third-party \u201cthey\u201d encourages this acceptance of fame, framing it as a unique honor and testament to a rising name. \u201cThey\u201d see you as the shiny new thing, rinse and repeat. However, \u201cClara Bow\u201d takes the theme a step further. While \u201cThe Lucky One\u201d remains vague and only alludes to aged-out celebrities, the TTPD track refers to Clara Bow herself, a heavily scrutinized \u201cIt Girl\u201d from the early 20th century with publicized mental health struggles. Later, Swift cites herself as the model which people disparage to uplift the up-and-coming generation. Thus, she alludes to this cyclic nature of fame and how it largely places an expiration date on stars.\n\n\u201cClean,\u201d \u201cDaylight\u201d & \u201cThe Black Dog\u201d: Loving a flawed relationship\n\nFrom three different eras, these three tracks hint at imperfections in a relationship that just don\u2019t push the singer away. \u201cClean\u201d: \u201cRain came pouring / Down when I was drowning, and that\u2019s when I could finally breathe.\u201d \u201cDaylight\u201d: \u201cI wounded the good and I trusted the wicked / Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke.\u201d \u201cThe Black Dog\u201d: \u201cOld habits die screaming / Six weeks of breathing clean air / I still miss the smoke.\u201d Swift\u2019s natural imagery suggests that even with awareness of a troubling relationship, there is an enduring bond that transcends the struggle.\n\n\u201cright where you left me\u201d & \u201cI Look In People\u2019s Windows\u201d: Periods of stasis\n\nIn December 2022, Variety ranked the \u201cevermore\u201d bonus track \u201cright where you left me\u201d as Swift\u2019s eighth-best song of all time. Overshadowed by the smash quarantine hit \u201cfolklore\u201d and relegated to the \u201cextras\u201d section, \u201cright where you left me\u201d details a narrator who is stuck in time, unable to move forward in her life. \u201cHelp, I\u2019m still at the restaurant / Still sitting in a corner I haunt / Cross-legged in the dim light / They say, \u2018What a sad sight.\u2019\u201d \u201cI Look in People\u2019s Windows\u201d adopts a similar perspective. The narrator is unable to abandon the throes of her past. The track follows her as she sees other people live their lives. Yet she remains transfixed and always the watcher. \u201cSo I look in people\u2019s windows / Like I\u2019m some deranged weirdo / I attend Christmas parties from outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak Now,\u201d \u201cmirrorball,\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Little Old Me?\u201d: Being seen and heard\n\nSwift is no stranger to spectacle, especially embodying one. From the \u201cSpeak Now\u201d era to the present day, she has broadened her scope of spectatorship. \u201cSpeak Now\u201d is a sharp-tongued articulation of interrupting a wedding to profess love to the groom. She only addresses him, even though her actions spark abhorrence from the wedding guests. \u201cI stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me / Horrified looks from everyone in the room / But I\u2019m only lookin\u2019 at you.\u201d Swift evolves to more of a traditional, expected spectacle in \u201cmirrorball.\u201d She\u2019s aware of her performance, yet the only person she cares about is the one individual. \u201cWhen they sent home the horses / And the rodeo clowns / I\u2019m still on that tightrope / I\u2019m still trying everything to get you laughing at me.\u201d The singer continues the circus motif four years after \u201cfolklore,\u201d the span of which has kept her in the spotlight after releasing the most amount of music ever before. \u201cCrash the party like a record scratch as I scream / Who\u2019s afraid of little old me? / I was tame, I was gentle \u2018til the circus life made me mean.\u201d However, she refuses to glamorize her role as a circus performer. Swift envisions herself as the unwelcome, uncomfortable party-crasher.\n\n\u201ccardigan\u201d & \u201cPeter\u201d: No heroes here\n\n\u201ccardigan,\u201d and its folklorian greater whole, came from the COVID lockdown, in which Swift imagined fictitious worlds, characters and places that never existed. \u201cI knew you / Tried to change the ending / Peter losing Wendy.\u201d In \u201ccardigan,\u201d Swift laments \u2014 albeit from the fictionalized perspective of high school Betty \u2014 of a lover who fell into the Peter Pan trope who chose eternal adolescence over anything else. TTPD\u2019s \u201cPeter\u201d is a direct response to the song. With the title, Swift compares her lover to Peter Pan of Neverland. \u201c Said you were gonna grow up / Then you were gonna come find me / Words from the mouths of babes / Promises oceans deep.\u201d Swift reiterates the theme of aging, but the \u201cwords of babes\u201d are meaningless now.\n\n\u201cYou Belong with Me\u201d & \u201cSo High School\u201d: Adolescent love\n\nArguably the most popular song in Swift\u2019s discography is \u201cYou Belong With Me,\u201d a wistful tune that takes listeners back to high school, where a crush is like no other. It\u2019s amplified and narrowed at the same time. It\u2019s embarrassing and heartstopping, altogether. \u201cShe\u2019s cheer captain, and I\u2019m on the bleachers / Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find / That what you\u2019re looking for has been here the whole time.\u201d Well over 15 years have passed since the \u201cFearless\u201d track peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard charts. Now, Swift\u2019s claim to being the next-door-girl is a little bit more difficult at this stage in her life. But there is something about high school and high school love that is magical and worth remembering forever. \u201cI\u2019m trying to stifle my sighs / \u2018Cause I feel so high school / Every time I look at you / But look at you.\u201d\n```"}

As always, he succeeded.\n\nScott Dixon held on Sunday to win the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach. (Photo by Nick Charles Currie)\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie April 21, 2024 at 4:58 pm PDT\n\nAn unpredictable race ended with one of the most predictable outcomes in IndyCar: Scott Dixon won with fuel strategy Sunday at the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach. With the win, the six-time champion moves into second in the championship. He\u2019s now won at least one race in 20 consecutive years, one more year than his teammate Kyffin Simpson (No. 4) has spent alive.\n\nDixon (No. 9) has made a tradition out of winning with massive fuel saves in recent years, coming out on top while off-strategy twice last year. This one, Dixon said, was uncertain. \u201cIt was definitely a bit sketchy,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the [fuel] number consistently, so I was a little worried about that.\u201d\n\nWith two laps to go, however, the New Zealander was told he was good to go on fuel, which let him defend from Colton Herta (No. 26) in second until the checkered flag flew. \u201cI knew he was gonna make it [on fuel]. I don\u2019t know how,\u201d reigning champion Alex Palou (No. 10) said. \u201cProbably he\u2019s cheating, he has an extra fuel cell,\u201d he jokingly added.\n\nIt took a while for Dixon\u2019s weekend to kick into gear. He was out of the top ten in both practice sessions and only qualified eighth. As it often does, though, the race fell perfectly Dixon\u2019s way. Polesitter Felix Rosenqvist (No. 60) lost the lead immediately, with Will Power (No. 12) hanging it around the outside at turn one. Power grew a five-second lead over second-place Marcus Ericsson (No. 28), while the Meyer Schenk driver quickly dropped to sixth.\n\nOn lap 16, the race turned upside down. Rookie Christian Rasmussen (No. 20) broke a toe link and spun, taking him out of the race and bringing out a caution. About half the field, including then-leader Power, chose to change tires and refuel ten laps before the expected pit cycle. That group saved time on pit road, but assigned themselves a colossal fuel save.\n\nAfter the restart, Power lost the lead of his strategy to Dixon, who quickly gapped the Penske driver. While multiple alternate strategy drivers finished in the top ten, only Dixon had success. The six-time champion started the race eighth, but found himself leading after the final round of pit stops. Power was second of those drivers, finishing sixth.\n\nWith 20 laps left, it was clear that Dixon would have a very tough time winning the race. Josef Newgarden (No. 2) quickly caught up to Dixon and was within a second of the New Zealander with 16 to go. The two-time champion struggled to get past Dixon, with few overtaking opportunities around the two-mile street course. Newgarden stayed within a second, but he lost time at the start of the straight on Shoreline Drive \u2014 the main place to pass.\n\nAs Newgarden doggedly pursued Dixon, Herta began gaining around half a second each lap on the leading pair and shortly joined the battle for the lead. With nine left, Dixon caught lapped traffic, but Newgarden was sent into anti-stall after being hit in the gearbox by Herta, dropping Penske\u2019s top car to fourth. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been happy if it had gone that way for me, I apologize to him,\u201d Herta said of the incident. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t go into anti-stall, then nothing happens.\u201d\n\nJust like Newgarden, Herta persistently tried to get past Dixon for the lead but could not get close enough to make a move. \u201cSometimes you need more than just speed in car racing,\u201d the California native said. \u201cIt\u2019s always tough to lose the home race, but I\u2019m happy with second.\u201d\n\nIndyCar returns next Sunday at Barber Motorsports Park in Alabama, as the season kicks into gear.\n```"}

A Japanese duo consisting of Ayase and Ikura, YOASOBI entered the music scene in 2019 as producer and singer respectively with their single \u201cYoru ni Kakeru.\u201d This song is an adaptation of the short story \u201cTanatosu no Yuwaku\u201d (The Temptation of Thanatos) by Maya Hoshino that depicts the love story between a man and a young woman who repeatedly attempts to take her own life, ending in both of them succumbing to death. Unlike the story however, the song has a bright and upbeat instrumental paired with Ikura\u2019s sweet vocals. This push and pull between darker themes and the light melodies and vocals have grown to become YOASOBI\u2019s signature sound.\n\nAnother part of YOASOBI\u2019s distinctive vibe comes from Ayase\u2019s process and his background as a Vocaloid producer. Vocaloid software utilizes a synthesized voicebank with popular artists including names like Hatsune Miku. The duo also experiments with the genre and instrumentation. Ikura\u2019s vocals bring more life and emotion to each performance, allowing the songs to feel both new and familiar every time. Ayase takes in the crowd as a live video of guitarist Ash plays on the backdrop. (Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\nAlthough YOASOBI has been growing since their start, another big break they had was with their theme song for the anime \u201cOshi no Ko\u201d (My Favorite Idol) called \u201cIDOL\u201d that blew up online. In addition to \u201cOshi no Ko,\u201d they have done anime theme songs for other shows such as \u201cSousou no Frieren\u201d and \u201cBeastars.\u201d As a result, fans at the Los Angeles concert could be found wearing anime T-shirts and even cosplays. From people from out of state, to USC students, to people who drove up from San Diego, the line for YOASOBI saw a wide range of fans ready to experience the group\u2019s first solo concert. The earliest person in line, Susan, who declined to give their last name for privacy reasons, revealed that she arrived at around 6:40am to wait in line and hopefully snag the best view possible. \u201cI heard it\u2019s a lot harder to see them overseas. Who knows when they\u2019ll be back,\u201d Susan said In fact many fans had the same idea to come earlier, with around 50 fans already waiting with camping chairs and umbrellas at 1pm. Fans wait in anticipation for YOASOBI to enter the stage. (Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\n\u201cWhenever I am feeling down or when I want something like peaceful vibes, happy vibes I just put on YOASOBI and their playlist,\u201d Susan said. \u201cMajority of the songs for me \u2013 if you put aside the meanings since a lot of them are very deep \u2013 it\u2019s usually like mellow, catchy, instrumentals which I need in my stressful life.\u201d\n\nFast forward to around 9:15pm, YOASOBI opened their concert with \u201cSeventeen\u201d and the hall erupted with light sticks and cheers. Ikura had streetwear and high pigtails with pink highlights on a raised platform for the first song while Ayase rocked bleached blond hair on keyboard and synthesizer as their live band brought the iconic instrumentals to life. Ikura thanks fans for coming to the show. (Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\nWith very short breaks between each song, the energy stayed high throughout the concert with Ikura saying \u201cThank you!\u201d after every performance. But in true YOASOBI experimental fashion, not only did they have a set list that highlighted their diverse discography but they leveraged lighting and the backdrop screen graphics to even better immerse the audience in their performance. Bassist Hikaru Yamamoto gazes into the audience as she accompanies Ikura\u2019s vocals. (Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\nAbout a third of the way into the night, YOASOBI had everyone put on 3D animation glasses for their seventh song \u201cBiri-Biri\u201d and turn off any light sticks or phones. During the song, the backdrop behind YOASOBI jumped out with the 3D effects of a \u201cMinecraft\u201d-style landscape. The beautiful graphics heightened Ikura\u2019s vocals and energy to another level as the audience was truly able to feel the emotions of the song with all their senses. The last song featuring the 3D animation was \u201cTsubame\u201d (meaning \u201cswallow\u201d) that is based on the short story \u201cChiisana Tsubame no Ookina Yume\u2019' about a swallow that shows the negative aspects of humanity and how a swallow brings happiness to people. This song\u2019s graphics displayed a beautiful bird animation forming and flying over Ikura perfectly matching the song. Ikura moves to the melodies of \u201cShukufuku.\u201d (Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\nAfter the 3D displays, YOASOBI brought out one of their most popular songs, \u201cIDOL.\u201d Unlike other performances where this song is saved for the end of their performance, YOASOBI\u2019s set featured this song close to the beginning of the second half of the concert. More phones and lightsticks rose up in the crowd than ever before, with some fans even doing lightstick choreography in sync with the song. Without rest, the energy continued on with the audience cheering in unison and singing to YOASOBI\u2019s songs and even rocking to the guitar lines in \u201cKaibutsu.\u201d Although no one wanted the night to end, the concert began to speedily reach its close as YOASOBI sang \u201cHeart Beat,\u201d stating it was their last song. However, much of the crowd was still waiting for YOASOBI\u2019s most iconic song, \u201cYoru ni Kakeru,\u201d as the lights dimmed and the band and YOASOBI left the stage. With everyone in the audience cheering \u201cENCORE\u201d together, YOASOBI, of course, did not forget their roots. \u201cYoru ni Kakeru\u201d was the perfect ending to the night as everyone in the audience cheered and jumped to the catchy instrumentals of the song.

With their ingenuity with melodies, beats, and lyricism, YOASOBI is definitely not stopping anytime soon.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/21/what-to-expect-around-the-streets-of-long-beach/", "response": "```\nThe Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach is in its 49th year, but it is as hard to predict as ever. Meyer Schenk Racing\u2019s Felix Rosenqvist (No. 60) took pole position, continuing a hot start to the season and to his time with the team. This will be the fourth front-row start in four races for the Swede. It\u2019s the first time the team has started on pole in a points race, but Rosenqvist did lead the field to green in Thermal. \n\nWill Power (No. 12) has had a roller coaster weekend already. After practice, a good starting position seemed unlikely as he found the wall twice. The Australian driver hasn\u2019t taken pole since Laguna Seca in 2022, when he set the record for most poles in IndyCar history and clinched his second championship. Today, he and Rosenqvist set a different record: the closest front row on a street course in series history (0.0039 seconds).\n\nDespite topping the morning practice session, Long Beach\u2019s reigning winner and polesitter, Andretti\u2019s Kyle Kirkwood (No. 27), only managed a 10th-place starting spot. He\u2019s had pace all weekend and should still pose a threat, but at a notoriously difficult track to pass on, he has his work cut out for him.\n\nWith the grid set, here\u2019s what to watch when the Grand Prix of Long Beach kicks off.\n\nTeam strength\nAndretti Global is traditionally quick around street courses. That has continued so far this weekend with all three drivers. Colton Herta (No. 26) and Marcus Ericsson (No. 28) join Kirkwood in the top ten, starting fourth and fifth, respectively. Rosenqvist is further proof of the team\u2019s speed this weekend, as Andretti shares its data with MSR. Penske managed a 1-2-3 finish in the season opener at St. Petersburg, also a street track. Will Andretti and MSR\u2019s qualifying pace translate to race pace?\n\nTurn eight\nTurn eight is a 90-degree right-hander, followed by the track\u2019s second-longest straight. It is not traditionally a passing opportunity, but it was reprofiled and only has painted curbing this year, which has allowed drivers to carry more speed through it. Power and Rosenqvist were skeptical that it could lead to moves into turn nine, but there were multiple moves at both eight and nine in the IMSA race. Both are risky moves with tire barriers on the outside, but both turns could easily be the site of a jaw-dropping pass or an embarrassing crash.\n\nStill no David Malukas\nMcLaren\u2019s David Malukas is still out, yet to recover from an offseason bike crash which broke his wrist and tore ligaments. His replacement in the No. 6 car had been Callum Ilott, but the Brit isn\u2019t available, already contracted to drive for Jota in the World Endurance Championship. In Ilott\u2019s stead is reigning Formula 2 champion Th\u00e9o Pourchaire. The Frenchman had never driven an IndyCar before this weekend and qualified 22nd. He is unlikely to pose a significant threat, but McLaren is a top team and it may be Pourchaire\u2019s only opportunity to race stateside this year. His race should at least be intriguing.\n\nA second car change\nAt St. Petersburg, IndyCar introduced an upgrade package that removed 20 lbs from the car. This weekend, IndyCar brings in a new aeroscreen which is 11 lbs lighter. Such changes are not unusual for this season \u2014 the long-awaited hybrid engine is set to debut after the Indy 500 \u2014 but they provide another challenge to get on top of at an already tough track. The weight change is already making itself felt, Power said. \u201cYou can actually get away with being a little sideways and not lose time,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt\u2019s a more nimble car. You can hustle it.\u201d Rosenqvist did just that on his pole-winning lap, losing the rear at turn five but carrying plenty of speed. Cars have yet to run in traffic, where they have less downforce. That willingness to lose the rear end could prove treacherous in race conditions.\n\nThe green flag will wave in Long Beach at 12:45 PST on USA Network and Peacock.\n```"}

(Photo by Kim Ly)\n\nBy Terence Holton April 20, 2024 at 4:52 pm PDT\n\nThe 2024 season for USC football is officially underway. In a showdown as old as time between the USC offense and USC defense, the defense came out on top. \u201cYou saw some really good moments from both sides, some really good potential from both sides,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said postgame. \u201cAs those guys that played today get better, as we get some of these guys back here for summer and fall camp, [I\u2019m] excited about where we can go.\u201d\n\nThe spring game rules are nothing like the normal rules of football. Because the game is offense versus defense, the defense starts with 24 points, while the offense starts with none. The defense can score points in five different ways: Three points for forcing a turnover, three points for a fourth-down stop, three points for a missed field goal by the offense, seven points for a defensive touchdown and seven points for a forced safety.\n\nUSC fans got their first look at what is likely to be a redshirt junior quarterback Miller Moss-commanded team, as well as UNLV transfer redshirt freshman quarterback Jayden Maiava, who showed signs that he is still in the running to compete for the coveted position as USC\u2019s starting quarterback.\n\nIn his first snap on the field of the Coliseum, Maiava ripped off a short run, which he likely would have taken for more if the play was not blown dead by the spring game\u2019s light tackling rules.\n\nThe USC defense took a dominant start, nabbing interceptions on three straight offensive possessions by all three of the Trojan QBs, Maiava, Moss and junior Jake Jensen. Two of the interceptions were grabbed by newcomers. Graduate cornerback DeCarlos Nicholson (a Mississippi State transfer) grabbed the first and freshman cornerback Marcelles Williams grabbed the second.\n\nThe USC defense started off up 33-0 after not allowing the Trojans offense any leeway whatsoever. Senior defensive lineman Jamil Muhammad discussed how much better he believed the tackling has been for the Trojans so far in the offseason \u2014 an issue that has plagued Riley\u2019s Trojans thus far in his tenure.\n\n\u201cI think we had some live periods today where guys were the first ones to the ball, and we needed no more bodies because they broke them down,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cI think tackling has been much better, and I think also that is a component of getting bigger, getting stronger in the weight room this offseason.\u201d\n\nThe first touchdown of the game came from a dart to the corner of the end zone from Maiava to freshman wide receiver Makai Lemon. After the first score, the offense got cooking, as Jensen and company marched down the field and punched in a touchdown on the ground, with freshman running back Bryan Jackson capitalizing to end the first half with the offense down 33-14.\n\nThe hot stretch for the offense did not continue as after a dropped Moss pass to junior wide receiver Kyron Hudson wound up in the hands of junior cornerback Prophet Brown, who took the interception back 100 yards for a pick-6 to give the defense a 40-14 lead.\n\n\u201cI probably haven\u2019t run that long since my high school days at running back,\u201d Brown said jokingly. \u201cI was definitely gassed after that play.\u201d\n\nRiley spoke of how the defense\u2019s performance was nothing new to the coaching staff and what they have seen so far in 2024, saying \u201cI thought that defensively, you saw some flashes of what we have been seeing on the practice field. Defensively did a great job creating turnovers, probably the story of the day of the defense making the offense pay for their mistakes.\u201d\n\nThe slow grind continued for the offense as the clock dwindled down, but the offense seemed unphased and proceeded with its game plan. Eventually, Moss lofted a short pass to Jackson to score the receiver\u2019s second touchdown of the game, as the USC offense eclipsed over 20 points, still sitting 19 points down to the Trojan defense.\n\nMoss finished with 133 yards, two interceptions and the lone touchdown; however, he wasn\u2019t phased when he was told that Riley said he would be the starting quarterback if they had played a real game today.\n\n\u201cMy mentality or approach isn\u2019t by coach Riley saying that I am the starting quarterback or not. My job is to lead this team and do everything I can to help us win,\u201d Moss said.\n\nThe defensive domination continued the next drive, as Maiava threw his second interception of the game, putting the defense up 43-21.\n\nThe game ended with redshirt freshman running back A\u2019Marion Peterson carrying the ball 6 yards for the touchdown, effectively finishing the game with the defense on top, 43-28.\n\nUSC has a long offseason of tackling drills, quarterback competitions and overall development before the 2024 season. The Trojans\u2019 first game in the Big 10 kicks off at 4:30 p.m. on September 1 in Las Vegas against the highly vaunted LSU Tigers.\n```"}

Overflowing with intimacy, Swift\u2019s 11 studio album takes fans on a rollercoaster of emotions. From the aftermath of her breakup with British actor Joe Alwyn in \u201cSo Long, London\u201d to a celebration of her love for Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce in \u201cThe Alchemy,\u201d here are ten of the best lyrics from \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt more when we played pretend / Than with all the Kens / \u2018Cause he took me out of my box / Stole my tortured heart / Left all these broken parts\u201d \u2013 \u201cMy Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\u201d\n\nReminiscent of Greta Gerwig\u2019s 2023 film \u201cBarbie,\u201d Swift depicts herself as a doll who has been played with and abandoned by her lover. Even with her plastered-on plastic smile, Swift\u2019s heart has been cracked and her spirit broken by their relationship.\n\n\u201cI stopped CPR, after all, it\u2019s no use / The spirit was gone, we would never come to\u201d \u2013 \u201cSo Long, London\u201d\n\nThe heartbeat of Swift\u2019s relationship with Joe Alwyn seems to have gone silent, leaving their love dead with no hope of resuscitation. The \u201cMidnights\u201d vault track song \u201cYou\u2019re Losing Me\u201d uses a similar metaphor with lyrics like \u201cI can\u2019t find a pulse / My heart won\u2019t start anymore / For you\u201d set to the beat of a pulsing heart.\n\n\u201cSo I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street / Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream / \u201cWho\u2019s afraid of little old me?\u201d / You should be\u201d \u2013 \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Little Old Me?\u201d\n\nAs she compares herself to the Grim Reaper, Swift enters the anger stage of grief. The haunting, rage-filled lyrics of \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Little Old Me?\u201d contain the biting wit seen in the song \u201cmad woman\u201d from Swift\u2019s eighth studio album \u201cfolklore.\u201d\n\n\u201cDancing phantoms on the terrace / Are they second-hand embarrassed / That I can\u2019t get out bed / \u2018Cause something counterfeit\u2019s dead?\u201d \u2013 \u201cloml\u201d\n\nSwift flips the common meaning of \u201cloml\u201d on its head in this song, as she addresses an ex-boyfriend as the loss, rather than the love, of her life. The ghosts of this relationship are seen haunting Swift as she watches their inauthentic love story play out before her again and again.\n\n\u201cBreaking down, I hit the floor / All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, \u2018More\u2019\u201d \u2013 \u201cI Can Do It With A Broken Heart\u201d\n\nIn \u201cI Can Do It With A Broken Heart,\u201d Swift sheds the put-together mask she wore during the first half of The Eras Tour to reveal her internal breakdown after her breakup with Alwyn. The juxtaposition between her public image of success and private grief following heartbreak is mirrored by depressing lyrics set to an upbeat track.\n\n\u201cSo when I touch down / Call the amateurs and cut \u2018em from the team / Ditch the clowns, get the crown / Baby, I\u2019m the one to beat\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe Alchemy\u201d\n\nUtilizing multiple football references, \u201cThe Alchemy\u201d details the highs of Swift\u2019s blossoming relationship with Kelce. Rather than stating that she and Kelce have chemistry, Swift travels back in time to the medieval era to express the magnetic pull between them.\n\n\u201cWas it hazing for a cruel fraternity? I pledged and I still mean it / Old habits die screaming\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe Black Dog\u201d\n\nThrough the metaphor of a college student joining a fraternity, Swift recounts the torture her ex put her through to earn his love. Despite her ongoing commitment to him, it seems she has been left in denial, grasping onto old habits.\n\n\u201cYour hologram stumbled into my apartment / Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness / Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus / And I just watched it happen\u201d \u2013 \u201cChloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus\u201d\n\nSwift sees herself as a detached observer who lacks the power to interfere with the life of a former lover. In her head, she plays back a scene of him cheating on her with some stranger she doesn\u2019t know the name of.\n\n\u201cThe deflation of our dreaming / Leaving me bereft and reeling / My beloved ghost and me / Sitting in a tree / D-Y-I-N-G\u201d \u2013 \u201cHow Did It End?\u201d\n\nPlaying off of the popular nursery rhyme \u201cK-I-S-S-I-N-G,\u201d Swift outlines the death of her dreams to marry one of her exes. In a tree she might have once sat with her lover, Swift is left alone with nothing but the ghosts of her past to keep her company.\n\n\u201cTruth, dare, spin bottles / You know how to ball, I know Aristotle / Brand new, full throttle / Touch me while your bros play \u2018Grand Theft Auto\u2019\u201d \u2013 \u201cSo High School\u201d\n\nIn the spirit of teenage love, Swift refers to games like \u201cspin the bottle\u201d and \u201ckiss, marry, kill\u201d in \u201cSo High School\u201d to portray her love with Kelce.

(Photo by Paulena Edelman)\n\nBy Paulena Edelman\nApril 19, 2024 at 5:34 pm PDT\n\nFor three days, and three days only, The Grove hosted Spotify\u2019s installation of a library dedicated to Taylor Swift\u2019s latest album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department.\u201d Taylor Nation began spreading the message on Monday. It was set to run from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. from April 16 to 18.\n\nThe first thing you notice as you stroll through The Grove \u2014 a lively outside mall in Los Angeles \u2014 in search of the pop-up is the sound of Taylor Swift songs playing over speakers. Next, if you enter from the valet circle, you notice the smaller-than-expected display. As you continue advancing towards the \u201clibrary,\u201d there\u2019s a line in front of the pop-up with people waiting to circle the rectangular structure and take pictures. The line, at first glance, appears short... then, you look past that surprisingly small line and down the main street of The Grove. That\u2019s when the reality of the situation hits. The line did not start there, it wrapped around the corner and continued for at least another block further.\n\nSwifties waited for hours to take pictures in \"The Tortured Poets Department\" pop-up. (Photo by Paulena Edelman)\n\nVelvet ropes. Security guards. Spotify. Grove management. Swifties. And more Swifties. Samantha Shields, with MKG marketing company, saw long lines, \u201ca million Swifties,\u201d dogs with wagging tails and the installation of new props covered by umbrellas to prevent fans from seeing the new pieces before each reveal.\n\n\u201cMy favorite part has been meeting all the Swifties,\u201d Shields said. \u201cI did not understand how well-loved Taylor Swift was until I worked this event. [...] I didn\u2019t expect so many happy people to be out here.\u201d\n\nMothers, fathers, daughters, sons. Friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, grandparents, husbands and wives. Casual outfits and cardigans, themed outfits and friendship bracelets. People of all ages and genders were grasping onto pieces of cardstock with \u201cTTPD\u201d song titles, checking off their most anticipated song while waiting in line.\n\nMatthew Wallace, a Swiftie in the making, drove in from Santa Monica \u2014 streaming Swift on the way there \u2014 so his wife and daughter could experience it. \u201cI\u2019m excited. I love to support their interests,\u201d Wallace said. \u201c[I\u2019m most excited about] hearing my daughter sing all the songs around the house.\u201d\n\nMack Moore, 24, and Karina Marino, 21, were excited to share this experience together since the two best friends originally bonded over their shared love for Swift. \u201cIt means a lot to me to be able to participate in stuff like this and kind of just have fun with it, especially because I feel like I grew up with Taylor,\u201d Moore said. \u201c[Karina and I] are best friends because of Taylor.\u201d\n\nNine Eras Tour shows and a six-hour drive from San Francisco to participate in the pop-up madness later, it only made sense that the dynamic duo came dressed up as tortured poets with a pink aesthetic \u2014 inspired by Swift \u201cShe takes her joy seriously. She takes how she wants to approach life seriously,\u201d Marino said. \u201cShe chose it... and I think that\u2019s very inspiring that you continue to choose your own happiness, but also be so vulnerable about your own sadness.\u201d\n\nMack Moore and Karina Marino, two friends who bonded over their love of Swift, dressed in a pink poet aesthetic. (Photo by Paulena Edelman)\n\nLiliana Ruiz-Garcia drove in with her friends from Laverne, California. During her time in line, she reveled in the presence of the Swiftie community. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re all meeting each other for the first time. But we all, like, know each other,\u201d she said.\n\nOther fans took the opportunity to gather with fellow Swiftie friends. Joy Pangilinan, who is only three days younger than Swift, created the SoCal Swifties Club to connect with other fans in a judgment-free zone. \u201cYou can just sing and dance and kind of do whatever you want [because] they\u2019re not going to judge you for who you are,\u201d Pangilinan said.\n\nAfter minutes, hours or days of waiting, you finally reach the front of the line. Today was Andrea Rosenthal\u2019s third day in line. The Santa Clarita resident drove an hour there and back on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. She was in line Tuesday morning at 7:45, camped out for the first-day opening. On Wednesday, she scoped out the line in anticipation of bringing her friend the next day. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting because you catch [easter eggs] you didn\u2019t catch the first time,\u201d Rosenthal said. \u201cYou\u2019re always with new people in line, so a lot of the fun is singing along with the songs or [...] walking through The Grove and seeing other people mouthing the words.\u201d\n\nFirst, there is a photo opportunity in front of bookshelves and a TTPD wall. The picture, \u201cFrom the Desk of Taylor Swift,\u201d is printed out and handed to you as Spotify workers nudge you further into the \u201clibrary.\u201d Gray walls, gold accents and shelves filled with books varying in color \u2014 gray, white and black \u2014 with multiple Easter eggs nestled amongst the nooks and crannies. Easter eggs included a black peace sign hand, which fans speculated indicated a double album release. Books lined the top of the wall. Typewriters, candle sticks and library cards filled the walls. TTPD signs were splashed throughout the entire pop-up. Stone busts were front and center in some of the shelves.\n\nAs you leave the library, you get another photo opportunity, this time next to a giant picture of Swift. Exiting, you are handed one last keepsake: a bookmark with the song tracks. While the line certainly looked tortuous, the Swifites were in an infectiously good mood \u2014 laughing, talking, smiling and, of course, trading friendship bracelets.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Jada Ward and Marco Haynes\nApril 19, 2024 at 4:19 pm PDT\n\nStarting July 1, 2024, USC Annenberg will bid farewell to CareerLink, its longtime platform for career services, advising, events and online resources. The school is set to move to Handshake, a decision that will change how students navigate their career paths. Handshake connects students with job opportunities, internships and career resources, helping to ensure that students are well prepared for success in their future careers.\n\nHandshake, a career management system, offers a user-friendly network that simplifies the job searching process. This shift will provide students as well as alumni with additional resources to navigate their career paths effectively.\n\nThe decision to switch from CareerLink to Handshake was made by the university over the past summer, going over bids from several companies. \u201cThe university came together and this past summer we had a number of companies come to us with their versions of what their job board would be like, potentially for USC and handshake was the one who won the bid,\u201d said Annenberg career advisor Zackery Luis Rigney. \u201cRecently, we\u2019ve been going through the implementation of transitioning from Simplicity, which was CareerLink, and connectSC into Handshake.\u201d\n\nStudents\u2019 CareerLink profiles have already migrated to Handshake, making the transition seamless for users. \u201cHonestly, because of how easy and simple it is to utilize, anyone can just hop on to look for jobs; even [just] narrowing down searches and seeing different things, [overall] accessibility, it is going to be a lot easier for people to find jobs, especially for students and recent grads,\u201d Rigney said. \u201cI see a lot of confidence in our ability to help students and alums who are looking for their next step because of how easy it will be to utilize.\u201d\n\nHandshake will allow students to narrow down positions that meet their needs, whether they are looking for internships, part-time or full-time jobs. Students can also find out about events on campus and get in contact with employers through posts on the platform.\n\nHandshake is already being used by over 1,500 other colleges and institutions, according to their website. The decision to pick Handshake was based on the needs communicated by students in their job search, as well as the concerns of employers who have had difficulty posting job openings on CareerLink, according to Rigney.\n\n\u201cThe biggest hindrance for students is \u2018A\u2019, finding jobs and \u2018B,\u2019 for employers [is] posting jobs, and because it\u2019s [Handshake] a way easier system to utilize, it becomes a lot more efficient for people to post things,\u201d Rigney said.\n\nHandshake was founded in Michigan by tech alumni in 2014, and since then has more than 15 million students and 900,000 employers who have joined the site.\n```"}

(AP/David Zalubowski)\n\nBy Dylan Luden April 19, 2024 at 4:11 pm PDT\n\nIn a season filled with hills and valleys for the Los Angeles Lakers, their first-round playoff matchup against the Denver Nuggets seems like Mount Everest. The Lakers haven\u2019t defeated the Nuggets since Dec. 16, 2022 \u2014 eight straight regular season and playoff losses to the reigning NBA champions. Even after being swept by the Nuggets during the regular season, the Lakers have a chance to rewrite their story against Nikola Jokic, Mike Malone and co.\n\nDuring last season\u2019s playoffs, LeBron James was playing on a foot injury. Now, he\u2019s fully healthy and ready to go after serving as the primary defender against a lights-out Zion Williamson during the Lakers\u2019 play-in victory on Tuesday. In order for the Lakers to defeat the Nuggets, LA has to find a way to get their shooters hot. Without the Lakers\u2019 arch-nemesis Bruce Brown on the Nuggets\u2019 roster, D\u2019Angelo Russell and Austin Reaves have a chance to be X factors in a series that\u2019s result will largely depend on how each team\u2019s big men play.\n\nRussell played extremely well from behind the arc against the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday, sinking five threes as he\u2019ll look to carry that momentum into Denver. Even though Anthony Davis is one of the NBA\u2019s best defenders, it\u2019s almost impossible to stop the multi-talented two-time (and potentially soon to be three-time) MVP Nikola Jokic, who has so many ways to torture a defense. He can hurt you in the post, behind the arc and with his smooth passing skills.\n\nJarred Vanderbilt\u2019s absence will also hurt the Lakers, as he and Davis could\u2019ve switched off defensively on Jokic. Jaxon Hayes might fill that role of a help defender with size, which he\u2019s done a good job of so far this season in limited minutes.\n\nWith Jokic as the main star of the Nuggets\u2019 roster, it was arguably Jamal Murray who outshined him during last season\u2019s Western Conference Finals sweep of the Lakers. During that series, Murray averaged 32.5 points per game, shooting 53% from the field and 41% from deep. But this time around, the Lakers might just have Murray\u2019s kryptonite: former Miami Heat playoff cult hero Gabe Vincent, who is hitting form at just the right time after missing most of the season with a left knee injury.\n\nVincent was one of the catalysts for a Lakers run in New Orleans that saw them take the lead at halftime after being down by over 10 in the second quarter. He was hitting threes and creating chaos on defense, racking up steals. Vincent also was able to keep Murray relatively quiet in the NBA finals last season, helping to shrink Murray\u2019s points per game average down to 21.4 points. Murray\u2019s field goal percentage also dipped to 45% in the NBA Finals and his three-point percentage went down to 39%.\n\nGiven the lack of off-the-bench impact for LA following Rui Hachimura\u2019s promotion to the starting lineup, the Lakers have relied heavily on the starting five to acquire wins. If Vanderbilt were healthy, he would slide into the starting lineup, allowing Hachimura to give the Lakers that offensive threat from the bench. Without him and the stretch-forward in Christian Wood, the Lakers bench offense has been tame. However, Vincent now seems fully healthy and his performance against the Pelicans showed it. He shot 50% from the field and from deep, so maybe he\u2019s the spark from the bench the Lakers need.\n\nLakers\u2019 staff reportedly raved about his impact in Tuesday\u2019s game, according to Bleacher Report. It almost seems like a David vs. Goliath matchup, since it\u2019s been so long since the Lakers have taken down the Nuggets, but with a healthy James and Davis, anything is possible. The Lakers first game against the Nuggets is on Saturday, April 20 at 5:30 p.m.\n```"}

The Bulls won 131-116. (AP/Nam Y. Huh)\n\nBy Joseph Domingot April 19, 2024 at 3:46 pm PDT\n\n\u201cFight on, Dribble on\u201d is a weekly column by Joseph Domingot about how Trojans are performing in the NBA. After another grueling 82-game schedule, the NBA regular season has now been completed. Despite 12 teams being eliminated thus far, some former Trojans have finished off the season with some stellar performances.\n\nChimezie Metu: In the regular season\u2019s final five games, Metu averaged 11 points on a 69.2% field goal percentage during this span for the 14-68 Detroit Pistons. On April 6 against the Brooklyn Nets, he shot a perfect 9-for-9 from the field for 20 points and seven rebounds. Metu finished this season playing 51 games for the Phoenix Suns and the Pistons, averaging 6.5 points and 3.8 rebounds per outing.\n\nNikola Vucevic: Vucevic averaged over 27 points per game in the final three outings of the Chicago Bulls\u2019 regular season to help the team clinch the ninth seed and home-court advantage in the first leg of the play-in tournament, which they won against the Atlanta Hawks. He continued his stellar form in that game, scoring 24 points and collecting 12 rebounds in a do-or-die win. The Montenegrin averaged 18 points and 10 boards during the 2023-24 regular season and will look to clinch a first-round berth against the Miami Heat on Friday night.\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look back at other recent performances from former Trojans around the regular season\u2019s end, with both players looking to keep their momentum going into the postseason.\n\nEvan Mobley Despite missing several periods during the season due to injury, Mobley continued to show how vital he is for the Cleveland Cavaliers. In the 50 games he featured in, the Southern California native is 22nd in the entire league in win shares per 48 minutes \u2014 above even LeBron James. Win shares per 48 minutes are an estimated measure of the number of wins a certain player contributes every 48 minutes. Compared to seasons past, he has improved his all-around game, even despite a lack of playing time. Mobley set career highs in rebounds per game, assists per game and steals per game this season. He has also taken a massive leap in shooting efficiency at all three levels, setting career highs in field goal percentage, three-point percentage and free-throw percentage, suggesting he has another level to reach as a scorer.\n\nAgainst the Cavaliers\u2019 division rival Indiana Pacers on April 12, Evan Mobley and the Cavs had the opportunity to clinch a playoff berth with a win. In just under 30 minutes on the hardwood, Mobley clocked 12 points and five rebounds on 85% shooting to help the Cavaliers steer control of this game from the start. Despite a second-half comeback effort from the Pacers, the Cavs secured a playoff spot for back-to-back seasons.\n\nCleveland had a chance to be crowned Central Division champions with a win against the Hornets and a Milwaukee Bucks loss to the Orlando Magic. Although Orlando clinched the win, Cleveland had a different outcome. Despite scoring 14 points and securing six rebounds, the Cavaliers lost 120-110 after yanking their starters mid-way through the game, presumably in an effort to lock in their first-round matchup against Orlando. Cleveland has yet to clinch the Central Division since 2018.\n\nHis performances throughout the season have helped lead the Cavaliers through a competitive Eastern Conference, eventually finishing fourth for the second consecutive season. Now, Mobley and the Cavs will take on the fifth-seeded Magic, with Game 1 set to tip off on Saturday morning.\n\nDeMar DeRozan At 34 years old, DeMar DeRozan remarkably led the entire NBA in total minutes played in 2023-24 \u2014 finishing with 2,989. In 79 games this season, the Compton native also recorded a season-high in minutes played per game at 37.8. He is also currently the odds-on second-favorite to win the Clutch Player of the Year award, behind only the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Stephen Curry. DeRozan has been on a scoring rampage when he stays on the floor. In his final 10 regular season matchups, he averaged 29.6 points per game, helping the Bulls clinch a play-in berth. He has scored in double-digits in all but one game in 2023-24. In his 79 games, he continued to prove his worth as an all-out scorer, averaging 24 points a night, which ranks 17th in the entire association. He has done this with an efficient 58% true shooting percentage.\n\nAgainst Metu\u2019s Pistons on April 11, DeRozan torched Detroit with his scoring output, putting up 39 points in a dominating 22-point away victory to the Bulls\u2019 Central Division rival. Eighteen of those 39 came in the third quarter, which helped Chicago clinch its 38th win of the season and the nine seed, which gave the Bulls home-court advantage in the first play-in matchup against the eventual tenth-seeded Atlanta Hawks.\n\nAfter taking a rare rest against the Washington Wizards, the six-time All-Star started his 79th and final game of the regular season against the New York Knicks in Madison Square Garden. DeRozan started the game on fire \u2014 scoring 11 points in the first 12 minutes \u2014 and finished with 30 points, five assists, five rebounds and four steals in an overtime thriller in Madison Square Garden.\n\nDeRozan would follow a similar scoring pattern in the Bulls\u2019 first play-in game. He yet again opened the game at a rapid pace with 11 points in the first quarter of play and helped Chicago gain an early 18 point advantage heading into the second. Atlanta was not able to force a comeback effort, as he would finish one assist shy of a double-double to go along with his 22 points, keeping the Bulls\u2019 season alive \u2014 at least for one more game.\n\nDeRozan, Vucevic and the Bulls will take on the Miami Heat this Friday in hopes of securing the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\n\u201cFight on, Dribble on\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

(Photo by Shreya Agrawal)\n\nBy Charlotte Calm\u00e8s April 19, 2024 at 3:39 pm PDT\n\nSince October 2021, Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s administration has funneled over $700 million towards clearing homeless encampments across the state, championing a program he touted as funding \u201cresolutions\u201d to California\u2019s homelessness crisis \u2013 the largest of any state in the country. Now, the governor claims his hands are tied in tackling the issue, and is calling on the Supreme Court to take action.\n\nIn response to statewide demands for more sweeping action on homelessness, California officials are pushing to overturn the decision in Martin v. Boise, a five-year precedent that prohibits the criminalization of camping on public property when no other sleeping locations are available. Accompanying this move is the recent introduction of bipartisan California Senate Bill 1011, which aims to ban homeless encampments within 500 feet of \u201csensitive community areas\u201d such as schools and transit stops.\n\nState leaders are drafting new legislation and urging the high court to relax regulations that prevent them from clearing encampments across California. However, these measures would yield significant repercussions for South L.A. \u2013 situated in the county\u2019s supervisorial district with the largest homeless population \u2013 potentially criminalizing thousands of homeless Angelenos with nowhere else to turn.\n\nWhile homelessness is a \u201cvisually striking issue\u201d across the city according to Ben Henwood, director of USC\u2019s Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research, areas like South L.A., where many residents suffer disproportionately from factors such as income inequality and soaring housing costs, tend to experience higher concentrations of encampments.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, what you\u2019re seeing is the most extreme form of housing insecurity that people across California feel,\u201d Henwood said.\n\nIn recent years, government officials have launched a variety of city and state-level initiatives to address the ongoing encampment crisis, including Gov. Newsom\u2019s Encampment Resolution Funding Program and Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 Inside Safe campaign, which together have received over $1 billion in allocated funding. However, Henwood pointed out that despite the potential effectiveness of these \u201cvery important programs,\u201d relocations can tend to target wealthier neighborhoods with more frequent complaints about homeless residents, neglecting the fundamental issue of housing accessibility in areas with higher concentrations of encampments.\n\nIn South L.A. communities like Florence-Firestone, the number of encampments appears to be on the rise, despite noticeable clearings in other areas, according to Jonathan Pacheco Bell, vice president of the Florence-Firestone Community Organization and former embedded planner for the L.A.

Boise ruling endorsed by Gov. Newsom threatening to ban camping altogether, criminalization and dehumanization of those without permanent shelter could escalate significantly according to Director of Policy Advocacy for the Western Center on Law and Poverty Brandon Greene.\n\n\u201cWe know that unhoused people are not responsible for even a low percentage of violent acts or any other sort of public safety issue that happens in our communities each day, but it\u2019s easy to villainize them,\u201d Greene said. \u201cIf we were actually interested in the public safety aspects [...] we would do a far better job of actually listening to the experiences of unhoused people.\u201d\n\nIn order to begin alleviating the city\u2019s homelessness crisis, Greene said that leaders must focus on boosting housing availability and accessibility \u2013 both of which California has historically lacked, he explained.\n\n\u201cIf we were actually thinking about how we can rectify the expanding issue of unaffordability in California that is an on-ramp to houselessness, then we\u2019d be making very different investments,\u201d Greene said. \u201cAnd so if tomorrow the Supreme Court was to say that you could sweep more people, that\u2019s not going to get people into housing.\u201d\n\nWithout increased investment towards generating \u201ccreative housing solutions,\u201d Greene explained, sweeping measures at the state and national levels will pose significant disruptions for Los Angeles\u2019 nearly 75,000 homeless residents.\n\nWith lingering questions about future accommodations for homeless Angelenos, Henwood said that support for these measures from state leaders including Newsom \u201cdoesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, if there isn\u2019t a place for a person to go, how can you criminalize being out there on the streets? There\u2019s literally no other option,\u201d Henwood said. \u201cI think that the obvious next question is, well, where do you want people to go?\u201d\n```"}

Patrick Sandoval delivered his best start of the season on Monday, throwing five innings of one-run ball. The southpaw has continued to improve after a rough start to the season, however he was handed a no-decision, as the Angels offense couldn\u2019t muster any run support against the Rays RHP Zach Eflin. The right hander hurled 6.1 scoreless innings, striking out five and scattering six hits. The Rays bullpen took over after Eflin departed and in the top of the eighth, the Angels offense exploded, scoring five runs in the frame. The highlight of the offensive explosion was a Mike Trout two-run homer that gave the Angels a comfortable lead. The Angels allowed two runs in the bottom of the eighth, but responded right away in the top of the ninth, scoring two more and ultimately winning with a final score of 7-3.\n\nThe second contest of the four-game set was a marathon, as it took 13 innings to complete, when the Rays walked it off in extra innings. RHP Jose Soriano got the start for the Angels and his stuff looked overpowering, mixing a sinker that routinely sat in the upper 90s and even touched 101 with a low 90s wipeout slider. In five innings of work, he struck out six and only allowed one earned run. Soriano struggled with command at times as he walked five, but he mitigated the damage early on in the ballgame. RHP Aaron Civale was on the hill for the Rays and dealt early on. It took until the sixth inning, where OF Mickey Moniak and C Logan O\u2019Hoppe hit back-to-back home runs to put the Angels up 3-1. RHP Carlos Estevez came in for the save but the Rays managed to tie the game in the bottom of the ninth and send the affair to extra innings. The two teams went back and forth until the Rays faced a one-run deficit heading into the bottom of the 13th. RHP Carson Fulmer entered the game and surrendered a game-tying double and eventually a walk-off single to SS Amed Rosario.\n\nLooking to rebound, the Angels turned to the red-hot LHP Reid Detmers, who possessed a stellar 1.04 ERA heading into Wednesday. The lefty wasn\u2019t quite as sharp, but he still tossed 5.1 innings of one-run ball, allowing seven hits and striking out four. The bats started strongly in the bottom half of the first against RHP Zack Littell, with Trout slugging his eighth home run of the year. The Rays put themselves right back in the mix in the bottom of the second. Jose Siri hit a sacrifice fly but the Angels responded, plating a run in both the fifth and the sixth to take a 3-1 lead. Detmers allowed another run before giving way to the Angel bullpen. In the bottom of the seventh with RHP Adam Cimber on the bump for the Angels, Yandy Diaz lined a ball softly to Zach Neto, who made the catch and dove to tag second for a crucial inning-ending double play. RHP Hunter Strickland took over in the eighth and surrendered a go-ahead two-run homer to Amed Rosario, as the Angels bullpen continued to struggle with going late into games. Down to their last opportunity, the Angels rallied off of Rays closer Pete Fairbanks, highlighted by a game-tying single from Anthony Rendon and a go-ahead single by Taylor Ward. Strickland redeemed himself in the bottom of the ninth, pitching a clean frame to seal the 5-4 victory.\n\nIn the final game of the series, the struggling Griffin Canning got the start and the Rays jumped the right hander by scoring two runs in the first. Canning pitched a relatively clean game throughout the rest of his five innings of work, but the Angels offense failed to find an answer for RHP Ryan Pepiot. The former top prospect in the Dodgers system twirled six innings, allowing only one run and striking out seven. The Angels scored their lone run in the sixth, when Mike Trout stole second and third, eventually scoring on a sac fly, but that was all the offense they produced. In the top of the ninth, Miguel Sano and Luis Rengifo both reached to put the tying and go-ahead runs on base, but pinch-hitter Brandon Drury grounded out against LHP Colin Poche to seal the 1-2 loss for the Angels.\n\nThe Angels had an opportunity to take possession of first place in the AL West with a win on Thursday, but are now tied with the Mariners at 9-10 for second in the division. They\u2019ll head to Cincinnati to take on the Reds, who are currently on a three-game skid. They sit at 9-9 and fourth in the NL Central. It was recently revealed that RHP Robert Stephenson, who signed a three-year, $33 million dollar contract in the offseason, will miss the rest of the season due to elbow surgery. Stephenson is now one of the many pitchers that have undergone elbow surgeries early in the 2024 season, as there\u2019s been a concerning rise in elbow injuries. That\u2019s a big blow to their bullpen, especially as the Halos relief corps have struggled so far. They\u2019ve posted a combined 4.35 ERA, the sixth-worst in baseball. If they want to compete in a division that has seemed as open as ever, the Angels will have to look internally for help, or potentially acquire another reliever via trade as the season continues.\n```"}

In collaboration with De Los, the Los Angeles Times\u2019 Latine outlet, and L.A. Times en Espa\u00f1ol, the Latinidad stage can be found on the far end of Trousdale Parkway by Exposition Boulevard. There will also be Latine booths throughout the festival and a special performance by our very own Mariachi Los Troyanos de USC, all included in the festival\u2019s free admission.\n\nStarting with the Latinidad stage, there will be various events you won\u2019t want to miss. If you have young children, the story time by the Los Angeles Public Library on Saturday at 10 a.m. followed by storytime by Lil\u2019 Libros is perfect for you. They\u2019ll also have stories, rhymes, and tongue twisters followed by a read-aloud by Cindy Montenegro, author of My Mind is a Mountain. Montenegro is a Salvadoran therapist dedicated to the empowerment of everyone.\n\nAfterwards, at 1:30 p.m. there will be a talk on the struggles of street vendors with community organizers and some vendors themselves. Immediately after, there will be a panel on the importance of self-care hosted by LatinxTherapy. At 3:35 p.m. there will be a panel on soccer in Spanish and the power Los Angeles soccer teams have had on uniting the Latine community. The last event of the day on the Latinidad stage will be a talk dedicated to the difficulty of accumulating generational wealth for the Latine community at 4:30 p.m.\n\nOn Sunday, April 21st, the similar story times will be carried out as well as various talks including one on the experience of being \u201cni de aqu\u00ed ni de all\u00e1,\u201d as a first-generation American at 11:30 a.m. At 1:20 p.m. there will be a talk on the Oaxacan impact on Los Angeles with Odilia Romero, the cofounder of Comunidades Ind\u00edgenas en Liderazgo.

(Photo by Anthony Bottino)\n\nBy Anthony Bottino\nApril 19, 2024 at 2:34 pm PDT\n\nNothing brings people together quite like food, but sometimes it is a challenge to decide where to go or what to get. In Los Angeles, where there are seemingly endless restaurant and cuisine options, it can be nearly impossible for a group to come to a conclusion \u2013 especially indecisive college students. Why not refuse to choose and visit L.A.\u2019s largest open-air food market, Smorgasburg L.A.?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from Washington, but my son lives here,\u201d Steve Dilley, a Smorgasburg diner, said. \u201cHe said there\u2019s some good food, so I said we should come over here. My favorite thing is the variety of everything.\u201d\n\nLocated in ROW DTLA, Smorgasburg caters to everyone\u2019s food preferences \u2014 no matter what they are craving. The name is a play on the word \u201csmorgasbord,\u201d which is used to refer to a variety of foods. Smorgasburg certainly lives up to its namesake; open every Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., the market features more than 50 different restaurant booths with unique selections.\n\n\u201cSmorgasburg L.A. provides a platform for nearly 100 small businesses curated from the next wave of SoCal\u2019s food, beverage and shopping scene,\u201d Smorgasburg LA\u2019s website says.\n\nOriginating in New York at the Brooklyn Flea, Smorgasburg has expanded across the country to other cities like Miami, Jersey City and right here in Los Angeles. Founders Jonathan Butler and Eric Demby frequently traveled to Los Angeles looking for a place to open a new location, so when ROW DTLA reached out to them, they jumped at the opportunity.\n\nTo be part of the market, restaurants can apply online through their website and then go through an interview process \u2013 and a taste test. With so many vendors, it may seem that repeat cuisines and dishes would run rampant (and leave some foodies unenthused). But Zach Brooks, the general manager of Smorgasburg L.A., ensures that each one adds their own unique touch and flavor.\n\n\u201cWe understand that consistency is incredibly important in the food business,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cWe may have six, seven, eight taco vendors, but each vendor does a very specific style of taco \u2013 whether it\u2019s from a specific region in Mexico, or a family recipe that\u2019s incredibly unique or a chef-driven concept where the tacos are from a unique perspective from a chef that was born and raised in L.A. or something like that.\u201d\n\nNews outlets have also recognized the great food Smorgasburg offers Angelenos. In 2001, nearly 30 restaurants that were a part of the market were also featured on the Los Angeles Times\u2019 101 Best Restaurants list. Then in 2022 and 2023, Smorgasburg itself was featured on the ranking.\n\nBut Smorgasburg is more than just good food. It also embraces the L.A. lifestyle and culture by incorporating a small business section in the middle of all the food booths, allowing customers to do some light Sunday shopping while enjoying a meal. Some of the non-food vendors include small businesses like Baked Papaya, La Sirena and Pocket Square Clothing that sell apparel. Customers can also peruse the selection of custom rugs, jewelry, plants and homemade candles from other vendors. Of course, knowing the Smogasburg audience, there are also specialty kitchen knives.\n\n\u201cWhat food does is bring diversity. When you have different types of food from Asian to American to \u2018Happy Ice,\u2019 it brings people [together],\u201d said Joel Stallworth, owner of the Small Shop LA boutique. \u201cIf I can show my stuff in front of people, I can sell it. It [Smorgasburg] has been really good for my business and brand awareness.\u201d\n\nThe weekly market is a vibrant scene with music, occasional live DJ performances and Smorgasburg employees selling merchandise and interacting with customers. They also have a calendar that includes different themed events like speed dating with CitySwoon, an AAPI day collaboration with AAPI LA and a pizza day slated for the upcoming months. A vinyl records fair with music merchandise and vinyls for sale takes place every third Sunday of the month.\n\nSmorgasburg L.A. provides a space for vendors, restaurants and customers to enjoy robust culture centered around one of people\u2019s favorite things \u2013 food. While it is a commercial success, Smorgasburg keeps its biggest goal in mind: to bring attention to local businesses and provide Angelenos with good food.\n\n\u201cWe really pride ourselves on being an incubator for new businesses,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cWe are really proud of how many businesses we\u2019ve helped go from being something that someone started during the pandemic in their house, or a food truck or a pop up, [...] to opening a brick and mortar business, or opening a catering company.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Ethan Thai)\n\nBy Riley Sager April 19, 2024 at 2:27 pm PDT\n\nJust 135 days (but who\u2019s counting?) until the 2024 football season kicks off, but there\u2019s still one crucial component of this practice season remaining: the annual spring football game. This scrimmage will consist of an irregular game format that pits the Trojans\u2019 defense against the offense and will be the public\u2019s first sneak peek into what\u2019s been brewing this offseason. It\u2019s also an opportunity for the team to play together in a scrimmage that somewhat resembles a real game and become more familiar with plays on the big stage.\n\nThe spring game will be a good glimpse into the team\u2019s chemistry, how each player\u2019s positional situation has developed and overall morale. However, don\u2019t expect any schemes or magic trick plays, as there\u2019s much to be saved for the real competition when the season kicks off on September 1 against LSU.\n\nIt\u2019s been an intense five weeks of practices, but the Trojans are looking forward to demonstrating the hard work required for adjusting to new coaches, players and schemes. \u201cWe feel hungry,\u201d sophomore defensive lineman Elijah Hughes said. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited to get out there for the spring game and show what we\u2019ve been working on. Just excited to dominate and give it our all and showcase what we\u2019ve learned since day one.\u201d\n\nTrojan football should look a bit different since the last time USC stepped foot on the United Airlines Field against crosstown rival UCLA last November. The most notable changes include the addition of defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn and a new defensive scheme. \u201cWe have a lot of disguises, a lot of blitzes, and I feel like that versatility to switch it up and keep the offense on their toes is going to be very effective,\u201d redshirt junior cornerback Prophet Brown said on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re not letting them dictate what we\u2019re running. We\u2019re coming after the offense and that aspect makes it easier on the [defensive backs], the defensive line gets to get after it \u2014 it\u2019s just great overall.\u201d\n\nSenior linebacker Eric Gentry echoed the importance of playing fast and anticipating the offense during the pre-snap moments, a skill he said is senior linebacker Easton Mascarenas-Arnold\u2019s greatest strength. Gentry also acknowledged the importance of him and Mascarenas-Arnold playing off of each other\u2019s movements.\n\nOver on the offense, sophomore wide receiver Zachariah Branch has also been working on his reaction time in the key moments of a play\u2019s formation. He says he\u2019s improved his football IQ this offseason, which helps him understand defenses better before the snap. With that growth, he\u2019s learning to change his route based on the coverage he\u2019s facing. \u201cSometimes they do a certain disguise, but you kind of pick up off it after a certain amount of time watching film. Last year I was kind of just focused on the scheme,\u201d Branch said. \u201cI find the game\u2019s just slowing down a bit for me being able to read defenses a little faster.\u201d\n\nAs the Trojans head into the spring game, one thing for fans to keep an eye on is the offensive front. The defense has had an impressive physical transformation since last season, but a crucial aspect in adjusting to the Big Ten will be how USC\u2019s offense can hold up at the line of scrimmage. \u201cThe offense is going to have to get more physical and be able to control the trenches, which means the offensive line is going to have to be able to run the ball and protect, as well as the defensive line and defensive side,\u201d former USC defensive end and former NFL linebacker Willie McGinest said last week.\n\nThe Trojans are used to playing a quick-strike offense and getting the ball down the field, and with former star quarterback Caleb Williams, that was never a problem. USC operated from an outside-in format, with strong and skillful players on the outside tasked with handing the ball in an efficient manner. \u201c[USC] is going to be going up against bigger, stronger, more physical defenders,\u201d McGinest said. \u201cMost of the Big Ten is built from the inside out, meaning big defensive linemen and big offensive linemen are very physical.\u201d\n\nChanging conferences is no simple task, but the more the Trojans continue to work in the offseason to become stronger and more familiar with schemes, the better they\u2019ll be able to combat Big Ten teams. Saturday\u2019s game will be an interesting insight into whether USC\u2019s offense can handle its own defensive line, but another area of anticipation is at quarterback.\n\nRedshirt junior quarterback Miller Moss has three years of collegiate play under his belt and finished last season with a USC bowl-game record performance against the Louisville Cardinals. Moss threw an impressive six touchdown passes in the Holiday Bowl, sealing a 42-28 victory for the Trojans and likely made himself the team\u2019s starting quarterback going into the 2024 season. While Moss has the experience to battle it out on the field in true Trojan fashion, he\u2019ll be sharing the limelight on Saturday with UNLV transfer redshirt sophomore quarterback Jayden Maiava and redshirt junior quarterback Jake Jensen.\n\nRiley said after Tuesday\u2019s practice the team hasn\u2019t worked out who will be claiming starting quarterback this fall but ensured the players will get their share of experience. \u201cWe\u2019ll rep all three of those guys,\u201d Riley said on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s probably fairly similar to how we\u2019ve repped them in spring, which has been Miller and Jake ... they\u2019re certainly getting competitive reps every day.\u201d\n\nThere are still a lot of unknowns to settle for the Trojans, but if nothing else, the spring football game is sure to get fans excited for a new season of players, coaches and competition. Saturday\u2019s spring football game will take place at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at 12 p.m.\n```"}

Eight teams from each respective conference are set to duke it out for the hardest trophy to win in sports, the Stanley Cup. While some squads have known for weeks that they\u2019d make it to the postseason, others just narrowly eked out wins down the stretch to secure their spots.\n\nEastern Conference\n\nFlorida Panthers (Atlantic 1) vs. Tampa Bay Lightning (Wild Card 1)\n\nAnother playoff battle for Sunshine State supremacy: the Florida Panthers (52-24-6) narrowly snagged the Atlantic Division crown by one point, setting them up for home-ice advantage against their upstate rival Tampa Bay Lightning (45-29-8). Florida and Tampa Bay previously squared off in the 2021 and 2022 playoffs, with the Bolts winning both series. This matchup could truly go either way. The Panthers took the season series two games to one, including one win that ended with a dominant 9-2 score, but the Lightning are always a championship-level team come the postseason. Having the league\u2019s points leader in winger Nikita Kucherov \u2014 who tallied a whopping 144 during the regular season \u2014 will put Florida on its toes. However, the Panthers are simply a scoring machine with an NHL-best plus-68 goal differential. Center Sam Reinhart\u2019s 57 goals led that effort. The starting goaltender matchup between Tampa Bay\u2019s Andrei Vasilevskiy and Florida\u2019s Sergei Bobrovsky will be a classic, though Bobrovsky had a clear head-to-head advantage in the regular season. Florida will probably win the series, but it won\u2019t come easy; it\u2019ll likely take at least six games to finish.\n\nBoston Bruins (Atlantic 2) vs. Toronto Maple Leafs (Atlantic 3)\n\nThe Boston Bruins (47-20-15) have a chip on their shoulders after last year\u2019s first-round blunder against the Panthers. This season, they were also contenders for a second consecutive Presidents\u2019 Trophy with 109 points, good enough for second in the Atlantic. The Bruins should be licking their chops at the idea of facing the Maple Leafs (46-26-10) in round one. Boston went 4-0 against Toronto this season and has won its last six playoff series against the Leafs. The Bruins\u2019 goaltending tandem of Linus Ullmark and Jeremy Swayman against Toronto\u2019s high-powered offense consisting of forwards Auston Matthews, William Nylander and Mitch Marner will be a battle for the ages. But again, Boston\u2019s defense has shown this year that it can easily handle what the Leafs have to offer. We might be in luck for some down-to-the-wire matchups in this series, as the first two head-to-head games this season went past regulation. The Bruins dominated the next two, though taking both in 4-1 finishes. Boston will win this series. It won\u2019t be a sweep by any means, but a five- or six-game run feels fair.\n\nNew York Rangers (Metropolitan 1) vs. Washington Capitals (Wild Card 2)\n\nThe curse of the Presidents\u2019 Trophy is real, but the New York Rangers (55-23-4) are hoping to make a push for their first Stanley Cup in 30 years. This Rangers squad is arguably the most complete in the franchise\u2019s 98-year history. Winger Artemi Panarin had the best season of his career with 120 points and Adam Fox is playing like one of the best scoring defensemen in the league. The fact that the Washington Capitals (40-31-11) are even in the playoffs is a miracle. Alex Ovechkin\u2019s team just barely edged out other Eastern hopefuls, winning its last three games to snag the second wild-card spot. The Caps\u2019 minus-37 goal differential is by far the worst among playoff teams. The intriguing and surprising part of this matchup is the fact that the teams split the season series. Washington also took the final two games, including a 4-0 shutout. Rangers fans shouldn\u2019t worry, but they also shouldn\u2019t be shocked if the Capitals steal a game or two in round one. New York will take this series, probably in five games.\n\nCarolina Hurricanes (Metropolitan 2) vs. New York Islanders (Metropolitan 3)\n\nThe Carolina Hurricanes (52-23-7) finished with the East\u2019s second-best record and made a splash at the trade deadline by acquiring winger Jake Guentzel, who has 25 points in 17 games since the blockbuster trade. Carolina doesn\u2019t have a superstar roster but has the tools to be one of the league\u2019s best on both sides of the ice. Netminder Frederik Andersen missed significant time this year but has been a gem when he\u2019s played, posting a 1.84 goals-against average. Pyotr Kochetkov has been the main goalie all year, and he\u2019s been consistent, making for a really solid tandem. The Hurricanes will try to force pucks past Islanders netminder Semyon Varlamov, who has won his last five games and aims to take the starting job from Ilya Sorokin. New York (39-27-16) had an improbable run to the playoffs in the wake of a coaching change. Both teams each took two games from each other during the regular season, with three of them decided by one goal. The Isles have generally struggled to secure close games, though, co-leading the league with 16 overtime losses. Still, the Islanders have proven it can win when it matters, finishing 8-1-1 down the stretch to secure the third spot in the Metropolitan. This series\u2019 direction could really come down to who gets hot at the right time. Carolina is a fantastic team and will presumably win the series. But the Islanders could make things interesting, possibly forcing it to go to six or seven games.\n\nWestern Conference\n\nDallas Stars (Central 1) vs. Vegas Golden Knights (Wild Card 2)\n\nThis matchup could be a great one. The Vegas Golden Knights (45-29-8) took all three head-to-head games against Dallas (52-21-9) this year, but the Stars \u2014 the West\u2019s best team \u2014 have been absolutely on fire for the past two months. The Golden Knights have undergone a bit of Stanley Cup hangover since hoisting the trophy last June, but they\u2019re never a team to count out in the postseason. Even for how young of a franchise Vegas is, it has played Dallas twice in the playoffs, losing in 2020 (the Stars\u2019 Cup appearance run) and defeating it last season en route to the title. Jake Oettinger and Scott Wedgewood have been lights out in net for Dallas and the Stars have been the deepest, most complete team in the conference. The Knights will hope for consistency in goal and big impacts from their notable deadline acquisitions: forwards Tomas Hertl and Anthony Mantha, plus blueliner Noah Hanifin. The Stars should win this series, but a wild upset shouldn\u2019t phase anybody. It could very well go to seven games, and the Golden Knights are about as qualified as anyone to pull off something crazy.\n\nWinnipeg Jets (Central 2) vs. Colorado Avalanche (Central 3)\n\nThe Central Division race was the most exciting in the NHL with how close to each other its top three teams finished. The Stars ultimately won it, but the Winnipeg Jets (52-24-6) and Colorado Avalanche (50-25-7) both very well could\u2019ve. These teams most recently squared off on April 13, when Winnipeg demolished Colorado in a 7-0 finish. The final score was alarming, but it shouldn\u2019t overshadow the upcoming clash between elite goaltender Connor Hellbuyck and the league\u2019s No. 2 point scorer and Hart Trophy contender Nathan MacKinnon. The Avalanche\u2019s main liability is goaltending, which hasn\u2019t been nearly as stout as Winnipeg\u2019s. But Colorado has plenty more playoff experience than the Jets and knows what it takes to hoist the Cup. The Avs own more star power, as Winnipeg\u2019s leader in points, Mark Scheifele, only has 72. Don\u2019t let the lower total fool you \u2014 the Jets are very deep. Despite the lower seeding, Colorado will take the series in seven games. You just can\u2019t count out the championship pedigree of this team on top of its pure scoring ability. Winnipeg is also very inconsistent; while it is currently riding a seven-game win streak, that success follows a six-game skid.\n\nVancouver Canucks (Pacific 1) vs. Nashville Predators (Wild Card 1)\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks (50-22-9) have been great all year but have dipped a bit recently, while the Nashville Predators\u2019 (47-30-5) story is basically the complete opposite. The X factor for Vancouver is that star backstop Thatcher Demko has returned from injury, giving the Canucks insurance between the pipes in the wake of a rough end to the season. Add in top blueliner Quinn Hughes and some strong center depth, and Vancouver is a scary team for any opponent. The Preds were the hottest team from mid-February until the end of March, which gave them the momentum to secure a playoff spot. But since then, Nashville hasn\u2019t been nearly as successful and doesn\u2019t have the depth that Vancouver has. However, the Predators have seen immense success from forward Filip Forsberg, blueliner Roman Josi and goaltender Juuse Saros. An upset isn\u2019t out of the question, but Vancouver has been the more consistent squad this year. Expect a five- or six-game series that sees the Canucks stay alive.\n\nEdmonton Oilers (Pacific 2) vs. Los Angeles Kings (Pacific 3)\n\nAn Edmonton Oilers (49-27-6) matchup against the LA Kings (44-27-11) in the first round for a third straight year? Count me in. Los Angeles will aim to defy history and finally beat its older brother in the Pacific. The Kings have been the better team lately, but still needed to give it all they could to avoid playing the Stars instead, which would\u2019ve been a nightmare. Los Angeles\u2019 big weakness is inconsistency on the road \u2014 that could be a problem when it goes up north. Center Connor McDavid recently broke the 100-assist mark, and the Oilers seem desperate to make a real Stanley Cup push. Edmonton went 3-1 against the Kings during the regular season, scoring at least three goals in every win. If LA wants to avoid a hat trick of series losses against its Canadian foe, it\u2019ll need goalies Cam Talbot and David Rittich to stay resilient, and bottom-six players to step up immensely. Winger Adrian Kempe has been electric since returning from injury, so he\u2019ll look to be a catalyst too. A five-game finish in favor of the Oilers feels like an accurate prediction.\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

(Photo by Shruthi Narayanan)\n\nBy Shruthi Narayanan April 19, 2024 at 1:27 pm PDT\n\nThe third annual Student Sustainability Town Hall on Thursday allowed additional time for a student Q&A with university officials and faculty. Like the two previous iterations of the event, the meeting was hosted in collaboration with student groups, the Student Sustainability Committee and the Environmental Student Assembly (ESA). After a brief introduction featuring a video from President Carol Folt on Assignment: Earth\u2019s 27 goals, panelist introductions and a group discussion, the floor was opened for students and other audience members to ask questions.\n\nThe allotted time for questions was significantly increased from previous years, according to Cheska Pangilinan, the social and events coordinator of the Student Sustainability Committee and one of two moderators. \u201cThe main reason why we host this town hall every year is because students want to know what\u2019s going on in terms of USC sustainability,\u201d Pangilinan, a senior environmental studies major, said. \u201cWe were able to achieve that because the discussion was driven by the audience. In previous years, we had a lot of questions from moderators [...] also, we had more panelists last year.\u201d\n\nShivi Anand, a global geo design major, was one of the people who asked questions during the session, asking about the 2028 deadline of USC\u2019s Assignment: Earth initiative. \u201cJust sitting here in the sustainability hub and feeling like there\u2019s such a big community around it and [knowing that] people in power generally care,\u201d Anand said, \u201cThere\u2019s something very inspiring about that.\u201d\n\nPanelist Effie Turnbull Sanders echoed the sentiment, saying she felt inspired from what the audience members were saying. \u201cMy favorite part of the panel was just the opportunity to hear what the students\u2019 concerns are and how they\u2019re thinking about their role in helping USC meet its sustainability goals,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat was exciting to see students that were taking their free time to come and participate in the dialogue.\u201d\n\nStudent engagement with panelists was one of the main goals of the event, according to Jon-Marc Burgess, the ESA advocacy liaison and the other moderator for the event. \u201cIt\u2019s a town hall for a reason. We want the students to be engaged with the panelists,\u201d Burgess said, emphasizing the importance of community participation. \u201cWe want them to ask pertinent questions that they have related to sustainability, and to just give [...] space to the panelists to be transparent, which is one of the things that we advocate for in ESA.\u201d\n\nOther initiatives from the Sustainability Hub and Assignment: Earth brought up during the panel included the \u201cSuper Six for Sustainability,\u201d a list of six actions introduced in spring 2023 that USC students can take to reduce their impact on the environment. \u201cLast year, we were like, now we have to get very specific about telling people exactly what they [...] can choose to do to change their behaviors to be more sustainable,\u201d panelist and Associate Director of the Office of Sustainability Ellen Dux said in an interview conducted after the town hall. \u201cThis is not an all inclusive list, but we were trying to make it snappy so people could remember \u2018Super Six for Sustainability.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe other panelists were Chief Sustainability Officer Mick Dalrymple and Jill Sohm, the environmental studies program director and associate professor of environmental studies. Sohm discussed what she felt was the real motive behind an initiative to increase the amount of sustainability courses. \u201cThe overall goal, which is stated in our aspirations for Assignment: Earth, is that every student at USC is getting sustainability education from the center in their curriculum,\u201d Sohm said during the panel. \u201cAnd the more we can encourage faculty to incorporate sustainability in their classes, the more we can increase the chance that a student is going to experience that type of education while they\u2019re here at USC.\u201d\n```"}

This caused streaming services to be swarmed with Swift\u2019s audience. Tortured Poets has already broken the record for the most streamed album in a single day on Spotify and Amazon Music according to entertainment outlet Pop Base.\n\nIt leaves the question: do people think this album is \u201cthe one\u201d or are people \u201cshaking it off\u201d as just okay\u2019? \u201cIt made me cry, truly life changing, [and] a lot better than I expected,\u201d said Hailey Savage, a sophomore majoring in business, when asked her thoughts on the album. Savage said her favorite songs were \u201cFortnight\u201d and \u201cThe Black Dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the album showcases a combination of changes she is making to her sound. Lyrical[ly] wise, it was a little more symbolic than her first few albums, which were much more like \u2018this happened and then this happened,\u2019\u201d said Malia Tarazon, a junior majoring in biology who says she is a true swiftie. \u201cProduction wise, I think it is a combination of the techno pop from \u2018Midnights\u2019 and the acoustic and cottage-core feeling that \u2018Folklore\u2019 and \u2018Evermore\u2019 have,\u201d she added.\n\nDiscussing whether the album lives up to the anticipation, Tarazon said \u201cI think during the initial listen I didn\u2019t really know what to expect. Some songs I know will be growers, meaning I will probably like them the more I listen to them. But there are also songs that I loved immediately. I do think it lives up to the Swift hype!\u201d\n\nSwifties across the campus had different favorites from the album. Ciara Gallagher, a sophomore majoring in economics listed her favorite songs are \u201cSo Long London,\u201d because she felt it was different sonically than anything she\u2019s done before, and \u201cPeter,\u201d because it\u2019s a call back to a song on her favorite album \u2013 \u201cFolklore.\u201d Echoing Tarazon, Gallagher added, \u201clike most Taylor albums, I think it will grow on me with time and I was so impressed that she wrote a double album in the midst of her Era\u2019s Tour.\u201d\n\nOlivia Bryant, a freshman majoring in business, was also very passionate about the album release. \u201cI loved the new album! My favorite song so far is either \u2018loml,\u2019 \u2018Who\u2019s Afraid of Little Old Me\u2019 or \u2018So Long, London.\u2019\u201d Bryant believes that this album,\u201ddefinitely lived up to past album releases because it turned into a double album drop.\u201d\n\nHowever, not all fans have such positive reactions to Swift\u2019s new album. Some students shared mixed reactions to the artist\u2019s new drop. \u201cI think Taylor Swift\u2019s new album was okay, not as good as others in the past, but still, can\u2019t complain that much,\u201d Jackson Reese, a junior majoring in business administration said.\n\nInfluencers on X, previously known as Twitter, also shared their thoughts on the release. Dave Portnoy, owner of pop-culture blog Barstool, commented on the song \u201cthanK you alMee,\u201d \u201c#ThanKyouaIMee is Taylor Swift\u2019s magnum opus. A masterpiece! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Sing it Northwest! SING IT!!!! [sic]\u201d Ex-football player Robert Griffin III poked in a little fun at the Travis Kelce and Swift romance that has swept the nation, posting on X,\u201dThere is no doubt that this Madden Cover would lead to the greatest selling Madden Game of all time.\u201d\n\nSwifties are counting down the days to another new album release.

{"key": "/2024/04/19/how-will-usc-be-included-in-the-new-ea-sports-college-football-game/", "response": "```\nHow will USC be included in the new EA Sports College Football game?\n\nBy Will Simonds April 19, 2024 at 1:07 pm PDT\n\nPerhaps this summer\u2019s most anticipated release isn\u2019t an album or a movie like most might expect. Instead, it\u2019s the return of an iconic franchise after a decade\u2019s absence, one that holds a certain nostalgia for a generation that grew up on the brand. That\u2019s right \u2014 everyone\u2019s favorite college football video game is back in just a matter of months, and with one key change. Thanks to new NIL regulations, real-life players will be a part of this iteration, in the same way that Madden uses actual NFL stars.\n\nAccording to ESPN, \u201ceach player who opts in to have their name, image and likeness used will receive $600 and a copy of the game, valued at around $70.\u201d Not only is this a long-awaited revival for the general public, but USC players \u2014 many of whom have fond memories of playing the game as kids \u2014 are just as excited to be featured.\n\n\u201cThe excitement is just the fact that college football is back in a video game,\u201d said Jose Eskenazi, an associate athletic director for USC that oversees strategic partnerships, brand and licensing. \u201cThe players can now see themselves, play as themselves and receive some compensation.\u201d\n\nEskenazi has been with USC Athletics for over 20 years and oversaw the school\u2019s partnership with EA Sports during the previous era of college football titles. The process of working with EA has been fairly similar; the main difference is providing information about specific players, including their names, numbers and headshots.\n\nEskenazi says that a majority of the USC football roster has already opted into the game ahead of an end-of-April deadline, adding that he hasn\u2019t heard of any players specifically opting out. Three of the top Trojan stars for the upcoming season \u2014 redshirt junior quarterback Miller Moss, sophomore wide receiver Zachariah Branch and junior defensive lineman Bear Alexander \u2014 have already announced on social media that they will be featured in the game.\n\nIn typical fashion for a college student, redshirt senior linebacker Mason Cobb said that he forgot his password in order to opt in, but that he\u2019s definitely planning to do so. \u201cBeing able to see my name on there will be amazing,\u201d Cobb said, especially since NCAA Football 14 is still one of his favorite games.\n\nSophomore running back Quentin Joyner and senior linebacker Easton Mascarenas-Arnold have both opted in as well, and they echoed the collective excitement for the game throughout the locker room. In fact, Joyner already has specific plans for the coming months. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna make a national championship run [in the game] and on the field.\u201d\n\nSimilar to previous editions of NCAA Football, EA asked Eskenazi for USC\u2019s creative assets to make the gaming experience as realistic as possible. So, he submitted Nike\u2019s line art for the Trojans\u2019 home and away uniforms, which will allow EA to recreate the uniforms down to the smallest of details. The two-finger \u201cvictory\u201d emoji will be on the front of players\u2019 helmets and \u201cFIGHT ON!\u201d in block letters on the back \u2014 just like in real life.\n\nOther submitted assets include all of USC\u2019s logos and even its rivalry trophies. Trojan fans will be able to win a replica Victory Bell and Jeweled Shillelagh within the game.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there. \u201cEA has made an effort to make it so that if you\u2019re playing it, it\u2019s as if you\u2019re in the Coliseum,\u201d Eskenazi said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to make it as authentic as possible, which I believe they\u2019ve done a pretty good job of, from everything that we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nThe L.A. Coliseum has undergone renovations since the last installment of EA\u2019s franchise, and the new game will reflect recent changes, such as the remodeled Scholarship Club Tower. Eskenazi mentioned that \u2014 aside from corporate advertising \u2014 the stadium will be wrapped just like on any gameday.\n\nThe jerseys of USC\u2019s past Heisman Trophy winners will be laid out on the peristyle end of the field, too. Several USC traditions during home games will be featured, such as the lighting of the torch at the start of the fourth quarter. Of course, the incessant sound of The Spirit of Troy will be blasting through the speakers within the game as well; you\u2019ll hear \u201cFight On\u201d after first downs and touchdowns, \u201cTribute to Troy\u201d on defense and so forth.\n\nEskenazi also revealed that the school has submitted past rosters and assets to EA, which suggests a possible \u201clegends\u201d gamemode. So, maybe fans will be able to play as Caleb Williams in a Trojan uniform after all.\n\nUnfortunately, not every little thing will be featured in EA Sports College Football right away. For example, Traveler won\u2019t make an appearance until future updates or versions of the franchise, and Lincoln Riley isn\u2019t going to be USC\u2019s coach in the game yet either. However, Eskenazi is looking forward to seeing fan feedback for the game and continuing to work with EA Sports to improve the franchise\u2019s long-awaited revival.\n\nFans will surely want to keep an eye on how USC continues to appear in the game going forward \u2014 not just because of the program\u2019s elite prestige in the college football world. After all, USC players often graced the covers of the initial run of the franchise, dating all the way back to when Tommy Trojan was on the front of College Football USA 96. Former USC legends Carson Palmer and Reggie Bush were cover athletes for the 2004 and 2007 versions of the game, while Mark Sanchez made an appearance for the PlayStation Portable edition of NCAA Football 10. Who knows, perhaps Zachariah Branch might join that elite company of Trojans sometime soon.\n```"}

The works showcased in the Festival of Books offer us these invaluable gifts. I\u2019m profoundly grateful to writers who show us a full picture of humanity in works of fiction, poetry and nonfiction,\u201d\n\nThe festival attracts approximately 155,000 people each year from Southern California and other parts of the country. The annual festival dates back to 1996 and was originally held at UCLA, but made the switch to USC in 2010. General admission to the festival grounds and indoor panel tickets are free, but a reservation is needed for specific events and certain additional events during the festival weekend may require a paid ticket.\n\nThere are nine different festival areas and highlights within the USC Campus that incorporate the different booths. https://events.latimes.com/festivalofbooks/files/2024/03/FOB-MAP.pdf\n\n\u201cAs a non-book reader, I am excited to see a bunch of culture,\u201d said Alexander Jung, a junior studying accounting. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool how they do all this stuff and I wish I could come out more. I think it\u2019s cool how they have all the vendors and give out free swag.\u201d\n\nThe festival was created to bring together authors and their audiences in a collaborative space, though it\u2019s not limited to just books. There will also be live bands, poetry readings, film screenings and artists performing live acts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important because it brings together a large community of people from the outside areas, not just for students at USC but for families who are in the surrounding area in South Central,\u201d said Genevieve Nguyen, a sophomore studying business administration.\n\nThis event is also focused on enhancing education by giving out free books and other supplies. Maya Gardner, a senior studying theater, is looking forward to meeting some of her favorite authors and perusing through the used books.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s nice is that the festival presents authors in many different ways that are accessible for people who don\u2019t read as much or have trouble with reading, as well as people who read every day,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to get people exposed to more books.\u201d\n\nGardner was inspired to volunteer because one of her friends had the opportunity to work with her favorite author as well as other prestigious authors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also in a community that has a lower socioeconomic status so having easier access to books is more important because they might not have that and we also don\u2019t have a lot of libraries nearby,\u201d Gardner said.\n\nAt this L.A. Festival, they will also have movies, graphic novel stores and merchandise for different shows or posters. Nguyen said she was excited to see the diverse spread of book vendors like the Ripped Bodice and Vromans Bookstore.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll set up and bring their whole book stand and bring out some authors to sign and the speaker events are also pretty cool,\u201d she said.\n\nPublic parking will be available for $20 in the following USC Parking Structures: Jefferson Blvd, Downey Way, USC Shrine, Figueroa St and Grand Ave. The most convenient driving directions to USC\u2019s campus would be by taking the freeway exit from I-110 onto Exposition Boulevard. At the end of the exit you will see the campus on the right-hand side one block down the street. Another convenient access is to exit from Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) on Vermont south to Jefferson Boulevard. The Metro is another form of public transportation to get to USC\u2019s campus.

(AP/Alex Gallardo)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner April 19, 2024 at 12:57 pm PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 A thrilling 5-4 overtime win against the Blackhawks on Thursday evening gave the Kings a one-point edge over the Golden Knights, allowing LA to clinch the third spot in the Pacific Division and set up a first-round date with the Edmonton Oilers for the third consecutive season.\n\nThe Kings clinched the playoffs back on April 11, but were unaware of who they\u2019d face in the first round with a week left in the regular season. The candidates were the Oilers, Dallas Stars and Vancouver Canucks. While Los Angeles matched up the best against the Canucks, finishing with a 3-0-1 head-to-head record against them in the regular season, the Kings were playing to win down the stretch and forwent the Wild Card chaos altogether.\n\nIf the Kings had fallen behind Vegas, they would\u2019ve faced Dallas, who destroyed LA on three occasions during the regular season. But instead, the Kings have landed on the middle scenario and will meet a familiar foe in the opening round \u2014 the Oilers \u2014 who have ended Los Angeles\u2019 season the past two years in close series. Edmonton took down LA in seven games in 2022 and six in 2023, making this year\u2019s matchup a revenge tour for LA.\n\nAll-time, the Oilers have eliminated the Kings in seven of nine attempts during the postseason. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a short history with [the Oilers], but we were just excited to make the playoffs and go play whoever we were going to play,\u201d said interim head coach Jim Hiller. \u201cWe just want to get going, and we\u2019re excited.\u201d\n\nDuring the regular season, the Oilers defeated the Kings in three out of four games, with the first game ending in a shootout win for Edmonton. Los Angeles took the second game in a 4-0 shutout, but the Oilers posted four goals in each of the final two games to take sound victories.\n\nWhile the matchup has been a constant of the Stanley Cup Playoffs in recent years, both teams enter this year\u2019s series having made notable coaching changes. Hiller is now at the helm as opposed to Todd McLellan for LA and for Edmonton, Kris Knoblauch replaced Jay Woodcroft early this season after Edmonton started the campaign poorly.\n\nCam Talbot and David Rittich also make for a new Kings goalie tandem and multiple players, like wingers Adrian Kempe and Trevor Moore, have seen their stats improve significantly.\n\nA massive X factor for Los Angeles will be winger Quinton Byfield. Byfield leads all LA skaters with six points against the Oilers this season, scoring on 25% of his shots in those games. But the catch is that Byfield has hit a bit of a slump since his electric start to the year. The 21-year-old has only tallied two points in April and hasn\u2019t registered regular points night-in, night-out since March.\n\n\u201cOver the years, just playing [Edmonton] consistently in the playoffs sparked a rivalry,\u201d said Byfield. \u201cWe definitely want to beat them now.\u201d\n\nWinger Viktor Arvidsson will be another King to look out for, as he\u2019s been a very consistent scorer since returning from injury. The 31-year-old tallied two goals and an assist in Los Angeles\u2019 regular-season finale against Chicago and has averaged over a point per game in April.\n\nCenter Connor McDavid has been practically every team\u2019s kryptonite this year. McDavid tallied seven points against LA in the four matchups and he\u2019ll hope to finally make a Stanley Cup run after many seasons of falling short. The three-time Hart winner recently reached the 100-assist mark and has shown zero signs of late-season fatigue.\n\nLos Angeles also had trouble facing netminder Stuart Skinner, who started in all four matchups and tallied a stout 1.99 goals-against average and .936 save percentage against the Kings. Rittich and Talbot split time between the posts this year against Edmonton, with Rittich recording the lone victory, saving 26 shots en route to the shutout.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the Oilers are favored to win. But the Stanley Cup Playoffs always feature upsets and insanity, so prematurely counting out the Kings wouldn\u2019t be a fair assessment.

(AP/David Becker)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nApril 19, 2024 at 12:50 pm PDT\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 A 4-1 win over the Vegas Golden Knights that featured a hat trick from winger Frank Vatrano and winger Cutter Gauthier\u2019s NHL debut closed out the Ducks\u2019 sixth straight non-playoff season on a high note. With yet another long summer on the horizon, Anaheim finished its 30th anniversary season with 59 points on a 27-50-5 record, awarding it the third-best odds at landing the No. 1 overall pick in the upcoming draft. The Ducks also own the Edmonton Oilers\u2019 first-round pick this season after acquiring it near the trade deadline, which will likely slot in later in the round.\n\nThe constant woes of the past few seasons may paint the organization as a perennial loser, but Anaheim\u2019s future looks as bright as ever, replete with prospects such as Gauthier, blueliners Olen Zellweger and Pavel Mintyukov and 2023 No. 2 overall pick, forward Leo Carlsson, who all made their NHL debuts this season. On top of simply entering the league, all four showed legitimate promise in the action they received, which ranged from one game (Gauthier) to the majority of the season (Carlsson).\n\nVatrano was indisputably the Ducks\u2019 best player, receiving his first All-Star nod and posting a career-best campaign in his second year in Anaheim. The 30-year-old scored seven game-winners and carried a team that often struggled to ignite the spark offensively. With one year left on his contract, general manager Pat Verbeek might ship him off at some point next season to acquire more valuable draft assets for future seasons.\n\nAnaheim also saw yet another solid campaign from young forward Mason McTavish, who nearly matched his point total in 2023-24 despite playing in 16 fewer games due to injuries; the 21-year-old tallied 19 goals and 23 helpers this season. Additionally, while not a big impact player at this stage in his career, the Ducks will say goodbye to winger Jacob Silfverberg, who spent over a decade with the franchise and recently announced his retirement.\n\nLooking ahead to next season, Anaheim will still have one of the top prospect pipelines and should expect players like defenseman Rodwin Dionicio, who is currently at the junior level, or Nathan Gaucher in the American Hockey League to contend for roster spots. With a solid mix of veterans and youngsters in the lineup, the Ducks will benefit from having more experienced players take the lead, such as winger Alex Killorn and blueliner Cam Fowler, who can help bring the newer guys up to speed. This could be applied especially to Anaheim\u2019s goalie situation. John Gibson and Lukas Dostal both struggled in net this season, recording goals-against averages above three, but given Gibson\u2019s deep NHL resume, he will continue to be a factor in guiding Dostal along through the younger goaltender\u2019s progress, as Dostal\u2019s still only 23 years old.\n\nLooking towards the draft, the Ducks will have a slim chance at taking the Hobey Baker-winning forward Macklin Celebrini, who\u2019s projected to be the No. 1 overall pick. But even if Anaheim doesn\u2019t win the lottery, as it is very unlikely at 11.5%, other prospects like Michigan State defenseman Artyom Levshunov or Russian forward Ivan Demidov, who are also highly touted, could be available in the top three. Verbeek\u2019s team is in the process of a classic rebuild and could be exciting in the years to come.\n\nThe season was disappointing, with some highs and lows, from winning six straight at the beginning to multiple lengthy losing streaks dispersed throughout the year. The Ducks will cross their fingers through early May, when the ping-pong balls decide the draft lottery winner. Anaheim\u2019s prospect pool will only continue to progress by adding two first-rounders in June.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/19/padres-the-mlbs-most-relevant-team/", "response": "```\nSAN DIEGO \u2013\u2013 The San Diego Padres continue to fight early in the 2024 season, winning a crucial series against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium over the weekend by two games to one. However, the Padres failed to overcome the Dodgers on Saturday night. After a two-hour and 15-minute rain delay, San Diego broke up Gavin Stone\u2019s perfect-game bid in the sixth inning and staged a game-tying rally for a second straight night, but the Padres\u2019 bullpen collapsed to send them back to the hotel with a 5-3 loss to the Dodgers on a cold, rainy evening in the Chavez Ravine.\n\nLeft fielder Jurickson Profar was at the center of a bench-clearing incident in the fifth, the inning before the Padres started their rally against Stone. The 31-year-old veteran squared to bunt while Stone was still pitching a perfect game before pulling his bat back. On the next pitch, Stone threw a 92 mph fastball inside that nearly scraped Profar on his right elbow. Profar stared down and began beefing with catcher Will Smith at the plate. Home plate umpire Chris Guccione stepped in between Profar and Stone to keep them apart, and both teams came running out of their dugouts and bullpens as the benches cleared. Despite the hubbub, no punches were thrown and no players were ejected from the game.\n\nOne inning later the Padres finally broke through against Stone, as Tyler Wade broke up the perfect game with a leadoff walk, Kyle Higashioka broke up the no-hitter with a single to left field and Tatis ended the shutout with an RBI double to center that tied the score, 1-1. Unfortunately, Tom Cosgrove allowed three runs to score while only getting one out in the bottom of the sixth inning, giving the Dodgers a 4-1 lead. This did not silence the Friars, however, as they put two runners on base against Dodgers closer Evan Philips in the ninth inning to bring the tying run to the plate. Unluckily, Wade grounded out to end the game.\n\nAfter the game ended, Smith commented on the benches-clearing incident and said some harsh words towards Profar, saying that he is \u201ckind of irrelevant.\u201d In the series finale on Sunday, Profar let his bat prove he is, in fact, very relevant. Profar nailed a tiebreaking, three-run double in the seventh inning to help the Padres get a 6-2 victory and series win over the Dodgers on Sunday evening. The ball hit the wall and was inches away from being a grand slam, but it still capped off another Padres comeback.\n\nThe Padres also drew 14 walks on Sunday, massively helping them secure the win. Additionally, Manny Machado homered and starter Yu Darvish allowed a solid three runs over five innings, plus the San Diego bullpen finished the game with four shutout innings \u2014 a complete team effort.\n\nAfter winning two out of three against the Dodgers, the Padres traveled to Milwaukee to take on the Brewers Monday evening at American Family Field. The Padres\u2019 20-year-old rookie outfielder Jackson Merrill stole the show with three hits, including a two-run single in a high-scoring fifth inning for the Friars. The Padres trailed 3-1 before their outburst of runs in the fifth. Then, eleven Padres batters stepped to the plate. A succession of six singles, a walk, a passed ball, catcher\u2019s interference and a pitch-clock violation allowed the Padres to tally six runs in the fifth alone.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, Joe Musgrove struck out three and gave up seven hits, four walks and three runs in six innings. With the win over the Brewers, Musgrove sits at an even two wins and two losses with twenty strikeouts on the season. After a shaky first two innings from Musgrove, he found his groove and reminded everybody why he is the number two ace on the roster.\n\nDylan Cease made the start for the Padres in their second game against the Brewers on Tuesday. The right-hander pitched six strong innings, giving up only one run and two hits while striking out seven and walking five. Cease threw a season-high 110 pitches, which is his third consecutive start of throwing 100 or more pitches. Durability is exactly what Padre\u2019s pitching needs this season, so hopefully Cease can help with that for the rest of the season. Cease now leads the National League in opponent batting average (.130) and is both fifth in ERA (1.99) and tied-fifth in strikeouts (27).\n\nThe Padres helped Cease right out of the gate by scoring four runs in the first inning. Machado drove in the first run of the night when he hit a rocket off the knee of Brewers pitcher Wade Miley. In the very next at-bat, Ha-Seong Kim followed up with a three-run moonshot off the left-field foul pole for his third home run of the season. The Padres ended up securing a 6-3 win and back-to-back series wins.\n\nMoving to Wednesday afternoon\u2019s game, Michael King pitched a phenomenal performance on the mound. The 28-year-old right-hander took a no-hitter into the seventh inning before giving up a two-out single. The Padres starter ended up throwing 109 pitches to follow up Cease\u2019s 110 and went 7.2 innings on the day, striking out 10 batters and walking two. The Padres held King\u2019s shutout intact into the eighth before the Brewers finally broke through for a run and went on to win 1-0, avoiding a Padres sweep.\n\nThe Padres could not get their offense going, but they did have a great opportunity to get on the board in the eighth when Matthew Batten led off with a triple before being stranded.\n\nOff the diamond, the Friars signed infielder Donovan Solano to a minor league deal on Monday. Solano has played in 820 games for five teams over a 10-year career. Last season, Solano played 134 games for the Twins, hitting .282 with five home runs and 38 runs batted in over 450 plate appearances. The Padres also traded right-handed relief pitcher Pedro Avila to the Guardians for cash Wednesday morning. Avila (1-0, 9.00 ERA) has appeared in four games for San Diego this season, all out of the bullpen. He had been with the Padres organization since 2019 and made 22 appearances on the major league mound, including eight starts.\n\nMinutes later, Yu Darvish was placed on the 15-day IL for a neck tightness injury. Logan Gillaspie, who appeared in 11 games in relief last year for the Orioles, finished with eight strikeouts and a 6.00 ERA. Infielder Matthew Baten was recalled, and catcher Brett Sullivan was optioned to Triple-A. Batten appeared in 43 games for San Diego last season, slashing .258 with two homers and eleven RBIs in 120 at-bats. Sullivan has had only two at-bats this season, striking out in both appearances.\n\nAfter a day off on Thursday, they will face the Blue Jays in San Diego for a three-game series.\n```"}

She joined last year and quickly adapted, bringing her passion for anime and Japanese dramas into her performances. \u201cThe energy and enthusiasm of the undergraduates are particularly invigorating,\u201d Ma noted.

Summer Qin, a first-year architecture student, brings her expertise on the guzheng, a traditional Chinese instrument, to creSCendo. Having played since she was four, Qin views her involvement as a chance to introduce more people to the guzheng. She integrates her instrument into the band\u2019s repertoire, which ranges from traditional Chinese music to hip hop and rap. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to explore different musical cultures through my instrument,\u201d Qin said.\n\nCeline Wen on the stage with her band (Photo courtesy of James Qian)\n\ncreSCendo also provides the opportunity for students to learn more about their musical selves.

A friend\u2019s girlfriend, who was part of the management, invited us because we were already involved in writing and producing rap music,\u201d Gong said. As co-president, Gong has focused on enhancing the efficiency of the club\u2019s management and fostering a collaborative environment. Under his leadership, creSCendo has expanded its musical repertoire from standard pop covers to more intricate band performances, a reflection of the members\u2019 growing technical skills. One of his personal highlights was a 2022 performance at Tommy\u2019s Space, where he performed \u201c\u6d77\u9614\u5929\u7a7a\u201d (\u201cBoundless Oceans, Vast Skies\u201d), resonating deeply as he is a native Cantonese speaker. Gong noted the event\u2019s exceptional balance of sound and lighting, marking his first live guitar solo performance. \u201cMy main role during performances is to act as a coordinator and leader, ensuring everything runs smoothly and assisting with any technical issues that arise,\u201d Gong said. Looking forward, he aims to evolve creSCendo into a band-oriented club that embraces complex musical arrangements and original works. \u201cI\u2019d like our performances to reach more local students and introduce them to our music, which includes a mix of Western and Chinese songs,\u201d Gong said. \u201cUnderstanding the local music market better would help us in tailoring our outreach.\u201d\n\nLeo Yang, a sophomore studying Business Administration and International Relations, joined creSCendo in his first semester at USC. Quickly becoming involved in both the executive board and the performance team, Yang has taken an active role in the club\u2019s operations. During a recent performance, he participated as a bassist and backup vocalist for \u201cCan\u2019t Stand the Rain\u201d by The Rescues and as the lead guitarist for \u201cEdge of Midnight 17.\u201d He described the challenges in preparation for the show, \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty stressful with a lineup of 20 songs tonight, the most we\u2019ve ever had. Managing tech, sound, and production complexities requires great coordination,\u201d Yang said.\n\ncreScendo takes a group photo after the performances (Photo by Runyu Li)\n\nHowever, Yang also highlighted the uniqueness of creSCendo, \u201ccreSCendo is the only music club on campus centered around bands and Chinese performers. We provide a platform for non-major music students to express their talents and perform,\u201d Yang said. The club provides a vital performance platform for non-music majors, allowing them to showcase their talents. Yang is looking forward to expanding the club\u2019s offerings. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a lot of cool things for the future, focusing on giving our members more performance opportunities and exploring professional development in the music industry,\u201d Yang said.\n\nBoth presidents are committed to the growth of creSCendo, seeing it as a dynamic community where students can explore diverse musical genres and experience personal growth within a supportive environment. With a focus on professional growth and collaboration, creSCendo is poised for a promising future as a leading platform for aspiring musicians at USC.\n```"}

We know who to root for and who to root against. Basketball fans believe it\u2019s that way in real life, too. With a celebrated group of rookies having just been drafted to the WNBA, there\u2019s been considerable media buzz concerning the league\u2019s current players\u2019 opinions about Iowa\u2019s Caitlin Clark and other incoming stars from this past season.\n\nWhile commentating on the NCAA Final Four, Phoenix Mercury guard Diana Taurasi responded to a Tweet asking who she would pick first in building a WNBA team, Clark or UConn\u2019s Paige Bueckers. Without giving rationale, Taurasi chose Bueckers. And immediately following Monday\u2019s draft, ESPN sportscaster Scott Van Pelt asked Taurasi what the future had in store for the incoming class. Taurasi answered, \u201cReality is coming.\u201d\n\nBoth of Taurasi\u2019s remarks sparked an onslaught of hate from media outlets. The basketball-watching public started thrashing the three-time WNBA champion, characterizing her answers as jealous and petty. People started accusing her of hating Clark. Instantly, news broke of trouble brewing between Clark and Taurasi, and this alleged beef snowballed into fan excitement for a foreseeable rivalry for the upcoming WNBA season.\n\nEven before the WNBA 2024 draft, Phoenix Mercury hinted at this feud by specifically promoting their matchup against the Indiana Fever. Taurasi\u2019s face \u2014 along with \u201cThe GOAT\u201d caption \u2014 is front and center, considerably larger than the shadow of the 22 jersey, which was heavily implied to be Clark.\n\nBut is there even merit in labeling this Clark-Taurasi relationship a rivalry? Is it spiteful for Taurasi to choose another immensely talented player to be her projected first pick in a completely hypothetical situation, since Bueckers didn\u2019t even declare for the 2024 draft? While headlines advertise that Taurasi warns Clark \u201creality is coming,\u201d the phrase has been taken out of context.\n\nIn watching the full video of her interview with SVP, it\u2019s clear Taurasi said more than just those three words. Here\u2019s Taurasi\u2019s entire answer: \u201cReality is coming. You know, there\u2019s levels to this thing. That\u2019s just life. We all went through it. And you see it on the NBA side, and you\u2019re gonna see it on this side \u2014 where you look superhuman playing against 18 year-olds, but you\u2019re going to come with some grown women that have been playing professional basketball for a long time.\n\n\u201cNot saying that it\u2019s not going to translate because when you\u2019re great at what you do, you\u2019re just going to get better. But, there is going to be a transition period where you\u2019re going to have to give yourself some grace as a rookie. It might take a little bit longer for some people.\u201d Taurasi was talking to all draftees, not just Clark. She indicates that a difficult college-to-professional transition period is natural and that these incoming players are capable of translating their game, with some adversity. Can one detect malice there?\n\nThis kind of relationship and rivalry distortion didn\u2019t start with this WNBA news. The two season-long Angel Reese-Caitlin Clark animosity was purely a media push intended to guide viewers to that basic conclusion of heroes and villains. Mainstream media heavily criticized Reese for her ring celebration gesture during the 2023 NCAA championship. This judgment of her fierce competitive drive cemented her as the \u201cvillain\u201d of the college basketball storyline.\n\nIn a recent post, Reese clarified, as she had done many times before, that there was no hostility beyond the competitiveness that viewers saw on the court. Preceding the women\u2019s collegiate 2024 Elite Eight round, a Los Angeles Times writer released a now-edited commentary on the UCLA and LSU game as \u201cAmerica\u2019s sweethearts vs. its basketball villains.\u201d Overwhelming, obvious bias portrayed the Bruins positively, describing them as operating \u201cin saintly shadows while being as wholesome as a miniature stuffed Bruin mascot.\u201d\n\nThe writer asked the reader if they preferred a team that was looking to grow women\u2019s basketball or the team that polarized and divided the sport. Many denounced the article as racist and sexist, taking issue with the binary itself as a reductive simplification of female competition as \u201cgood versus evil.\u201d After initially reposting the article, UCLA head coach Cori Close deleted it and issued an apology saying she had only read the headline and not its problematic contents.\n\nEven after USC freshman JuJu Watkins posted a season-record of 51 points against Stanford, she had to respond politely to a baiting comment by a reporter about Clark, who was totally irrelevant to Watkin\u2019s accomplishment on that night. Why does the media need to pit women against each other in order to be interested in them? Is an underlining dramatized storyline necessary in women\u2019s competition? Finally, is it justifiable?\n\nThis media\u2019s narrative warping is a double-edged sword, in that it might have a positive impact. Fans, even women\u2019s basketball haters like Jason Whitlock, have admitted that they\u2019ll tune in to the Fever and Mercury game. This assumed rivalry has people interested and eyes engaged, before Clark has even stepped on a WNBA court. More people are inclined to watch because they want to see Clark topple Taurasi. Increased viewership means more profit for the WNBA.\n\nShould we overlook this contortion of reality because it might help the WNBA? It\u2019s very easy to believe a simple, popular story. Media plays a very powerful role in public opinion. It is impossible to isolate ourselves from its influence. We will always receive conflicting narratives, but it\u2019s up to the individual to choose which ones to believe.\n```"}

The event coincided with a recent statement signed by over 150 USC faculty members, condemning the university\u2019s decision and advocating for her speech to be reinstated.\n\nProtesters were composed of various RSO\u2019s, students, faculty, and other concerned locals from across Los Angeles.

Held in Cannes, France, this event is one of the world\u2019s premier film festivals. Each year it screens films of all genres, awarding the best film the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or, which has previously been awarded to Francis Ford Coppola, David Lynch and most recently Justine Triet for her 2023 film \u201cAnatomy of a Fall.\u201d\n\nTo apply to the program, students must write a 3,000 to 10,000-character review of any two films, either from BFI/Sight and Sound\u2019s top 100 list or a Palme d\u2019Or winner. Along with the reviews, a cover letter is required detailing the personal importance of attending this event and how students are planning on supporting themselves during the trip since acceptance into the program does not include airfare, lodging or other expenses.\n\nSenior Director of Festivals and Distribution Sandrine Cassidy seeks to ease the financial strain of the program through a donor fund for housing; however, this assistance is not guaranteed and varies year by year. \u201cIt\u2019s still a pilot program, and the fact that we were able to get a few funds to help [the students] is a miracle,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a personal investment from them...this collaboration with Cannes Classics is a unique opportunity for our students to have a full experience of covering this incredible festival.\u201d\n\nJunior journalism major Lyla Bhalla-Ladd projects to spend around $2,000 out of pocket for her time in France, about double what junior cinema and media studies major Kayla Cunningham paid last year when she attended. However, her year, housing was completely covered compared to Bhalla-Ladd\u2019s $400 housing payment. Yet, what is included is priceless for those in the film industry: accreditation to enter the Palais des Festivals and attend screenings, reserved seats at Cannes Classic, and meetings with guests and organizers. Better yet, coveted pink badges for greater access within the venue.\n\nStudents will use their experiences to write personal reviews and critiques that will be published on the Cannes Classic blog. The program is in its third year, and Heidi Atlas, a senior cinema and media studies major, said that it is looking to continue expanding. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to just continue to elevate our presence,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have some ideas cooking, [but] I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s all gonna turn up, because once you\u2019re there in France, it\u2019s just a complete whirlwind.\u201d\n\nAtlas says she is \u201cextremely grateful\u201d to be attending the festival for the second time and encourages students to apply for next year\u2019s program. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect party-hard, work-hard lifestyle where you\u2019re watching three movies a day from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and then you\u2019re out all night trying to network [and] also have fun in Europe,\u201d she said.\n\nTiger George, who is working toward a Master of Fine Arts in the cinematic arts, film and television production program, said this program will be a way of reconnecting with film. \u201cI\u2019d love to go to Cannes and I would love to watch films because I feel like I haven\u2019t had time to since I\u2019ve started my master\u2019s degree\u201d she said. \u201cMy Letterboxd has never been drier.\u201d\n\nFitz Cain is a senior journalism major with a minor in cinematic arts and is one of the few students in the program without a major within SCA.

While Living Desert takes care of these tortoises as eggs and hatchlings, there are some special considerations to make, said Thomas.\n\nThomas: Because these guys are going to go back out into the wild, we don\u2019t want them to get too used to having food or water or an abundance of resources are not going to have once they\u2019re released ... That way when they\u2019re released or they go up to Edwards. They\u2019re not already in that mindset of abundance where they think they have all these resources that they don\u2019t have. So, we want to start them a little bit early on that. At the same time, we still do provide them with the water and we do give them more also food, because we want them to be grown really quickly.\n\nMojave desert tortoises have to deal with predators such as coyotes and ravens, but also with human impact. Invasive plants brought to the desert, damage to the ecosystem and climate change all harm the tortoise. Thomas\u2019s final takeaway for the public?\n\nThomas: I think being really cognizant of the impact you\u2019re having. So, something like having trash or having water runoff is not something that you might initially associate with a decreasing tortoise population ... a healthier ecosystem just makes a healthier habitat for them.\n\nThe Living Desert Zoo and Gardens has resources for how to help the desert tortoise available online. They\u2019re optimistic that, with programs like this one, the future will be bright for the tortoises.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Marie Louise Leone.\n```"}

(Photo by Mohammed Zain Shafi Khan)\n\nOn the third day of campus unrest at USC, Provost Andrew Guzman appeared at the monthly Academic Senate meeting to address the representative faculty body. He defended President Carol Folt\u2019s decision to rescind the valedictorian\u2019s speech at commencement and stated it has nothing to do with Asna Tabasumm\u2019s political views, which have ignited campus and national controversy in the past week.\n\nGuzman, who announced Monday that the 2024 valedictorian would not be speaking at commencement, specifically addressed the faculty senate Wednesday. Guzman noted that the reaction to Tabassum\u2019s selection was \u201cunprecedented in volume and tenor\u201d and noted that USC\u2019s commencement, in which \u201cpeople are displaying their identities in visible ways,\u201d proves a security challenge every year.\n\nHe expressed that while it was not the committee\u2019s \u201cfirst choice,\u201d he has \u201ca high degree of comfort with the decision\u201d to rescind the valedictorian\u2019s traditional speech. The Marshall Executive Board Member, Christine El Haddad, nodded enthusiastically as Guzman spoke.\n\nThe Academic Senate, the \u201crepresentative body of the entire faculty at USC,\u201d meets monthly in the Faculty Hall of Doheny Library, where the ceiling beams read a Latin phrase, \u201cPalmam qui meruit ferat,\u201d and its translation, \u201cwhoever earns the palm shall bear it.\u201d But for the valedictorian, she must bear it alone.\n\nTwo key decisions were made by USC this month. On April 5, the selection of Tabassum as valedictorian was made by Guzman following her recommendation by a faculty committee. However, the decision to rescind Tabassum\u2019s speech was made by Folt this week. The LA Times and other outlets have reported that Folt made the second decision.\n\nIn his address to the Academic Senate, Guzman did not directly name Folt but said \u201ca different set of people\u201d decided \u201cwe cannot have her speak at commencement.\u201d Erroll Southers, USC\u2019s associate senior vice president of safety and risk assurance, said the commencement decision was made because of the \u201cspecificity of the individual [the valedictorian] and the specificity of the location [of commencement]\u201d which made the risk level for the predicted 70,000-person event \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d\n\nSouthers noted that the members of his team who have been at USC for 40 years have \u201cnever seen anything like this directed at a valedictorian or any speaker.\u201d Despite what Southers called unprecedented circumstances, some are demanding clearer answers. The undergraduate student government called Folt\u2019s reasoning \u201cinsufficient.\u201d Paul Adler, a Marshall professor who attended the Senate meeting, called the provost\u2019s message to the community \u201cdisturbingly ambiguous.\u201d\n\nWhat perhaps is on many students\u2019 minds is the status of the safety of commencement following this decision. It is unclear if barring Tabassum\u2019s speech has produced more threats than her selection. \u201cThere has been another, and this was not unanticipated by us, wave of comments or social media posts. Many of them are antisemitic or Islamophobic, and it\u2019s incredibly disturbing and heartbreaking,\u201d said Beong-Soo Kim, USC\u2019s senior vice president and general counsel.\n\nAfter Guzman and Southers addressed the Senate, the floor opened for questions. Notably, Johnathan Cohen, a professor of clinical population and public health sciences who shared that he is close to Tabassum, asked the provost during the meeting if he, on behalf of USC, would \u201cadequately condemn those threats, so as to reassure everyone, that we are not the type of university that caters to that kind of pressure.\u201d\n\nCohen also asked Guzman to confirm that barring Tabassum from speaking \u201chas absolutely nothing to do with Asna\u2019s political views and that [the provost] welcome[s] honest discourse about Israel and Palestine.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very happy to say that this decision had nothing to do with her political views and positions,\u201d said Guzman.\n\nSince the announcement of Tabassum as valedictorian, uproar over her pro-Palestinian views expressed on her social media account has spread throughout the USC campus and nationally. Trojans for Israel wrote in a statement on social media that they are \u201cdeeply disappointed that USC has failed to condemn the antisemitic rhetoric propagated by the valedictorian.\u201d\n\nThe meeting follows international media attention and several highly produced, high-profile sit-down interviews with the valedictorian. In her Monday statement, Tabassum expressed \u201cdisappointment\u201d at the university\u2019s decision.\n\nUSC Associates Chair in Humanities, English professor and non-voting member of the Senate John Rowe asked why there was no consultation with faculty or the broader student community as to the decision for Tabassum not to speak. The provost answered that it was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d and USC leadership teams are \u201cnot at liberty\u201d to discuss threats with anyone broader than the direct leadership.\n\nThis meeting comes on the same day that more than a hundred faculty members, including Rowe, signed a letter to Folt urging her to reinstate Tabassum\u2019s speech. Nicolas Duquette, an associate professor at Price, asked why the school chose to remove the valedictorian, noting an alleged pattern of placing the \u201cburden of that safety decision on the person who was the recipient of the threat and not the person who was engaging in the threatening or otherwise malicious behavior.\u201d\n\nThe question came after a preamble toward Guzman in which Duquette called himself a \u201cbig fan.\u201d The provost answered that this decision was \u201cnot the first choice\u201d of the committee, \u201cbut it was the choice we had.\u201d Southers added that in the past, actions have been reactive, and now the school has a chance to be \u201cpreemptive.\u201d\n\nAnastassia Tzoytzoyrakos, master lecturer at Bovard, asked why alternative formats of Tabassum\u2019s speech were not considered. The provost answered that the nature of her speech, in-person or not, still provides a \u201cfocal point\u201d on the university campus, which shares the same threat.\n\nTabassum told CNN that \u201cthey did not tell me about any specific threats.\u201d While unspecific in the nature or number of threats towards the valedictorian or the campus before the decision, Kim said, \u201cif we had gone forward and something happened, legally and morally there would be no forgiveness with such clear indication of potential risks.\u201d\n\nSouthers added that last year\u2019s commencement received a total of 352 threats, \u201cwhich you didn\u2019t hear about.\u201d The number of threats this year toward the valedictorian specifically or the larger campus Guzman stated was not disclosed. Southers noted this weekend\u2019s LA Times Festival of Books, an event that draws thousands of people to campus every year, and thus a security matter as well, is also on the safety department\u2019s approaching radar. \u201cWe have to get to commencement.\u201d\n\nMohammed Zain Shafi Khan contributed reporting to this article. This story has been updated to clarify that Guzman did not directly name Folt during Wednesday\u2019s meeting.\n```"}

You know, harassment from those wealthy investors who want to buy those houses and then tearing down without even letting the community know and building up these buildings that make no sense within this community.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times Reported that although USC has no affiliation with these private developers, they have partnered with the website \u201cOff Campus Housing 101\u2032\u2032, that lists community rentals. USC Junior majoring in Business Administration, Risa Takemoto, shares the same sentiments as the protestors.\n\nRisa Takemoto: I think USC has not done their best at trying to be more inclusive and to integrate the South Central Community, I think, especially with after they built the village in 2017, when they could have opened up the shops to be more inclusive to the community. It\u2019s obviously like, they\u2019re opening like Sunlife and Trader Joe\u2019s and target, which is like, for a specific demographic of people. And I think they can do a better job at integrating the South Central Community since they have been the cause of a lot of the gentrification around South Central.\n\nOn the other hand, some students like Ben Meyers, a sophomore majoring in Business and Computer Programming, believes that the university\u2019s role in the housing issue has been more positive.\n\nBen Meyers: As someone who lives off campus, I feel like USC has set up like a nice, symbiotic relationship with the, you know, the yellow jackets, making sure everyone\u2019s safe.

He stood in front of the Tommy Trojan statue Wednesday morning holding a sign that read \u201cJewish faculty in support of Asna Tabassum: Let her speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe might even hold opinions about the state of Israel that I personally disagree with,\u201d Blair said. \u201cBut I would die to defend her right to say that.\u201d\n\nMany were confused by RevCom\u2019s presence as a communist group not affiliated with USC. According to their promotional materials, RevCom follows the ideology of Bob Avakian, a political activist who founded the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA. He has been criticized by some as a cult leader.\n\n\u201cWhenever I tried to talk to them and there was a point where they couldn\u2019t answer sufficiently, they gave me this flyer which said to scan a QR code and listen to Bob Avakian,\u201d said Jonathan Silverman, a graduate student studying law at USC Gould. Silverman said he spoke to a RevCom member to see what their stance on Israel is.\n\n\u201cTheir stance was that Israel\u2019s existence is bad. The state should be abolished,\u201d Silverman said.\n\nRevCom is centered around a common goal to eliminate the \u201ccapitalism-imperialism\u201d system, according to the flyer. \u201cWe need to get rid of this system,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cCapitalism-imperialism is driving this genocide and requiring the US to back and fund what Israel is doing today and other crimes throughout history.\u201d\n\nRevCom members were handing out two flyers in front of their protest. Bold lettering on top of one of the flyers encourages people to join their \u201ccode of the revolution.\u201d There are six codes listed, one of which begins with, \u201cwe are going for an actual overthrow of this system and a whole better way beyond the destructive, vicious conflicts of today between the people.\u201d\n\nTrojans for Palestine, a USC student organization, released a statement saying that they are not affiliated with RevCom. \u201cThis group of people are constantly on USC ground promoting what at first sight might seem as pro-Palestinian/abolitionist ideology, but they in fact hold a cult-like agenda and follow a leader named Bob Avakian,\u201d the statement said.\n```"}

But that is the reality for many Persian Jews at the University of Southern California and in Los Angeles. Early on Sunday morning, sirens rang across Israel as Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel. Although 99% of the rockets were intercepted, the unprecedented attack heightened tensions between the Israeli and Iranian governments.\n\n\u201cApril 13 will be a watershed moment in the history of the Middle East,\u201d said Sam Yebri, a Tehran-born LA workers\u2019 rights attorney and former 2022 city council candidate. Israel and Iran have been long-time adversaries, and this recent attack was in response to an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, earlier this month. But this most recent incident has worried the Persian Jewish community in LA, many of whom fled from the regime in the late 1900s.\n\n\u201cFor many years, there\u2019s been this deep fear that the land of my birth would be at war with my ancestral homeland, Israel,\u201d said Yebri. \u201cWatching it unfold on Saturday live on television and social media was surreal and quite terrifying.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian revolution began in 1978, leading to the monarchy\u2019s downfall and the establishment of an Islamic republic in 1979. Today, Iran\u2019s supreme leader is Ali Khamenei, who has been in power since 1989. The regime has a history of persecuting religious minorities, including Baha\u2019is, Christians, Sunni Muslims, Zoroastrians and Jews, according to the State Department\u2019s 2018 Report on Religious Freedom for Iran. Many Persians fled Iran due to oppression. Before the revolution, there were over 100,000 Jews in Iran, but only 15,000 remain, as reported by the Tehran Jewish Committee. Many fled to the United States, with a large community in Southern California.\n\nThe United States is home to about 400,000 Iranian-born immigrants, with more than a third living in the L.A. metropolitan area, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Many Iranian-Americans worry about their loved ones living under the regime since they still have family in Iran.\n\nEthan Hamid, a junior studying gerontology at USC, is the descendant of parents who fled from Iran. For his family, \u201cthe Iranian regime has been the biggest threat to Western civilization,\u201d said Hamid, who is on the board of the USC Chabad and the co-founder of the Iranian Medical Society. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a dream to be able to go back and visit Iran.\u201d\n\nHamid said his family has an ancestry that goes back to Iran for around 2,400 years. His father\u2019s family left Iran a year before the revolution, while his mother\u2019s family left during the revolution. One of his grandfathers was imprisoned for attempting to flee the country as a Jew, and his family had to spend their entire life savings on securing his release.\n\n\u201cI pray that Iran goes back to being the country that it once was,\u201d Hamid said. He still has distant relatives living in Iran and close family members residing in Israel. The recent attack on Israel is an issue that hits close to home for him. He also said his cousins in Jerusalem shared videos of rockets fired last weekend, just as Ethan was finishing up Shabbat.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mixed emotions,\u201d Hamid said. \u201cI\u2019m scared for my family on both sides.\u201d\n\nHana Masrour, a junior studying public relations, also has a family heritage that traces back to Iran. Her father immigrated to the United States in 1979, and her mom, who spent some time in an Iranian jail, left the country in 1988. Masrour has some distant family in Iran and plenty of relatives in Israel, making her worried about the recent attack.\n\n\u201cI hope that the regime will fall and suffer as they rightfully should, for oppressing the people of Iran, especially the women,\u201d said Masrour. Women in Iran must cover their hair with hijabs, and cameras monitor compliance. They are not permitted to travel without their husband\u2019s consent.\n\nShe advised people to educate themselves and listen to Iranian women who lived under the regime, instead of those who had never been to Iran. \u201cIf something sounds like a fascist, oppressive dictatorship to you, maybe don\u2019t stand behind that,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t align with your beliefs about Israel.\u201d\n\nYebri said he also hopes to see change. \u201cIt feels like there is an opportunity for change within Iran because I believe that the people of Israel and the people of Iran want the same thing, which is to live in peace and freedom without terrorism,\u201d said Yebri.\n```"}

She does have a problem with her neighborhood turning into a playground for the rich, she said, which is why she filed with the California Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) to protest Highly Likely and its alcohol permit when the restaurant opened in Highland Park last July.\n\n\u201cI was photographing these staple establishments \u2014 the 98 Cent Store, the affordable taco spot, Coco\u2019s bakery \u2014 that had either closed or were sold during the pandemic,\u201d said Gonzales-Torres, a longtime Highland Park resident and anthropology researcher at UCLA. \u201cAnd I noticed these businesses being replaced in Highland Park, particularly on Figueroa Street, with five notices to sell alcoholic beverages at once.\u201d\n\nGonzales-Torres, now president of the Historic Highland Park Neighborhood Council, has long been part of a coalition of residents filing protests and pointing to an over-concentration of alcohol permits across Los Angeles. On March 7, the Historic Highland Park Neighborhood Council issued a community impact statement opposing the Restaurant Beverage Program (RBP), a city ordinance that fast-tracks alcohol permit approval and bypasses public hearings.\n\nHighland Park\u2019s City District 1 is the last remaining to adopt the program and is currently considering its position on the ordinance, according to communication between Gonzales-Torres and the CD 1 office.\n\nThe statement followed a public letter penned last July by Gonzales-Torres and Mercedes Gonzalez, a longtime resident of Echo Park and Council District 13, in which they requested a town hall with Councilmembers Hugo Soto-Martiniez and Eunisses Hernandez. In the letter, Gonzalez expressed a need to restore balance in the Echo Park and Silverlake neighborhoods, where ABC exceeds standards of undue concentration with 133 on-sale active alcohol permits in the area.\n\n\u201cAll of our resources are being taken out of the community, and [the community is] just being thrown more alcohol permits,\u201d said Gonzalez in an interview with LA Public Press. \u201cThe elderly are missing pharmacies we once had. There\u2019s no place to have an [Alcoholics Anonymous] meeting, because the Echo Park Methodist Church is being forced to close.\u201d\n\nIn October, Gonzalez filed an alcohol permit protest against organic grocery chain Sprouts Farmers Market \u2014 where a carton of a dozen eggs can cost as high as $12.99 \u2014 that is replacing a Rite-Aid pharmacy and former homeless encampment site in Echo Park. At a meeting with the Echo Park Neighborhood Council\u2019s Planning and Land Use Committee in February, Gonzalez asked a Sprouts representative to consider an in-store pharmacy to serve elderly and sick community members who can no longer easily access medication or affordable household essentials.\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with being against small businesses,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cIt has everything to do with who these businesses want to bring in, and who they\u2019re ignoring \u2014 a large portion of the community that has been in place for so many years.\u201d\n\nAfter COVID-19 closures forced nearly 122,700 layoffs for restaurant workers in LA, city councilmembers voted in 2022 to adopt the RBP, which cut the administrative fee to obtain an alcohol permit from about $13,000 down to $4,000. The ordinance also streamlined a state-run, months-long Conditional Use Permit clearance process \u2014 like the one Sprouts Farmers Market had to use as a grocery store \u2014 down to a few weeks for sit-down restaurants.\n\n\u201cI understand that [the RBP was created] to help businesses during the pandemic, but we\u2019re being told by the enforcement team at ABC \u2014 who are supposed to look into DUIs, underage serving, and imbalances in our neighborhoods \u2014 that they\u2019re short on staff,\u201d Gonzales-Torres said. \u201cNow, we have more bars than any other service for our youth or our elderly.\u201d\n\nRBP applications are processed separately from California ABC by eight planners in the City Planning\u2019s Beverage and Entertainment Streamlining (BESt) unit, after which a specialized inspector conducts inspections sometime in the first two years of approval, an LA City spokesperson told LA Public Press. Since 2022, the RBP has authorized 154 alcohol permits.\n\nThe Institute for Public Strategies calculated that over a third of census tracts in Los Angeles severely exceeded guidelines for alcohol permit density by about 300 percent as of 2019. Of those tracts, 65 percent also had above average crime rates \u2014 including DUIs and hit-and-runs \u2014 in East LA neighborhoods like Lincoln Heights, Chinatown, Echo Park, and Highland Park.\n\n\u201cCD 14, which includes Lincoln Heights, has the highest eviction rate in all of Los Angeles \u2014 people are losing their homes left and right,\u201d said Fernanda Sanchez, president of the Lincoln Heights Neighborhood Council. \u201cWe also are the third district with the highest alcohol permits, which is about to get even higher, because CD 14 just adopted the RBP program.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is that a healthy solution to a community that\u2019s in crisis?\u201d Sanchez added.\n\nA 2020 study by the LA County Department of Public Health found that communities with a high concentration of alcohol outlets in LA County were over twice as likely to have high rates of alcohol-related hospitalizations and deaths, even after adjusting for social determinants like socioeconomic status, minority status, housing type and household composition.\n\n\u201cWhat we actually need is mental health resources and permanent, affordable housing,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cIn many ways, our communities are full of trauma, and alcohol abuse is very common. With [the RBP], we\u2019re exploiting our vulnerabilities for profit.\u201d\n\nCalifornia ABC also enforces its own requirements for issuing alcohol permits. It can deny any retail license within the immediate vicinity of churches and hospitals, or within 600 feet of schools, public playgrounds and nonprofit youth facilities. It only denies these permits when licensed premises fail to serve \u201cpublic welfare and morals.\u201d\n\nIn October, Gonzalez filed another protest against SoCal chain Breakfast Republic\u2019s request for an alcohol permit at its new Echo Park location. She pointed to the ten other alcohol permits within a mile radius, as well as the restaurant\u2019s close proximity to Logan Elementary and Gabriella Charter School, Edendale Library, and youth nonprofit El Centro De Pueblo.\n\nBoth Gonzalez and Gonzales-Torres have yet to receive an Administrative hearing date and notice of investigation from ABC after filing their protests.\n\nIn December, Sanchez helped file an appeal against two alcohol permits requested by Juntos Market, a new upscale 7,850 square-foot market and restaurant in Chinatown. She was joined by Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, the Historic Cultural North Neighborhood Council, and 78 other residents who signed a petition opposing the permit. They cited an over-concentration of alcohol-related uses, proximity to existing breweries like Homage Brewing and Highland Park Brewery, and the market being located just across the street from Ann Street Elementary School and William Mead Homes public housing development.\n\nThe zoning administrator for the case approved an alcohol permit for 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. service and denied Juntos a second wine and beer license, requiring that the market accept EBT cards and try to keep their tacos affordable enough for the surrounding community.\n\n\u201cWilliam Mead is a couple streets down from LA Historic Park, which has concert venues and a bunch of breweries up and down that street,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cThese neighbors appealed this alcohol permit because they deal with party-goers peeing and defecating on their lawns and their rose bushes.\u201d\n\nBecause the city does not allow public hearing in the approval process, Sanchez said it often takes an army of community members to research, organize, and advocate for basic input in the form of a protest or an appeal.\n\n\u201cThese are seniors that have lived there for 30 years,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cThese are our most vulnerable people in our communities, and they had zero say in what happened to this alcohol permit unless it was appealed, and it should not be like that.\u201d\n\nIn an Alcohol Sensitive Use Zone, for communities \u201cburdened with public health and safety issues,\u201d the RBP requires a notification to the neighborhood council after authorization and places the restaurant on a one-year provisional period.\n\n\u201cMore will be learned in the coming year regarding compliance with RBP standards,\u201d said an LA City Spokesperson to LA Public Press. \u201cRequests for proactive inspections of restaurants under RBP do not begin until later this year.\u201d\n\nTo preempt community concerns, the RBP emphasizes that the streamlined process is open only to sit-down restaurants, not bars. Its extensive eligibility criteria includes that the restaurant must have an operational kitchen and full menu served at all hours, operate between the hours of 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. and have a minimum of 10 patron seats.\n\nBut for Gonzales-Torres, skyrocketing rent doesn\u2019t discriminate between high-end restaurants and fancy bars. Nearly a third of residents in Highland Park\u2019s CD 1 are below the poverty level, and around 79 percent of residents live in rental-occupied units, according to the census.\n\nSmall businesses don\u2019t need cheaper alcohol permits, she said. They need cheaper rent.\n\nHighly Likely in Highland Park. (Photo courtesy of Angela Gonzales-Torres)\n\n\u201cIf you look at Figueroa, we have [around] 20 permits in a five block radius. That tells other landlords, the person next to you is asking this much for rent, maybe you can, too \u2014 and smaller businesses who can\u2019t satisfy that rent are priced out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be so expensive to the point where we can\u2019t have mom-and-pop-shops anymore, because their landlords might want to invite a Highly Likely to satisfy an egregious amount of rent.\u201d\n\nHighland Park used to have a family-owned skate shop and a bookstore across from Highly Likely, where the community hosted free and family-friendly events, said Gonzales-Torres. Sanchez used to pull up to neighborhood rotisserie shop Chappalitas in Lincoln Heights, which was replaced by a wine and beer deli.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re predominantly monolingual, immigrant, working-class communities,\u201d said Sanchez, \u201cand these aren\u2019t our safe spaces anymore.\u201d\n\nGonzalez remembered when La Guadalupana, a low-priced Hispanic grocery store in Echo Park with a carniceria in the back, closed in 2018 after it could no longer afford rent. Or, when A Grocery Warehouse, a staple Asian market on Sunset Boulevard, was bought out by developers as part of a $9.5 million deal in 2017 and has remained unoccupied since, pending conversion to restaurant and residential space.\n\n\u201cSometimes, I\u2019m walking around Highland Park, and I feel like I\u2019m not even a stranger in my own home \u2014 I\u2019m an unwanted guest,\u201d said Gonzales-Torres. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like any of these businesses are trying to cater to those of us who grew up here, who want to have some semblance of home and safety.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/17/clippers-la-preps-for-first-round-matchup-against-dallas/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 Clippers fans have seen this matchup before, and they\u2019ll see it again this year, as the fourth-seed LA Clippers prepare to take on the fifth-seed Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the playoffs. Including this season, the two teams have faced each other in the first round three times over the past five years, having also done so in 2020 and 2021. LA prevailed both times in what were tight series, but both rosters have undergone serious makeovers since their last postseason bout.\n\nOn Dallas\u2019 side, center Kristaps Porzingis was traded to the Boston Celtics and Jalen Brunson signed with the New York Knicks in free agency. Even though 2021 was just Doncic\u2019s second season in the NBA, he still led the Mavericks in scoring with 27.7 points per game and has only improved as an offensive hub since then. Plus, Dallas also made a change at head coach following Rick Carlisle\u2019s move to the Indiana Pacers, with Jason Kidd taking over.\n\nThe Clippers had a few players depart in the proceeding years, like Marcus Morris and DeMarcus Cousins, but Paul George and Kawhi Leonard were already in LA by 2020. The most significant changes to the Clippers\u2019 roster have occurred last year, with the additions of Russell Westbrook and James Harden, who have been huge parts of the team in 2023-24.\n\nThe Clippers won the regular season series against Dallas 2-1, but the two teams haven\u2019t played one another since right before Christmas, making those results less telling of what we\u2019ll see. Doncic, the NBA\u2019s leading scorer, led the Mavericks in points in all three contests against LA and has been their number one offensive option throughout the season. Kyrie Irving has settled into the role of a high-scoring second fiddle, averaging 25.6 points per game during his first full year in Dallas, good enough for 13th best in the league.\n\n\u201cYou have two elite scorers and attackers, so it\u2019ll be a challenge for sure,\u201d said Clippers associate head coach Daniel Craig after their 116-105 loss to the Houston Rockets Sunday. \u201cI know our staff has already dove into it the last couple of days knowing that we\u2019re locked in to play them, so we\u2019re getting ready for a lot of different coverages and getting ready for both those guys being on the floor together,\u201d Craig said.\n\nIn terms of one-on-one matchups, Leonard will likely guard Doncic on many possessions, assuming Leonard is healthy come Sunday. George will probably find himself on both Derrick Jones Jr. and Tim Hardaway Jr., who typically split minutes at Dallas\u2019 small forward spot. Harden will start for the Clippers, but expect Westbrook to get significant minutes in an effort to match Irving\u2019s speed around the perimeter. And on the interior, Ivica Zubac will be matched against Daniel Gafford, who has been a solid replacement for Porzingis since the Washington Wizards traded the Latvian big man.\n\nThe Clippers\u2019 recent postseason history with the Mavericks makes the matchup even more compelling. \u201cI think those chess pieces have moved a little bit already, where when you have teams that haven\u2019t seen each other in the postseason recently, everything can be a little new,\u201d said Craig. \u201cThose first couple of games both teams will be a little bit more prepared and maybe a little bit further ahead than some of these other first-round opponents because of that recent past with them in the playoffs.\u201d\n\nThe headline in this series is the battle between the two teams\u2019 star players, but bench contributions will likely be the X factor that pushes one team ahead of the other. The Clippers decided to rest their starters in losses to the Houston Rockets and Utah Jazz this past weekend, and substitutes like Amir Coffey and Bones Hyland put up significant numbers in those games, suggesting they\u2019ll be ready when called upon. When the Clippers began to lose more games in early February, the issue was that they were relying too heavily on their top talent, but recent performances by Brandon Boston Jr. and Hyland give some hope for the Clippers\u2019 depth.\n\nThe Mavericks mirrored the Clippers\u2019 strategy, resting their entire starting lineup in their two final regular season games in preparation for the playoffs. The four-five matchup is meant to be the most even matchup in the playoffs, and in the case of Clippers-Mavericks, it truly is. Both teams are nearly equal in terms of defensive rating, though the Mavericks have an edge offensively, averaging three more points per game. This series will be a test of endurance and a seven-game round is certainly not out of the question.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/17/cbb-transfer-portal-update-guards-are-going-fast/", "response": "```\nThe season may have ended with UConn\u2019s dominant championship run, but players across the country have already begun to shift next season\u2019s landscape by entering the transfer portal and committing to new schools. Here are some of the offseason\u2019s most notable transfers thus far and how they might impact their new squads.\n\nKylan Boswell: Arizona to Illinois\n6-foot-2 guard\nAfter two consecutive disappointing postseason finishes with the Arizona Wildcats, Kylan Boswell entered the transfer portal and promptly committed to the Illinois Fighting Illini. As a freshman, Boswell came off the bench for Arizona, averaging fewer than five points per game in about 15 minutes of game action per night. However, he became the starting point guard as a sophomore and upped his scoring to 9.6 points per game with 3.6 assists per game, as well. In the Wildcats\u2019 opening round win against Long Beach State in the NCAA Tournament, Boswell scored a career-high 20 points with eight assists. However, in Arizona\u2019s next two games\u2013including their season-ending loss to Clemson\u2013Boswell scored a combined five points and only recorded three assists. Despite his lackluster performance in March Madness, Boswell\u2019s move to Illinois puts the Fighting Illini in a position to be a top three offense in the country for the second straight season. Boswell is one of the most efficient isolation scorers in the country and Illinois will likely use him as their primary ball handler next season, given Terrence Shannon Jr.\u2019s impending departure. And with Zach Edey NBA-bound, Boswell immediately makes Illinois a serious threat to win the Big Ten next year.\n\nZeke Mayo: South Dakota State to Kansas\n6-foot-3 guard\nUnlike Boswell, Zeke Mayo\u2019s college career has already exceeded expectations. After three seasons, Mayo has started in 87 games for the South Dakota State Jackrabbits, including two NCAA Tournament appearances. Last year, Mayo averaged 18.8 points per game and led the Summit League in 3-pointers made (92) and 3-point percentage (39.2%) en route to winning Summit League Player of the Year honors. As a senior, Mayo will be taking his talents away from the Summit League and into the most competitive conference in the country, as he joins the Kansas Jayhawks in the Big 12. In a down year, Kansas finished with 23 wins and won their first-round matchup in March Madness. However, the Jayhawks opened the AP\u2019s Preseason Poll ranked No. 1 and fell short of the expectations that came with landing last season\u2019s top transfer, Hunter Dickinson. Head coach Bill Self\u2019s crew never found an offensive identity and injuries derailed their chances of making a deep postseason run. With Mayo on board, Self\u2019s squad will inherit a true three-level scorer and pick-and-roll ball handler, who can also play iso-offense and is an elite cutter. Mayo gives the Jayhawks something they were missing last year: a player who can create their own shot in a close game.\n\nDarlinstone Dubar: Hoftra to Tennessee\n6-foot-6 guard\nThe most impactful transfer in college basketball last season was the Tennessee Volunteers\u2019 versatile grad student Dalton Knecht. For the second year in a row, head coach Rick Barnes has made a splash in the portal, this time with Darlinstone Dubar from the Hofstra Pride. As a freshman, Dubar averaged three points per game in his seven starts with the Iowa State Cyclones. To make matters worse, in his last four games there, he recorded 41 straight minutes without scoring a single point and the Cyclones went 0-4 to finish Big 12 conference play with a winless 0-18 record. After that disastrous season, Dubar transferred to the Hofstra Pride, where he has rebuilt his college basketball career. In three seasons in Long Island, Dubar played in 100 games, averaging 13.2 points per game on a wildly efficient 53.1% shooting from the floor. Dubar does most of his work off the ball, which will make his transition to SEC basketball as easy as it comes. He may not be as gifted a scorer as Knecht\u2014few are\u2014but his ability to cut to the rim is as good as anyone\u2019s in the country, which will give returning Volunteer Zakai Zeigler a dream target in two-man pick-and-roll actions. The last time a team won back-to-back outright regular season titles in the SEC was Florida in \u201813 and \u201814. Eleven years later, will Tennessee accomplish the same feat on the back of another elite transfer?\n\nKentucky\u2019s incoming freshmen\nThe biggest story in college basketball (other than its reigning back-to-back champion) is superstar head coach John Calipari\u2019s departure from the Kentucky Wildcats to take over the Arkansas Razorbacks. Calipari is arguably the best recruiter in the history of the sport, with names like Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, Karl-Anthony Towns, Julius Randle, and Malik Monk coming through the Kentucky program during his tenure in Lexington. Due to his sudden departure, there are now four incoming freshmen (three of whom are five-star recruits) that have reopened their recruitment. These players are Somto Cyril, Karter Knox, Boogie Fland, and Jayden Quaintance. Will they follow Coach Calipari to Arkansas? Or will they spread out across the rest of the college basketball landscape? We will find out soon, along with the results of the rest of the transfer portal.\n```"}

However, it seems like the James and the Lakers don\u2019t mind the tournament too much, as they made their third play-in appearance in four years and advanced to a first-round matchup against the Denver Nuggets.\n\nOnce again looking to secure the Western Conference\u2019s seventh seed, the Lakers entered New Orleans with the conference\u2019s eighth-best regular season record and beat the Pelicans in a nail-biter to secure their playoff spot. It was the fifth matchup of the season between the two teams, following a recent Lakers victory over New Orleans on Sunday.\n\nAfter the Lakers embarrassed New Orleans on the Pelicans\u2019 home floor over the weekend, the Pelicans gave LA everything they had from the opening tip. The first quarter featured back-and-forth scoring between the two teams and after the opening 12 minutes, the Lakers found themselves trailing 26-34. Despite the deficit, they had reason to be optimistic, as D\u2019Angelo Russell scored 13 points and had four assists in the first quarter to keep Los Angeles in the game.\n\nLos Angeles started off the second quarter much more impressively and eventually took a 41-38 lead thanks to a Gabe Vincent three-pointer. Vincent easily had his best game as a Laker yesterday, putting up nine points off the bench and making two three-pointers with one steal.\n\nThe Lakers were able to grow their advantage to as many as 14 in the second quarter and entered halftime leading 60-50, outscoring New Orleans 34-16 in the period. At halftime, James had 15 points, four rebounds and five assists, while Russell had 15 points with six assists.\n\nThe Lakers started the third quarter on fire and extended their lead to 18 with less than seven minutes remaining in the period. However, Los Angeles was not totally safe. New Orleans came back and trimmed the Lakers\u2019 lead to seven entering the fourth.\n\nLeading 83-76 to begin the final period, the Lakers surrendered 31 points in three quarters to Zion WIlliamson and it looked like the Pelicans had the necessary momentum to advance. Even though New Orleans made the game competitive again, the Lakers ultimately weathered the storm.\n\nLos Angeles took a 91-80 lead after a basket from Anthony Davis and tried to do everything the team could to put New Orleans away, but the Pelicans kept fighting back and eventually tied the game at 95 with 3:19 remaining. The game-tying shot was Williamson\u2019s 17th field goal and 40th point, but he then exited the game and did not return with what is now being called a left hamstring strain.\n\nDown Williamson the rest of the way, the Lakers took advantage of the huge break and escaped New Orleans with a win. Los Angeles outscored the Pelicans 15-11 in the final minutes and earned its fourth win of the year over New Orleans, including a previous winner-take-all game in the in-season tournament semifinal.\n\nAll five Lakers starters finished as double-digit scorers and James led the way for the Lakers with a near triple-double: 23 points, nine rebounds and nine assists. After a hot first quarter, Russell cooled down, but still posted 21 points and six assists, while Davis finished with a double-double, scoring 20 points and grabbing 15 rebounds along with three blocks and one steal.\n\nLos Angeles also received 29 combined points from Rui Hachimura and Austin Reaves, who scored 13 and 16, respectively. With the win, the Lakers are now 3-0 in the play-in tournament and have secured the seventh seed each time they have appeared in the tournament.\n\nLast season, the seventh-seed Lakers went all the way to the Western Conference finals after beating the second-seeded Memphis Grizzlies in the first round and the sixth-seeded Golden State Warriors in the second round. However, in the conference finals, Los Angeles was swept by the eventual champion Denver Nuggets.\n\nThe Lakers have a chance to redeem themselves this time around as their win over New Orleans locked them into a first round matchup against Denver. As the Lakers gear up to face the Nuggets, they will have three full days of rest before their true postseason run begins. Game one between the Lakers and Nuggets in Denver is set to tip off at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.\n```"}

Scott Applewhite)\n\nBy Isabel Crespo April 17, 2024 at 3:27 pm PDT\n\nWhat was once a popular social media platform for users to create short-term video content has now become a hot topic on the Senate floor. The House of Representatives passed a bill on March 13 that, if passed by the Senate, would ban TikTok in the United States unless the Beijing-based parent company ByteDance sells its stake to a buyer that the U.S. government signs off on. The Biden Administration and lawmakers are concerned with the app\u2019s potential national security threats and data privacy risks for the U.S. government and its users.\n\nThe recent bill, however, raises questions about the merit of the potential risks and the legal and policy implications of an administration targeting a popular free speech outlet. \u201cWe have to ground the debate in evidence as much as possible, and to not allow political considerations to dictate how we approach the issue,\u201d said Matt Perault, the director of the Center on Technology Policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cIf there is significant national security risk associated with TikTok, then significant remedies are justified. And so the fundamental question is, is there significant risk? The best way to reveal that risk is through an investigation.\u201d\n\nOverview of the TikTok issue\nTikTok is a social media app for short-form video content from user-submitted videos. According to a report done by Oxford Economics, there are 170 million active users and 7 million businesses on the app. It also has generated $24 billion to the U.S. economy. TikTok\u2019s popularity and economic impact has made this bill a hot topic among the U.S. population, especially among young people, putting pressure on the current administration and lawmakers in an election year.\n\nThere is currently limited evidence that the Chinese Government has access to TikTok\u2019s data from a former employee of ByteDance, Yintao Yu, who is suing for wrongful termination and alleges that the Chinese Communist Party used TikTok to spy on users. Remaining concerns over cybersecurity and privacy risks in connection with China prompted the House to speed up legislation under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act \u2014 requiring the support of two-thirds of the House for passage. The act was passed 352-65 with 197 Republicans and 155 Democrats voting yes, making it a true bipartisan bill.\n\nThe future of the bill depends on the Democratic-governed Senate. TikTok CEO Shou Chew responded to the TikTok Ban Bill in a TikTok video: \u201cOver the last few years, we have invested to keep your data safe and our platform free from outside manipulation. We have committed that we will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nAccording to Michael Daniel, leader of the Cyber Threat Alliance, the potential risks of TikTok are over the application of its data, such as what it collects, where it\u2019s going, who can access it and whether it\u2019s monetized. The wide popularity of the app only exacerbates the potential harm, explaining why this particular social media platform has garnered so much attention.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that while I certainly have some concerns about TikTok, its security, and its relationship to the Chinese government, it does strike me that this is really not about TikTok itself,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cIt\u2019s embedded in a much broader conversation policy set of issues about how and when we are going to allow the technology from China into the United States? And under what conditions? Are they going to allow technology from the U.S. into China? Is this competition between the U.S. and China going to play out in the technological sphere?\u201d\n\nTikTok\u2019s Privacy Policy offers a comprehensive breakdown of how they use user information, how they share it and other related rights and choices. TikTok does not sell or share users\u2019 personal information to third parties and is committed to maintaining trust with their users.\n\n\u201cByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government,\u201d said Chew at the House Energy & Commerce Committee hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s a privacy company. 60% of the company is owned by global institutional investors, 20% is owned by the founder, [and] 20% owned by employees around the world.\u201d\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testifies during a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on the platform's consumer privacy and data security practices and impact on children, Thursday, March 23, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nDaniel believes that the U.S. needs national privacy laws that clarify the expectations for how social media platforms and applications manage an individual\u2019s personal data. Moreover, proper ways to inform users on what they are meaningfully or negligently consenting to.\n\n\u201cI think you also need to make some distinctions between what really is data that you care about versus data that you don\u2019t,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cSecure by design effort, how do you actually build applications so that they\u2019re more secure from the ground up so that the end users have greater confidence that there are fewer vulnerabilities and flaws in those applications?\u201d\n\nSocial media apps\u2019 impact on users and where TikTok comes in\nAn important consideration is not only what the U.S. government and lawmakers think about TikTok, but the majority of its users who would be directly affected by this issue. According to Pew Research, about a third of U.S. adults under the age of 30 are regularly using TikTok and adults ages 18-29 are the primary users of the app, majority Gen Z.\n\nGen Z, having grown up in the digital age, has had plenty of exposure to a variety of apps and platforms that have utilized their personal information and data over the years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honestly not worried about my data,\u201d said Jack Murphy, a sophomore political science major and Tik Tok influencer. \u201cI know our government has all of the information on us on all the other platforms so it\u2019s like, \u2018What makes a difference?\u2019 And I feel like the really big issue here is the fact that the United States government is not the one controlling the data, and that\u2019s their issue.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about the media\u2019s portrayal of this issue is that the U.S. government and lawmakers don\u2019t wish to ban TikTok in the U.S., but aim to divest the company from ByteDance to a company that the U.S. signs off on. It will be banned, however, if ByteDance refuses to divest.\n\nThis important distinction, however, brings into question the merit of the potential risks of TikTok under the ownership of ByteDance. If TikTok were to become fully U.S. owned, would users\u2019 data still be protected, hence raising the same concerns if it were under ByteDance?\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence showed in a declassified 2023 report that U.S. intelligence agencies have enlarged what is \u201ccommercially available information\u201d because of the rapid development of technology and can access \u201csensitive and intimate information\u201d about U.S. persons.\n\nThe U.S.-based data broker Acxiom has more than 20,000 servers collecting and analyzing data on about 700 million people around the world, according to a report by the Nato Strategic Communications Centre of Intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe head of Sun Microsystems was famously quoted as saying, \u2018You have no privacy, get over it,\u2019\u201d Jonathan D. Aronson, a USC professor of communications, said. \u201cAnybody who is intent on finding information about you can. There are enough public databases. There is enough leaking in terms of that. If you don\u2019t want somebody to know something, don\u2019t put your information on the internet.\u201d\n\nA report by the Center for Democracy and Technology also revealed legal loopholes that law enforcement and intelligence agencies use to get information from data brokers that typically require a warrant.\n\n\u201cAll of those kinds of things are the policy issues that we need to be talking about,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cI know, they sound kind of dry and boring, but it really actually matters, you know, over the long run. Just as another concrete example, do we want to set some rules, or at least some norms?\u201d\n\nWhat the future holds for TikTok\nTikTok is already banned from all federal and state-issued devices in most states under the Consolidated Appropriations Act and Montana\u2019s ban on TikTok was blocked by U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy in a preliminary injunction over violations of First Amendment rights for users and business.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that changes is who owns the company,\u201d Perault said. \u201cThose specifics will need to be worked out in court, and I think the rigor of the judicial process will be helpful. It\u2019s easy to write an op-ed talking about potential harms. It\u2019s much more difficult to serve five judicial reviews and the intensive scrutiny that comes with judicial review. I think the thing that we would learn in a court process is more about the facts that animate how the government\u2019s thinking about it and the particular speech value that Tik Tok provides.\u201d\n\nMurphy was in the Capitol building when the TikTok bill was being voted on in the House as part of the university\u2019s political science program and had the opportunity to speak to different lawmakers about the app. He learned two major insights: the media is mischaracterizing the TikTok issue, and it is unlikely that the bill will pass in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to die on the Senate floor because as the Senate is the upper house, there\u2019s a different type of respect between houses and they don\u2019t want to take up a bill from the lower house, in my opinion,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI think that in the Senate it\u2019s too political to touch as it is an upcoming election year too.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting how you have the very far left politicians like Congressman Ro Khanna, for example, and then you have Congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene who\u2019s far conservative who both disagree on the fact that they don\u2019t agree that TikTok should be banned. You have just the middle people voting on banning TikTok but then you have the very far ends of the spectrum actually agreeing on something.\u201d\n\nThe debate over whether or not the TikTok bill will pass is one component of the debate, but another is when the ban would actually go into effect if it does.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty on how this is going to play out,\u201d Aronson said. \u201cAnd especially in the timeline, it\u2019s definitely not going to happen tomorrow or anytime soon. If this ban gets passed, [TikTok] is going to challenge that, and there\u2019s going to be back and forth, so it\u2019s definitely not going to be a change tomorrow but it does kind of bring up some important conversations about the politics getting involved in communication platforms like TikTok.\u201d```"}

{"key": "/2024/04/17/how-sports-leagues-stand-to-benefit-from-the-nationwide-legalization-of-sports-betting/", "response": "```\nHow sports leagues stand to benefit from the nationwide legalization of sports betting\n\nBy Riley Sager April 17, 2024 at 10:39 am PDT\n\nThe explosion of technology in recent years has significantly shortened our attention spans and dangerously increased our desire for an overstimulation of entertainment. Watching Outer Banks at the dinner table isn\u2019t enough, one must also catch up on TikTok\u2019s latest and greatest breaking news. With the countless streaming platforms and latest gadgets, it\u2019s clear the profound impact technology is having on the ways we interact with media and entertainment. But, it isn\u2019t just a new generation of \u201ciPad kids\u201d or chronic procrastination that has resulted from this technological advancement. Technology has also provided a platform for sports betting to redefine the future of professional sports. It\u2019s no longer about watching Damian \u201cDame D.O.L.L.A.\u201d Lillard and Steph Curry battle it out on the court \u2014 you also have to make sure your parlay hits. After all, what are sports about if not entertainment and competition?\n\nWhile illegal sports betting has existed for hundreds of years in this country, it wasn\u2019t until just a few years ago that it became widely legalized in America. In 2018, the Supreme Court overturned the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act that had previously prevented sports betting in every state (except Nevada) for nearly three decades. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision didn\u2019t immediately legalize sports betting, but instead gave each state the power to decide. Incentives for states include the potential for millions of dollars in tax revenue, and it seemed like a win-win-win situation for all parties involved, so long as the Detroit Pistons do the impossible and make you a millionaire off 1000-to-1 odds.\n\nWith lower regulations and taxes, more sportsbooks would be able to enter the market, a wider audience of Americans would have access to place more bets and this increased volume would ultimately generate more tax revenue. Since the ruling in 2018, 37 states have joined Nevada in legalizing sports betting of some form, while 30 states now allow it via online platforms. The legalization prompted the addition of sportsbooks and betting kiosks in state and tribal casinos, as well as FanDuel and DraftKings brick-and-mortar lounges. However, the largest source of revenue remains online betting platforms, which have contributed to the industry\u2019s $10 billion worth.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic proved to help the industry more than anything since the Supreme Court decision, as it challenged the norms of entertainment consumption. The pandemic eliminated any concept of normalcy in the world and \u2014 with endless hours to fill watching Tiger King and TikTok \u2014 millions of Americans turned to sports betting for that familiar sense of entertainment and connection to the game. The pandemic presented professional sports with a much more virtual platform through which leagues could continue to capitalize on the fan experience while seizing the opportunity to manufacture a \u201cnew normal,\u201d like how the NBA televised virtual fans during the \u2018bubble.\u2019\n\nWhile Americans were losing jobs and battling illness, major sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings capitalized a collective $1.5 billion in revenue. Even though the coronavirus produced record-high revenue for companies, sports betting isn\u2019t just a temporary part of the pandemic hangover. Much more mature international markets have existed for decades, and it was ultimately the 2018 decision in the U.S. that permanently changed the forecast of what professional sports will become.\n\n\u201cThese sports leagues have no choice but to embrace gambling,\u201d former NBA player and current TNT Sports analyst Charles Barkley said. \u201cThese leagues are getting paid, and honestly, I do commercials for FanDuel.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt technology has strongly impacted public opinion on sports betting since its rise in the early 2000s. In 2003, the NFL refused to air a Super Bowl commercial for Las Vegas tourism because of the city\u2019s affiliation with gambling. Fast forward to 2023, the NFL generates roughly $2.3 billion per year from legal sports betting and Sin City even hosted the 2024 Super Bowl, where FanDuel alone collected $307 million in wagers from more than 2.5 million Americans.\n\n\u201cGambling is one of the reasons the NFL is King Kong,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cThey are the most popular league by far, and it has a lot to do with gambling.\u201d Technology\u2019s impact is unignorable, as it delivers an efficient access point for anyone to enjoy an additional element of entertainment. This access allows anyone to mindlessly place bets and promotes the placement of \u201cprop bets,\u201d which are side wagers not related to the outcome of the matchup. Prop bets are an instant way to make a game more interesting for fans, especially if one\u2019s spread bet isn\u2019t looking hopeful.\n\nThere are nearly 60 legal sportsbooks in America today, and while their goal is to produce revenue, consumers are seduced by the opportunity to make fast money while staying connected to their favorite teams and players. \u201c[I am] a big gambling person myself, but I am concerned about gambling in sports because being able to bet in-game on who\u2019s going to make the next basket, if somebody\u2019s going to make two free throws, I think it can easily make somebody become addicted,\u201d Barkley said.\n\nSports betting certainly poses substantial risk, but the technology is unavoidable, and it\u2019s up to these professional leagues if they want to capitalize on this opportunity or try to hold on to an image of the good ol\u2019 days that no longer exists. Aside from the potential health risks that result from gambling-related addiction, the skepticism many Americans experience towards the sports betting industry stems from uncertainty. Just as no one could have predicted the impact TikTok would have on consumerism, it\u2019s impossible to conclude exactly what the sports betting landscape will look like in five or 10 years.\n\nAnother thing to look out for is the impact of artificial intelligence. Breakthroughs in AI technology have disrupted markets all over the world, from television media to delivery services. Its potential is lurking behind the shadows, and it\u2019s unclear exactly how it will impact sports betting. Such changes include outcome-predicting algorithms used to forecast winning bets. League commissioners have discussed necessary regulations regarding betting, including NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who spoke out in support of a safe hub for sports betting back in 2014.\n\n\u201cI believe that sports betting should be brought out of the underground and into the sunlight where it can be appropriately monitored and regulated,\u201d Silver said in a New York Times op-ed. Silver\u2019s argument is similar to those of many Americans, as he acknowledges the potential opportunities that could come from endorsing such an industry.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying the industry\u2019s potential for creating a multi-billion dollar market, but the next few years pose a crossroads for American professional sports leagues. They can either lean into the endorsement of sports betting \u2014 capitalizing on potential billions \u2014 or they can hesitate and lose out on a new generation of potential fans focused on entertainment and instant gratification.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a mature way to gamble because you have no control over who\u2019s betting, old people, young people, or anything, but I do know sports gambling is here to stay and it\u2019s probably only going to get bigger and more dangerous,\u201d Barkley said.\n\nThese leagues will have to rely on each respective state to legalize sports betting, but if they help advocate for the industry\u2019s country-wide legalization, multiple parties would stand to make millions of dollars.\n```"}

That is an introduction that USC sophomore, Kamryn Tate, will give 15 times this semester. Every Friday at 1pm, dozens of students passing Tommy Trojan\u2019s home on Trousdale are drawn to this upbeat energy. They stop in their tracks to become audience members for a comedy troupe called Commedus Interruptus, which Kamryn joined her freshman year. Commedus Interruptus: It\u2019s improv... and it\u2019s free! Free! Free improv!\n\nWhile Kamryn loves to put on a good performance for the crowd, she also finds that being a Black female comedian at USC \u201cis comedic in and of itself.\u201d Tate: This is not a place that I historically belong, yet here I am, right? I kind of take this experience and use it to influence my comedy by essentially stating the obvious and what not, the things that people can see but don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s necessarily correct to say out loud. And I find that hilarious in itself because, well, we all see it, so why not say it?\n\nAnd she has a lot to say about race, identity and the lack of Black women in comedy here at USC since her arrival. Tate: So I came on this campus and said, hey. There are improv auditions. Why not? I stepped into those audition rooms and I did not see too many faces that looked like mine. In fact, I could count on my hand. Two. And I have made great relationships with those people, so it did bring out something great, but it definitely did strike me in a sense of, well, where are all the Black people in USC comedy? Is it that we\u2019re not interested? Which I\u2019ve learned is not the case.\n\nKamryn believes the real case is that Hollywood is responsible for decades of obstacles that Black female comedians face. Academy award winning comedians Quinta Brunson and Ayo Ediberi\u2019s historical 2024 Emmys victories mark just the second and third awards for Black women in their comedy categories. And USC is just Hollywood\u2019s backyard. Those obstacles start on college campuses and grow larger as aspiring comedians become working comedians.\n\nMattie Bayne, USC alumna and current story editor for ABC\u2019s Not Dead Yet, shared her experience with race and gender inequalities in college comedy. Bayne: Just like a white man who just refused to acknowledge that I was in charge of him. And sometimes I would trick him by doing the things that I wanted to do by asking my friend who was another white man, to ask him to do the things I needed him to do. Because all the time he pushed back he\u2019d be like, Mattie, blah, you\u2019re a tyrant. And I was like, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m affable. But I was like, I\u2019m tricking you. Like, you can\u2019t even really tell how misogynistic or racist you are.\n\nEmmy award winning actress and comedian, LaNisa Renee Frederick agrees. She says this isn\u2019t just a one-off, this is a common experience many Black female comedians face. She calls this form of obstacle a \u201cwhite man in a flannel\u201d who thinks he rules the comedy world. Frederick: I think one of the reasons why we see a discrepancy is because we have to think about who is behind the camera, who is in the boardroom, who is sitting at the table making the decisions. So, there are some days that I just say, \u2018Oh, I wish I was an accountant and had a nine to five and I give up because this is some BS.\u2019 And then there are some days that the part of me that stays in that is fueled by the challenges, that\u2019s fueled by the fact that you keep saying no to me. So that makes me wake up every morning and go harder.\n\nAnd Kamryn is running on that same fuel. Even when it gets hard, she isn\u2019t giving up. She\u2019s facing these conflicts head on. Tate: That gets tiring and constantly trying and trying to be that bound, barrier breaking person. Like, can it just be normal? But on the other side, I was like. Wait. This is a lot of fun though, cause I love being the person where everybody thinks, what is she going to say next? Because I hate being predictable. Being predictable isn\u2019t fun anymore. You\u2019ve got to be something else. And I find the joy in being that because it brings joy, it brings laughter. It makes me happy. It makes my peers happy. And so that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to conquer.\n\nAnd the key to conquering these challenges is reclaiming comedy that uplifts Black joy. That\u2019s what Tylre Sinclair believes. She\u2019s a working screenwriter and former director\u2019s assistant for Right of Way Films. Sinclair: I feel like black women in general have been kind of the butt of the joke most of the time, instead of the ones making the jokes. And yet at the same time, it feels like black women in general, the way that we talk is taken by other communities. The jokes that we say. It\u2019s like, we can say the joke kind of quietly under our breath, only the people around us will hear it, but then someone else of a different skin tone says it louder, and then they get all the credit for it. And so I think in general, I feel like it\u2019s time to kind of almost reclaim comedy in a way.\n\nCommedus Interruptus: Did you rhyme, rhyme, rhyme? Did you rhyme, rhyme? Doo doo, yeah! I drive a car, it\u2019s a van. Doo doo, yeah! And I\u2019m banned. Doo doo, yeah! And it\u2019s sand. Did you rhyme, rhyme, rhyme? Did you rhyme, rhyme? I\u2019m Jody Foster and this is Silence of the Lambs!\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what Kamryn Tate is doing with her campus comedy career. In fact, she even founded her own sketch comedy troupe. Tate: I\u2019ve started my own, POC led sketch comedy group called Three Fifths Comedy. Someone\u2019s got to do it. Because if I\u2019m amongst people like me, nobody\u2019s the token here. We\u2019re all equals in this space, right? We sit down, we have writers meetings, we write down pitches and ideas. We film out, read them, see what sticks, and we develop them further and we post them online.\n\nMaybe the key to changing the industry is making more space for Black women in comedy before they enter it. Kamryn is making steps towards that future. That\u2019s an award of its own.\n```"}

Rapid change is needed.\n\nDense traffic on a Los Angeles freeway. (\"Los Angeles Traffic\" by Accretion Disc is licensed under CC BY 2.0.)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan\nApril 17, 2024 at 10:33 am PDT\n\nTraffic violence in Los Angeles and California has been on the rise since 2020, but it\u2019s hard to pinpoint why that is. Jack Hallinan investigated the dark truth behind the sad statistics.\n\nIf you drive in LA, you\u2019re no stranger to auto accidents littered across the city\u2019s streets and highways. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a sign and sound Angelenos have grown all too used to. More than 300 people died due to traffic violence in 2022, marking the city\u2019s highest traffic death toll in 20 years.\n\nDamian Kevitt: I was bicycling in Griffith Park with my wife, we were going to the LA Zoo for a picnic. That\u2019s Damian Kevitt. He suffered a horrible accident about 10 years ago.\n\nKevitt: I was hit, pinned underneath a car, dragged nearly a quarter of a mile from the streets onto and down the 5 freeway at freeway speeds. The incident caused irreversible damage to Kevitt\u2019s lower body.\n\nKevitt: My right leg was ripped off, about 20 pounds of flesh in 2 minutes, 20 broken bones. It was a hit and run. The guy that hit me never stopped and was never caught, so I was left in traffic lanes of the 5 freeway.\n\nBut his terrible accident put Kevitt on a journey toward advocacy for safer streets. Kevitt is the founder of the organization \u2018Streets Are For Everyone\u2019, S.A.F.E., and his job is as important as ever.\n\nFatalities have continued to rise since 2020 in the city of Los Angeles as well as the state. In fact, around 10% of the nation\u2019s traffic deaths occur in California. That statistic and others like it are probably what inspired California State Senator Scott Wiener to propose legislation that all cars should have speed governors that automatically prevent drivers from going more than 10 miles per hour above the speed limit.\n\nWhile that solution seems unlikely to pass through the legislature for the time being \u2014 Kevitt\u2019s organization has produced practical results towards the same goal.\n\nS.A.F.E\u2019s mission began when Kevitt was still in the hospital.\n\nKevitt: But after the doctor\u2019s left, I turned to my wife and my mom, who was there, and I said \u2018I\u2019m going to finish that bike ride that I started when I get out of the hospital... And once I was recovered enough we started with an event called Finish the Ride. And that was an awareness-raising event, it was an event focused on hit-and-runs and to raise awareness of and to try and make streets safer.\n\nS.A.F.E. made the Finish the Ride event an annual tradition and it will mark its 11th year this April.\n\nKevitt: The event was so successful that we ended up... I was asked by people, \u2018please don\u2019t stop, do more\u2019 and so I continued and that became the organization Streets Are for Everyone.\n\nKevitt\u2019s role as a leader in the fight against traffic violence remains as vital as ever.\n\nLate in 2023, 34-year-old mother of five Adriana Infante lost her eldest son Felipe to a hit and run in South LA.\n\nInfante: That day, he was going to school, he waited until the car stopped, he was crossing the street, he was almost done, and unfortunately, Arturo Mercado was on his phone watching TikTok videos and hit my son, flew him 14 feet, left him there...\n\nFelipe walked an hour every day to Fremont High School. His mom says he liked to sew and he was also a member of the Junior Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps. She says he hoped it would give him a secure future after high school.\n\nBut... that would never happen.\n\nInfante: He was in the hospital for a week and a half until they said they couldn\u2019t keep him in the machines no more, so they disconnected him because he couldn\u2019t pass the brain tests, so they declared him brain dead.\n\nInfante became involved with S.A.F.E. in the wake of her son\u2019s passing. She says she hopes activism against traffic violence will make streets safer for everyone. Especially children like her own.\n\nInfante: As you saw I have 5 other kids... so unfortunately, you know, I do work, I am a single mother, so I do have to work, sometimes, double shift. And as kids, they have to walk or be on their own, you know? It\u2019s always that on your head, you know, are they okay?\n\nAfter our interview, Adriana pointed me in the direction of a makeshift memorial to honor Felipe, just down the block from their home.\n\nHallinan: I\u2019m standing on the corner of 110th and Main Street, the location where Felipe Infante was struck and killed by a reckless driver. There\u2019s now a memorial here that marks his passing. It\u2019s a tire that\u2019s been painted white and chained to a street sign, with messages written on it. One says \u2018hit and run is not an accident\u2019 and in Felipe\u2019s case, it certainly wasn\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunately easy to see how Felipe was hit while crossing the street, as Main is a busy road where drivers are moving quickly, but there are no stop signs or traffic lights that obligate drivers to stop. While it may be a bit inconvenient for drivers, pedestrians would be much safer on this street if cars were required to stop at the intersection.\n\nTragic incidents like the one that ended Felipe\u2019s life prematurely unfortunately suggest we aren\u2019t likely to see an end to traffic violence soon. Especially since it doesn\u2019t have just one root cause, according to Kevitt.\n\nKevitt: And so we don\u2019t know exactly why it\u2019s gone up so much, I can\u2019t tell you exactly.. but we know this: We know that speeding is the primary factor. We know that speeding is the single largest thing that\u2019s driving collisions and fatalities.\n\nFor that reason, maybe Senator Wiener\u2019s speed bill will make a difference in the future, but in the meantime, S.A.F.E also played a key role in pushing through California\u2019s AB645 bill, which pilots speed cameras in school zones, known street racing circuits and high traffic-incident areas.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all it will take. Solving traffic violence will require faster action from those behind the wheel as well as those in power.\n\nKevitt: We need to actually treat it with the urgency that it deserves, with the funding that it deserves... You know, like, just do anything! We need to treat it as the public health crisis that it is, we\u2019re in the living wild, wild west right now in terms of road safety.\n```"}

Credit: Aadya Chidanand\n\nBy Jonathan Martin April 17, 2024 at 10:28 am PDT\n\nJackfruit, kale, basil are just some of the produce growing on several acres of land in the heart of Watts. Alicia Salmeron: That is one of the most robust Kales I have ever seen. It is on a lean yet it still produces, it tastes fabulous, it\u2019s super organic. Alicia Salmeron is showing me around Mudtown Farms. She\u2019s the manager and has been here for a few years. Salmeron: The kids love it, the parents love it, the generations that used to live here absolutely love it, they want to see more of it, they want more parks like this. Having over 120 fruit trees, 1.5 acres of fertile growing land that is almost self sustainable that is what this foundation is all about. Making sure there is food for the generations to come. And that\u2019s their goal. Making sure local residents don\u2019t have to worry about where to get fresh organic produce.\n\nSalmeron: During the winter seasons we can only feed about thirty people. In the warmer seasons we can feed up to ninety to one hundred. Because we do it weekly we have a system where they are only allowed to take so much so that everyone else can take some, otherwise one person can dominate it and there\u2019s not enough to go around.\n\nMud Town Gardens has been around for decades but it\u2019s gone through many changes. At one time buildings stood on this fruitful plot of land, but during the infamous Watts Riots in 1965, the buildings burnt down. Overtime, residents cleaned it up and turned it into a very rustic garden. Eventually, in 2005, the Watts Labor Community Action Committee bought the land and formally named it Mud Town Farms.\n\nReginald Simms: The name Mudtown came from the community of Watts. Reginald Simms has lived in Watts for the past 50 years. He\u2019s MudTown\u2019s groundskeeper and maintenance man. Simms: Before the city of Los Angeles came in an put streets and curbs in, everything was dirt so when it rained what did it turn into? So they called Watts Mudtown back in the day, it was in the 30s and 40s because there was no streets.\n\nSimms grew up in the Jordan Down Housing projects that sit adjacent to the farm. Simms: I was ten years old looking at this place in that window right there. My vision was what could this be. I wanted it to be a park area cause if the kids can\u2019t play and release all that energy you know what they gone do its gone get bottled up now when they release it they angry. And Simms\u2019 vision came to be. People from the neighborhood enjoy this green space all year round.\n\nJorge Escobar has lived in Watts for more than 30-years. Jorge Escobar: It\u2019s the first time that I am actually in the garden. SOT: I was having some anxiety, panic attacks and to be honest this has calmed me down and hopefully it doesn\u2019t get too populated cause I\u2019m the type that likes the city from a mile away.\n\nAnd he\u2019s not the only one. Oscar Rizo is a farmer at the garden and lives in the area, too. He works inside the greenhouse where he plants seedlings into trays. Jonathan Martin: What is your favorite area of Mudtown? Rizo: My favorite area is Zone C. Jonathan Martin: Should we check it out? Rizo: For sure. The reason why I love this place is because we literally walk out right here we work right here, so we are looking right in front of it the whole time. Oscar can see the entire farm from this area. Rizo: Its very peaceful, its like a safe haven. Outside of these gates its a lot of crazy stuff going on.\n\nAnd that\u2019s true. Many say this is a rough neighborhood. Watts is known more for its gang violence. In fact, this was the birthplace of high profile gangs, like the Crips and Bloods. But here, people find solace. Rizo: It has helped with my mental health for sure. I\u2019ve learned how interested I am in nature and how I truly love growing foods. One thing I want to do is bring more knowledge and teach our community how to grow their own foods in their backyards because you don\u2019t have to starve. Or as Ms. Alicia explains you can grow the food right here in the garden.\n\nSalmeron: Cause we do have resident plots in the back that they can actually have a full year growing cycle but a lot of people don\u2019t know about that. Or you can come to a class. Salmeron: So continuously engaging on the weekends for the community giving them what they want, they want classes, they want workshops, they want activities they want more food. Getting them here and getting our voices heard actually allows us to get the community here. And building a community is what Mudtowns Farms plans to do for generations to come.\n```"}

Previously performing at venues such as The Troubadour and The Greek Theatre, Ferrell will be returning to the stage Wednesday for an EP release show at the Moroccan Lounge. Ferrell\u2019s EP \u201cHasn\u2019t Even Started\u201d has six tracks including the previously released singles \u201cLife or Death,\u201d \u201cMissed Your Chance\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Talk to Me Like That.\u201d Aside from pursuing his full career as an artist, the 19-year-old is also a sophomore at USC studying acting.\n\nAnnenberg Media chatted with Ferrell about \u201cLife or Death\u201d and how the single relates to his other works. Full transcript has been edited for clarity. Note: This episode was recorded in February before the release of \u201cLife or Death.\u201d\n\nFerrell: My name is Magnus Ferrell. I\u2019m a sophomore at USC, my major is actually acting: BA in theater with an emphasis in acting is the full name. I\u2019m from here, LA. And my role in music, I guess, I\u2019m an artist, I do songwriting and singing stuff. And yeah, I think my goal is, I don\u2019t know, my goal is to just do this as a living and do the music stuff for a living and be able to live off that and only have to do that for the rest of my life. Obviously, a pretty lofty goal, but that\u2019s my goal.\n\nFerrell: Yeah, I first started just with music as early as five years old. That\u2019s when I started playing piano and then I got into jazz and songwriting when I was like 13. And then up through high school, I was in a jazz band and that\u2019s where I learned all my theory. And I continue to write music. And now I\u2019m here at USC, continuing to write music, and I\u2019m putting out a lot more stuff. Yeah.\n\nFerrell: Yeah, I always mentioned the jazz background, because it just gave me all the tools to be able to write the music and come up with the melodies and just the musical background that I have today. And it\u2019s \u2018cause when you learn jazz, you learn all these theory things, all these scales, all this stuff that was pretty trivial and boring. But then once you get it down, you kind of forget it all and then you just kind of hear stuff and play. And to be able to do that is \u2013 I\u2019m really lucky that I forced myself to do that and that I had people around me telling me to do that because as a result, I feel like I have an ability now that helps a lot. I think it makes the music I make more interesting because I\u2019m able to take as much or as little as I want from jazz, if that makes sense. And yeah, I\u2019m just really grateful for it.\n\nFerrell: During the pandemic, there was not much to do, obviously, and I remember I had just got like this mic and this interface. And for my birthday, my mom had gotten me Logic, which is a producing software basically. And there was one day where I went to my room and I just started messing with stuff and making music that was not very good. But I was in there for what I thought was like two hours, but it ended up being like six or seven hours and I didn\u2019t even notice that the time had gone by that fast. I just kind of sat there and was like, \u2018Hmm, if I can really sit there for that long and just do this stuff and let time fly by then I think it\u2019s something that I like.\u2019\n\nFerrell: My musical inspirations, they\u2019ve obviously evolved over time. And I mean, everybody takes musical inspiration \u2013 like everything\u2019s always cycling through. When I was in my jazz phase, I guess, I was transcribing stuff, so there was a lot of like Miles Davis and Oscar Peterson and those guys and then that turned into like indie-pop guys or more just indie and alternative in general like Bruno Major. And then most recently has then evolved into noticing intricacies of the music of like Silk Sonic and Bruno Mars and Harry Styles and Ruel. It just evolves over time as I paid attention to different styles I guess.\n\nFerrell: I love performing. I think that\u2019s the best part about this whole thing is being able to affect a crowd and change the mood of a room just by your art and how much it affects someone. I don\u2019t know. I think performing, I\u2019ve discovered that I like to be just kind of fun and almost flamboyant a little bit. And so, I\u2019ve taken that and tried to just insert that into, I guess, my brand and how I would want people to see me on stage is what I\u2019m trying to portray on social media, through my music, through whatever people see.\n\nFerrell: One of my best memories, I remember, going back to my jazz piano days, I was really frustrated with it at first. And I didn\u2019t like it for a long time because it was hard and, you know, people don\u2019t like when things are hard. And I just remember struggling for such a long time with the theory and all the scales. And then one day it finally like \u2013 I just remember this one day where it finally clicked. And I found something that I could really mess around with. I think it was some chord and I just remember I was like, \u2018Oh my god, this is cool. I\u2019m gonna continue to roll with this. If I just keep working a little bit harder, I\u2019ll be able to find more discoveries.\u2019 So it was just this one moment, I was like 14 at the piano. That\u2019s kinda it.\n\nFerrell: [The] biggest challenge has been just finding your sound and finding something that\u2019s unique. With social media, it\u2019s like, you can basically find anything you want. And to be able to find something that is 1) relatable and 2) different is pretty hard to do. I\u2019ve found that for me, I guess, my most unique and I guess most relatable sound is when I\u2019m making stuff I love to make. And yeah, but it\u2019s been pretty hard to figure that out.\n\nFerrell: There\u2019s a lot of music that is old, that I think doesn\u2019t really represent accurately what I\u2019m doing now and what I quite frankly want people to hear and see what I\u2019m doing. So who knows, maybe I re-release them, but I just thought that it wasn\u2019t an accurate representation of the sound that I wanted. And some of those songs were also attempts to try and cater to audiences, which I\u2019ve completely flipped that philosophy now of like, I just make stuff that I like, and you\u2019ll find an audience. Rather than trying to look for \u2013 like, trying to make a song for that audience, if that makes sense. So yeah, I\u2019m just putting out stuff that I love to make and that I\u2019m passionate about because if I\u2019m passionate about it, then I have emotion and then it\u2019s a good song in my eyes at least.\n\nFerrell: My roommate, Gabe [Yaron], he\u2019s a big producer. And I met him in high school through the jazz band stuff and we started working on stuff just for fun when we were like 15. And that\u2019s developed into making stuff that we just really like and have a good time with. And so yeah, it was just another one of those songs that we made. It\u2019s just about, I don\u2019t know, finding a connection with someone, but then also staying in the moment and not rushing things and still being able to have a good time with that person you like, without it having a label, without it having any pressure. So that\u2019s the gist of the song.\n\nFerrell: I guess the whole idea is like, I wish right now in this moment in time, I could speed up the process and make myself feel a certain way, like make myself fall in love. But I can\u2019t do that. I also don\u2019t want to say yeah, I feel so strongly right now and then later find out I don\u2019t and then let that person down if that makes sense. Yeah, just wishing that you could feel more in that moment in time. But that\u2019s just not how people work.\n\nFerrell: I was doing the dishes. He was playing the guitar in the other room and he was playing those chords. So that melody of the [mimics the melody], that came in my head as I was doing the dishes and so I stopped doing the dishes. I walked in, I was singing to him, that melody. He kind of looked at me like, \u2018Oh wait, this is kind of cool.\u2019 Then we went to the balcony and for an hour, we just got a rough verse, chorus and bridge melody and then a couple days later, we then went into his home studio at his house. Yeah, and then we just cranked it out and finished it there. That was kind of the process.\n\nFerrell: Yeah, it\u2019s all it\u2019s always gonna be real-life experiences that I\u2019m having or Gabe\u2019s having or whoever I\u2019m writing with is having, always. I mean it\u2019s fun because it motivates you to, one, have more life experiences. Don\u2019t be afraid to get yourself hurt. Don\u2019t go looking to get yourself hurt, but when stuff happens, stuff happens. And it\u2019s just for me and for a weird group of people, we all find it as an opportunity to write about those emotions. And it\u2019s really like a therapy. And I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like a great loop where it\u2019s like, okay, go out and experience stuff. Go feel stuff, come back. If you feel strongly about something good, bad, in the middle, go write about it. And then you have a new song. And then repeat the process.\n\nFerrell: It\u2019s hard to pull like a specific lyric because I think the whole song for me encapsulates what I was feeling at the moment in time well. I\u2019d say my favorite part is the bridge, which is where I\u2019m just repeating that one line it\u2019s like, \u2018Come with me and tell me you want me / We\u2019ll kiss in the backseat...\u2019 And we kept looping that until it just builds. I just really like how it blossoms and it has a bunch of background vocals. And they\u2019re all funky too. They\u2019re weird sounding. It\u2019s a weird-sounding chord when it all comes together. And I think that it\u2019s just very powerful to me at least, and you know, I hope it resonates with other people, obviously.\n\nFerrell: Oh my god, that screen. That\u2019s a mistake. Literally a mistake. I thought I did bad. And I scream in the mic and Gabe looks at me like, \u2018Okay, we\u2019re keeping that.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018No.\u2019 I thought he was joking. And he just kept it. So that\u2019s the scream at the end. And it\u2019s at the end so, you actually have to listen to the whole song to hear it.\n\nFerrell: The more recent stuff is gonna have a narrative. From \u201cDrinks on Me,\u201d \u201cMissed Your Chance,\u201d all this stuff is, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s really just experiencing life while being still young. I mean, I\u2019m only 19. So it\u2019s just a display of being super present, and trying to stay present and talking about feelings in different moments. And not really I don\u2019t know \u2013 like taking risks and not really committing to one thing and just experiencing stuff. And I think that\u2019s the best narrative I can give you is just experiencing stuff while still being young, and you have so much life to live and there\u2019s no need to solidify certain decisions right now, if that makes sense.\n\nFerrell: I mean, the stuff that I most recently put out like \u201cMissed Your Chance\u201d and then this one coming out is obviously more upbeat and just kind of vibey I guess, more R&B, and that\u2019s gonna continue to be the theme. But, I am intending and I\u2019ve been working on a lot of stuff that\u2019s way more emotional. And I mean, it\u2019s all emotional, but it\u2019s more, I guess, heartfelt, and I have definitely a deeper connection to it because it\u2019s real, raw stuff. Definitely in the future, there\u2019s gonna be more ballad-y stuff.\n\nFerrell: Yeah, I just try and make sure I\u2019m just honest with myself and honest with the people around me. I\u2019m lucky to have good friends and people that I\u2019m comfortable with sharing my opinion, nicely, obviously. And I just make sure that all this stuff feels like it\u2019s me. And all this stuff feels like it could be performed onstage and have that same vibe. And it\u2019s all stuff that I\u2019m thinking like, \u2018Okay, if I had a favorite artist. Would I wear these types of clothes? Would I like this type of vibe? Would I like the music video if it looked like this?\u2019 And if I do, then I roll with it. And as long as it\u2019s just accurately representing the message I want to send and the artistry I want to show.\n\nFerrell: So I\u2019m still kind of staggered, I feel like my music has progressed a little bit more than, I guess, my acting, just journey. And, yeah, it is something I do want to get back into, which is why my major is my major \u2018cause I felt like it was way easier to do the music stuff outside of school than to do the music stuff in school and then not do any acting or be running around doing auditions when I probably wasn\u2019t ready yet. But yeah, I think the acting stuff would come off of hopefully the success of the music. Kind of like how Childish Gambino, Donald Glover does, what he does and how he does that. I think that\u2019s really inspiring. And that\u2019s something that is definitely something I\u2019m interested in. So we\u2019ll see where that goes, but yeah.\n\nFerrell: My realistic goal for the year is just to put out as much music or the most music that I\u2019ve ever put out. That\u2019s my goal. And so through your intuition, you could probably guess that there\u2019s gonna be more stuff beyond the EP this year. Yeah, and we\u2019re just gonna see where that takes us. It can be very unpredictable, in good ways and bad ways in the music world, so I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see. Hopefully, good stuff.\n\nFerrell: Oh, I\u2019m gonna sound like such an ass. Sorry, if I swore, but so when I went to Coachella, my senior year of high school. I went with a bunch of buddies. And I just remember being mad because I wasn\u2019t on the stage. And that was a moment of like, \u2018Oh, I really want this if I am mad watching incredibly talented artists in the crowd.\u2019 And it was such a privilege to be there. And yeah, that was my moment of like, \u2018Man, I want to be on that stage.\u2019 But in general, I want to be doing the biggest shows I can be doing. And you know, I want to be putting out music. I want to be the best. And you know, I just really want it. If that\u2019s gonna happen, we\u2019ll see. But, yeah, that\u2019s my goal. Oh, also, I want to play in the celebrity NBA All-Star game. That\u2019s what I wanna do.\n\nFerrell: What\u2019s fulfilling about it is that, for me, it\u2019s been there and it\u2019s been there to help me through whenever I\u2019ve been sad, wherever I\u2019ve been feeling pain in whatever sort of way. It\u2019s there and it\u2019s like a therapy. I know, I said that before, but it really is truly a therapy. And that\u2019s the most fulfilling part. Actually, that\u2019s one of the most fulfilling parts. The other most fulfilling part is to be able to affect a room of people. And if you do it in the best way possible, if you\u2019re good at it, the goal is to like if you\u2019re singing a song that made you cry when writing it, you\u2019re gonna make the whole room cry if you\u2019re good at it. If you made a song that made you so happy and made you elated, you\u2019re gonna make the whole room happy. And so that\u2019s the most fulfilling part and I think that\u2019s the ultimate goal is to make people feel what you felt when writing it or making it so yeah.\n```"}

(Owen Humphreys/PA via AP)\n\nBy Marco Haynes April 16, 2024 at 7:01 pm PDT\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d is a column by Marco Haynes about the English Premier League in which he breaks down the week\u2019s three most consequential results.\n\nVilla\u2019s late goals deal a major blow to Arsenal in the title race\n\nArsenal squandered an opportunity to go top of the Premier League in a 2-0 defeat to Aston Villa at the Emirates Stadium. The first half unfolded with Arteta setting up an attacking Arsenal lineup, only to miss 14 shots against a defensive-minded Villa side that was content to wait for counter-attacking opportunities. Despite the team\u2019s offensive malaise, the Gunners\u2019 defense had some luck in the 38th minute, watching Aston Villa forward Ollie Watkins inside-the-box strike hit the left post. The ball spiraled across an open net, only to bounce out of bounds.\n\nIn the second half, Arsenal\u2019s tempo dropped, which allowed Aston Villa to grow into the game, although it took until the 84th minute for ex-Arsenal manager Unai Emery to punish his former team. Substitute Leon Bailey hit a side-footed effort at the far post coming off Lucas Digne\u2019s low cross from the left-corner to give the away side the lead. Just two minutes later, it got worse for the Gunners. Watkins pounced on a defensive mishap and latched onto Youri Tielemans\u2019 cross-field pass, before shrugging off Emile Smith Rowe in the penalty box and chipping the ball over goalkeeper David Raya to seal the victory.\n\nArsenal suffered its first defeat in 2024, having not lost since New Year\u2019s Eve \u2014 a 2-1 defeat to Fulham. With this result, the club dropped to second in the table, two points behind the new league-leaders Manchester City. Arsenal have now failed to score in two of their last four Premier League matches. The team has only gone goalless three times in 32 Premier League matches this season. Arsenal will play Wolves next at the Molineux Stadium on Saturday.\n\nAston Villa have done the double for the third time over Arsenal in the Premier League era, previously winning 1-0 this season at Villa Park in December. They remain in fourth place, three points ahead of Champions League-chasers Tottenham. Watkins also scored his 19th goal of the Premier League season, the joint-most ever scored in a single campaign for the Villians in the league alongside former striker Christian Benteke, who scored 19 goals in the 2012-13 season. Aston Villa return to Villa Park to face Bournemouth on Sunday.\n\nNewcastle\u2019s Isak\u2019s brace punish a dismal Tottenham defense\n\nThe Magpies thrashed a lackluster Tottenham team 4-0 at St. James Park, resulting in the heaviest defeat of Ange Postecoglou\u2019s Spurs tenure. During the first half, forward Alexander Isak cut inside of centerback Micky van de Ven, dropping him to the ground. Isak then fired a shot into the bottom left beyond Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario to go in front. It took just over a minute for Newcastle to double their lead via Gordon, who pounced on Pedro Porro\u2019s awful back-pass inside the penalty box. The English international dribbled past Van de Ven to then curl a shot into the right corner of the net.\n\nIn the second half, Isak blew any chance of a Spurs comeback. The Swede ran onto a through ball from Bruno Guimaraes behind the Spurs\u2019 defense then calmly slotted the ball into the bottom right corner. The celebrations continued for the Magpies in the 85th minute, as defender Fabien Schar\u2019s towering header at the far left post completed a masterful 4-0 winning performance.\n\nA magnificent Newcastle display kept them in the race for European qualification, moving up to sixth place on 50 points and having won their last three Premier League games. The Magpies have recorded 36 points at home this Premier League season, something only Liverpool (42), Arsenal (38) and Manchester City (38) have bested. It was the perfect day for Swedish striker Isak, netting his 17th goal in the Premier League \u2014 the joint-most by a Swedish player in the single Premier League campaign alongside now-retired striker Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 in 2016-17 with Manchester United. He is the fourth Newcastle player in Premier League history to score in six consecutive league home matches.\n\nThe Magpies return on April 24 in the Premier League, traveling to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace. Spurs dropped into fifth place, moving out of a Champions League position and are now three points behind Aston Villa. Bizarrely, Tottenham\u2019s last three defeats by four or more goals have all happened against Newcastle at St. James Park, which also included 5-1 and 6-1 losses in May 2016 and in April 2023, respectively. Tottenham will look to rebound from this heavy defeat in a North London Derby matchup against Arsenal on April 28.\n\nTwo goals from captain Bruno Fernandes rescue a draw for United\n\nVAR overturned a late penalty decision for Bournemouth to leave the match settled at a 2-2 draw, meaning the Cherries shared a point with Manchester United at the Vitality Stadium. In the 16th minute, striker Dominic Solanke capitalized on 19-year-old United centerback Willy Kambwala\u2019s slip, slotting a low-driven shot into the bottom left corner of the net from the edge of the penalty box. United fought back for an equalizer for about 15 minutes, before midfielder Bruno Fernandes smashed a shot into the roof of the net. The goal was set up by a rebound off Cherries centerback Illia Zabarnyi\u2019s foot in his attempt to block Alejandro Garnacho\u2019s cutback.\n\nHowever, just six minutes later, United\u2019s joys were squashed, and the Red Devils found themselves behind again. Bournemouth winger Justin Kluivert\u2019s low shot into goalkeeper Andre Onana\u2019s near-post put his side up 2-1 after United left him an abundant amount of space in which to operate.\n\nIn the second half, Bournemouth was in control until a harsh VAR decision awarded United a penalty, judging that fullback Adam Smith had committed a handball by brushing the ball with his shoulder. Fernandes converted his spot kick into the bottom right of the net to make the score 2-2.\n\nThere was further drama late in the game, as one final Cherries attack led by Ryan Christie saw the Scottish winger tripped by Kambwala, believing he had won his side a penalty in stoppage time. VAR overturned the decision, with replays showing the foul had occurred mere inches outside the 18-yard box.\n\nThe draw moved United down to seventh in the table and without a win in the club\u2019s last seven Premier League games. In their last eight away Premier League matches, the Red Devils have conceded 17 goals in total. Fernandes\u2019 two goals against the Cherries means he is now United\u2019s top goalscorer in the Premier League this season with a tally of eight. The Portuguese\u2019s equalizer also meant he has either scored or assisted 90 league goals since joining the club in 2020 \u2014 an impressive record.\n\nThe Red Devils play Sheffield United at Old Trafford on April 24 in the Premier League. Disappointed with two debatable VAR decisions, the Cherries can at least remain positive about staying unbeaten against United in both league matches this season \u2014 Bournemouth also won the reverse fixture 3-0 at Old Trafford in December. They now sit at 13th in the league, on course for a comfortable mid-table finish at the end of the season.\n\nThe Englishman Solanke has now set a record for most goals scored by a Bournemouth player in a single top-flight season with 17, beating Joshua King\u2019s previous total of 16 goals in the 2016-17 Premier League campaign. The Cherries will face Aston Villa traveling to Villa Park on Sunday.\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Asna Tabassum)\n\nBy Quinten Seghers, Vishu Reddy, Nathan Elias, Joseph Domingot, Malieya Pittman, and Dylan Luden April 16, 2024 at 6:48 pm PDT\n\nUSC\u2019s decision to bar valedictorian Asna Tabassum from delivering her commencement speech, announced Monday, became national news overnight \u2014 sparking petitions, letters and intense debate on campus and beyond. Tabassum, a pro-Palestinian student, was scheduled to give a speech on commencement day, but after the announcement of her selection as valedictorian, some groups like Trojans for Israel claimed a link in her Instagram bio contained \u201cantisemitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s Provost Andrew T. Guzman notified students and faculty of the University\u2019s decision to cancel her speech in a campus-wide email Monday afternoon, citing safety concerns. \u201cThis decision is not only necessary to maintain the safety of our campus and students, but is consistent with the fundamental legal obligation \u2013 including the expectations of federal regulators \u2013 that universities act to protect students and keep our campus community safe,\u201d Guzman wrote in the email.\n\nTabassum will graduate next month with a major in biomedical engineering and a minor in resistance to genocide. Tabassum is heavily involved in the USC community, having been involved with Los Angeles Community Impact, USC Mobile Clinic, and co-founding Blueprints for Pangaea \u2014 a USC organization that distributes medical supplies from USC\u2019s medical school to places in need worldwide.\n\nTabassum released a statement Monday saying the university \u201cabandoned\u201d her. In an interview with CNN Tuesday, Tabassum said she\u2019s expecting and hoping to be reinstated to speak at commencement. \u201cAlthough this should have been a time of celebration for my family, friends, professors, and classmates, anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian voices have subjected me to a campaign of racist hatred because of my uncompromising belief in human rights for all,\u201d Tabassum wrote in her original statement from Monday.\n\nMany student groups at USC have spoken out against the decision to revoke Tabassum\u2019s valedictorian speech through statements on social media, including a letter sent to Annenberg Media. \u201cWhen you are silencing her, you are silencing all of us,\u201d reads the letter signed by over 30 campus and community-affiliated organizations. \u201cWhen USC uses the rhetoric of safety to justify its decision while refusing to provide safety measures to a threatened student, we know it means the safety of USC receiving donations, not the safety of its students.\u201d\n\nJewish Voice for Peace, a USC student group \u201corganizing towards Palestinian liberation and Judaism beyond Zionism,\u201d signed onto the joint letter in support of Tabassum, and they also released their own statement through Instagram. \u201cAs members of JVP, we are disgusted that USC put her in this position, didn\u2019t protect her, and then allowed her to be harassed by multiple organizations who aren\u2019t even affiliated with a school that operate outside of the school,\u201d said Bea Heard, a member of JVP USC.\n\nTrojans for Israel \u2014 a \u201cbipartisan advocacy group committed to strengthening the US-Israel relationship\u201d according to their Instagram \u2014 posted a statement Thursday stating Tabassum \u201copenly traffics antisemitism and anti-Zionist rhetoric\u201d and asked the university to reconsider their selection for valedictorian. USC Chabad also released a statement on Instagram in which they expressed concern over the statement from the Office of the Provost. \u201c[USC] released a statement that the valedictorian would not be speaking due to security concerns,\u201d reads the Chabad statement. \u201c[USC\u2019s] statement says nothing about the sentiments expressed, nor about the fact that those sentiments continue to be featured on her social media.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Annenberg Media, Erroll G. Southers, the associate senior vice president for safety and risk assurance at USC, doubled down on the university\u2019s stance. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had anybody or any group of people express grievances with anyone who is going to be at commencement. And we\u2019ve certainly not had the volume that we\u2019ve had here,\u201d Southers said. \u201cIt was not just about our valedictorian\u2019s safety and her family\u2019s safety, but it\u2019s the 70,000 people that come to campus for commencement.\u201d\n\nStudents at USC shared feelings of disappointment and disbelief in light of the university\u2019s decision to cancel Tabassum\u2019s speech. \u201cI feel embarrassed being a USC student,\u201d said Rachita Jai, a sophomore studying economics and data science. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you can strip something like that away from someone who\u2019s worked so hard and done so much and contributed so much to USC. She deserves the opportunity to speak, and it\u2019s unfair for the university to say that they stand by free speech while they\u2019re taking away that opportunity from her.\u201d\n\nAnnenberg Media spoke to a friend of Tabassum, also a senior majoring in biomedical engineering, who requested her name not be used for her family\u2019s safety. She said Tabassum first put the link on her Instagram bio, which is filled with references to additional books, documentaries and websites to learn more about Palestine, about five years ago. \u201cShe is not a person that is antisemitic in any way,\u201d the friend said. \u201cA lot of people are conflating anti-Zionism with antisemitism, and they\u2019re not the same thing. I feel like there\u2019s been a lot of nuance that has been lost, and a lot of nuance can be lost over social media because you can\u2019t have these conversations if someone isn\u2019t willing to sit down and listen.\u201d\n\nTabassum was named valedictorian for the Class of 2024 by Guzman in early April among the 200 eligible seniors. The Valedictorian and Salutatorian Selection Committee evaluated nearly 100 applications. After recommendations from the committee, the Provost ultimately decided on Tabassum. Guzman wrote in the email that the valedictorian vetting process did not include social media presence.\n\nIvana Giang, USC\u2019s 2019 valedictorian, told Annenberg Media that the decision to remove her as commencement speaker is a mistake that embarrasses the university and alumni. \u201cThe administration is in the wrong to try and take away the voice of its most accomplished undergraduate, the faculty who selected her, and all of the classmates and community members who have poured out their support for her since the decision was announced,\u201d Giang wrote in a statement to Annenberg Media.\n\nJody Armour, a USC law professor, said private discrimination and private sanctions on free speech perpetuates social inequities as much as government restrictions on free speech. He also referenced the Controversial Speakers webpage on USC\u2019s official website, which states \u201cthe First Amendment does not protect what is referred to as the \u2018heckler\u2019s veto,\u2019\u201d or shutting down speech because other people don\u2019t like the message. \u201cThis is what an actual heckler\u2019s veto looks like,\u201d Armour said. \u201cThat is pre-emptively shutting down speech because of unnamed security concerns. It makes it very easy for hate campaigns to silence people on our campus.\u201d\n\nGuzman wrote in the email announcement that this situation has nothing to do with freedom of speech and that \u201cthere is no free-speech entitlement to speak at a commencement.\u201d The Controversial Speakers page reads, \u201cIt would undermine academic freedom and set a troubling precedent if the university were to begin prohibiting certain individuals (but not others) from speaking simply because their ideologies or points of view were deemed controversial.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis unprecedented decision, at the end of the day, didn\u2019t really strike me as something that keeps us safe,\u201d Armour said. \u201cIt only emboldens bigotry. It\u2019s not something that I think makes us necessarily safer, and it\u2019s certainly not something that makes a clear statement of who we are, what values we\u2019re willing to stand for, how we\u2019re willing to be as brave as that Tommy Trojan statue standing out there.\u201d\n\nTabassum\u2019s friend said the University cited security concerns for canceling her speech, yet they are \u201cnot providing her the security she needs.\u201d \u201cI would love to hear Asna speak,\u201d Tabassum\u2019s friend said. \u201cShe\u2019s an incredible speaker and incredible person, and I think she can offer a lot of wisdom to the USC community ... It\u2019s been a real privilege getting to be friends with her these past four years and just get to hang out and have a ton of fun. And I think people don\u2019t tend to see the humanity in a person when things like this are going on.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of FAFSA)\n\nBy Heli Ruiz\nApril 16, 2024 at 6:17 pm PDT\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Education, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) was updated for the 2024-2025 academic year to improve the application process and reduce frustration for future college students. For some, the new application has proven to be the opposite.\n\nThe updated application was initially slated to be released to students on October 1, 2023, but it was delayed multiple times due to glitches and maintenance periods. The site wasn\u2019t officially opened to students until the early weeks of January. However, the new application led to a variety of issues for its student applicants.\n\nSpecifically, a new change in the FAFSA application requires parents to create their own accounts and provide a valid social security number alongside it, which disproportionately impacts first-generation college students.\n\n\u201c[The new changes] basically stopped me from being able to actually submit my FAFSA for basically three months ever since January,\u201d said Erik, a sophomore majoring in the business of cinematic arts whose last name has been withheld by Annenberg Media for protective reasons.\n\nAs a first-generation college student, Erik said the biggest obstacle in completing the FAFSA was the valid social security number requirement. \u201cI had to submit the paper incorrectly at first because of the social security issues. And even when the corrections were up, I still had to wait an extra week to even get in my corrections. So it\u2019s been a lot of waiting.\u201d\n\nDavid, whose last name has also been withheld for protective reasons, is another first-generation college student and a sophomore majoring in real estate. He also said that the social security portion of the application made the process more complicated.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely very stressful, not just for me but also for my parents...it\u2019s a very stressful thing to have to worry about your kid if they\u2019re going to be able to come back [to school] the next year,\u201d David said.\n\nDavid and Erik searched online to see whether anyone else was experiencing similar issues and to determine what else could be done. Both concluded that there were no workarounds, with David saying that \u201ceveryone was in the same spot.\u201d\n\nDaniel Coleman, a worker for USC\u2019s Financial Aid\u2019s Student Services Contact Center, said that students with concerns over the new FAFSA application have had questions all year. \u201cThey\u2019ve been only ramping up in intensity, kind of following our deadlines,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the lobby, I\u2019ve had about six to eight students who\u2019ve asked about the FAFSA,\u201d said Coleman. \u201cOver the phone, it\u2019s been easily over a dozen today.\u201d\n\nColeman also noted that the most prominent issue has been with \u201cparent verification and social security number verification for students whose parents don\u2019t have a social [security number]\u201d\n\nAccording to Coleman, USC has been doing its best with the issues the new FAFSA application has raised, but emphasized that the delay is \u201con a systemic level that we haven\u2019t really seen before.\u201d\n\nColeman clarified that his opinions are his own and do not represent his department.\n```"}

She specified that the initiative focuses on preventing homelessness instead of hiding or merely managing the issue. \u201cWe will end homelessness with a new strategy and a new system that urgently lifts people from the street and surrounds them with the support and housing that they need to never go back to the streets,\u201d Bass said.\n\nThe program provides housing for the unhoused and consists of four steps: outreach, connection, move-in day and housing. According to Bass, Inside Safe has taken thousands off the streets since its implementation.\n\nResponding to criticism about the initiative, Bass said that \u201cit is far, far more expensive to leave people unhoused on our streets.\u201d According to Bass, calls to fire departments, paramedics and police as a result of homelessness are costly for the city. \u201cI just will not accept this, and our city can\u2019t afford to accept it,\u201d Bass said.\n\nIn addition, Bass said that Inside Safe is seeking donations from the private sector and that she will be introducing a new campaign called \u201cLA for LA,\u201d which will use private funding to acquire property, lower capital costs and speed up the housing process for unhoused individuals.\n\nThe 2028 Olympics and 2026 World Cup\nLos Angeles is set to host the Olympic Games in 2028 and will hold eight World Cup matches in 2026. These two events will put an international spotlight on Los Angeles and make way for major economic developments within the city, according to Bass. \u201cThe Olympics are about opportunity and that opportunity begins now,\u201d Bass said, explaining that the games will bring more than five million visitors and billions of dollars. \u201cMy administration will create a focused initiative to make sure that the games will mean hundreds of small businesses winning contracts and hiring Angelenos.\u201d\n\nBass believes that the World Cup and the Olympics will also allow Los Angeles to change negative preconceptions about the city. \u201cI want the world to see all levels of government joining forces, locking arms and actually working together,\u201d she said.\n\nPublic transportation\nDuring her speech, Bass also discussed concerns about the safety of public transportation in Los Angeles. \u201cWe want the world to see that Los Angeles is now the number two transit city in the country because riders are seeing that we are changing Metro\u2019s approach to safety, cleanliness, and customer service,\u201d Bass said. She said that investment in new tracks, safety and other changes to the city\u2019s transportation system will create a more connected city.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Adrian Kraus)\n\nBy Terence Holton April 16, 2024 at 4:37 pm PDT\n\nYes, the college basketball season ended just one week ago, but a too-early ranking is just the thing to power you through until next season. Be wary, though: in the new era of the transfer portal, these lists can change drastically from now to November.\n\n1. Duke\nThe Blue Devils are, per usual, at the top of the recruiting class rankings, sitting at No. 1 in the 247 ranking for the class of 2024. With four five-star recruits, including No.1 Cooper Flagg and No. 3 Khaman Maluach, Duke has easily the most loaded incoming freshman class in the country. Duke just made its first deep tournament run under head coach Jon Scheyer, going all the way to the Elite Eight before bowing out to 11-seed NC State. While last year\u2019s Blue Devil squad was incredibly talented, next year\u2019s may be even better. That\u2019s why, for the second year in a row, they are my too-early No.1 team.\n\n2. Kansas\nKansas never has two down years in a row. Head coach Bill Self will return with two of his leaders in juniors Dajuan Harris and K.J. Adams, as well as a stellar recruiting class and solid transfers. It will be hard to doubt the Jayhawks again. The Jayhawks\u2019 recruiting is fantastic, but Self is more the reason Kansas lands at No. 2. The Jayhawks dealt with a horrible string of injuries down the stretch of the season and are the main reason Gonzaga was able to blow Kansas out in the second round. Doubting Self is a terrible idea, and the Jayhawks have nowhere to go but up.\n\n3. Gonzaga\nGonzaga *sigh* is back. The Zags are likely returning four of five starters, as well as adding a quality scorer in a Pepperdine transfer, junior guard Michael Ajayi, who averaged 17 points for the Waves last season. Head coach Mark Few consistently puts together teams that make deep tournament runs, and the consensus is that Gonzaga is likely to return to its national dominance. With the Zags consistently easy conference schedule, it will be interesting to see if Oregon State and Washington State can spice up the West Coast Conference a bit, but Gonzaga will likely dominate.\n\n4. Iowa State\nIowa State has consistently had one of, if not the best, defenses in the country, and that will 100% carry over to next season. Head coach T.J. Oltzerberg\u2019s brand of basketball is some of my favorite to watch in the country. There just aren\u2019t enough teams who play hard-nosed defensive basketball anymore. Iowa State will return three of its five starters and will also bring in two double-digit scoring transfers in junior guard Nate Heise (Northern Iowa) and sophomore center Dishon Jackson (Charlotte). Overall, Iowa State will likely have one of the best starting lineups in college basketball, and the tough defense will make the Cyclones a contender yet again.\n\n5. Houston\nIn just its first year in arguably the best basketball conference in the country, the Houston Cougars dominated the Big 12 regular season and made the Big 12 championship game. Now, Houston is prepping for yet another dominant year. The Cougars are another team that I love watching run up and down. This team also plays rough and tumble basketball, which is so awesome to watch in this day and age of high-scoring college hoops. Head coach Jerome Sampson coaches physicality and great conditioning \u2014 a great formula for winning games. Sampson has not made a deep tournament run since 2021, but with much of his team returning, the Cougars are gearing up to possibly dominate the Big 12 once again. It feels like I\u2019m just drumming my fingers waiting for next season, and it is only 28 weeks until November!\n```"}

(Photo by Robert Westermann)\n\nBy Sammie Yen April 16, 2024 at 4:34 pm PDT\n\nThe star-studded 2024 WNBA draft generated national excitement like none other. USC\u2019s very own McKenzie Forbes and Kaitlyn Davis gave cardinal-and-gold fans something to cheer about, becoming the 17th and 18th Trojans to be drafted to the WNBA. It was only fitting for USC alumna and basketball legend Cheryl Miller to make the announcement: \u201cThe L.A. Sparks, with the 28th pick, select McKenzie Forbes from USC.\u201d Davis\u2019s name was also called in the third round as the 35th overall pick by the New York Liberty. With the Liberty\u2019s location in Brooklyn, Davis is only a Brooklyn Bridge away from her alma mater, Columbia University, where she clinched a league championship her senior year.\n\nThis is the fourth time that Southern California has successfully sent a pair to the women\u2019s draft. Just last year, graduates Okaka Adika and Kadi Sissoko were successive third-round selections, going to Liberty and Phoenix Mercury, respectively. Forbes and Davis completed their final year of NCAA eligibility with a lucrative farewell to the USC program. Both graduate transfers were instrumental to USC\u2019s success. Not only did the Trojans take the Pac-12 Tournament championship, but they also earned a No. 1 seed in March Madness, reaching the Elite Eight for the first time since 1994.\n\nForbes earned Pac-12 Tournament MVP honors after a 26-point performance to upset Stanford. With a career-best 14.3 points per game, she was an important second scoring option for USC alongside freshman guard JuJu Watkins. When her impact isn\u2019t always evident in the box score, it\u2019s through her voice. Forbes commands the court and demands excellence of herself and her teammates.\n\nDavis also exuded leadership the past season, bringing balance to the court. She plays with passion and control, grace and ferocity. Davis\u2019s steadiness anchored the Trojans in crunch time. She was most effective around the rim on both ends of the court, averaging 5.8 rebounds per game.\n\nDrafting Forbes and Davis is a major nod of recognition to their effects on the game. While the WNBA\u2019s limited roster spots will make it tough for them to see an opening game day, they were undoubtedly chosen for a broad skill set. Overall, the 2024 rookie class, in its incredible depth, is unlike any other before.\n\nFollowing record-breaking viewership of the women\u2019s collegiate tournament, all eyes immediately turned to the professional stage, which placed the talented incoming class in the limelight. The ESPN live stream reached a peak of 2.4 million spectators, an over 400% increase from the 572,000 viewers during the 2023 WNBA draft.\n\nThe first overall pick was not a difficult question. The Indiana Fever easily and gladly answered with Iowa guard Caitlin Clark. Clark\u2019s achievements exceed measurement. You could glance at the numbers and see her NCAA record-breaking 3,951 points. You could see her packed trophy case, which includes back-to-back National Player of the Year honors. You could even quantify the distance of her long-range signature shot, a whopping 30 feet away from the iron.\n\nThe most impressive feat that Clark boasts is beyond individual accomplishment. Her past couple seasons sparked widespread and intense engagement in women\u2019s basketball. She has transformed the nation\u2019s relationship and connection with the sport. Clark will decidedly remain a Midwest machine.\n\nOther selections included Defensive Player of the Year Cameron Brink and reigning NCAA champion Kamilla Cardoso. The No. 2 overall pick, Brink, will go down south in the Golden State to play for the L.A. Sparks, and Cardoso took the third spot for Chicago Sky. In the Windy City, Cardoso is joined by LSU alumna Angel Reese, the No. 7 overall pick. The two teammates were previously fierce competitors, as seen in the 2024 SEC Championship.\n\nNeedless to say, the WNBA will benefit from national intrigue in this particular year of college-to-pro transition.\n```"}

At this time, authorities have not named any suspects. However, an FBI press relations representative told Annenberg Media \u201cthe FBI and LAPD are conducting a joint investigation to determine the person or group responsible for a [multi-million dollar] theft that occurred at a building in the city of Sylmar on Sunday, March 31st.\u201d\n\nLAPD Commander Elaine Morales told the Los Angeles Times that the burglars successfully breached the building and vault Sunday night. The robbery went unnoticed until Monday morning when facility operators opened the safe. The robbery seemed so flawless that USC professor Suzanne Lynch says insiders at GardaWorld could be involved. Lynch, who worked in corporate crime investigations for 30 years, says companies like GardaWorld will look to their employees for evidence of any insider activity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sophisticated team effort with potential insiders, as well as a very sophisticated outside crew that would do things like breaking in through the roof,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cI think there was quite an interesting organization that was put together to do this.\u201d\n\nGardaWorld has a track record of misplacing large sums of money. The Tampa Bay Times conducted an investigation in 2020 that uncovered millions of dollars had gone missing from company vaults. Court records show employees ignoring security protocol and failing to investigate reports of missing cash.\n\nBrian Newell, a past manager of GardaWorld\u2019s armored truck branches, told The Tampa Bay Times that his supervisor once instructed him to transport all coins stored at his Connecticut branch to a branch in Massachusetts. The branch was missing money ahead of an impending audit from Bank of America. He later discovered he was one of several branch managers asked to send all of their holdings to cover up the missing cash.\n\nA document obtained by The Tampa Bay Times stated that GardaWorld executives found discrepancies in 2014 and estimated approximately $9 million missing throughout the company. Employees reported that money continued to go missing after the executives\u2019 internal investigation, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nUpdates from the San Fernando facility have remained stagnant since the heist. According to an unnamed Los Angeles Times source, one side wall of the cash-holding building, in addition to the roof, showed evidence of an attempted breach. At least one alarm is confirmed to have been triggered during the heist, but it didn\u2019t trigger a call to law enforcement.\n\n\u201cThere could be multiple people who understand the physical security or the layout of the building. Most cash vaults are extremely secure\u2014the physical building and the alarm networks,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cThere was a small alarm that went off and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nSince customers do not usually pay with hundred dollar bills, the burglars likely had to load millions of $5, $10 and $20 bills into getaway vehicles to make up the $30 million stolen. This means getaway vehicles would have to fit and transport several tons of coins and paper bills.\n\n\u201c30 million is a lot of money to get taken like that,\u201d said Ezra Avery, a sophomore studying economics and mathematics. \u201cThey must have known what they were doing and had it super planned out because there was not a lot of evidence left behind.\u201d\n\nAvery remains optimistic that the thieves will escape with their fortune. Other students hope to see them behind bars.\n\n\u201cI think they can make a really cool Netflix series about this in 50 years,\u201d said Roman Marchetti, a sophomore studying journalism. \u201cI hope they catch them so they can do that.\u201d\n\nAnyone with information about this theft should contact the FBI at 1 800 CALL-FBI (225-5324) or online, at tips.fbi.gov.\n```"}

Since then, she has spearheaded numerous campaigns under the banner name \u201cTeam Sabrina\u201d in honor of her late mother, Sabrina Jones. Through these initiatives, she champions mental health awareness and suicide prevention in collaboration with AFSP.\n\nOn Sunday, April 14, Ryan led her second Out of the Darkness Campus Walk at the USC Village Great Lawn hosted by the AFSP. Despite the rain, advocates showed their support for the campaign by participating in on-site activities, such as an honor bead ceremony where participants wear different colored bead bracelets based on their connection to the lost loved one to share messages of hope.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s super fulfilling, seeing everyone that has come together, put their hearts and heads together, planning such a big day,\u201d Ryan said. Today is just to remind everybody that it\u2019s okay to lean on your peers and to talk about your problems with those around you\u201d\n\nRyan has led other Out of the Darkness Walks in her hometown Nebraska, Santa Monica and USC. Last year she led the USC Out of the Darkness Campus Walk sharing her experience as a student speaker and volunteer. This year she took the position of a campus walk chair where she had control of the campus community outreach to offer an inclusive walk for all communities around campus.\n\nThe event was in partnership with Red Bull, USC Hillel, The American Cancer Society, Didi Hirsch, Men Across America, and many mental health organizations on campus.\n\nAsha Adley, a sophomore studying Urban Studies and Planning met Taylor Ryan her freshman year, was impacted with her mission and was inspired to advocate for \u201cTeam Sabrina\u201d during the walk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really nice having a team on campus that is so loudly an advocate for suicide prevention. Having something smaller, more centered, and personal creates a comfortable space for people.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s \u201cTeam Sabrina\u201d campaign also brings awareness to the stigmas surrounding mental health. Junior, Maggie Kolchira, studying Global Health on the Pre-Med track, explains her experience with stigmas as she shared her journey with mental health as the student speaker for this year\u2019s Out of the Darkness Walk.\n\nShe explains, \u201cI want to erase the stigma behind suicide. I always heard from my friends that I\u2019m a very bubbly, happy person. But that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t have my own struggles. It\u2019s really important to recognize that people can be both, and we have our cycles, and we need to be there for each other to help us get back up.\u201d\n\nKolchira shares that getting to the point of becoming a speaker is a major milestone in her journey. She wants to inspire others going through mental health struggles to build the courage to be vulnerable.\n\n\u201cCreating a space where you can be vulnerable and share your struggles is what saved me. I was able to open up about my struggles and by doing so I was able to find the help that I needed.\u201d\n\nAndrea Guzman, an AFP programs manager for the LA chapter explains the importance of campus walks.\n\n\u201cEveryone has their own story, their own connection. Our Out of the Darkness Walks are a chance to be in a community space and an important reminder that regardless of your story, you are not alone.\u201d\n\nRyan carried the AFSP banner with \u201cTeam Sabrina\u201d across the village campus being the top fundraising team for the second year in a row, raising over $5,000. Overall, Ryan was able to successfully reach her $15,000 fundraising goal to AFSP.\n\nIf you are having thoughts of suicide, text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 or text TALK to 741-741.

He kind of got mad at the people doing his sound because he said they were autotuning it. He skipped a few songs because he just wasn\u2019t happy with the way they were coming out.\u201d She also warned future Coachella attendees of the less glamorous side of the festival.\n\nGauba: \u201cSo by the time you get home, it\u2019s like 3:30, you\u2019re not in bed until 4 a.m., and then you do it again the next day. You\u2019re in the heat and then you\u2019re in the cold. It\u2019s exhausting on your body.

This protocol is to ensure students\u2019 safety after long sessions.\n\n\u201cThe number one thing you learn on set is that there are three billion things going on at once,\u201d Abunassar said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel safe on set, it ruins the whole vibe.

(Photo courtesy of Tara Moreno-Goodwin)\n\nBy Audrey Serrano, Aditya Thiyag and YJ Si\nApril 15, 2024 at 7:17 pm PDT\n\nThe 23rd Coachella festival opened this past weekend in Indio, California, featuring performances from headliners like Lana Del Rey, Tyler the Creator and Doja Cat. Ahead of the second weekend of the festival, some Trojans, like junior Ashley Gauba, said the first weekend \u201cblew my expectations away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were such amazing shows to see, and everybody in the crowd was just so energetic and so nice,\u201d said Gauba, a public relations major.\n\nFootage on social media from the first weekend shifted expectations for some attending the second weekend of the festival. Canadian artist Grimes\u2019 Saturday performance sparked a great deal of internet discourse over the technical issues, such as tapes that played too fast, that arose during the set.\n\nJenna Salley, a sophomore studying public relations and a Grimes fan, expressed concern over the artist\u2019s set after seeing the fiasco go down online.\n\n\u201cI really hope Grimes gets it together because I was reading articles that said she had multiple mental breakdowns throughout her set,\u201d Salley said.\n\nSome Coachella attendees prefer attending the second weekend, because they expect a smoother experience once all the issues from the first weekend are ironed out. Caroline Perez, a sophomore studying international relations, said she is \u201can avid promoter of weekend two, just because there are less influencers and there are also less technical difficulties.\u201d\n\nFor some, attending weekend two allows for more production preparation and they expect a more cohesive festival experience. Perez said that last year her experience during the second weekend was a marked improvement on a technical level compared to the first weekend.\n\n\u201cOne of the artists that I really loved was Yves Tumor and during their weekend one set, there were a lot of sound issues,\u201d Perez said. \u201cBut when I went to weekend two it was one of the best performances ever.\u201d\n\nDeclining ticket sales over the last few years has been a major point of contention to determine Coachella\u2019s relevance within current pop culture. Nate Sloan, assistant professor at the USC Thornton School of Music, said Coachella\u2019s sales might not be due to a lack of cultural relevance, but rather the skyrocketing ticket prices.\n\n\u201cWhen the festival started in 1999, I believe it was only $50 for a day pass, and now it\u2019s hundreds of dollars, plus the expense of finding a place to stay and whatever kind of housing accommodations and transportation there are,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cThe whole festival costs a lot of money and when the cost of living is higher than ever, people are more judicious about where they\u2019re going to spend their money.\u201d\n\nSloan said Coachella\u2019s biggest strength was how the festival brought together headliners of various generations in order to have shows that appeal to the broadest group of people possible.\n\n\u201c\u2018Coachella is great about providing more opportunities for them to have shows that combine artists of different generations like [Gwen Stefani] and Olivia Rodrigo playing together,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that could make the festival kind of stand out, because you have all these artists there at the same time, and there\u2019s exciting opportunities to see them cross over.\u201d\n\nWeekend one attendees said that they attributed the decline in sales to lack of name recognition and pricing. Lucy Kwitten, a sophomore studying Economics and Data Science, said that many headliners brought out other well-known artists that were not on the lineup, and including them might be beneficial for sales.\n\n\u201cI was watching Rene\u00e8 Rapp and Katy Perry was right there next to me in front of the Barricade,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think they would have way more attendance if they advertised how many creators are there.\u201d\n\nJake Rutsky, a sophomore studying business, said that he also thinks the advertising is the main contributor to lower attendance.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of people performing who I didn\u2019t even know were going to be there,\u201d Rutsky said. \u201cThere were two big DJs Chris Lorenzo and Chris Lake that are a part of Anti Up, and a lot of people probably just didn\u2019t know that. There\u2019s just less widely-known names on the lineups probably contributing to [lower attendance].\u201d\n\nWhile the prices are high, Kwitten said her experience was worth the expenditures \u2014 passes, housing and shuttle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a good deal if you think about it,\u201d Kwitten said. \u201cYes, the tickets are very expensive, but you\u2019re seeing 20 different artists for that price. It\u2019s so worth it in my opinion.\u201d\n\nKwitten said that she was pleasantly surprised by her weekend experience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rate it a nine out of 10,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really, really well organized in general, which I was really happy about. Every single headliner came on [and got off] exactly when they were supposed to. I\u2019d definitely go again.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Wendi Lu April 15, 2024 at 7:07 pm PDT\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 seventh winning streak ended Saturday when beach volleyball encountered its crosstown rival UCLA in a 3-2 loss, wrapping up the Center of Effort Challenge Final at Cal Poly. The loss moved the Trojans to 24-19 all-time against the Bruins and marked UCLA\u2019s second straight victory in the series.\n\nDuring the two-day tournament, the Trojans were high in spirits, opening with a 4-1 win over longtime rival Pepperdine while sweeping No. 7 Long Beach State and No. 5 TCU. Despite the gritty weather conditions, for USC \u201cit really comes down to always pushing through that and just playing it at our level,\u201d sophomore Madison White said. \u201cWe know that\u2019s a high level and I have very high expectations, and we will work hard to fulfill them.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday morning, the first dual point against TCU was collected by graduate students Audrey and Nicole Nourse with a quick 21-12, 21-13 victory on court three, securing their 114th all-time victory as a duo. On court one, seniors Megan Kraft and Delaynie Maple finished next with a clean 21-18, 21-13 win.\n\n\u201cThat was our best dual this year, top to bottom,\u201d Maple said. \u201cHonestly, we don\u2019t get to bring one through 21 of our whole team a lot. Having everybody here makes a huge difference.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans were on a roll, as freshman Ashley Pater and graduate Grace Seits clinched their dual with a 21-9, 21-19 win. White and graduate Maddi Kriz came out on top 21-15, 21-17. Freshman Madison Goellner and sophomore Mabyn Thomas ended the sweep with a 21-12, 21-17 win.\n\nMaple didn\u2019t find playing all five games at once a challenge: \u201cWe only have three coaches, so two teams don\u2019t have a coach. But at the same time, it\u2019s cool because you feed off everybody\u2019s energy and it\u2019s a better warmup with everyone present.\u201d\n\nThe second match of the day for USC came against the No. 1 UCLA. USC scored first behind Pater and Seits. However, the Bruins bit back and the Nourse twins fell to UCLA freshman Kenzie Brower and junior Jessie Smith with identical sets of 21-16. Then, UCLA reclaimed the lead at 2-1 on court two over Kriz and White, 21-18, 21-19.\n\nThe Trojans brought it back to a tie when Kraft and Maple followed with three thriller sets a 22-20 win, a 21-15 loss and a 15-12 win and improved to 56-6 all-time. All eyes were on court three, where the Trojans had the upper hand until the end of the first set 21-14. However, the momentum was lost when Goellner and Thomas fell 21-17 and 15-10 in the final match.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tweaked the lineup or some new pairs to get in the groove for the next three weeks of the season, which is the Pac-12 championship. That\u2019s our goal,\u201d head coach Dain Blanton said.\n\nThe Trojans will meet the Bruins for a rematch at 12:30 p.m. on Thursday at Merle Norman Stadium. At 2:30, USC will celebrate Senior Day against No. 10 LMU while honoring 10 seniors.\n```"}

Andrew T. Guzman, the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, said the decision was based on maintaining \u201ccampus security and safety\u201d in the email.\n\nThe valedictorian, Asna Tabassum, said in a public statement later Monday she feels the university has \u201cabandoned\u201d her. \u201cThis decision is not only necessary to maintain the safety of our campus and students, but is consistent with the fundamental legal obligation \u2013 including the expectations of federal regulators \u2013 that universities act to protect students and keep our campus community safe,\u201d said Guzman in the message to the USC community.\n\nThe decision was made after days of complaints from students, alumni and others who viewed the valedictorian\u2019s social media activity as antisemitic. \u201cAnti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian voices have subjected me to a campaign of racist hatred because of my uncompromising belief in human rights for all... I was hoping to use my commencement speech to inspire my classmates with a message of hope. By canceling my speech, USC is only caving to fear and rewarding hatred,\u201d Tabassum said in her two-page statement.\n\nGuzman said the decision was made primarily out of concerns for on-campus safety. \u201cThe intensity of feelings, fueled by both social media and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, has grown to include many voices outside of USC and has escalated to the point of creating substantial risks relating to security and disruption at commencement,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe cannot ignore the fact that similar risks have led to harassment and even violence at other campuses.\u201d\n\nIn the statement, Tabassum wrote that she met with the Office of the Provost Sunday to express her own concerns about safety at commencement, to which they responded that \u201cthe University had the resources to take appropriate safety measures for my valedictory speech, but that they would not be doing so since increased security protections is not what the University wants to \u2018present as an image.\u2019\u201d\n\nGuzman, however, wrote that the valedictorian selection was made \u201cbased on various criteria \u2013 which did not include social media presence,\u201d in the letter to the community. \u201cBased on these faculty recommendations, I made the final decision.\u201d\n\nThe university had previously announced Tabassum as valedictorian on April 4 in an Academic Honors Convocation. In her Instagram biography, Tabassum links to a pro-Palestine landing page that reads in part, \u201cLearn about what\u2019s happening in Palestine, and how to help.\u201d Some students took to social media to express their opposition to her as their valedictorian due to the language on the landing page. The website states, \u201cZionism is a racist settler-colonial ideology that advocates for a Jewish ethnostate built on Palestinian land.\u201d\n\nStudent groups and other on-campus clubs, such as Chabad and Trojans for Israel, called for the \u201creconsideration\u201d of the valedictorian. The debate is similar to what\u2019s happening on college campuses across America, and illustrates a deep divide only exacerbated by events in Gaza since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.\n\nTabassum was elected valedictorian for having a GPA greater than 3.980, possessing total knowledge of an academic program, contributing to both university and community life, and submitting a reflection essay on her time at USC. In an article about the selection, USC News noted Tabassum is graduating with a major in biomedical engineering and a minor in resistance to genocide. The article noted she has studied how technology, immigration and literacy affect the type of medical care people receive, and added, \u201cShe has also been an advocate for the community through her service with the Muslim Student Union and the Mobile Clinic at USC.\u201d\n\nThe university told Annenberg Media there will be no other student speaker replacing Tabassum at the main ceremony on May 10 and that the university has offered her resources for support during this time. USC\u2019s main stage commencement ceremony is predicted to host 65,000 on the University Park Campus, according to the Office of the Provost. Jon M. Chu, the accomplished producer, director, and writer, will be the main ceremony\u2019s commencement speaker.\n\nThis story was updated to include Tabassum\u2019s statement, additional context, and more details.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Amy Harris/Invision/AP)\n\nBy Kim Ly April 15, 2024 at 5:45 pm PDT\n\nMaggie Rogers makes the kind of music you run to\u2014and not a casual, three-mile jog type of run, but rather, a whirlwind of emotions, coming-of-age, end-of-the-movie type of run. On Friday, she released her latest album, \u201cDon\u2019t Forget Me,\u201d where she makes the listener run again. This time, it\u2019s the pace you go down your hometown\u2019s street on a late Sunday afternoon as the skies slowly fade from blue into orange. In line with her Dazed interview, Rogers definitely makes \u201cmain character\u201d music.\n\nRogers first blew up in 2016 through a YouTube video on a masterclass session at NYU Tisch with Pharrell Williams where he praised her song \u201cAlaska.\u201d Six years, a master\u2019s degree from the Harvard Divinity School and many albums and mixtapes later, Rogers has truly honed her craft in \u201cDon\u2019t Forget Me.\u201d Written entirely within five days with co-producer Ian Fitchuk, Rogers\u2019 latest album brings a new sense of maturity and rawness to her discography that draws back to her banjo-playing background.\n\nRogers has always been more experimental with her genres, managing to combine dance-pop with folk-indie and even elements of alternative rock within her previous albums, \u201cSurrender\u201d and \u201cHeard It In A Past Life.\u201d For \u201cDon\u2019t Forget Me,\u201d she leans into a more folk, indie and pop direction that is somewhat reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac.\n\nOriginally written chronologically, the album is also best listened to chronologically. As you go through the album, she brings you through her memories of love (both romantic and platonic), loss and moving on. Here is a breakdown of every song on the new album:\n\n1. It Was Coming All Along | 7.5/10\nThe album opens up with \u201cIt Was Coming All Along\u201d where you\u2019re immediately overtaken with soft drums, acoustic strings and synth. The instrumentals are nostalgic in a small-town band that performs out of their garage, kind-of-way (except, you know, if the band was perfectly mixed and mastered). \u201cIt Was Coming All Along\u201d feels like the conclusion to her openers. While \u201cGive A Little\u201d from \u201cHeard It In A Past Life\u201d was about newness and excitement and\u201dOverdrive\u201d from \u201cSurrender\u201d was filled with chaos \u2014\u201dIt Was Coming All Along\u201d wraps things up with an acceptance of her fear of the uncertain future. \u201cI\u2019m crying, wish I wasn\u2019t hanging on / But I know it won\u2019t last for long / So fast, it\u2019s fading out of view / I\u2019m flying long past twenty-two / So high, can\u2019t find the moment it went wrong / But it was coming all along,\u201d Roger sings. Time will pass, and all you can really do is accept it. 7.5/10\u2014best listened to during moments of existential crisis.\n\n2. Drunk | 6.5/10\n\u201cDrunk\u201d hits you like a tornado especially after the softness of \u201cIt Was Coming Along.\u201d This track feels particularly raw in her vocal intonations that spontaneously change throughout the song, invoking a whirlwind of emotions. \u201cDrunk\u201d brings you through the gradual acceptance of growing up. Rogers is \u201cdrunk\u201d and is going dizzy with all of her thoughts and memories of youth. At the same time, she\u2019s sobering up and is becoming more serious as she reaches adulthood. \u201cI\u2019m drunk, but not drinking / Lost in wishful thinking / Round and round and round it goes ... Time is up / You\u2019ve had your fun / Oh, but it\u2019s so loud,\u201d Rogers sings. Despite the tone changes, as the track nears the end, the lyrics fall flat and begin to feel repetitive. 6.5/10\u2014best listened to during the nights when you\u2019re screaming at the top of your lungs.\n\n3. So Sick Of Dreaming | 8/10\nYou\u2019re immediately calmed down from \u201cDrunk\u201d with a strong folk-pop vibe from \u201cSo Sick Of Dreaming,\u201d where Rogers reflects on her experience with dating. Similar to the past two songs, there\u2019s a sense of acceptance but this time, about romance. \u201cOh, there ain\u2019t no diamond ring you could buy me / To take me home / Oh, \u2018cause I\u2019m / So sick of dreamin\u2019 / Oh, and I\u2019m / All that I\u2019m needin\u2019,\u201d Rogers sings. This song seems to be dedicated to everybody who\u2019s ever tried dating in today\u2019s world; dating is difficult and Rogers knows that. It\u2019s relatable, it\u2019s fun and it\u2019s easy to listen to. 8/10\u2014hopeless romantics should steer clear of this song.\n\n4. The Kill | 8.5/10\nRogers absolutely kills it with \u201cThe Kill\u201d as she smoothly transitions from \u201cSo Sick Of Dreaming\u201d into this song\u2019s more alternative pop and indie vibe. \u201cThe Kill\u201d reflects on a relationship filled with ups and downs. These lyrics are more reminiscent of her previous album, \u201cSurrender\u201d which is filled with lines on a difficult and borderline toxic relationship. However, \u201cThe Kill\u201d is a lot more mature and positive as Rogers looks toward the future. \u201cOoh, we were just wasting time / \u2018Cause we were hurting / But I know that you know that I know you best / And I know that we both can forget all the rest / We both were so difficult, but so invincible / Irresistible, but I loved you still,\u201d Roger sings. The build-up toward the choruses makes the song ever-so-exciting to listen to while simultaneously evoking the \u201cmain character\u201d feeling that Rogers writes for. 8.5/10\u2014one of my favorite songs on the album and is perfect for those nostalgic days.\n\n5. If Now Was Then | 7/10\nFollowing \u201cThe Kill\u201d and halfway through the album is another song on reflection: \u201cIf Now Was Then.\u201d Rogers sings of regrets and the things that could\u2019ve been. \u201cI\u2019d take it back, but I can\u2019t, I\u2019m sorry / I know it hurts, but you shouldn\u2019t worry,\u201d Roger sings. Despite the relatively regretful lyrics, the instrumental and vocals are upbeat and make the listener excited for what\u2019s next. 7/10\u2014best for a drive down the road on a sunny day.\n\n6. I Still Do | 8.5/10\nLeading into the second half of the album is \u201cI Still Do\u201d which is the first ballad on \u201cDon\u2019t Forget Me.\u201d Following \u201cIf Now Was Then,\u201d Rogers continues to reflect on her relationship but is now more calm, collected and (seemingly) ready to let go. \u201cDarling, my dear, I know we\u2019ve had a good thing going / Darling, I fear it\u2019s time for us to do some growing,\u201d Rogers sings in the first two lines. This track is a slow and soft ballad that allows for the piano instrumental and Rogers\u2019 melodic voice to shine. However, it is not a sad song. Rather, \u201cI Still Do\u201d tells the story of a beautiful love that once was and will forever exist in Rogers\u2019 memories. Rogers takes a more peaceful approach to letting go that nicely contrasts typical break-up songs that seek vengeance. 8.5/10\u2014best for those slower, rainy summer days.\n\n7. On & On & On | 7/10\n\u201cOn & On & On\u201d brings back memories of Fleetwood Mac songs with its groovy instrumentals. It\u2019s a fun break-up song that brings back the energy following a ballad. \u201cWhen you realize the things that you lack / Better think twice \u2018fore callin\u2019 me back,\u201d Rogers sings. 7/10\u2014snarky and fun; best for dancing.\n\n8. Never Going Home | 7/10\nRogers is still attempting to move on in \u201cNever Going Home\u201d but memories of her past haunt her. She plays further into this idea as this track is instrumentally more similar to earlier songs in the album like \u201cIt Was Coming All Along.\u201d \u201cYou get to talking, but those lips aren\u2019t your lips / We lean together, those hips aren\u2019t your hips / When we\u2019re out in the back and I\u2019m catching my breath / I close my eyes to forget all the rest, oh,\u201d Roger sings. However, she also sings, \u201cNow I\u2019m never, ever going home.\u201d She wants to move on, but she still considers her partner her \u201chome.\u201d At this point, I\u2019m wondering when Rogers is going to move on in the album. 7/10\u2014best for those wanting to text their ex; listen to Rogers\u2014you are never going \u201chome.\u201d\n\n9. All The Same | 8.5/10\n\u201cAll The Same\u201d is the second ballad in this album that heavily ties back to the earlier ballad, \u201cI Still Do.\u201d In \u201cI Still Do\u201d Roger sings, \u201cAnd how far can you bend before you break it all someday? / And how long can you wait?\u201d Roger follows up in this track where we find out her partner chose not to stay. \u201cGive me the chance to wake up in a full romance / Just knowing that you chose to stay If only just to keep on hoping / Maybe even knowing there\u2019s another way / Oh, won\u2019t you wait?\u201d Roger sings. It\u2019s a last-ditch effort for Rogers to make this difficult relationship work. However, she doesn\u2019t seem too desperate based on the tone of her singing. \u201cAll The Same\u201d combines Rogers\u2019 soft hums, the melodic piano keys and slow strumming of a guitar throughout to create a feeling of nostalgia and comfort. It\u2019s like a warm, hearty, goodbye hug that I\u2019m not ready to let go of yet. 8.5/10\u2014best for those early mornings.\n\n10. Don\u2019t Forget Me | 7.5/10\n\u201cDon\u2019t Forget Me\u201d wraps up the album with Rogers\u2019 raw vocals and a smooth folk-indie instrumental as she is finally ready to move on. \u201cOh, and promise me that when it\u2019s time to leave / Don\u2019t forget me / Don\u2019t forget me / And maybe I\u2019m dead wrong / Maybe I was bitter from the winter all along / Maybe there\u2019s a stranger standing, holding out for love / Just waiting on the next street / Just for me,\u201d Rogers sings. She\u2019s borderline pleading when she sings \u201cDon\u2019t forget me,\u201d but at the same time, there\u2019s a resolute confidence and hope for her future. The track ends the album on a high note while simultaneously showcasing the struggles she went through; Rogers is battered and hurt, but she\u2019s willing to cautiously try again. It\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows\u2014but when is love ever that easy anyway? 7.5/10\u2014best listened to during emotional reminiscing.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Forget Me\u201d is now streaming on all platforms.\n```"}

(AP/Carolyn Kaster)\n\nBy Mia Nu\u00f1ez April 15, 2024 at 3:39 pm PDT\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that this year\u2019s WNBA draft class is stacked. After the college basketball season officially ended on April 7 with the South Carolina Gamecocks winning it all, there\u2019s a quick turn around to the draft. There\u2019s been so much hype around college women\u2019s basketball this year because of the competitiveness of all the teams and star players like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. Hopefully, fans will want to see these stars transition into the pros and continue to bring women\u2019s basketball viewership to new heights. Check out where I think everyone will land:\n\n1. Indiana Fever: Caitlin Clark PG | 6-foot-0 | Iowa\nNo doubt about it. Clark is going first. She doesn\u2019t need an introduction, but she averaged 31.6 points this year, so we know she can shoot at an elite level. Her record speaks for itself; she\u2019s won countless awards and has broken countless records. The combo of two first round picks, Clark and Aliyah Boston are going to be lethal for Indiana. She\u2019s going to make a difference right away in the league just like her new teammate did.\n\n2. Los Angeles Sparks: Cameron Brink PF | 6-foot-4 | Stanford\nAfter barely missing the playoffs last year and losing Nneka Ogwumike and Jordan Canada to free agency, the Sparks need a big time player. The Naismith Women\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year can be the addition the Sparks need to become playoff contenders. Brink is a defensive lock, but she\u2019s also a great shooter. She averaged a remarkable 17.4 points and 11.9 rebounds this year. As a rookie, Brink can be a first scoring option in place of the players the Sparks lost.\n\n3. Chicago Sky: Rickea Jackson SF | 6-foot-2 | Tennessee\nAfter trading Kahleah Copper and losing Courtney Williams this off season, it\u2019s apparent that the sky is going into full rebuild mode. They need a dominant guard and starting the rebuild around the phenomenal Rickea Jackson is exactly what Chicago needs. Jackson averaged 20.2 points per game last season and her ability to make plays and shoot is going to help the Sky in their rebuild. Additionally, she averaged 8.2 rebounds, so she can help get boards for established players like Marina Mabrey and Diamond DeShields.\n\n4. Los Angeles Sparks: Kamilla Cardoso C | 6-foot-7 | South Carolina\nCardoso could definitely go third, but Chicago needs scorers right now and Cardoso has more of a defensive acumen. While the NCAA championship MVP\u2019s expertise is defense, she can definitely still handle business on offense. She averaged 14.4 points a game this year after averaging 9.8 last points last year. She\u2019s proven that she can step up after having to do so for South Carolina after Dawn Staley\u2019s unit lost all five of their original starters. The Sparks is the perfect place for Cardoso to refine her shot and become a star alongside Brink.\n\n5. Dallas Wings: Jacy Sheldon SG | 5-foot-10 | Ohio State\nThe Wings need another guard to help Arike Ogunbowale out. Sheldon is the second best guard in the draft, so it just makes sense. Sheldon can be the two-way player that the Wings need, as she\u2019s shot 37.3% from three this season and proved to be a great perimeter defender. She has just enough size to help the backcourt and enough agility to be a shot maker.\n\n6. Washington Mystics: Aaliyah Edwards PF | 6-foot-3 | UConn\nElena Delle Donne announced that she\u2019s sitting out the 2024 season, so the Mystics are in need of a defensive lock. When Delle Donne does come back, a combination of her and Edwards in their back court could make their defense unstoppable. Edwards averaged 9.2 rebounds, but she has some room to grow with her shooting. When Delle Donne does come back, she\u2019s the perfect veteran to show Edwards how to be a good defensive player and a shooter.\n\n7. Chicago Sky: Angel Reese PF | 6-foot-3 | LSU\nThe guard and forward duo of Jackson and Angel Reese are going to help the Sky return to its championship form. Reese\u2019s ability to rebound and make plays was apparent in the Final Four game against Iowa. She averaged 18.6 points and 13.4 rebounds this season. The Sky needs a consistent rebounder because that\u2019s something they\u2019ve lacked ever since Candace Parker left.\n\n8. Minnesota Lynx: Isobel Borlase PG | 5-foot-11 | Australia\nThe Lynx are missing another star on their team to help out Napheesa Collier. The former Australian WNBL player has proven she\u2019s a star with her 59.6% shooting. One of the most impressive things about Borlase is her ability to draw fouls and shoot free throws accurately. This is something the Lynx struggle with. Last season, the Lynx ranked seventh in free throw percentage, so the 19-year-old will be a perfect addition to their squad.\n\n9. Dallas Wings: Alissa Pili SF | 6-foot-2 | Utah\nTo continue adding help to the Wings\u2019 scoring, they should draft the former USC Trojan Pili. She averaged 21.4 points and shot 40.4% from the three. Dallas could use her quick hands to make shots. There are some concerns about her defense, but her offensive game outweighs those concerns. Additionally, she\u2019ll be in the back court with Arike Ogunbowale who has no problem picking up some defensive slack.\n\n10. Connecticut Sun: Dyaisha Fair PG | 5-foot-5 | Syracuse\nThe Sun need a shooter and the fifth overall NCAA all-time scorer is just that. She averaged 22.3 points and shot 39.2% from three. Also, Fair is fast and can get to the line to create free throws. The Sun had an impressive season last year finishing third in the league, but they struggled with their three-point shooting. Fair\u2019s height may be a concern, but she\u2019s already been able to hold her own in the ACC, a highly competitive conference.\n\n11. New York Liberty: Nika Muhl PG | 5-foot-10 | UConn\nMuhl proved how good she really is during UConn\u2019s Final Four game against Iowa. The Liberty\u2019s Courtney Vandersloot is getting older and Sabrina Ionescu needs another shooter alongside her. Muhl is no stranger to helping out a star guard, having just played with Paige Bueckers. Aside from her shooting, she can be a huge help defensively. She did a fantastic job on that side of the ball in the final four against Clark, who is notoriously hard to guard.\n\n12. Atlanta Dream: Javyn Nicholson PF | 6-foot-2 | Georgia\nAs Atlanta made the playoffs last year for the first time in five years, they\u2019re looking for a player who can continue growing the team. The biggest issue on this team is their all-around shooting. Nicholson averaged 16.8 points last season and 8.7 rebounds. She proved that she\u2019s a shooter against South Carolina earlier in the season with 17 points and 12 rebounds. The depth Nicholson can add will help the Dream in their next playoff run.\n```"}

(Photo by Wesley Chen)\n\nBy Suzanne Schofield April 14, 2024 at 7:25 pm PDT\n\nNavigating transitions and retention\n\nAs USC football enthusiasts eagerly anticipate the upcoming season, all eyes are on head coach Lincoln Riley as he navigates the complexities of player retention, team development and the ever-evolving landscape of college football. Riley addressed the pressing issues of modern-day college football, notably the impact of the transfer portal and the NIL era on player retention. With recent news of various players\u2019 decision to enter the portal \u2014 notably senior defensive lineman Isaiah Raikes and redshirt sophomore cornerback Tre\u2019Quon Fegans \u2014 Riley acknowledged the challenges but maintained a pragmatic stance.\n\nHe emphasized the importance of understanding each player\u2019s unique circumstances and the necessity of ongoing evaluation and adaptation in the recruiting process. \u201cEvery kid\u2019s different at this age,\u201d Riley said after practice on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t get too overly emotional one way or another. ... This is not going to be the right fit for every single player, we get that.\u201d\n\nRiley highlighted the shift in timing and approach necessitated by the transfer portal, indicating that conversations about retention now occur earlier in the season. Despite the increased effort required to retain players, Riley stressed that USC\u2019s reputation and allure remain strong. Instead, the focus lies on finding the right fit for the team\u2019s continuous evolution.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, this is USC,\u201d Riley said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to beg people to be here. For every guy that leaves here, there\u2019s going to be a line of a hundred people that would die to take that spot in a heartbeat.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Riley hinted at potential targets for recruitment, particularly in positions like offensive line and wide receiver. While acknowledging the ongoing evaluation of player development within the team, he remained open to exploring opportunities in the transfer portal to bolster USC\u2019s roster.\n\nMiller Moss steps up amid transition\n\nWith the departure of star quarterback Caleb Williams to the NFL Draft, redshirt junior quarterback Miller Moss has stepped into the limelight, shouldering the responsibility of leading the Trojan offense. Quarterbacks coach Luke Huard echoed praise for the inexperienced signal caller and emphasized his commitment to the team\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cMiller is an extremely intelligent quarterback,\u201d Huard stated after Tuesday\u2019s practice. \u201cHe\u2019s got really really good leadership skills. You know this thing is extremely important to him. He cares a lot about this football team.\u201d\n\nTransitioning from a supporting role to a leadership position, Moss acknowledges the challenges ahead. As he shifts his focus, the redshirt junior aims to balance personal improvement with the broader responsibilities of guiding the team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about making sure your stuff is right, but making sure the entire offense is,\u201d Moss said. \u201cI think that\u2019s been the biggest change \u2014 just being able to kind of delegate between the attention to my game and the attention to the offense as a whole.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Moss emphasized the camaraderie among the quarterbacks, describing it as a source of strength for the team. \u201cI think the room as a whole is close and obviously looking forward to furthering those relationships,\u201d Moss said.\n\nAs Moss navigates the challenges of leadership and adjustment, his partnership with Huard and the unity within the quarterback room provides a solid foundation for USC\u2019s future.\n\nRising star Marcelles Williams\n\nOne name has consistently emerged as a standout throughout spring practice: freshman cornerback Marcelles Williams. \u201cLittle Celly [Marcelles] has been standing out, most definitely doing his thing,\u201d redshirt junior safety Anthony Beavers Jr. remarked after Thursday\u2019s practice.\n\nBeavers Jr. elaborated on how Williams\u2019 football-focused upbringing, combined with his ability to chart his own course in the sport, underscores his potential for greatness. \u201cCelly comes from a great football family, and I played with his two brothers [former USC safety Max Williams and Arizona State redshirt senior Macen Williams]. I think it\u2019s just being able to see how much he\u2019s learned from them and to implement his own game. I think he\u2019s been doing a tremendous job grasping everything and hitting the ground running.\u201d\n\nSophomore wide receiver Ja\u2019Kobi Lane emphasized Williams\u2019 receptiveness to coaching. Lane\u2019s observation underscores not only Williams\u2019 raw talent, but also his coachability, a trait often indicative of future success in the sport.\n\n\u201cYeah, I think technique-wise and just pure ability-wise, he\u2019s everything you\u2019d want from a young guy,\u201d Lane said. \u201cVery receptive to all the coaching that [secondary coach Doug] Belk and [defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton] Lynn give him. He thrives in listening and taking coaching in.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about potential; Williams is already making waves on the field. Moss was quick to highlight Williams\u2019 on-field prowess. Moss\u2019 praise underscores Williams\u2019 seamless transition into a critical position on the field and his ability to hold his own against more seasoned players.\n\n\u201cObviously, as a young kid, he\u2019s a high school senior,\u201d Moss said. \u201cBut he can definitely play corner with the best guys on our team right now ... I feel like he\u2019s definitely got a bright future.\u201d\n\nAs the young cornerback continues to impress both his teammates and coaches with his performance on the field, it\u2019s clear that he is poised to make a significant impact in the world of college football. With his combination of natural talent, dedication, and willingness to learn, Williams is undoubtedly a name to watch out for as he embarks on his collegiate football journey.\n```"}

(Photo by Eric Park)\n\nBy Mia Nu\u00f1ez\nApril 14, 2024 at 7:11 pm PDT\n\nUSC baseball had its five-game winning streak snapped by the Oregon Ducks, but it was still able to snatch away a Sunday victory to avoid the series sweep at PK Park in Eugene. With the series loss, the Trojans are just under .500 with a 17-18 regular season record and 6-7 Pac-12 mark.\n\nUSC\u2019s first two losses were due to its cold bats and missed opportunities. The Trojans left a combined total of 16 runners on base across the first two games.\n\nThe Trojans started off hot in game one, scoring in the first inning off of an RBI by sophomore infielder Ethan Hedges. But, they couldn\u2019t get the bats going after that first inning to fall 4-1 Friday night. This was not the case for the Ducks, though, as they put up a run in the first three innings.\n\nThings were looking up for the Trojans during the fifth inning, when sophomore catcher Jacob Galloway launched the ball into center field with two runners on base, but it was robbed by Oregon senior outfielder Bryce Boettcher. The Ducks\u2019 junior pitcher RJ Gordon was a problem for the Trojans, as he was strong during his 8.1 innings pitched.\n\nWhen USC did get opportunities, its bats just couldn\u2019t cash in with runners on base. This continued until the ninth inning, when the Trojans had a chance to tie the game. Senior infielder Ryan Jackson got a leadoff double, then Hedges drew a walk. With two runners in scoring position, Oregon senior pitcher Logan Mercado came in and got two outs in a row to silence the USC rally and finish the game.\n\nThe Trojans looked to turn it around on Saturday, and it looked like they were going to. They started off strong, taking a 3-1 lead into the bottom of the fourth inning. But, similarly to game two, the Trojans couldn\u2019t get their bats going late in the game for a 5-3 loss.\n\nPitching also became a problem for the Trojans, as redshirt sophomore pitcher Eric Hammond had a disappointing start with five walks in just three innings. The Ducks scored their first run in the second inning when Hammond walked junior outfielder Jeffery Heard, then threw a wild pitch so he could advance to second. With Heard in scoring position, redshirt sophomore catcher Anson Aroz drove him in with a double.\n\nThe walks continued to hurt the Trojans when, in the bottom of the fourth, Hammond walked Heard again, then Aroz singled. The Trojans replaced Hammond with junior pitcher Fisher Johnson, but he couldn\u2019t stop the Ducks bats with players in scoring position. Oregon put up three runs in the frame.\n\nJust like the day prior, the Trojans had a chance to tie the game when the bases were loaded in the ninth inning. However, they weren\u2019t able to execute again and fell to Oregon for the second time, as Hedges grounded out to close out the game.\n\nThe Trojans were able to win the final game of the series on Sunday to avoid the sweep. Sophomore outfielder Austin Overn led the offense, while four pitchers limited the Oregon bats to win 4-2.\n\n\u201cShoutout those guys, our bats weren\u2019t as hot as we wanted to today,\u201d Overn said about Sunday\u2019s pitching performances. \u201cThank you to them, because, without them, we would\u2019ve probably gotten smacked.\u201d\n\nAfter going just 1-for-7 in the series\u2019 first two games, Overn shined in game three against the Ducks. Including a fourth-inning home run, he scored three of USC\u2019s four runs and robbed a home run during the bottom of the fifth to keep the Trojans up.\n\n\u201cI felt like my timing was good, and I stayed disciplined at the plate and found a way to get on,\u201d Overn said.\n\nWith the Oregon series behind them, the Trojans have to prepare for two midweek games as they look to return to .500.\n\n\u201cTwo midweeks does a toll on our body, so keeping our mental up and finding ways to fight through and win games is going to be huge for us this week,\u201d Overn said.\n\nThe Trojans will look to get revenge on the University of San Diego \u2014 a team that beat USC 9-3 on April 2 \u2014 at Orange County Great Park on Tuesday.\n```"}

They have played just under a .500 rate, improving to a 7-8 record, but have shined on offense, scoring nine or more runs on four occasions. Starter Dylan Cease allowed just two unearned runs in six innings and backed up a two-game slide atop the rotation, following rough starts from Yu Darvish (four runs in three innings) and Joe Musgrove (four runs in four innings).\n\nIn the 10-2 victory on Wednesday, the Padres\u2019 offense helped out Cease by scoring multiple runs in four different innings. Jurickson Profar went 3-for-3 with a two-run homer and RBI double, while Jake Cronenworth also went yard and drove in a pair of runs.\n\nIn the series opener, the Padres stormed back for an astonishing 9-8 victory after giving up eight runs to the Cubs on Monday night. The Padres scored seven runs in the sixth inning. Then, only down a run with Jackson Merrill on first base, Fernando Tatis Jr. stepped in against right-handed closer Adbert Alzolay and hit a two-run homer to seal the game. The comeback also occurred on the 20th anniversary of Petco Park\u2019s opening, giving the win a fitting sense of occasion.\n\nThe Padres\u2019 only loss in their past four games came on Tuesday night, sandwiched between the victories. Joe Musgrove allowed a leadoff home run by Yan Gomes and then walked Ian Happ, yielded a single to Seiya Suzuki and plunked Cody Bellinger to help load the bases. And with runners in scoring position, Christopher Morel smacked a grand slam that propelled Chicago to a 5-1 victory.\n\nBut on Friday night, the Padres rallied from a four-run deficit to beat the Dodgers 8-7 at Dodger Stadium. The Padres hit four home runs that evening, highlighted by another two-run slam from Tatis Jr.\u2014this time in the seventh inning\u2014to tie the game up at 7-7. Ha-Seong Kim and Cronenworth both hit solo homers and Machado hit a two-run shot himself.\n\nThe Padres bullpen held the Dodgers in check, stranding a potential go-ahead run on base in the seventh, eighth and 10th innings to give the offense a platform to win the game. After Michael King surrendered seven runs in the first three innings, the five relievers held the Dodgers scoreless over the final six innings\u2014a top-notch performance from the bullpen after a busy week against the Cubs.\n\nMerrill took charge in the 11th inning with a two-out single into the infield\u2019s open left side to bring Jos\u00e9 Azocar home from second base, while Robert Suarez retired the Dodgers in the bottom of the inning to secure the victory. For Merrill, his game-winning hit capped off another standout game in his debut season. The 20-year-old rookie also made a diving catch to rob Shohei Ohtani of extra bases in the second inning and his game-winning single came off veteran Alex Vesia on an 0-2 count.\n\nThe Padres have now won four of their last four games, scoring at least eight runs in each of those victories. They now stand at .500 with an 8-8 record and hold second place in the National League West, one game ahead of the third-place Diamondbacks. Following Saturday\u2019s game, the Padres are now 8-9 and play the Dodgers again on Sunday evening.\n```"}

(AP/Ryan Sun)\n\nBy Matt Kim April 14, 2024 at 5:35 pm PDT\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 Coming off a disappointing series loss against the Red Sox, a team which seems to be in the midst of a rebuild, the Angels looked towards a huge series against the visiting Rays. Game one was headlined by a masterful Tyler Anderson performance. Anderson, coming off a disappointing first season in Anaheim in 2023, threw seven innings of shutout baseball, walking one and striking out three. He flourished in limiting hard contact, something that was a big factor in his 2022 breakout season with the Dodgers.\n\nEven though he didn\u2019t need much, Anderson had plenty of run support as three different Halos would record three hits each. Anthony Rendon was the most notable of the trio, as he started the season on a rough patch. Through the first two series against the Orioles and Marlins, both opponents held Rendon hitless. He recorded a couple of singles in the previous series against the Red Sox, but finally broke out in this game with three hits and three runs against the Rays. Rendon has been hitting out of the leadoff spot to begin 2024\u2014unfamiliar territory for the veteran third baseman.\n\nThe leadoff spot had normally been reserved for fast on-base threats, but in recent years, managers have been experimenting with putting anybody with the ability to get on base in the leadoff role, the most prominent experiment being the Phillies\u2019 Kyle Schwarber, who leads off despite even though he\u2019s one of the slowest players in baseball.\n\nThe core of the Angels offense, three-time American League MVP Mike Trout, also recorded three hits, including a home run. Trout has had a scorching start to the year, slugging six home runs and recording an OPS of 1.195. Trout staying healthy will be key for the Halos offense, as they miss him sorely when he\u2019s not in the lineup.\n\nOverall, the Angels looked dominant to begin the series with their 7-1 win, but they ran out of gas throughout the last two games. Patrick Sandoval was on the hill for game two, but he once again struggled with his command. In five innings, he walked three while giving up six hits, ultimately surrendering four earned runs. \u201cSandy\u201d has struggled to go deep into games, racking up high pitch counts early into games that force manager Ron Washington to go to the bullpen early.\n\nHowever, the bullpen didn\u2019t fare much better, surrendering two more runs that would ultimately be the difference, including a run given up by Jose Cisnero. The veteran right hander has an abominable 14.57 ERA out of the pen, as his errant control in high pressure situations has yielded poor results. This bullpen is expected to carry a large workload this season, especially in the early part of the year as Robert Stephenson is still on the injured list.\n\nOffensively, Trout hit another home run in game two, but the rest of the offense provided mediocre results. Luis Rengifo would record an RBI, but the Angels offense couldn\u2019t string together a rally as they fell short 6-4.\n\nIn the final game of the series, the Angels turned to Jose Soriano, a former reliever turned starter, and he posted a middling performance. In four innings, he gave up six hits and four earned runs, one of those being a home run from Jose Caballero. He did strike out six, but his limited arsenal makes him a wild card as a starting pitcher.\n\nThe Angels loaded the bases in the bottom of the first, but they failed to score a run as Brandon Drury struck out to strand three. That would be the theme of the game, as Angels left 14 men on base. Trout, Jo Adell and Matt Thaiss all recorded multi-hit games but the lack of hitting with runners in scoring position became their Achilles heel.\n\nBrandon Drury and Mickey Moniak have struggled early on and Moniak is in danger of losing his already limited playing time. He struck out three times in four at-bats while exclusively facing right handed pitching. Both have a sub .500 OPS and were expected to be big contributors this year, but the season is still young and they have plenty of time to improve.\n\nWhen Soriano departed, the Angels bullpen took over and delivered five innings of scoreless baseball. Matt Moore, who had a fantastic 2023, went two innings and struck out three without surrendering a baserunner. But the Angels couldn\u2019t quite climb out of the hole, as they lost the series finale 4-2.\n\nThe Angels now sit at 6-6, second in the American League West, but they\u2019re going to need a rapid step up in offensive production. The Rays series showed that they have firepower, but until the Angels start hitting with runners in scoring position, they could fall behind in the ultra-competitive AL West.\n\nNow, Los Angeles looks to take on the Red Sox for the second time in two weeks, having lost two of three in the first series. The Red Sox dominated the Angels in their two wins, as Tyler O\u2019Neil\u2019s great offensive performances alongside strong efforts from the starting rotation propelled them. In the Angels lone win, Reid Detmers looked dominant in six innings as he struck out 12 Red Sox, showcasing his ability to be a future ace in the rotation.\n\nIf Rendon can continue to build on his strong series against the Rays, alongside the typical offensive showings from Mike Trout, the Angels just need the rest of their offense to chip in and drive in runs, especially with two outs on the board. The Red Sox rotation has gotten out to a hot start, but the Angels have already seen them once, so that might prove pivotal towards making a positive adjustment.\n```"}

Atlanta Falcons fullback Keith Smith continued his annual tradition by hosting his fifth football skills camp at his alma mater, Charter Oak High School, on Saturday, April 6. The NFL veteran shared the field with fellow teammates, former coaches and family, enriching the next generation with positivity and knowledge throughout the day.\n\n\u201cIt means everything ... being able to get down to these kids\u2019 level and show them we are human just like them, and show all it takes is hard work and consistency,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI grew up going to these camps.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s Skills Camp, which offered spots to children from first to 12th grade, focused on character development, leadership, and sportsmanship. The camp is part of his Smith Effect Foundation, which aims to \u201cempower youth through the provision of transformative opportunities and access to education and resources.\u201d\n\nSmith, also known as \u201cbeef,\u201d has been in the NFL for over a decade, entering the league in 2014 as an undrafted free agent with the Dallas Cowboys. Smith was a natural linebacker his whole life, winning multiple CIF Championships at Charter Oak and racking up 476 total tackles in his four years at San Jose State. However, after one season with the Dallas Cowboys, former head coach Jason Garret converted Smith to a fullback to keep him around the organization. After three seasons with the Cowboys, Smith signed with the Oakland Raiders for one year in 2019. Following his short stint with the Raiders, Smith found a new home with the Atlanta Falcons, where he has spent the past five seasons.\n\n\u201cIt is electrifying every time I hear my name called ... it\u2019s the most awesome feeling a dad can ever have,\u201d said Smith\u2019s father, Keith Smith Sr.\n\nA collection of Smith\u2019s teammates and coaches rounded out the volunteers helping to run the skills camp. In his Jordan 13 Hellcats, former 2017 Offensive Player of the Year and 2015 Rookie of the Year Todd Gurley, who played alongside Smith with Atlanta in 2020, coached the young generation about pure speed and toughness. Current Falcons teammates Tyler Allgeier and Bijan Robinson also showed up for their vet.\n\n\u201cSeeing Keith come out here and change these kids\u2019 lives, give them an opportunity to come out, play football and just have fun with each other... that is something that I take part in and believe in,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nIn addition, several other former college and professional teammates and friends came out to help with drills: tight end Josh Oliver, running back Ameer Abdullah, safety Jaylinn Hawkins, cornerback Ben\u00e9 Benwikere, linebacker Christian Kirksey, linebacker Elijah Lee, linebacker Will Smith, cornerback Nik Needham, running back Kenjon Barner, safety Eddie Pleasant and defensive end Cassius Marsh. Every coach added a different perspective to the camp\u2019s drills, with various position groups represented on the field.\n\nFollowing brief introductions of the coaches, the kids finally hit the field for a day of skills training. Split into nine groups, the kids start with warmups. By 9 a.m., the energy was high across the board.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all for the kids, seeing a smile on their faces, having them compete, and showing them how to be great,\u201d Allegier said.\n\nAfter warmups, the nine groups split away to various stations, working on lateral agility, catching, blocking and footwork. While there was a fun motive behind every drill, coaches pushed the kids to compete and perform with detail. Every time a player messed up a drill, they did a set of 10 pushups.\n\nAs each coach managed their drills, Smith checked in with every group. With a large smile, Smith brought infectious energy that the parents in the stands and the coaches on the field could feel. Smith\u2019s larger-than-life attitude on Saturday has been his way of life for a long time.\n\n\u201cKeith is a giver; he is always about the community,\u201d Jack Smith, Keith Smith\u2019s high school football coach, said. \u201cHe was always joyful out there [on the football field], giving all he had and producing.\u201d\n\nBut his personality doesn\u2019t just come from football. According to his father, Smith also learned the importance of loving and caring in his early childhood.\n\n\u201cWe love and enjoy life. Everybody is my brother and sister. So that\u2019s what we give, the spirit we put out,\u201d Smith Sr. said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about love, joy, and happiness. And if everybody were like my son and me, this would be heaven.\u201d\n\nThe positive energy that radiated from every coach came through in the drills. Using positive affirmations, coaches uplifted the kids when they messed up a drill and encouraged them not to give up.\n\nVeteran Fullback Keith Smith enters his 11th season in the NFL, sixth with the Falcons. After two hours of drill, coaches had an opportunity to show off their strength in a game of tug-of-war. As the kids gathered around the large inflatable tug-of-war bouncer, fellow Falcon teammates Robinson and Allegier faced off in the age-old game. With pride and bragging rights on the line, Robinson got the better of his teammate.\n\nThe beautiful morning in Covina wrapped up with high school-aged players getting to impress their NFL coaches with one-versus-one repetitions. With coaches watching from the sidelines, the players had the rare opportunity to receive professional advice on how to improve their game.\n\n\u201cLearn football from actual guys that did it ... I think that\u2019s the biggest blessing of it all,\u201d Gurley said.\n\nAfter wrapping up the camp\u2019s fifth-ever edition, Smith headed back to Atlanta for his 11th season in the NFL. He reflected on growing into a leadership role, passing on the lessons of a veteran to his younger teammates.\n\n\u201cI feel he should write a book, because [Smith] has mastered stability, taking care of the community, and giving back in Atlanta and Covina,\u201d Smith Sr. said.\n```"}

The two teams had met just four days before, with Los Angeles falling 3-1 to the Ducks in an offensive snoozefest for the Kings. But back at home, even without top-line center An\u017ee Kopitar in the lineup, who was sidelined with a minor wound, LA found its footing as the game progressed to claim a close win.\n\n\u201c[Kopitar] had something nagging,\u201d said interim head coach Jim Hiller. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna rest anybody, but if there\u2019s something that\u2019s nagging or somebody picked up something tonight, those decisions will be made based on that.\u201d\n\nThe Kings have now won five of their last six games, including three bouts where they only allowed one goal. Los Angeles has also been on a roll at home, winning its last eight games at Crypto.com Arena since March 11. This is a drastic shift from when former head coach Todd McLellan was at the helm, as the team seemingly only thrived on the road. But under Hiller, the Kings are 13-2-1 at home and feeding off the crowd\u2019s energy to take victories with ease.\n\nAlthough LA clinched a postseason berth against the Calgary Flames, there is still a lot to play for; the win against the Ducks gave the Kings a three-point edge over the Vegas Golden Knights, who occupy the second Western Conference Wild Card spot. With just two games remaining and the Kings, Golden Knights and Nashville Predators all neck-and-neck, the conference\u2019s playoff seeding still remains murky. But for now, the Kings still sit in third place in the Pacific Division.\n\nThe first period was stagnant. Both teams went on power plays but couldn\u2019t make anything of them, forcing a scoreless tie at first intermission. But the second period featured two Kings that have dealt with recent scoring woes finding the back of the net.\n\nCenter Pierre-Luc Dubois, who was skating on the first line in Kopitar\u2019s place, took advantage of an early man-advantage chance in the second period. Dubois, along with wingers Viktor Arvidsson and Adrian Kempe, exploited Anaheim\u2019s defense, flinging the puck back and forth. Dubois, open near the right post, caught netminder Lukas Dostal off guard to score his first goal since March 15, his 40th point of the season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re feeling good, we\u2019re having fun out there,\u201d said Dubois. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard; we\u2019re adjusting the little things that we think we can do better at.\u201d\n\nDubois hasn\u2019t performed at the level Los Angeles would\u2019ve hoped given what the franchise surrendered to bring him in, but against the Ducks, he had a stellar performance. The 25-year-old, who usually appears in the bottom six, won eight of his 10 faceoffs on top of his goal.\n\nEight minutes later, Los Angeles found a much-needed insurance goal, courtesy of defenseman Matt Roy. Roy, like Dubois, hadn\u2019t scored since mid-March. The Detroit native took a snipe from the blue line that missed but center Blake Lizotte quickly set up Roy again for another chance that made its way past Dostal, doubling the Kings\u2019 lead.\n\nForward Akil Thomas, who was recently called up from the American Hockey League\u2019s Ontario Reign, notched his first career assist on the play, his fourth point in six games. At the second intermission, LA led 2-0.\n\nGoaltender David Rittich appeared on track for a shutout until center Trevor Zegras beat the glove of the veteran netminder to cut the deficit in half. Rittich still ended up saving 28 of 29 efforts, improving his goals-against average to 2.16 and his save percentage to .921, both career-highs.\n\n\u201cObviously Cam [Talbot] has had more of the workload here over the last six weeks,\u201d said Hiller. \u201cWith David [Rittich], he just comes in and plays really well ... He was probably the difference in the game.\u201d\n\nWinger Kevin Fiala put the nail in the Ducks\u2019 coffin with just over two minutes to go for his 29th goal of the year and third in the last four games. Fiala wrapped his shot around the post from behind the goal for the score, giving the Kings a two-goal edge with limited time left.\n\nLos Angeles struggled to convert chances into goals at the rate it should\u2019ve, but maintained control of the game by winning 68.3% of its faceoffs and posing a constant threat to the Ducks\u2019 defense.\n\n\u201cIt was flat to start, there wasn\u2019t a lot of intensity, but then we got our energy going,\u201d said Hiller. \u201c[Anaheim] played well, you can see the speed they\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nWinning at the right time, the Kings will face the Minnesota Wild and Chicago Blackhawks to close out the season. While seeding should be on the team\u2019s mind, and depending on the way other games fall, the final regular season games could be used to rest certain players and give bottom-liners extra time to enhance their game. LA will host the Wild on Monday at 6:30 p.m., which will be nationally televised on ESPN.\n```"}

(Photo by Alan Mittelstaedt)\n\nBy AC Shick April 14, 2024 at 2:52 pm PDT\n\nPerhaps the ultimate multi-hyphenate, Jane Fonda has held Academy Award-winning acting roles, launched successful workout videos, and then pivoted to championing the climate crisis \u2014spending her 82nd birthday in jail after being arrested at a climate change protest. In an exclusive with Annenberg Media, Fonda shared insights and advice from her six-decade-long career.\n\nFor many of us passionate about climate issues, this connection to nature and the Earth began during childhood. Have you always had a connection to the outdoors?\n\nAll my life. I grew up here in the 1930s, 40s and it wasn\u2019t a happy time in my home. I took solace in nature so I was always outside. I got to know the nature of California on a first-name basis. In the summer I swam every day in the ocean. It made me happy. Walking in forests or climbing up 14,000 feet has always made me happy. Altitude is where I do best. I love to climb. I love to walk. I love to be in forests and high up in the mountains.\n\nFor many young people who care about environmental issues, but are not scientists or climate experts, there is a sense of helplessness. You are someone who\u2019s shown the power of being a creative and being an activist. How would you recommend those starting their career to go about finding the connection between art and environmental justice?\n\nIt\u2019s so important for artists to find a way to express their environmental angst and express the reality of what\u2019s happening, whether that\u2019s painting, sculpture, plays, movies, TV, music. It\u2019s critical because people are moved and transformed, not by what you say to them, but how you make them feel. So, storytelling, images and things that surprise us when we don\u2019t have our guard up can get through in a way that lecturing can\u2019t always.\n\nYou have seen success in a plethora of fields, including acting, modeling, exercise programming and writing, but the throughline has been political activism. How do you know to stay truthful to yourself and your ideology while being successful in a career that doesn\u2019t traditionally allow you to fight for those beliefs?\n\n[Fonda laughs] We all have to earn a living. We all have to ply our trade, whatever it is and we can\u2019t always imbue that work with our deepest values. I was very bothered by the contradiction between the movies I was making and my growing need to be an activist. In the early 70s, I had a mentor who was a Black lawyer. He founded the League of Revolutionary Black Lawyers in Detroit, Michigan, where I was working with UAW [United Automobile Workers] organizers to learn how to be an organizer. I said to him, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to not be an actor anymore because it\u2019s too hard for me when I\u2019m working with people who are in a very different situation in the world.\u201d He said to me, \u201cFonda, the movement has a lot of organizers. We don\u2019t have movie stars. We need movie stars. You should not only keep doing what you\u2019re doing but you got to pay more attention, own it. Own your career, make it work for you as an activist.\u201d So I formed a company and I started making 9 to 5, Coming Home, The China Syndrome, and I enjoyed it a lot more that way. I was able to do that, at that point in my career. I had enough control to where I could make movies that expressed things that I wanted to say. You have to find a style that will carry the message such that people can enjoy it, even if they don\u2019t accept what you\u2019re trying to say. I\u2019m 86 and a big part of me wants to wrap up the acting stuff and be an activist full-time. But, I\u2019m well aware that since, for example, Grace and Frankie was so successful, that has really helped me as an activist. Having a platform is very helpful.\n\nYou\u2019ve seen the world change, whether it\u2019s in Hollywood, the climate crisis or political power, and it\u2019s continuing to change. How have you seen these changes? And, if you look into the future what are your predictions?\n\nI\u2019m a hopeful person. One of the reasons I\u2019m hopeful is because I\u2019m an activist. Maybe five or six years ago, I was really despondent about the climate situation. I was doing stuff, but I knew I could do a lot more given that I have a platform. It was hard for me to even get out of bed, I was so depressed. Then I started Fire Drill Fridays and the minute I started my activism full-on, the depression lifted.\n\nYou\u2019ve been able to reinvent yourself through a variety of successful careers. How do you know when it\u2019s time for a change and while making sure you\u2019re staying true to yourself?\n\nI\u2019m not sure that this answers it, but I just want to say that I\u2019m gonna say this. We\u2019re in a very dangerous time right now, as you know. I think that the most dangerous threat facing us is the climate crisis, because if we don\u2019t confront it in time it\u2019s going to be very hard to achieve democracy, equality, anything that we want in a stable society. When I decided to devote myself to the climate crisis issue full-time, it was to try to alert people of what\u2019s coming. We have about six years to reduce our fossil fuel emissions. Historically, all over the world, problems of the kind that we\u2019re facing right now can be overcome if enough people do something about it. That\u2019s why protests, civil disobedience, nonviolent, can change history. It\u2019s a question of people\u2019s power. I know that sounds rhetorical, and like a cliche, but it\u2019s true. While I have the opportunity, with every ounce of my being, I want to say to the young people that will read this: please vote and vote with climate in your heart. People are worried about climate, but they don\u2019t bring that into the voting booth with them. We have to confront this in order to have a livable future. It\u2019s your future, I\u2019ll be dead.\n\nFinally, I have to ask, what is your favorite hike in L.A.?\n\nWell, the one that I\u2019ve done the most is Runyon Canyon. But, I like Will Rogers. I used to do that a lot.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/13/kings-playoffs-secured/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The wait is over, the Los Angeles Kings have officially secured a bid to the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the third straight year. A stunning loss to the Anaheim Ducks delayed the Kings\u2019 playoff-clinching moment, but they recovered with a 4-1 dismantling of the Calgary Flames at home on Thursday to make their postseason status official. LA now sits one point above the Vegas Golden Knights in the Pacific Division, meaning Vegas holds the second Wild Card place. With just three games remaining on the calendar\u2014all of which are against non-playoff squads\u2014the combination of Los Angeles\u2019 ability to finish strong and other team\u2019s results will ultimately decide who the Kings face in the first round.\n\n\u201cEverybody who\u2019s been involved has been a part of the team reaching the playoffs,\u201d said interim head coach Jim Hiller. \u201cEverybody should be proud of that, it\u2019s a hard thing to do, and more importantly, it\u2019s an exciting thing because now you get to take the next step.\u201d\n\nThree points separate the Edmonton Oilers and Vancouver Canucks for first place in the Pacific. If Edmonton can ignite a spark in its last five games and overtake Vancouver for the top spot, LA could breathe a sigh of relief and could feel more secure at third in the division. But if the Oilers stay in second, it might be in the Kings\u2019 best interest to settle for a Wild Card spot in order to set up a more favorable series against Vancouver. If the season ended today, the Kings would face the Oilers in the first round. Edmonton has defeated Los Angeles in the playoffs in back-to-back seasons and owns a 3-1 record against the Kings this season. On the flip side, LA has dominated the Canucks this year, besting them in three of four matchups with one lone overtime loss. But given the current standings, a matchup with Edmonton seems a likely possibility. However, LA could still face Vancouver if LA falls back to the first Wild Card spot and the Canucks remain on top. But if the Kings drastically regress and slide to the second Wild Card spot, they\u2019d have a nightmare matchup with the Dallas Stars, a team that has wreaked havoc on Hiller\u2019s crew all season.\n\n\u201cYou want to be feeling good going into the playoffs,\u201d said center An\u017ee Kopitar. \u201cIt\u2019s going in feeling good at the right time, and just kind of put a streak together.\u201d\n\nKings starting netminder Cam Talbot nearly recorded a shutout against the Flames and also stayed resilient in LA\u2019s crucial  6-3 win over the Canucks . And while Talbot did struggle in Anaheim, the Kings\u2019 offense didn\u2019t provide much help for him. Los Angeles\u2019 All-Star goalie will look to gain some more consistency come playoff time. At the other end of the ice, winger Adrian Kempe isn\u2019t showing any sign of slowing down either. The Swede has tallied points in all but one game in April and is coming off a stellar March too. Since returning from an upper-body injury, Kempe hasn\u2019t missed a single step. Forwards Akil Thomas and Viktor Arvidsson haven\u2019t been on the ice for nearly as much time as other members of the team, but both have shown flashes of success lately. Since his call-up from the American Hockey League, Thomas has generated three goals in just five games from the fourth line. Arvidsson, on the other hand, scored two against Calgary and has found his teammates for a number of helpers in recent games.\n\n\u201cIn the playoffs, it\u2019s details and puck management,\u201d said Arvidsson. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be ready to battle.\u201d\n\nWhile the playoffs present a grueling road ahead, the Kings have completed their first step of the journey: booking their ticket. Following the three remaining regular-season bouts, Los Angeles will embark on its playoff trip later this month. The Kings will seek revenge against Anaheim at Crypto.com Arena on Saturday at 7:30 p.m.\n```"}

Furthermore, you don\u2019t believe it\u2019s acceptable for a self-proclaimed fan to know nothing about your team beyond its current success. To put it plainly, you hate bandwagon fans. Can\u2019t name everyone on the roster? Not a real fan. Leave before the game ends? Not a real fan. Don\u2019t know the general manager? Not a real fan. Your reasoning is seemingly sound. Why should that person have the right to reap the benefits of your team\u2019s success? Shouldn\u2019t those victories be reserved for the authentic fans who seemingly have earned it?\n\nTake the NBA\u2019s Golden State Warriors. In the 2011-2012 season, they finished 13th in the Western Conference and failed to make the playoffs with a losing record of 23-43. This wasn\u2019t a team on the national radar. Fast forward only a couple years later to 2014. Golden State just clinched an NBA championship, yet the team was only in the infancy of its dynasty. Even if you don\u2019t have Bay Area blood, you could appreciate what the Warriors were doing. Whether you were a true basketball fan or not, it was thrilling to watch. The Warriors were indisputably changing the game of basketball forever. It didn\u2019t matter if you were sitting courtside, in the nosebleeds or on the couch at home because the dynamics of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala were pure magic.\n\nI\u2019m a Lakers fan, and to say that the team was doing poorly in those years was an understatement. Riddled with injuries and failed trade attempts, the Lakers posted consecutive franchise-worst losing records in 2015 and 2016. I might have seen every single Golden State game in those years, rarely flipping the channel to see purple and gold. So when I was incessantly cheering for the Warriors during their five-year championship runs, did that make me a bandwagoner? Certainly. Thousands of people like me dropped previous allegiances to witness and celebrate basketball mastery. Even those who were new to the sport understood and fed into the hype. Maybe you couldn\u2019t explain the value of Curry\u2019s off-ball movement. Maybe you didn\u2019t know how player efficiency was measured. But nothing and nobody could take away from the feeling you felt when Curry hit a game-tying trey in the first round of playoffs against the Pelicans. Or watching Thompson\u2019s 60-point game off of 11 dribbles. Or just seeing Oracle Arena explode in gold and royal blue fashion after each knockdown shot.\n\nTo gatekeep that exhilaration, or to believe that somebody doesn\u2019t deserve that feeling, is selfish and diminishes the true essence of sports: to unite people together in the respect of achievement. American University Trina Ulrich professor discussed the psychological phenomenon of the bandwagon effect in an interview with NPR. It falls on the spectrum of hope, and how fans with high dispositional hope may draw in more casual fans with less dispositional hope. \u201cHormones rise because of motivation and excitement and success,\u201d Ulrich stated in the interview. \u201cWhy not feel this way when you see someone else feeling this way?\u201d\n\nAlthough the term \u201cbandwagon\u201d has evolved into a contemporary context, the very origins of the word might help us remember that sports are a spectacle. Of course their impact goes far beyond that, but at its core, it is crafted entertainment that functions similarly to art. It captivates us and leaves us craving more. Sports communicate a universal language that doesn\u2019t require a hardcore, adamant commitment to a single player or team. Above all, it does not require regulation to enjoy. \u201cSports Mythbusters\u201d runs every other Friday.\n```"}

On Thursday, the final piece of a larger-than-life statue finally came to ruin. Few figures in American culture have traversed the spectrum of adoration and disdain as profoundly as O.J. Simpson. His life, a tapestry woven with triumphs, controversies and, ultimately, a poignant demise, encapsulates the intricate interplay between fame, public perception, and the human experience. Simpson\u2019s life is an emotional observation and case study of the complicated dynamics of celebrity and public scrutiny. His journey from football hero to a figure marked by controversy and tragedy is a testament to the complexities and frailties of fame and infamy. From his meteoric rise as a gridiron great at the University of Southern California, where he earned the prestigious Heisman Trophy, to his illustrious career in the National Football League, Simpson embodied the epitome of athletic excellence. His grace on the field and unparalleled achievements endeared him to millions, elevating him to the status of more than a sporting legend and just short of a god. In his second act, Simpson seamlessly transitioned into entertainment, captivating audiences with his charismatic persona. From acclaimed roles in films such as \u201cThe Towering Inferno\u201d and \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d to his charismatic presence in commercials and television, Simpson\u2019s charm transcended his athletic prowess, cementing his beloved status as a trusted spokesman and entertainer. Yet, as his star and celebrity rose, Simpson\u2019s transition from football hero to cultural icon plunged into the abyss, marked by a series of tumultuous events that would forever alter his public image. The trial for the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, captivated the nation and unearthed centuries of historical complexities of race, fame, and flaws within the justice system. As the trial unfolded, we learned about his abusive habits and manipulative ways, and the Adonis-like statue we crafted began to chip away; mounds of rust began to accumulate on our idol. Our constant desire and insatiable thirst for up-to-date information surrounding the trial gave way to the 24-hour news cycle, reality, and true crime television. Simpson\u2019s trial single-handedly revamped the inner workings of media coverage. His subsequent acquittal in the \u201cTrial of the Century\u201d sparked intense debate and controversy, forever tarnishing Simpson\u2019s reputation. A cross-section of our society relished and celebrated a symbol that encapsulated the frustrations with a racial caste system, while an equal number of people lamented the morose notions that justice went unserved. As the clock expired with Simpson\u2019s battle against cancer, we must examine the totality of his life\u2014a mosaic of triumphs, controversies, and blemishes on his legacy. Despite the shadows that loom like a specter, it is essential to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of his impact on American culture. His journey serves as a sobering reminder of the difficulties and cautionary tales inherent in idolizing public figures and the enduring legacy of their actions. Ultimately, O.J. Simpson\u2019s life is a testament to the intricate razor-thin dance between fame and infamy, triumphs and tragedies. His story serves as a mirror reflecting the ever-shifting landscape of celebrity and public perception\u2014a reminder that behind the glitz and glamor lies the fragile humanity of those we elevate to iconic status. It is a valuable lesson to learn\u2014we don\u2019t know the skeletons these celebrities harbor or the depths of their fallibility. As we bid farewell to a figure that was equally larger than life and infamous, we must confront the nuance of his legacy and yield to the lesson gleaned from his tumultuous journey through the annals of American history\u2014beware of the idols you build.\n```"}

Having just played the night before, Los Angeles rested Paul George and Russell Westbrook and were once again without Kawhi Leonard and James Harden, who were out with knee and foot injuries respectively.\n\nThe final box score may say this game was a blowout, but the Clippers played Phoenix tough despite missing a lot of their star power. Tyronn Lue rolled out a three-guard lineup for the Clippers as Amir Coffey and Terrence Mann took up the backcourt, alongside Bones Hyland, P.J. Tucker and Mason Plumlee in the front. The latter three had the unenviable task of having to slow down Phoenix\u2019s big three of Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal and Devin Booker.\n\nAfter one quarter, the Clippers only trailed by one point as Phoenix led 28-27. Then, it looked like the Suns had broken the game open in the second quarter as Phoenix started the period on a 23-9 scoring run to take a 15-point lead. However, Hyland\u2019s scoring effort kept Los Angeles in the game. The Clippers responded to the Suns\u2019 big scoring run with a 20-4 streak of their own, in which Hyland was responsible for nine of those points. The former Nugget capped off a monster, 24-point first half by hitting a three-pointer at the buzzer to give the Clippers a 56-55 lead going into halftime.\n\nIn the third quarter, both teams scored 37 points and the Clippers entered the fourth with a 93-92 lead, which five points from Coffey helped secure. The Clippers were able to keep it close for some of the fourth quarter, but the Suns\u2019 offensive firepower proved to be too much for a depleted Clippers squad. Phoenix scored 13 straight points and took a 114-106 lead with less than three minutes remaining in the game. The Suns went on a tear and ended the game on a 23-2 run to pick up a 124-108 victory.\n\nBut Los Angeles would not have stood a chance in this matchup if not for the heroics of Hyland and Coffey. Hyland scored a career-high 37 points and Coffey contributed 23 points off the bench. Following the game, Suns star Kevin Durant was highly complimentary of Hyland\u2019s performance after Phoenix had to center their defense around slowing Hyland down in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cI love Bones, I worked out with him this summer,\u201d Durant said post-game. \u201cEvery chance I get to see him on the floor doing his thing is cool except for when it\u2019s against us.\u201d\n\nDespite the loss, the Clippers are still closing out the regular season with a lot of momentum heading into the playoffs. Dating back to Los Angeles\u2019 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on March 27, the Clippers have won seven of their last nine games and still hold the fourth seed in the Western Conference, despite a post-All Star weekend slump.\n\nHealth should be the top priority for the Clippers with just two games remaining in the regular season. Leonard missed his sixth straight game Wednesday and Harden did not play in either of the two matchups against the Suns. Lue will need all of his stars.\n\nThe Clippers have just two games remaining in the regular season as they will host the Utah Jazz on Friday and the Houston Rockets on Sunday. With a 51-29 record after the loss to Phoenix, the Clippers are locked into a first round matchup against the Dallas Mavericks, a team they have played and beaten in the postseason twice since 2020. Although the matchup between the two teams is confirmed, there is still a chance that the Clippers could fall to the fifth seed if they lose their final two games and the Mavericks win their final two games, thus swapping the team with the home-court advantage in a seventh game. Los Angeles will need to take care of business during the final weekend of the regular season to secure that advantage for the first round.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/12/lakers-los-angeles-misses-anthony-davis-as-warriors-cruise-to-crucial-win/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 Before Tuesday, the Lakers had three games remaining in their regular season schedule and they needed to make them all count in order to secure the easiest path to the playoffs. But with Anthony Davis out, that goal fell through and the Warriors trounced the Lakers in a 134-120 win. Davis and LeBron James were both questionable and game-time decisions, leaving many Lakers fans worried about the team\u2019s chance to take down the Warriors for a fourth time in 2023-24 James literally told reporter Dave McMenamin before the game \u201cI\u2019m about to find out\u201d as to whether or not he\u2019d play, which he did end up doing, dropping 33 points to go with 11 assists and seven rebounds. Meanwhile, Davis was ruled out due to nausea and a headache. His absence, especially on defense, was crucial to the Warriors success. Golden State launched a season-high 26 three-pointers in the win. Klay Thompson led the team in points with 27, including and five threes. Per usual, Stephen Curry led the team in made three-pointers with six and finished with 23 points, but Draymond Green\u2019s statline raised some eyebrows. The 34-year-old power forward turned back the clock with a 15-point, 10-assist and six-rebound performance. He accumulated those 15 by shooting five-for-seven from deep, setting a personal season record for threes. Besides James for the Lakers, Rui Hachimura and Austin Reaves stepped up nicely on offense, as they both finished with 20 or more points. Even Jaxon Hayes made the most of a rare opportunity in the starting lineup, finishing with 11 points and six rebounds and shooting five-for-six from the field. On the other hand, D\u2019Angelo Russell and Taurean Prince had abysmal outings shooting-wise, going three-for-11 and one-for-six from the field respectively. Along with Prince, the bench failed to produce much in the game. Spencer Dinwiddie was the Lakers\u2019 only bench player who had a solid game, finishing with 12 points. Dinwiddie aside, the Lakers\u2019 bench combined for eight points. Without Davis, the Lakers looked like a shell of themselves defensively. Sure, the team is prioritizing health instead of aiming for a higher seed now that their spot in the postseason is secured, but allowing Green to torch them from beyond the arc is worrying no matter what. Next, the Lakers will play the Memphis Grizzlies and current six-seed New Orleans to round out their season. The Sacramento Kings, who hold a half-game lead over the Lakers for the eighth seed, play the Pelicans, Phoenix Suns and Portland Trail Blazers to close their regular season schedule. After the Lakers\u2019 loss to the Warriors, it\u2019ll be more difficult to see them passing the Kings to potentially play one fewer play-in game. The Kings, however, are .500 in their last ten games and the pendulum could swing away from their favor as they play the Pelicans and Suns, who are fighting for a higher playoff spot. A more realistic expectation is that the Lakers win both of their remaining games, but the Kings also win two of their three remaining games. This would give the teams the same record, but since the Lakers haven\u2019t defeated the Kings once this season, Sacramento would hold the tiebreaker. In order to make a deep playoff run like they accomplished last season, the Lakers should focus on ensuring James and Davis are fully healthy for the postseason. They can beat the Warriors or Suns if needed, but they\u2019ll need to get over the hill of the Kings \u2014which the Lakers have struggled with this season \u2014 if the two teams end up facing off against each other. The Lakers will play the Grizzlies in Memphis on Friday, April 12 at 5 p.m., where Davis should hopefully be back to give Los Angeles a much-needed boost.\n```"}

Even when eventually 50 police units arrived, no one asked us what had happened.\u201d\n\nThe incident started when Quiles returned to her apartment around 4 p.m, only to encounter a person she didn\u2019t recognize yelling to gain entry into the complex. Shortly thereafter, Quiles said the stranger jumped the fence and smashed a window with a pot to gain entry to the apartment. After a brief confrontation with the residents, the stranger took a water bottle and a clock before leaving.\n\nThat\u2019s when they called both DPS and police. According to DPS, the alleged burglar returned to the apartment less than two hours later. By then, Quiles\u2019 roommate Melissa Ayala was also home and in the kitchen with Quiles when the intruder entered the apartment a second time and lingered by the front door, prompting the students to begin filming.\n\n\u201cWe were sitting on the couch, right by the door entrance,\u201d Ayala said. \u201cI was eating my food, then all of a sudden I heard someone barge in. I looked up and I felt my heart kind of sink a little bit.\u201d\n\nThe intruder spoke to the students like they were a familiar friend, asking them for food. When asked to leave, they grabbing dry erase markers and other random items in reach before leaving once again.\n\nQuiles and her roommates were disheartened by what they claimed was a lackluster response by DPS and the LAPD. \u201cThe situation [...] was handled by the LAPD,\u201d DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said. \u201cThey made all the decisions.\u201d\n\nHowever, the LAPD said they turned control over to DPS. \u201cThat day, according to our [dispatch], USC handled it,\u201d an LAPD spokesperson said.\n\nLAPD officers arrived on the scene after the second break-in, when the students called 911 to report the repeat burglary. By then, the person had already been seen down the street behind a parking garage where they entered an abandoned house. Thirty minutes later, smoke was seen coming from the empty home. A stand-off would follow after LAPD\u2019s mental health unit arrived while other officers evacuated nearby apartments.\n\nHours later, just before midnight, the LAPD made the decision not to arrest the person. Quiles and Ayala said they watched the entire situation unfold 300-feet in front of their apartment on a Citizen livestream. That\u2019s how they knew both DPS and LAPD left the person who had already broken into their home twice alone, leaving the pair in fear the intruder would try a third time since they were only a short walk away.\n\n\u201cWe fully were convinced that they\u2019re gonna get this guy,\u201d Quiles said. \u201cThen the police literally leave on the livestream, we were genuinely so confused. \u2018This actually cannot be real. There\u2019s no way that they all just left.\u2019\u201d\n\nA miscommunication between DPS and LAPD could have contributed to the conflicting responses in the aftermath of the incident, and the lack of coordination dealing with the victims.\n\n\u201cThe suspect was arrested at the location the next morning by LAPD officers,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cDPS received the original call the day before, but turned the investigation over to the LAPD. \u201cWe supported LAPD by helping set up a perimeter around the building to keep people away from the scene and directing traffic,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhatever support LAPD requested.\u201d\n\nQuiles whatever happened between the two agencies, they themselves didn\u2019t get assistance from either LAPD and DPS. \u201cI ended up calling LAPD again and the dispatch person said, \u2018So when this guy came back to your house, you didn\u2019t call 911 because we have no record,\u2019\u201d Quiles said, despite having made the call that got LAPD to respond the day before. \u201cTurns out it was because of a miscommunication.\u201d\n\nDespite the confusion, Carlisle said the students did the right thing by not confronting the intruder and reporting the incident to both DPS and the police.\n```"}

Fonda talked about what sparked her desire for environmental activism, saying her goal was not only to help restore a world she cares about but also to inspire other older women as well as the younger generations.\n\nThe actress also revealed that most of her desire for environmental protection began when she was younger and moved back to California. \u201cIt was a glorious sun. Every day, I heard songbirds and you know, I knew all kinds of animals and I was in the ocean every day during summer,\u201d Fonda said. \u201cI didn\u2019t come back to California until quite a bit later. \u201cThere were freeways, there was smog and my eyes burned,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t understand how people who lived in California weren\u2019t bothered by what they seem to take for granted.\u201d\n\nFonda also touched on present issues surrounding the usage of fossil fuels, corporations, President Joe Biden\u2019s involvement with environmental justice and how the current conflict in Gaza has affected the environment. Touching all of these issues, Fonda told the audience, was environmental journalism and making sure the public was informed.\n\nFonda said she wanted to ensure that future generations of journalists would stay true to their beliefs and hold people accountable for protecting their planet. There were a few moments of tension during the discussion that drew a reaction from the audience, as Fonda made comments on Annenberg\u2019s funding and Dean Bay\u2019s marriage to Disney\u2019s CEO.\n\n\u201cYou know, one of the big problems with journalism schools is that there\u2019s this toxic relationship between journalism and corporations, because often corporations fund journalism school,\u201d Fonda said. \u201cThis probably is too, right. No? OK, good. But very often, they\u2019re funded by corporations.\u201d\n\nTemperature Check also featured a panel of experts who spoke after Fonda. Sammy Roth, a climate columnist at the L.A. Times and Allison Agsten, director of the USC Center for Climate Journalism and Communication took to the stage for a conversation moderated by L.A. Times reporter Faith Pinho.\n\nThey shared similar sentiments to Fonda, and encouraged and coming journalists to write about environmental issues and drive home why the climate is so important. \u201cImagine if we didn\u2019t know that burning fossil fuels was killing us,\u201d Agsten said. \u201cSomebody has to tell that story. \u201cSo we have to tell that story convincingly with all the facts in place, but also in a way that really moves people to listen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also have to talk about those innovations so that people want to adopt them. The storytelling is not just important, it\u2019s in fact, essential.\u201d\n\nThe event was well attended, with both students and local residents coming to see Fonda. \u201cI think what I found the best part of it was how positive she is, it made me feel a little bit less cynical, because you know, she\u2019s 86, and I\u2019m 24,\u201d Sofia Anguita, a new admit to USC, said. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, I should be a little bit more positive and hopeful and wanting to take more action.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to clarify that although KCRW Reporter Caleigh Wells was listed on the Temperature Check program, she did not attend the event.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Io Weintraub)\n\nBy Amrita Vora April 12, 2024 at 9:14 am PDT\n\nAlthough USC\u2019s Fashion Industry Association (FIA) will hold their annual fashion show this Saturday, April 13, rehearsals and dress fittings have been underway for months. This year\u2019s theme is sonder, which, by definition means \u201cthe feeling that one has on realizing that every other individual one sees has a life as full and real as one\u2019s own.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe actually look at the designers first, and then we pick the theme,\u201d Evelyn Zhong, head of events at FIA and a junior majoring in urban studies and planning, said. \u201cSo sonder is our way of portraying how each designer, each collection, each person has a separate distinct style and life and we really want to celebrate that diversity of [...] what we present to people, how we give the experience to the audience members.\u201d\n\nThe events, casting and outreach team came together to search for designers whose looks they can incorporate into the show by creating groups of designers that have a distinct theme. Not all of the designers are USC students, but they are all based in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cMy vision with [the theme] is promoting everybody\u2019s uniqueness, how everybody can style clothes in different ways and show off their personality just through clothes without even saying words,\u201d Co-President of FIA, Justin Tsai, a sophomore studying business administration with an emphasis in marketing, said.\n\nFrom designer Angela Li\u2019s reconstructed denim textiles to Ky Jeon\u2019s hand-painted pieces on recycled fabric, Tsai\u2019s sentiment is echoed in the variety of outfits and the difference in the aesthetics of the designer.\n\n\u201cHis [designer Max Rosenberg] designs are jackets and a lot of weave work,\u201d said Sage Cordsen, a PHD student who is modeling in the show. \u201cIt is really awesome homemade stuff.\u201d\n\nAnd no two designs are the same.\n\n\u201c[Designer Miranda Moreno] is doing a wonderful line inspired by winter and ice queens, and if you\u2019ve ever watched \u2018Sharkboy and Lavagirl,\u2019 the snow queen is the inspiration for the look,\u201d said Hanah Abualhaj, FIA model and senior majoring in communication.\n\nModels Le\u00f3n Prieto and Vincent Li explained that the models had to audition in front of the FIA executive board. While Prieto had walked for FIA before, Li was new to the experience and he wasn\u2019t the only one. Over 100 auditioned, many with no prior experience. Once they were chosen for the show, the designers then picked who they wanted for their looks.\n\n\u201cTo me, this experience means an adventure,\u201d said Fernanda Tapia, a model majoring in film production and theater. \u201cFind what makes you, you, and put that in your walk,\u201d Tapia said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a high fashion runway walk, it has to be a \u2018you\u2019 walk.\u201d\n\nTo see the designs and models, attend the show this upcoming Saturday from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m at 300 S Mission Road. Notable vendors include Dulce, Tinder and Fiji Water. More information can be found on the USC FIA Instagram page, where tickets are available to purchase through the link in their bio.\n```"}

She reveled in the birdsong, but then, after going away for many years, she came back to freeways, smog, way more people and way more buildings. But what really pushed her over the edge wasn\u2019t until the 2019 climate catastrophe in L.A. where there were raging wildfires. Fonda: Five years ago I went outside and the sky was orange brown. Remember how it was when all these wildfires? It was 112 degrees and I read that birds were falling dead out of the sky over Texas and Arizona because they were forced to fly inland when they migrated because of the fires, and they were dying of dehydration and lack of nourishment. And I got - I was so depressed, that I couldn\u2019t get out of bed.\n\nWhat pulled Jane Fonda out of her climate despair was a manuscript that arrived at just the right time for her of Naomi Klein\u2019s book \u201cOn Fire.\u201d In that book Klein outlines urgent actions she says must be taken to save the planet. So Fonda picked up her phone and called the director of Greenpeace: Annie Leonard. Together, the two launched Fire Drill Fridays. They rally as many people for non-violent action, hoping to effect change from the bottom up.\n\nFonda: Our goal was not to influence government, particularly. We knew because of research that was done that almost 70% of Americans are concerned about the climate. Thirty percent of them are willing to engage in in civil disobedience and risk getting arrested. When asked why they don\u2019t, they said well, nobody asked me. So Fonda asked them.\n\nFonda: And it started small, 50 people, it ended up with thousands and the unasked. And they were mostly women and as I look here, and I said to Willow- Willow Bay: You pulled me aside and said \u2018look at this room. It\u2019s filled with women\u2019 and I said that\u2019s how we roll.\n\nFonda\u2019s community-based activism has been guided by something Greenpeace Director Annie Leonard told her.\u201d If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\u201d And Fonda believes that if enough people join in then maybe government officials will realize how people really do care about climate policy, and then politicians will be forced to act.\n\nFonda: We\u2019re vulnerable when we\u2019re individuals. That\u2019s why the powers that be hate the word collective. Hate the notion of public sphere, public good. They want to keep us working as individuals because we don\u2019t have as much power as we do when we joined together.\n\nFor USC students Fonda had these messages: practice sustainable fashion, don\u2019t sleep with anyone involved in oil companies, and then one of her strongest pieces of advice to students was to vote in this years election. And Fonda said, vote for Biden.\n\nFonda: who we elect as president, this year in this country, is going to do a lot in determining what kind of future you all are gonna grow up in. I mean, I am furious with Joe Biden, okay? He made so many promises before he was elected that he hasn\u2019t lived up to. But I also know what he has done. And it is profound. It\u2019s not sexy, it\u2019s not always front page news. But he\u2019s making possible the transition to the alternative green future. What electing Biden does is it provides us a playing field, a context in which we can fight. Fixing climate change is a fight and will be for years to come. Best done in large groups, Fonda says. But she also says it\u2019s not just a grind.\n\nFor someone who has won Oscars, is a beloved fitness guru and has the longest running show on Netflix, she\u2019s still committed. And now she\u2019s enjoying the good fight to save the planet.\n\nFonda: It\u2019s fun. You know, this is not eating your broccoli. This is fun. It\u2019s fun to be an activist in a movement and meet people who are like you and have the same values. Fun, but serious. Necessary, and has to happen now.\n\nJane Fonda told us today at Annenberg\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Katie Simons.\n```"}

O.J. was acquitted, but a lot of people think he was guilty. People couldn\u2019t tear their eyes away from the TV screen as they watched police cars follow a white Ford Bronco with Simpson inside possibly trying to flee. CNN Audio: I think I just saw O.J. Simpson on the 5 Freeway. He\u2019s heading north.\n\nMonths later, on the edge of their seats, people watched the nationally televised court trial. The mass media coverage stopped people in their tracks allowing them to become fully immersed and influencing their perceptions. Here\u2019s Annenberg Media Law Professor Adrienne Lawrence.\n\nAdrienne Lawrence: We had the opportunity to watch a lot of the prosecution unfold on late night TV or through the news media... and as a result of that, it brought a major litigation into the home of most Americans. And it really interjected people into the legal system. That direct view influenced hearts and minds.\n\nLawrence: The mass media coverage certainly influenced people\u2019s perceptions of not only policing, but our justice system. From their couches people were felt like they were at the trial, what would seem to be the trial of the century. More invested than ever, people consumed the media coverage of the trial, anxiously awaiting the final verdict.\n\nAgain Professor Lawrence... Lawrence: We\u2019re in a situation where you have a potential uprising coming up as a result of a prosecution, for prosecution involving a black man. And what would come of that? So, a lot of people were very engaged, they wanted to know how is this going to end?\n\nThe trial ended when the jury found O.J. Simpson not guilty of murder. Some people celebrated and many others held onto their reservations, remaining steadfast in their belief that O.J. was guilty. A few years later, in a civil trial, a different trial jury found Simpson liable for the two deaths and ordered him to pay more than 33 million dollars to the families of Brown and Goldman.\n\nThe Heisman Trophy that Simpson won while playing for USC Football is displayed in Heritage Hall. His jersey hangs in the Coliseum. Senior business major, Sujay Alapati respects Simpson\u2019s achievements playing Trojan football.\n\nSujay Alapati: I think even though despite all the accusations and everything, I think he should still be remembered as one of the greatest athletes here.\n\nOver the years, some students have advocated that Simpson\u2019s Heisman be removed from display. Student, Ethan Wu disagrees with that.\n\nWu: What OJ kind of did at USC, I think is important just by itself, and like his accolades and everything that he\u2019s been able to accumulate and do for the Trojan name is definitely still worth remembering.\n\nO.J. Simpson is remembered today through the complexities of his life and the media portrayals. For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Paulena Edelman.\n```"}

Simpson dies of cancer at 76\n\nUSC grapples with the legacy of the former football player, actor, and broadcaster whose rise began on campus.\n\nO.J. Simpson was added to the USC Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994. (Annenberg Media Staff)\n\nBy Jake Petroff and Solana Espino\nApril 11, 2024 at 5:28 pm PDT\n\nO.J. Simpson was a leading man in field, film, and felonies\u2014with breakout football success, movie and marketing fame, and a notorious 1995 trial. The 76-year-old died Wednesday after a brief battle with prostate cancer. A post shared by his family on X, formerly known as Twitter, Thursday morning announced his passing; the news of his sudden death has brought Simpson\u2019s life, a unique series of highs and lows, into the spotlight once again.\n\nOn June 12, 1994, O.J. Simpson\u2019s ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson, along with her friend Ronald Goldman, were found stabbed to death outside her home in Los Angeles. Five days later, the former football star was arrested following a police chase that left much of America in shock. \u201c[The] guy who stars in comedies, in movies and Hertz ads, and [who] was this great football player,\u201d said Judy Muller, a professor of journalism at USC and a reporter on The People v. O.J. Simpson trial. \u201cThis is like arresting Donald Duck, what are you doing?\u201d\n\nSimpson was eventually charged with the murder of his former wife and her friend, feeding into the media frenzy surrounding the ordeal. \u201cThis case was a major spectacle,\u201d Muller said. \u201cI believe the O.J. Simpson case and trials were very, very, very important. They held up a mirror, albeit a cracked mirror, to America.\u201d\n\nFollowing his trial, the media attention only grew for Simpson. This became especially apparent as the USC Law Center \u201cdominated analysis of the trial,\u201d according to a 1995 article from the University of Southern California Chronicle. With no shortage of television specials, films, books, and more covering the life and trial of the American superstar, Simpson\u2019s story would forever be ingrained in popular culture \u2014 from his meteoric rise to his controversial fall.\n\nThat rise started at USC. O.J. Simpson, commonly referred to as \u201cThe Juice,\u201d was born in San Francisco on July 9, 1947. As a child, he wore leg braces for several years due to rickets, a calcium deficiency. However, he outgrew his disability, turning to football at 15. Simpson would begin his collegiate career in the sport at San Francisco City College in 1966, before transferring to USC in 1967. At USC, he would eventually become a record breaker, lead the Trojans to the 1968 Rose Bowl game, and win the 1968 Heisman trophy. \u201cOJ Simpson was like the football star of the United States. [He was the] quarterback at USC. He was the Heisman Trophy winner \u2014 he was amazing,\u201d Muller said.\n\nAn excerpt from one 1968 article from the Daily Trojan makes USC\u2019s view of Simpson at the time clear: \u201cThe student body, the Trojan team, the coaches, and all those who have known him will agree. O.J. has been the good guy for Troy for two years.\u201d\n\nToday, almost 30 years after his country-shaking trial, Simpson\u2019s reputation around the University\u2019s campus has dramatically changed. His success on the football field alongside numerous other accolades have been pushed to the side. \u201cI definitely forgot about that [his football career] just because of his criminal record, basically. And I think that he goes under wraps here athletically, we don\u2019t really pay respect to him as an athlete here anymore,\u201d said junior communications major Mia Triolo. \u201cI don\u2019t really care, you know, the devil got him.\u201d\n\nAlthough Simpson is still a member of the USC Athletic Hall of Fame, along with having his jersey on display in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, many are unable to look past his decisions off the field. As of Thursday evening, USC has yet to comment on the death of the former university superstar.\n```"}

From getting ousted from Glendale\u2019s Gila River Arena to having their Tempe arena plan denied by public voters to being ridiculed for sharing a 4,600-seat venue with Arizona State, the Yotes are still yet to find a concrete solution for their future long-term residency.\n\nRecently, the team released renderings and a plan to build a privately funded, 17,000-seat arena in northern Phoenix, complemented by an entertainment district, restaurants, retail options, housing and more. The Coyotes are set to bid on a 95-acre strip of state-owned land on June 27, which yields an asking price of $68.5 million. Although the auction\u2019s outcome could very well ultimately decide the fate of the franchise, the path to securing the land could potentially be interrupted by a sale and relocation of the team to Utah.\n\nThe Coyotes' new district will be anchored by a multi-purpose sport and entertainment arena that will serve as the new permanent home for the team. It would be the first-ever privately-funded sports arena and entertainment district in the history of Arizona. #YotesForever pic.twitter.com/PWExg5X8RL \u2014 Arizona Coyotes (@ArizonaCoyotes) April 5, 2024\n\nCoyotes President Xavier Gutierrez and company remain clear that \u201cHockey Belongs in Arizona\u201d (featured in the team\u2019s X bio) and Gutierrez said that the franchise will \u201cnot [be] asking for taxpayer money.\u201d Different from other relocation sagas, it\u2019s not that the Coyotes necessarily want out of Arizona. But the ownership\u2019s ineptitude in conjunction with the tall task of building a multi-use facility in a congested area has made the team\u2019s demise a nightmare for loyal Yotes fans.\n\nObtaining the prized plot and constructing a new arena on it might not be feasible given the recent momentum brewing in Salt Lake City and Scottsdale Mayor David Ortega\u2019s voiced concerns. Since the proposed arena district sits on the border between Phoenix and Scottsdale, Ortega outwardly opposed any possibility of the team building there, adding that Scottsdale wouldn\u2019t provide any water assets to the project and that the plan was \u201cglitzy,\u201d a \u201cfantasy,\u201d lacking adequate infrastructure and posing traffic risks.\n\nOne might ask why the mayor of an entirely separate city should have the right to barge in on a privately built project, and it\u2019s a valid question; Ortega technically shouldn\u2019t. His opposing views certainly don\u2019t help the cause, since his comments could possibly influence the conditions of winning the land auction, which could throw roadblocks in the way of the arena plan.\n\nMeanwhile, Utah Jazz owner Ryan Smith, who has been longing for an NHL team for quite some time, has eyed the Coyotes as a prospect to relocate to Salt Lake City. While the Coyotes aim to bid on the Phoenix land in June, a plan involving Coyotes owner Alex Meruelo selling the team to Smith for $1.3 billion could occur much sooner than the auction date. The sale would imminently move the Coyotes out of Arizona \u2014 the site of the team since 1996 \u2014 and over to Utah under a brand new name and identity, effectively killing off the iconic Kachina look.\n\nThe NHL would act as the middleman in the deal, buying the franchise from Meruelo and selling it at a more expensive price to Smith, dividing the extra money ($300 million) among the other team owners. However, the death of the Arizona Coyotes could possibly give heartbroken fans a new team to look forward to. Commissioner Gary Bettman has previously expressed that Arizona is a viable hockey market, so allowing the current ownership group to revive the Coyotes in the form of an expansion franchise isn\u2019t out of the question.\n\nBut Bettman has also stated that the league doesn\u2019t plan to expand anytime soon, and if it did, Arizona would have to compete with the likes of Houston and Atlanta, who also fiend for NHL teams. However, Arizona could be seen as a unique case since the NHL would ultimately be facilitating the Coyotes\u2019 move to Salt Lake City and sees the Phoenix market as a dependable one; so rebirthing the team in the region could come sooner rather than later. But in any league, expansion is an expensive, lengthy process, so there would be no guarantee whatsoever.\n\nIf the Coyotes do wind up in Utah, they would share the existing Delta Center with the Jazz until they would both eventually move into a brand new facility. The Coyotes\u2019 potential move to Salt Lake City wouldn\u2019t be their first in franchise history. The original Winnipeg Jets, who were founded in the World Hockey Association in 1972 before joining the NHL in 1979, are the reason for the dawn of hockey in Arizona. The Jets became the Coyotes in 1996 in the wake of financial issues that resulted in the team\u2019s relocation to the desert.\n\nThe Coyotes have had a colorful history since the mid-1990s, literally and figuratively. The team\u2019s unique brand identity that pays homage to the Pueblo people features splashes of purple, green, orange, red, black and cream, all working together to form a retro stick-holding Kachina Coyote logo.\n\nThe Arizona Coyotes' \"Kachina\" logo. (Photo courtesy of NHL.com)\n\nOn the ice, the team has never reached the Stanley Cup Finals and has seen its fair share of controversies over the years. Team ownership even filed for bankruptcy in 2009, forcing a sale of the franchise to the NHL, which it operated until 2013. This season could be the last year of the Arizona Coyotes as we know them. Through 79 games played, the squad has been eliminated from playoff consideration at just 73 points.\n\nSmith has already asked his X followers for suggestions on a team name, should it land one in the Beehive State.

Kazliner: I honestly think that, you know, the giants are so close, I don\u2019t think the ballers are going to get that big of traction. I think they\u2019re a cool idea. I\u2019m all in support of like small businesses, like small grassroots organizations starting teams, but I don\u2019t really think they\u2019re not going to be good or competitive. And so I think it\u2019s a little bit of a joke.\n\nParker thinks the A\u2019s eventual move to their new stadium in Las Vegas will finally bring success to their franchise. Parker: There\u2019ll be an influx of capital for that organization with the new TV deal, you know, with all kinds of new merchandising, with Las Vegas A\u2019s on it, and all kinds of stuff. So I expect things to turn around.\n\nThe A\u2019s have gotten off to a 4-7 start this season and sit third out of five in the American League West.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Tobey Groome.\n```"}

Erica Bergamyer, the Associate Director for donor communication, strategy and recognition, told Annenberg Media the event was a great way for students to become involved in the campus culture of practicing gratitude. The event took place in McCarthy quad and featured various activities such as a note writing, photo, and food station.\n\nBergamyer: We are grateful SC is a new event that we\u2019re hoping to do annually at least. But it\u2019s really a way for us to gather messages of gratitude that can be shared with our donors at a later time. So we have a couple of different activities ... to just let everyone on campus have an opportunity to say thank you to our donors for their generosity and the impact that they have here on campus.\n\nBergamyer believes that students and staff have a multitude of reasons to be thankful to donors, especially for the scholarship and facilities they fund. According to USC\u2019s 2023 Financial Statements, the university garnered around 386 million dollars from donations in the year ending June 30 2023.\n\nSenior Executive Director of stewardship and donor relations in the university advancement office, Gina Galluppi, expressed how organizers coordinated the event to bring the campus together and educate them on the importance of donors.\n\nGalluppi: So people make donations for scholarships. So students who receive scholarship to come here to USC, wouldn\u2019t that wouldn\u2019t happen if we didn\u2019t have donors who supported that. It\u2019s used to hire, hire and retain good faculty. So the important research that\u2019s happening across this campus and across the Medical Center campus. It benefits everybody, the larger community and the world.\n\nAditi Sonawane is a graduate student at Marshall and attended the event. Sonawane: I really appreciate the efforts that the donors and also the Institute has put into bringing students together and establishing great connections within the students. I feel just to have a lot of spaces, the campus almost make seems so accessible and it\u2019s almost like a home. We\u2019ve got everything on campus that we need from all the good food facilities, all the good study spaces, relaxation spaces, or even the libraries.\n\nOrganizers hope to host this event every year and hope that more Trojans express gratuity for the donors.\n\nFrom Annenberg, I\u2019m YeJi Jong.\n```"}

Ramadan is a month-long period of fasting, prayer and reflection. It also marks the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Ramadan is the holiest month of the year for over two billion Muslims across the globe. This time is used to strengthen their relationship with God and their religion. Muslims around the world have been fasting from all food and water from dawn to sunset for the past month, and at Eid they return to their regular lifestyles. Eid Al-Fitr and Laylat al\u2013Qadr are the two Islamic festivals celebrated. Eid Al-Fitr is also known as the \u201cfestival of breaking fast.\u201d The festival occurs the day after seeing the new moon. Muslims celebrate Eid by dressing up, eating food and spending time with friends and family.\n\nAs many USC students are far away from home, Muslim students said they have found a community and home away from home on campus. Student Penda Ba said that in a poll conducted by the Muslim Student Union, 75% of Muslim students would choose to be on campus during Eid. Early Tuesday morning, students gathered for the Eid prayer at Masjid Omar. In the afternoon, the students celebrated with a potluck. Penda Ba, a junior studying global health, started the Eid potluck her freshman year because there wasn\u2019t anything on campus. \u201cI knew a lot of my friends and I wanted to be able to do something,\u201d said Ba.\n\nThe event was particularly special for Hisham Anwar, the Muslim Student Union vice president. \u201cIt means a lot. I grew up in Doha, Qatar, so I don\u2019t have family here. So it\u2019s just the MSU that\u2019s my family here,\u201d said Anwar. \u201cI literally pray with them, spend time with them, go to classes with them, study with them ... So it\u2019s A to Z MSU.\u201d \u201cI had that experience freshman year of being worried whether or not I would have people to celebrate with,\u201d Ba said. \u201cI want to provide that for the freshmen this year, a lot of whom are out of state, and just create that environment.\u201d\n\nPareesa Fawad, a freshman studying biotechnology, said, \u201cIt\u2019s so cool because you\u2019re so used to celebrating with your family, and then when you get to celebrate with people, it makes you feel less homesick,\u201d said Fawad. \u201cEven during the month of fasting, getting to break fast with people that you know and care about, it\u2019s a nice feeling. It\u2019s like home away from home.\u201d \u201cJust seeing the community come out today has been so heartwarming, and I can\u2019t wait for more of this and better in the future,\u201d said Ba.\n```"}

GratefulSC changes that. The Trojan network is something students hear about all throughout their time at USC. They hear how many trojans there are out there and how philanthropic they are for the school, but students may never physically see or meet them.\n\nOn Wednesday, the GratefulSC event on McCarthy Quad brought together students, faculty and alumni to thank donors and alumni for the assistance they give USC. This year marks the inaugural event.\n\n\u201cGratefulSC is another way for the university advancement office to thank our donors,\u201d said Senior Executive Director of Stewardship and Donor Relations in the University Advancement Office Gina Galluppi. \u201cWe wanted to engage our entire campus community, faculty, staff and students in just saying thank you in different ways.\u201d\n\nSignificant recent donations from alumni include a $40 million gift to expand research with Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, a $260 million donation to a foundation that supports USC and a $59 million donation from healthcare leader Leonard D. Schaeffer and his wife to establish the Leonard D. Schaeffer Institute for Public Policy & Government Service at the USC Capital Campus in Washington, D.C.\n\nAt the event, there were different stations for students and faculty to share their appreciation. There were multiple tables under tents: one to write letters to donors, another to tape a thank you video and another for snacks for the people attending.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to use these different stations in different ways,\u201d Galluppi said. \u201cWe\u2019re sending out cards, sending out videos and emails to donors to say thank you from the Trojan family.\u201d\n\nThe event was right next to the weekly farmer\u2019s market on McCarthy Quad.\n\n\u201cWe usually come to the Farmer\u2019s Market so we wanted to stop by and see what it was about,\u201d said Marcy Higareda, who graduated from the School of Social Work with her master\u2019s degree in 2010. \u201cAnything that is about giving back to folks that can support USC is always appreciated.\u201d\n\nWhile showing appreciation for alumni and donors, GratefulSC gives students the opportunity to connect with alumni and use that Trojan network that they hear so frequently about.\n\n\u201cNetworking is one of the reasons I was excited to come to USC as a grad student. I heard all about the strong network of the Trojan family,\u201d Higareda said. \u201cSo I love that there\u2019s an opportunity for us alumni to connect with current students.\u201d\n\nWhile the network itself is important, Galluppi wants students to realize that the network wouldn\u2019t be possible without the alumni and their support.\n\n\u201cStudents start to get a sense of how critical it is to the university, their ability to go here, the ability to hire great faculty and the ability to have great facilities,\u201d Galluppi said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have all of this if we didn\u2019t have the philanthropy of our donors.\u201d\n\nThis is the inaugural GratefulSC, but the university advancement office does plan on doing it annually. The university special events department sent out broad communications for the students, faculty and staff to sign up for GratefulSC.\n\nGalluppi hopes that the donors really get \u201ca sense of the appreciation and impact they have on the university\u201d through this event.\n\n\u201cOne thing that we hear from donors all the time is how their money is being used.

Many organizations and people are supportive of this temporary ban on permits to breed dogs. Senior VP of PETA, Lisa Lange said this was a step in the right direction to ensure the safety of animals in Los Angeles.\n\nLange: Well, it\u2019s criminal that anyone would breed dogs. While there are so many homeless ones in our Los Angeles shelters. And now it is officially criminal to breed dogs in the city of Los Angeles. And we\u2019re thrilled. It\u2019s a good first step. It is not the answer. But it\u2019s a good first step.\n\nPETA also known as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, is a nonprofit animal rights organization and is the largest animal rights organization in the world. Its mission is to end abusive treatment in society and promote consideration of animal interests.\n\nAccording to a press release from city council member Eunisses Hernandez. Animal Services issued more than 1,100 breeding permits for just the first half of this year. High rates of breeding in the city can lead to less resources for dogs in shelters.\n\nLange said dogs in city shelters aren\u2019t treated well. Lange: Animals were being kept in cages for months, many animals were being turned away, none of the prevention was getting done, meaning spay neuter. And then of course, we got hit with the pandemic, which meant that people got animals and then when they went back to work in school, they turned them into the shelters, which is something we also warned about. You have to bring the population down through prevention and adoption. And none of that was done. So here we are.\n\nThe ban will stay in place until the number of dogs in city shelters is reduced for three months. In the same press release city council member Hernandez said, \u201cIt is unacceptable for the city to continue issuing breeding permits while thousands of animals are suffering from overcrowded conditions in shelters. This is a critical step to help mitigate the inflow of pets into our shelters and ensure that animals in our care are able to find forever homes.\u201d\n```"}

He was set to run as a Democrat when he initially announced his candidacy in 2023 but later switched to the Green Party. In October, he announced he\u2019d be running as an independent candidate and left the Green Party with much criticism.\n\nOn the talk show, Abdullah highlighted how Black Lives Matter would continue their tradition of not endorsing candidates.

One of the reasons cited for the downgrade was USC\u2019s medical operations exposure to industry-wide rising costs. This downgrade will impact USC by making it more expensive for the institution to borrow money, which it does annually, to fuel operations or expansions.\n\nMoody\u2019s cited USC\u2019s healthcare operations, which comprise over 40% of its 2023 operating revenue, as one of USC\u2019s biggest credit challenges due to exposure to \u201cchallenging operating environments\u201d such as wage growth in the medical field.

USC faces additional challenges that led to Moody\u2019s downgrading of USC\u2019s credit rating. The rating agency cited USC\u2019s \u201crising leverage,\u201d or debt. It also cited USC\u2019s \u201cmulti-year period of highly public legal issues,\u201d which it said could potentially damage the institution\u2019s reputation if continued in the future.\n\nUSC faced several legal challenges in recent years. The college admissions scandal sparked national headlines, including those regarding unethical efforts by \u201cFull House\u201d actress Lori Loughlin and fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli to get their daughter, YouTuber Olivia Jade Giannulli, admitted. Another example is the charges against former USC doctor George Tyndall for sexual abuse of students.\n\nMoody\u2019s report outlines factors that could lead to an upgrade in the rating, including a growth in USC\u2019s total wealth, in part buttressed by its \u201cexceptional fundraising success\u201d that Moody\u2019s said has averaged over $500 million over the last three years. The rating agency also cited USC\u2019s \u201clarge research activity\u201d that it said led to current sponsored awards that it valued at over $1.1 billion.\n\nExamples of sponsored awards that have increased the school\u2019s wealth include a recent $4 million federal grant to the Keck School of Medicine to support researchers aiming to protect children against air pollution, a $4.5 million grant to a USC Information Sciences Institute research in quantum computing, and more than $7 million in government grants to support USC Stem Cell research on kidney disease and Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.\n\nBeyond that, the downgrade report also cited potential improvement in the school\u2019s profile due to possible \u201csustained strengthening of healthcare operations and university-wide operating performance.\u201d Located near the heart of downtown Los Angeles, USC has an \u201cexcellent strategic position\u201d for a research university, according to Moody\u2019s report.\n\nMoody\u2019s report also outlines the diverse revenue sources received by USC. The institution received 30% of its revenue from student charges, 41% from patient care, 11% from grants and contracts, 5% from gifts and the rest from investment income and miscellaneous sources.\n\nUSC could face further downgrades, Moody\u2019s noted, if the university struggles to increase its profits while its savings and investments fail to grow, thus straining its \u201cleverage profile.\u201d This would threaten its financial stability. Additionally, taking on significantly more debt could be problematic, especially if the university doesn\u2019t see an increase in cash reserves. Lastly, a further hit to USC\u2019s reputation could reduce donations and student applications.\n\n\u201cUSC also continues to proactively invest in long-term strategic initiatives. As a result, we are experiencing greater exposure to the healthcare industry and a growing operating expense base and debt portfolio. One of USC\u2019s many priorities is to help transform the future of health. It is our goal to keep more people well across all facets of life. To fulfill that goal, we remain focused on our mission to enhance healthcare education, patient care and research. The intentional investments being made today are expected to benefit USC over time, both financially and reputationally,\u201d said USC.\n```"}

(Photo by Jinge Li)\n\nBy Chris Bibona\nApril 10, 2024 at 11:32 am PDT\n\nThe Trojans had an opportunity to flip the narrative of their season, and they did just that. Coming into Tuesday\u2019s game, UC Irvine \u2014 enjoying its best start in program history \u2014 was 9-1 in its last 10 games. USC stumbled out of the gate with a 3-11 start, but it met the Anteaters with a chance to finally break even at .500.\n\nThe Trojans welcomed No. 12-ranked UCI to LMU\u2019s Page Stadium for a non-conference matchup and routed the Anteaters 12-5. The win marks the first time that the Trojans do not have a losing record in 2024. It is a season milestone that comes against one of the best baseball teams in the nation, at a time when the Pac-12 is still up for the taking.\n\nThe Anteater lineup features a few of the most distinguished hitters in the nation, and it was no surprise that they threatened early. Junior outfielder Myles Smith started the scoring with an RBI single for UCI, but it was actually the USC bats that made an impression early. The first seven Trojans reached base in the home half of the opening frame, scoring a statement six runs.\n\nBoth sophomore catcher Jacob Galloway and freshman designated hitter Kevin Takeuchi put dents in the Blue Monster with doubles, and they were two of five Trojans to drive in at least one run in the inning.\n\n\u201cYou always talk about answering back, and that [first inning] was big,\u201d USC head coach Andy Stankiewicz said. \u201cWe put some really good swings together and strung them along really well. Typically, you\u2019re not going to score six runs in an inning versus UC Irvine, but we were able to do that.\u201d\n\nAnteater freshman righty Tim Grack was chased from the game without recording an out, forcing UCI to commit 27 outs to its bullpen for the midweek game. The first inning concluded with USC in the driver\u2019s seat, 6-1.\n\nThe Eaters clawed back with a run in the top of the second, but USC senior infielder Ryan Jackson delivered the counterpunch with a line drive two-run home run in the next half inning. Two batters later, sophomore infielder Ethan Hedges hit a solo homer to left-center that boosted USC\u2019s lead to 9-2.\n\nJunior pitcher Fisher Johnson relieved freshman Garren Rizzo in the third inning and delivered three scoreless innings for the Trojans with two strikeouts and one hit allowed.\n\n\u201cThe guy that came in and did the job for us was Fisher Johnson,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cWe needed someone to get us back on track on the mound, and he was fantastic.\u201d\n\nThe Anteaters entered the game with the 15th-best team ERA in Division-I, but that made no difference for the Trojans. In the bottom of the fourth, freshman infielder Dean Carpentier cleared the 37-foot wall in left with a towering two-run home run, extending the Trojan lead to 11-2.\n\nTuesday was just the third time that UCI allowed 10 or more runs in a game this season. The Trojans added insurance in the bottom of the sixth courtesy of a Hedges RBI double. The infielder had a near-impeccable night, going 3-for-4 \u2014 a triple shy of the cycle \u2014 with two runs and three RBIs.\n\nUCI threatened in the top of the seventh, scoring one run before loading the bases for junior second baseman Will Bermudez. USC freshman pitcher Andrew Harbour extinguished the rally by inducing an inning-ending 6-4-3 double play to keep the score at 12-3.\n\nAnteater junior backstop Blake Penso hit a moonshot homer to straight-away centerfield in the top of the eighth, but the damage was already done with the Trojans still leading 12-4. Two batters later, UCI redshirt freshman third baseman James Castagnola cleared the Blue Monster with another solo shot.\n\nStill, worries were low for USC. Freshman pitcher Brodie Purcell came in to shut the door in the ninth, and he struck out the side to cement the Trojan victory.\n\nIt took 32 games, but USC moved back to even on the year at 16-16 overall.\n\n\u201cEarly in the season, we were disconnected offensively, so I think now we are managing our swings better and managing the strike zone better,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cBetter at-bats lead to better opportunities, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in the past couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nUSC will travel to Oregon for a three-game weekend series against the Ducks \u2014 the team immediately above the Trojans in the Pac-12 standings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big challenge on the road at Oregon,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cWe\u2019ve played pretty good baseball the last couple of weeks, so we feel good about it.

These upward trends aren\u2019t unique to California. The national average is on its seventh consecutive day rising and is over 20 cents more than a month ago. AAA and the Oil Price Information Service report that while prices are high in LA, they are still lower than October 2022\u2032s record of $6.49. The national average has also dropped by $1.41 since the record was set in June 2022 at $5.02. AAA reports the national average price at $3.61 as of April 9 and California\u2019s average at $5.37.\n\nDuring the pandemic, there was a sharp drop in the price of gasoline, but as people began returning to in-person work and commuting, gas prices sharply increased again. Tim Leung is a second-year graduate student at Annenberg and has been putting off getting fuel because of the spike in prices. \u201cIt\u2019s too expensive....but [it] seems like it\u2019s not dropping,\u201d she said. Leung says that her friends have also felt the increase, particularly one friend who gets premium gas. Leung previously relied on a discount app for cheaper gas but recently ran out of points on the app and now has to pay more.\n\nBrandon Laventure, a graduate student in the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, said he drives an electric vehicle for environmental reasons. Like many hybrid and electric car drivers, gas prices haven\u2019t been on his mind. \u201cTo be honest, I haven\u2019t thought about gas prices in a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a private little sigh of relief whenever I hear other people complaining about gas prices.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have noticed that everywhere I go, it\u2019s like $5...before it was like $3 or $4,\u201d said Bigane Perez, an LA County resident. Perez says she doesn\u2019t have much of a choice when going to fuel up. \u201cIf I have to fill up, I just do it because everywhere it\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d she said. \u201cEverywhere I go, it doesn\u2019t matter where ... it\u2019s just always high.\u201d\n\nThough California is experiencing this increase, GasBuddy\u2019s head of petroleum analysis Patrick De Haan says that increased prices during March are to be seasonally expected due to maintenance affecting supply. GasBuddy is an app that uses crowdsourced data to track current gasoline prices from station to station, helping users find the cheapest gas in their area. However, in an April 8 statement on X, De Haan suggested that there may be light at the end of the tunnel for Californians. \u201cWholesale prices are down significantly today, which likely means price increases will soon fade, and price decreases could happen.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/09/rookie-report-the-thompson-twins/", "response": "```\nThe Talk of Troy Rookie report: The Thompson twins\n\nThe brothers from Overtime Elite have transitioned smoothly to the NBA after becoming the first twins to both be drafted in the top five.\n\nAmen Thompson (left) and twin brother Ausar Thompson (right). (AP/Nam Y. Huh, File)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan April 09, 2024 at 8:21 pm PDT\n\nSeven pairs of twins have played in the NBA, but only one duo saw both brothers drafted in the top 10. They also happen to be among the league\u2019s most recent entrants, so you\u2019ve probably heard of them. Together, they\u2019re known as the Thompson twins, but the average NBA fan will have to be able to tell them apart sooner rather than later, because these boys\u2014Amen and Ausar\u2014are going straight to the top of the league.\n\nAs you might expect from a pair of identical twins who\u2019ve spent almost their entire basketball lives together, the Thompsons have similar frames and skill sets. They both stand at 6-foot-7, weigh about 210 to 215 pounds and are considered some of the NBA\u2019s purest athletes despite their young age. That athleticism made their scouting profiles extremely tantalizing; their combination of prototypical wing size with top-tier mobility made them high-level defenders at the most important position.\n\nThe Thompson twins projected as the rare type of player who can both shut down explosive, smaller guards and trouble the NBA\u2019s bigger wing scorers, like a Jayson Tatum or a Kawhi Leonard, with their 7-foot wingspans. Moreover, their defense wasn\u2019t just theoretical \u2014 they showed it in the Overtime Elite league, a developmental league that pays its 16-to-20-year-old players while also permitting them to finish a high school education.\n\nIn the OTE regular season, Ausar averaged 2.4 steals and 1.1 blocks per game, while Amen posted similar 2.3 and 0.9 figures of his own, respectively. You can pick holes in the translatability of OTE stats, since basketball scouts consider it a lower level of play than college ball, but dismissing those numbers entirely misses the forest for the trees. It\u2019s indisputable that they play strong defense.\n\nWe know that because it immediately showed in their NBA performances. Amen, who the Rockets selected fourth overall, has averaged 1.3 steals and 0.6 blocks per game this season while tallying 2.3 defensive win shares. And again, Ausar (No. 5 overall to the Detroit Pistons) had a scarily similar impact: 1.1 steals, 0.9 blocks and 1.7 defensive win shares.\n\nDefensive win shares, for the uninitiated, measures the approximate number of wins an individual player added with their defense. Per Basketball Reference\u2019s formula, win shares can even be negative, so any rookie posting positive numbers should be considered a success. Plus, the Thompson twins\u2019 numbers look even more impressive when you compare their figure to that of Kawhi Leonard\u2019s, a two-time Defensive Player of the Year and long-considered one of the NBA\u2019s best wing defenders. Leonard has posted 2.7 defensive win shares this season, so the twins aren\u2019t lagging far behind one of the NBA\u2019s best stoppers.\n\nBut the Rockets and Pistons didn\u2019t just draft Amen and Ausar respectively for their defense. You can find solid-to-exceptional one-on-one defenders as late as the second round, like when the Pelicans took Herb Jones at 35 overall. Now, the Thompsons might have higher defensive ceilings than Jones, but they also displayed strong ball-handling and passing ability in OTE, which made them desirable playmakers who had the size and athleticism to trouble any defender in a pick-and-roll or driving situation.\n\nWithout those traits, Amen and Ausar would be little more than pure defensive and effort-based prospects, because their potential as shooters remains questionable at best. Both brothers have shot well under 20% from three-point range so far in their NBA careers and their respective field goal percentages, both of which hover around 50%, are buoyed by strong finishing around the basket. 75.2% of Amen\u2019s field goal attempts come within 10 feet of the hoop, and Ausar takes 66% of his shots in the same range.\n\nAs long as they spend a lot of possessions as primary ball-handlers and on-ball creators, they can squeak by as suboptimal shooters, but Houston and Detroit would surely like them to at least cultivate a little respect from behind the arc. Unfortunately for Ausar, a blood clot prematurely ended his season, pausing his development for the time being.\n\nBut Amen\u2019s Rockets just went on an 11-game win streak and have a puncher\u2019s chance of making the Play-In in the Western Conference, so we may be seeing more of him in the postseason.\n\nLet\u2019s check out some film to see how the brothers have adapted to the league so far:\n\nIf you needed any additional proof of Ausar\u2019s quickness or confidence with the ball in his hands, just watch him torch Bobby Portis Jr. in this Pistons vs. Bucks game. Ausar receives the ball at the three-point line and immediately attacks Portis. First, Ausar\u2019s sideways pump forces Portis to belatedly switch the direction of his stance, at which point Ausar is trying to blow past him. Despite his speed advantage, Ausar appears to recognize that Giannis Antetokounmpo is in position to play help defense inside of Portis, so Ausar does a spin move back in the other direction to find space. Portis spins and almost closes down Ausar perfectly, but the OTE graduate just leaps up to the hoop and lays in an easy one.\n\nLater in the same game, Ausar attacked Giannis at the rim, which had an expectedly amusing result. Ausar again receives the ball from behind the arc in space and drives immediately. Giannis steps out to contest and Ausar jumps up, seemingly to attempt a long-distance layup. Giannis awkwardly blocks him but Ausar hustles to grab the deflection, takes a dribble-step back out from under the hoop, puts his shoulder into Giannis, then makes a hook shot over both the Greek Freak and Brook Lopez, one of the league\u2019s best veteran rim protectors.\n\nThe play highlighted his youthful arrogance and exuberance, but also the athleticism and motor that make him such a threat. And finally, we had to highlight Ausar\u2019s defense. The way he jumps out to not just contest, but block this three-pointer against his brother Amen\u2019s Rockets is just absurd.\n\nNow, time for Amen to shine. We\u2019re going to start on the defensive end here, with this hyper-fluid block on the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 Justin Minaya. Full disclosure: I didn\u2019t know who Minaya was before watching this highlight. Apparently, he was an undrafted guy who has mostly played G League ball. So, yeah, not exactly the biggest challenge for Amen. But that\u2019s the thing: Amen makes this block look like child\u2019s play. He completely smothers Minaya all the way to the basket and contests effortlessly.\n\nStill just 21 years old, the admittedly raw Amen made a professional hooper look silly for even trying to put up that shot. And even though the league has somewhat moved away from the \u2018small ball\u2019 style the Golden State Warriors played in their title-winning seasons, Amen\u2019s (and his brother\u2019s) lack of a real three-pointer make them well-suited to playing a possession here or there at the five, just to give the opponent an unexpected look.\n\nWatch Amen sit in the dunker spot here and score off an audacious lob: Is the Trail Blazers\u2019 defense diabolically bad there? Yes, but I\u2019m not here to tell Chauncey Billups how to coach, just to explain how awesome Amen and Ausar are.\n\nAnd finally, good luck trying to stop Amen in transition.\n\nIn order to become All-Stars or even just contributors deserving of a nine-digit second contract, the Thompson twins will need to develop some semblance of a jumper. It\u2019s just hard to exist without for any position and role in this league, from a true point guard to even the stockiest of big men. But if they become just average shooters, their combination of shut-down defense and reliable ball-handling and offensive initiation make them game-breakers from coast to coast on the court.\n```"}

Newton finished the game with 20 points, 7 assists and 5 rebounds. (AP/David J. Phillip)\n\nDespite this year\u2019s NCAA Tournament having one of the most unlikely Final Four teams ever in No. 11 seed N.C. State, Monday night\u2019s championship game came down to the two best teams. Ultimately, the No. 1 overall seed Connecticut Huskies easily handled the Midwest Region\u2019s No. 1 seeded Purdue Boilermakers, 75-60.\n\nThe Huskies dominated every opponent they faced in this year\u2019s tournament\u2014 their smallest margin of victory was 14 points against Alabama in the Final Four\u2014but after a tight first half, it seemed like Purdue would keep it close. Connecticut, after completing a historic 30-0 scoring run against Illinois just over a week prior, was only able to achieve a 6-0 scoring run in the first half against Purdue.\n\nThe Boilermakers went into the locker room down by six points despite their two-time defending Naismith National Player of the Year, star center Zach Edey, having scored a whopping 16 first-half points. \u201cWe didn\u2019t care if Zach [Edey] took 25, 28 shots to get 30, 35 points. This whole game plan was like no [Braden] Smith, no [Fletcher] Loyer, no [Mason] Gillis, no [Lance] Jones,\u201d said Connecticut Head Coach Dan Hurley after the game. \u201cKeep that collective group under 18, 20 points...they had no chance to win, no matter how well Zach played.\u201d\n\nHurley\u2019s game plan was executed to perfection. Edey finished with 37 points on 25 attempts, well above his 28-point scoring average from the previous five games of March Madness. However, his supporting cast, the group Coach Hurley mentioned, finished with a combined 17 points. In the four games after the round of 64 (in which Purdue\u2019s main contributors sat out for most of the second half), that same group averaged over 35 points per game, double what they scored on Monday night.\n\nThe Huskies stopped Edey\u2019s supporting cast by keeping them away from the 3-point line. Coming into the contest, Purdue averaged 8.3 made 3-pointers per game, but on Monday, they only attempted seven. Their seven attempts, one make and 14.3% conversion rate were all season-lows for the Boilermakers.\n\nOn offense, Connecticut was led by this year\u2019s NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player, senior guard Tristen Newton, who finished with team highs in points (20), assists (7), 3-pointers (2) and free throws (6). Newton is one of three scorers from last year\u2019s championship who elected to return to the Huskies in 2024 and defend their national title.\n\nComing into the game, the story was Repeat vs. Redemption. All season, Connecticut was on a mission to become the first team since the Florida Gators in 2007 to successfully defend a national championship. After a 31-3 record heading into the tournament, including an outright Big East Regular Season Championship and a Big East Conference Tournament Championship, the Huskies earned the top seed in the field, and nearly a quarter of bracket makers picked them to cut down the nets.\n\nNot only did the Huskies repeat, they destroyed their competition. Connecticut recorded a +140 point margin of victory across their six tournament wins, which is the largest in men\u2019s NCAA Tournament history. Their 37 wins are the most in a championship-winning season since Kentucky in 2012, a team led by Anthony Davis and six other future NBA players.\n\nThe last time a team led the nation with at least 37 wins, won the NCAA Tournament and won their conference tournament was...never. Arguably, Coach Hurley and the Huskies just completed the best season in the history of men\u2019s college basketball.\n\nOn the other hand, Purdue was looking to redeem their shocking first-round exit in last year\u2019s tournament against No. 16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson. Rather than heading for the NBA, Edey returned for his senior season to attempt to avenge the crushing loss. Despite not ending the storybook season with a happy ending, Edey had an incredible year to cap one of the best college careers in history.\n\nBefore Edey, the last time a player won multiple Naismith Player of the Year awards was Ralph Sampson in the early 1980s. \u201cYou can never say that I didn\u2019t give it my 100% every single time I stepped on the floor, every single time I went through practice, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll always hang my hat on,\u201d said Edey after the loss.\n\nEdey appeared in the NCAA Tournament in all four seasons of his career, made two trips to the Sweet Sixteen, won two Big 10 regular season titles and one conference tournament title, and finished as Purdue\u2019s all-time leader in points and rebounds. Edey\u2019s basketball career will continue into the NBA, but the story of Monday night and the 2024 season is Connecticut\u2019s dominance en route to their second straight NCAA title.\n\nThe Huskies\u2019 six championships surpasses Duke\u2019s total and equals North Carolina\u2019s. Without a doubt, Connecticut is a blue-blood men\u2019s basketball program.\n```"}

As a nexus of culture and technology, gaming has long been a proving ground for creative experimentation and technological innovation. Recent advancements in AI and Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have ushered in a new era, fundamentally transforming game development and expanding creative horizons.\n\nA GDC Perspective\n\nThe increasing significance of AI in gaming was highlighted at this year\u2019s Game Developers Conference (GDC), where 64 of the 773 presentations focused on AI, covering aspects from coding and art to marketing. This attention underscores AI\u2019s pervasive impact across the entire game development and release lifecycle.\n\nRevolutionizing Game Assets with NVIDIA\n\nImagine gamers having conversations with NPCs in games that are personalized, improvised, and dynamic. These characters could have evolving personalities over time, complete with accurate facial animations and expressions\u2014bringing the narratives of movies like Westworld into reality and offering gamers a truly immersive experience. NVIDIA has been at the forefront, introducing technologies like the RTX Remix and generative AI to rejuvenate classic games. By enabling the upscaling of textures from the DX9 era, NVIDIA not only breathes new life into older titles but also democratizes remastering for smaller teams and enthusiasts.\n\nSimilarly, NVIDIA\u2019s advances in character animation and AI NPCs enhance realism in player interactions, thanks to real-time voice and dialogue AI models. This leap forward in AI-driven \u201csouls\u201d for NPCs is not just a technical achievement but a gateway to more immersive gaming experiences.\n\nHarnessing AI for Unprecedented NPC Interactions\n\nAn example of AI\u2019s potential in gaming is the \u201cCovert Protocol\u201d demo: a collaboration between NVIDIA and Inworld AI. This technical showcase, unveiled at GDC, redefines NPC interactions, leveraging Inworld\u2019s AI engine integrated with NVIDIA\u2019s Riva for accurate speech-to-text and Audio2Face for lifelike facial animations. Players step into the shoes of Marcus Pierce, a detective in 2062, navigating through interactions with dynamic NPCs like Tae Hyun, Sophia Anderson, and Diego Menendez. These characters respond dynamically, based on meticulously crafted backstories, showcasing AI\u2019s capability to create nuanced and responsive NPC personalities.\n\nBroad Applications and the Democratization of Game Development\n\nAcross the industry, from Roblox to EA, leaders recognize generative AI\u2019s role in streamlining game development. It\u2019s become a tool that empowers creators to rapidly prototype, iterate, and innovate, bringing higher quality and more engaging content to life with greater efficiency. AI\u2019s support for user-generated content (UGC) is particularly transformative, suggesting a future where creating game content is as accessible as producing a social media post. Yet, this burgeoning content creation facilitated by AI necessitates advanced moderation tools to manage the influx effectively.\n\nThe Double-Edged Sword\n\nWhile AI\u2019s advancements promise to revolutionize the gaming experience, they also spark debate within the industry. The ability of AI to rapidly produce high-quality content offers players more immersive experiences but raises concerns among developers about job security and the ethical implications of AI-generated content. The strike by Hollywood writers over AI underscores the tension between technological advancement and creative employment. However, beyond the realm of art and narrative, the undeniable benefits of AI in enhancing efficiency are clear. Tools like Microsoft\u2019s CoPilot demonstrate AI\u2019s potential to significantly aid programmers, hinting at a future where AI\u2019s role in game development is indispensable.\n\nThe Future of Gaming with AI\n\nInnovations like NVIDIA\u2019s Covert Protocol demo and Oracle\u2019s advancements in cloud infrastructure and AI modeling are paving the way for a future where games become more dynamic, responsive, and personalized. The evolution of AI promises a shift in NPC roles from mere scripted characters to complex entities that interact, learn, and adapt in real time. This progression is poised to offer players levels of immersion and agency that were previously unimaginable. With the introduction of versatile AI engines like Tencent\u2019s GiiNEX, the application of AI in gaming is expanding to include not just gameplay and narrative elements but also 3D graphics and music. These advancements herald the arrival of larger, more immersive projects. However, they also bring to light concerns about the potential impact on smaller developers and the possible reduction in roles traditionally filled by human creativity.\n\nStanding at the threshold of this new era, the question is no longer if AI will be integrated into gaming but rather how it will reshape the industry. AI acts as a catalyst for redefining gaming experiences, promising a future where the distinctions between player and character, creator and consumer, reality and virtuality become more intertwined than ever. Navigating the multifaceted landscape that AI presents to the gaming industry, there is a clear shift towards leveraging its potential to foster creativity and innovation. This journey requires a nuanced approach, one that not only embraces AI\u2019s transformative capabilities but also addresses ethical considerations and supports a smooth transition for the workforce. Through this balanced approach, AI can be utilized as an instrument to augment the gaming experience, enrich narratives, and unlock new creative possibilities, ensuring its integration complements rather than replaces human talent.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ian Walton)\n\nBy Marco Haynes April 09, 2024 at 6:42 pm PDT\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d is a column by Marco Haynes about the English Premier League in which he breaks down the week\u2019s three most consequential results.\n\nSalah\u2019s spot kick rescues a point for title-challenger Liverpool\n\nLiverpool missed its chance to return to top of the Premier League table against bitter rivals Manchester United, sharing the points in a thrilling 2-2 draw at Old Trafford. The Reds opened the scoring in the 23rd minute, as forward Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez flicked a pass on to Luis Diaz to score a close-range volley from inside the 6-yard box \u2013 all of which started with a routine corner kick by midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai.\n\nManchester United didn\u2019t manage to post a shot until the second half, but scored on its first effort. Midfielder Bruno Fernandes\u2019 miraculous strike from the halfway line put United on level terms, coming when Fernandes intercepted 21-year-old center-back Jarell Quansah\u2019s misplaced pass. Then, Kobbie Mainoo \u2014 one of Manchester United\u2019s breakout young players this season \u2014 punished Liverpool\u2019s wastefulness in front of goal, curling a beautiful shot into the top right corner from the edge of the penalty box and leaving the title-hopefuls down 2-1.\n\nBut the game took yet another twist in the 84th minute, when Man United fullback Aaron Wan-Bissaka fouled substitute midfielder Harvey Elliott inside the penalty box. Liverpool star Mohamed Salah\u2019s composed finish from the penalty spot into the bottom left secured the 2-2 draw.\n\nDespite rescuing a point, Liverpool dropped to second in the league after Arsenal and Manchester City both won, which continues to make the title race exhilarating for neutrals. This marked the first time in 16 games that Liverpool failed to win a match when taking the lead, going back to a 2-2 draw against Brighton in October.\n\nSalah scored his 17th league goal of the season \u2014 his fifth from the penalty spot \u2014 to place him in 3rd in the Premier League Golden Boot race. The Egyptian has now scored six league goals at Old Trafford, the most by any visiting player in Premier League history, and has overtaken another Liverpool club legend, Steven Gerrard, who had five.\n\nLiverpool will return to Anfield in the Premier League to face Crystal Palace on Sunday. Meanwhile, United remains sixth, 11 points from a Champions League place and only one point ahead of West Ham in seventh. As discussed, the Red Devils failed to take a shot in the first half, which they last did in the Premier League at Liverpool in 2022. The last time they failed to manage one at Old Trafford was against Manchester City in October 2015.\n\nThe captain, Fernandes, scored his 50th Premier League career goal in the 50th minute of the game against Liverpool \u2014 some nice symmetry. This is the Portuguese player\u2019s sixth league goal in 30 matches this season.\n\nUnited travel to the Vitality Stadium to take on AFC Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday.\n\nA commanding Arsenal performance puts the club in pole position\n\nHigh-flying Arsenal eased past Brighton in a 3-0 win at American Express Stadium on Saturday. In the first half, Seagulls defender Tariq Lamptey made a diving tackle on Arsenal forward Gabriel Jesus and the referee awarded a penalty to the Gunners. Bukayo Saka curled his spot kick into the bottom left corner of the net to give his side the lead and score his fifth penalty this season.\n\nAfter the halftime interval, Kai Havertz added the second Gunners\u2019 goal. Midfielder Jorginho dribbled toward the byline to put in a cross at the near post that found the German forward for a simple tap-in.\n\nFinally, ex-Brighton forward Leandro Trossard wrapped up the victory in the 86th minute, as Havertz pounced on the Seagulls defender Jan Paul van Hecke\u2019s mistake, putting Havertz in position to play a through ball to the Belgian winger from inside Arsenal\u2019s own half. Trossard received the ball and dribbled 50 yards before calmly chipping the ball over goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen.\n\nArsenal moved up to first place on 71 points, equal to Liverpool\u2019s tally, but with a superior goal difference. The Gunners have yet to lose a league match in 2024, winning 10 and drawing once.\n\nThe Gunners have now beaten Brighton both times this season and have not conceded in either match \u2014 no mean feat given the Seagulls\u2019 current status. Saka has now scored 14 goals in 29 league matches, which equals his most-ever in a Premier League season, with seven games still left.\n\nThe Gunners should have a slightly more challenging next league game, facing off against Aston Villa at Emirates Stadium on Sunday.\n\nThe defeat dropped the Seagulls to 10th, and it is the first time under manager Roberto De Zerbi that Brighton has lost and failed to score both home and away against the same opponent. This is Brighton\u2019s first defeat at home since August, when West Ham bested them 3-1, ending the club\u2019s longest Premier League unbeaten run at American Express Stadium, with 12.\n\nIn its last 18 matches at home in the Premier League, Brighton has only kept two clean sheets, going back to last season against Manchester United and Wolverhampton.\n\nThe Seagulls travel to Turf Moor to face Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday with the aim of ending their three-match winless run.\n\nMcBurnie\u2019s stoppage-time equalizer spoils Chelsea\u2019s victory\n\nLast-placed Sheffield United prevented Chelsea from moving closer to a European qualification place with a 2-2 draw at Bramall Lane. Experienced Blues centerback Thiago Silva unleashed a volley, hitting the back of the net after he made a run into acres of space inside the penalty box from Conor Gallagher\u2019s corner-kick to put his team up 1-0.\n\nThe Blades responded just after the 30th minute, as midfielder Gustavo Hamer\u2019s sharp through-ball to defender Jayden Bogle\u2019s run-in behind the Chelsea defense allowed him to receive the ball at the byline and sneak a near-post shot past Chelsea keeper Djordje Petrovic.\n\nIn the second half, Chelsea took another lead when right-winger Noni Madueke dribbled into the penalty box, cut inside and lashed a powerful strike toward the roof of the net. Madueke\u2019s strike had seemingly secured Chelsea\u2019s victory, until Sheffield United striker Oli McBurnie had other ideas.\n\nHe popped up with a last-gasp, 93rd-minute goal after a chaotic series of United headers around the box led to a close-range opening for the Englishman.\n\nMissing out on three points, Chelsea remain in ninth place, five points off from a European position. The Blues have yet to win back-to-back Premier League games in 2024.\n\nBlues star Cole Palmer had to be substituted in the 74th minute due to a seemingly minor injury. The Brazilian Silva played his 100th match for Chelsea, scoring his third goal of the season.\n\nChelsea will next play against Everton at Stamford Bridge for a Monday night kick-off (UK time).\n\nSheffield United, who remains bottom of the table and needed a win from this match, are still in touching distance to move out of the relegation zone at nine points away. It would require somewhat of a great escape, but it\u2019s still possible. However, results will need to improve rapidly; the Blades have lost once and drawn three times in their last four league matches.\n\nThey haven\u2019t won since a 3-1 result against Luton on February 10.\n\nWith another late goal, McBurnie has scored a preposterous half of his Sheffield United league goals in the 90th minute or later \u2014 a 4 out of 8 ratio.\n\nSheffield United travels to Brentford at Gtech Community Stadium on Saturday in the Premier League.\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

This announcement comes after extensive layoffs earlier this year that saw nearly a quarter of the newsroom cut, which some criticized as \u201cdemographically disproportionate.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles Times newspaper headquarters is shown in El Segundo, Calif., Tuesday, Jan. 23, 2024. Terry Tang, who has been leading the Los Angeles Times newsroom since late January on an interim basis, on Monday, April 8, 2024, was formally named executive editor. She is the first woman to hold the position in the newspaper's 142-year history. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)\n\nBy Quinten Seghers April 09, 2024 at 6:22 pm PDT\n\nThe Los Angeles Times appointed Terry Tang, the paper\u2019s first female executive editor, on Tuesday. Tang is a former New York Times reporter with over two decades of experience, and she first joined the Times as an Op-Ed editor in 2019. \u201cThe Los Angeles Times and its superb journalists make a difference every day in the life of California and this nation,\u201d Tang said in a Los Angeles Times article announcing her promotion. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to have the opportunity to lead an institution that serves our community and to make our work indispensable to our readers.\u201d\n\nPatrick Soon-Shiong, the executive chairman of the Los Angeles Times, shared a letter to readers on Tuesday in which he highlighted her decades of experience and expressed his optimism about the paper\u2019s future under her leadership. \u201cShe is a champion for the critical role that The Times plays in revealing the truth, explaining life in this sprawling region and bringing attention to issues that matter most, especially for those whose voices are often unheard,\u201d Soon-Shiong wrote.\n\nTang took her interim position at a tumultuous time for the paper, as 115 employees \u2014 nearly a quarter of their newsroom \u2014 received word in January that they would be laid off. In response, members of the Los Angeles Times Guild walked off the job in a one-day strike \u2014 the first newsroom union work stoppage in the paper\u2019s history.\n\nIn 2023, the Times launched a vertical named De Los, which makes content aimed towards English-speaking Gen Z and millennial Latinos. De Los, alongside the Washington D.C. division, was hit hard by the layoffs, according to the NiemanLab. At least three De Los reporters, a De Los assistant editor and a De Los culture columnist were laid off. A 2023 article from De Los titled \u201cMeet the De Los Staff\u201d shows 14 staffers in all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really disappointing to see demographically disproportional cuts in a newsroom during an age when diversity of sourcing and diversity of reporters has become so key to examining the debate between objective reporting and informed reporting,\u201d said Lyla Bhalla-Ladd, a junior majoring in journalism and one of Annenberg Media\u2019s 2024-2025 executive editors.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times Guild has a seniority rule in its contract with the paper, meaning that the latest hires were the first to go. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be making those decisions based on who\u2019s been there the longest,\u201d said Alexa Avila, a junior majoring in communication and an opinion editor at the Daily Trojan. \u201cIt should come down to the quality of their work ... you should always be trying to set a higher standard for yourself.\u201d\n\nBhalla-Ladd said objective reporting \u201ccan\u2019t exist\u201d because everyone holds different biases. She says the way to combat this is to hire and keep people of different perspectives in the newsroom. \u201cWhen you lay off or gut entire desks that are made up of that new hiring demographic ... we kinda go back to where we were,\u201d Bhalla-Ladd said. \u201cNow, rather than championing objectivity and we only have white male cis reporters, now we\u2019re not actually championing objectivity ... [and] we\u2019re still keeping the same reporting demographic. That has the potential to be very harmful.\u201d\n\nData from the Pew Research Center shows that 76% of newsroom employees are non-Hispanic white and six out of 10 employees are men. According to that same research report, 64% of U.S. employed adults are non-Hispanic white and 53% of all workers are male.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason we say \u2018The first female\u2019 or \u2018One of the few Asians,\u2019 because it\u2019s motivating,\u201d said Zain Khan, a junior majoring in journalism and international relations and Annenberg Media\u2019s 2024-2025 second executive editor. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should grow up with this one idea that somebody who fits this box is all we need. For a very long time, that box has been the white male in almost all institutions.\u201d\n\nThe Pew Research Center report also found that 47% of newsroom employees are non-Hispanic white and male, which is higher compared to the entire U.S. workforce (34%).\n\n\u201cAs a woman of color, this feels very affirming,\u201d Avila said. \u201cBeing at this school, as a whole, has been very much imposter syndrome left and right and feeling invalidated.\u201d \u201cSomething I\u2019ve come to realize, now that I\u2019ve been here a while, is that you can do it,\u201d Avila said. \u201cYou just have to work really hard, actually work double, I would say, just to get the same kind of recognition. I think overall this is a step in a really positive direction.\u201d\n\nKhan said it\u2019s important to not burden people who come from underrepresented communities with certain expectations, namely, that they have to be the ones to bear the responsibility for covering their entire community. He also warned against soloing reporters off to cover only groups that they are a part of. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is an ethical practice,\u201d Khan said. \u201cI think a good leader ... [makes] sure that every community, regardless of how big or how small, feels that their news reporting is equitable. A white person should be able to cover Black and brown communities and a Black and brown person should be able to cover white communities.\u201d\n\nBhalla-Ladd recognized that it may be difficult for newsrooms to diversify their staff when hiring more people is not financially feasible, especially considering consumers are less willing to pay for their news, according to a research article in \u201cJournalism,\u201d an academic journal. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to actually take ideals like wanting a more diverse newsroom and actually implement them by hiring more people because some people are caught in a financial catch-22,\u201d Bhalla-Ladd said. \u201cAt the same time, that\u2019s why places like Annenberg [Media Center], which is student-run, are special places because we don\u2019t have to experience those financial pressures.\u201d\n\nBhalla-Ladd said hopefully with Tang\u2019s promotion from interim executive editor to executive editor, the newsroom will be stabilized. \u201cThe LA Times [layoff] news has been disappointing over the past couple weeks,\u201d Bhalla-Ladd said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in my professors who are just very upset to see all of their friends either be fired themselves or have their desk so diminished. Perhaps my hope is not well supported, but I\u2019d like to think that under new leadership, the Times is going to do better.\u201d\n```"}

For more on the story, here\u2019s Dylan Brashier The women who experienced an allegedly burglary and trespasser at their apartment located just off-campus were left questioning how USC prioritizes student safety. They were not satisfied by LAPD and DPS\u2019 response to the incident on Thursday. The apartment\u2019s residents sat down with ARN to share their experiences.\n\nMelissa Ayala, one of the roommates, told us her initial interactions with DPS following the break-in. AYALA: The DPS officer kind of just like tells you the same thing. Like, yeah, we\u2019re gonna put out this report, but can\u2019t really do much besides that, like literally just reporting and he basically just told us like, yeah, like we\u2019re just gonna I\u2019m just gonna patrol the area essentially. And that was pretty much it and he gave us like the report number.\n\nFor those who missed the Trojan Alert last week, the suspect allegedly invaded their apartment on West 30th Street by breaking in through a window. It was live streamed via the Citizen app and watched by many USC students. But inside the building, the residents were undergoing a frightening experience. Ayala said they were shocked at what they saw and started recording on their phones. AYALA: We looked up and then we all realize like, this was literally the dude that had just burglarized us. And so, you know, in general, reacting to that we kind of just like sat there and like, we\u2019re like, what the heck do we do? Like, we didn\u2019t say anything amongst each other. And he literally said something along the lines of like, I\u2019m back guys are like, I\u2019m back, blah, blah, blah. And he had a Swiffer in his hand. And we have a video of all of this.\n\nMelina Quiles said the assailant then grabbed their taser out of a basket, but did not seem like he intended to harm or steal them. QUILES: We were in like our kitchen. So I grabbed a knife from the thing. And I just said, like, Get the eff out. And then he was like, No, he was like, I just want some food. Like, I\u2019m your friend. And I was like, No, like leave. And he grabbed like a couple things like it was it seemed like he wasn\u2019t like breaking in like with the intention of stealing something. It more seemed like the whole like smashing the window thing was like a retaliation for us, like not letting him in.\n\nOutside, 6:20 P.M. on Thursday, there were more than 10 DPS and LAPD vehicles on the premises, but LAPD did not attempt to enter the building until almost 10:00 P.M. 20 minutes later, the suspect climbed onto the roof of the building by breaking a glass window. LAPD said they disengaged the suspect around 12:30 A.M. but the suspect remained on the property until the next morning was he was finally arrested according to video footage taken by students and residents on the scene.\n\nDPS and LAPD issued separate statement about the incidents. An official LAPD response released at 5:50 P.M stated: \u201cAfter negotiations and the suspect\u2019s noncompliance, the LAPD Supervisor made the decision to \u201dtactically disengage\u201d and the suspect was not taken into custody.\u201d David Carlisle, the DPS Assistant Chief gave the following statement: \u201cThe situation you are referring to was handled by the LAPD. They made all the decisions. DPS was there in a supporting role.\u201d Carlisle gave a follow-up statement shortly after: \u201cThe suspect was arrested at the location the next morning by LAPD officers. DPS received the original call the day before but turned the investigation over to the LAPD. We supported LAPD by helping set up a perimeter around the building to keep people away from the scene and directing traffic. Whatever support LAPD requested.\u201d\n\nHowever, Quiles told ARN she and her roommates were left feeling helpless after speaking with law enforcement. This is what it was like, in her own words. QUILES: Eventually, I got a hold of a sergeant, who proceeded to tell me that because like, he was in a position where he could get hurt, if they tried to get him down from the building. And he felt like it would be a liability issue. So they had, allegedly, they had no choice but to disengage. And I asked him like, Well, are you guys gonna go back and like, try to get the guy in there? Like, unless there\u2019s another incident, we won\u2019t go back and try to arrest him.

South Carolina and UConn prevailed, thus reigning in an age of new college basketball superpowers.\n\nDawn\u2019s Dynasty\nThe Gamecocks capped off their undefeated season in the most fitting way: by slowly wearing down Iowa and winning 87-75. What\u2019s so impressive about South Carolina going undefeated and winning the national championship is that the team lost all five of its starters from last season, which had only lost one game themselves. Senior center Kamila Cardoso dropped 15 points and grabbed 17 rebounds to lead the Gamecocks down the home stretch. However, it was redshirt sophomore Raven Johnson who was the game\u2019s MVP in my eyes, as she held Iowa senior guard Caitlin Clark to just 12 points after the first quarter.\n\nAfter the game, South Carolina head Coach Dawn Staley has already entered the G.O.A.T conversation for college basketball head coaches. In the long run, UConn women\u2019s head coach Geno Auriemma will be hard to topple, as he has 11 national championships under his belt. However, Staley\u2019s last two seasons have been incredible. In the last two years combined, the Gamecocks are 74-1, with that one loss coming last year to Clark and Iowa in the Final Four.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s season-long style wasn\u2019t to beat opponents with one player, like Iowa and Clark did. The Gamecocks would beat teams down overtime with their ridiculously good depth, eventually just running circles around the other side. The Gamecocks were by far the most deserving national champion, and it will be scary to see what they might accomplish next year with multiple starters returning.\n\nDanny\u2019s Destiny\nThis UConn team was destined to do one thing, and one thing only: beat opponents to a pulp in the NCAA tournament. UConn head coach Dan Hurley is one of the most intense \u2014 yet most effective \u2014 coaches that college basketball has ever seen. His Huskies decimated the competition this March, winning their games in the 2024 edition by a combined plus-140 point differential over their opponents \u2014 the most in NCAA tournament history.\n\nUConn, similarly to South Carolina, has only lost one out-of-conference game in the last two years and showed they still had it in them, somehow becoming even better than their incredible season a year prior. The Huskies also shared another eerily similar quality to the Gamecocks: they, too, lost three of their best players from the previous year, yet still somehow improved from last year and steamrolled opponents.\n\nAnyone who didn\u2019t choose UConn now looks like a fool \u2014 myself included \u2014 and should have seen this from a mile away after Hurley\u2019s crew\u2019s performance throughout the regular season and the Big East tournament. The National Championship game quite didn\u2019t have the fireworks that most were hoping for between Purdue\u2019s senior center Zach Edey and UConn\u2019s sophomore center Donovan Clingan. But Edey played his heart out, adding 37 points and 10 rebounds, but in the end UConn did what it did best all year: annihilated the competition.\n\nThe Huskies will likely lose many key players from this year\u2019s tournament run; however, as discussed earlier, it happened last year, too, so who\u2019s to say they can\u2019t cut the nets down three times in a row? Hurley may get a call or two from Kentucky, pleading for him to come coach a more traditional \u201cBlue Blood\u201d in Lexington, but I can\u2019t imagine he will leave after what he has done for this UConn program.\n\nWhile I wish I could have pulled up this Google Doc and written about an incredible buzzer beater, or how Caitlin Clark and Zach Edey are the most incredible players ever, Goliath beats David 99 times out of 100, and that\u2019s exactly what happened this weekend. UConn and South Carolina were the best teams for the season\u2019s duration, and they deserved to hoist the national championship trophy, cementing themselves as the \u201cNew Bloods\u201d of college basketball. In the words of Thanos, \u201cI am inevitable.\u201d - UConn and South Carolina (probably)\n```"}

As part of the program, customers could potentially be prescribed drugs like Ozempic. But what does this mean for the usage of the drug moving forward?\n\nBy Jinny Kim and Heather Mimikos\nApril 09, 2024 at 5:49 pm PDT\n\nThe next time you stop by Costco for a two-dollar pizza slice or bulk granola bars, you might be able to pick something else up: Ozempic. Wholesale retailer Costco launched a new weight loss program last week in partnership with telehealth platform Sesame. For Costco members, it\u2019s 179 dollars for the three-month subscription period. Along with doctor consultations and nutrition guidance, the program can also prescribe weight loss drugs like Ozempic. But it\u2019ll come at an extra price. Users can expect to spend between 950 to 1600 dollars a month.\n\nInjectable drugs like Ozempic are used for weight loss by many celebrities, but they\u2019re intended for type-two diabetes patients who have high blood sugar. We spoke to Costco shoppers who are on Ozempic to treat their diabetes. Customer Wendy Weaver reacted to the drug being in the weight loss program.\n\nWendy Weaver: I thought since there\u2019s a shortage of it, it was supposed to be really prescribed for people with diabetes first. She said that Ozempic has helped control her blood sugar levels. Weaver: So it helps. I mean, I think it\u2019s a good thing. I don\u2019t know about just for weight loss.\n\nOther customers with diabetes, like Cherdchay Saetier, said weight loss isn\u2019t their primary use for Ozempic. Cherdchay Saetier: This, my doctor prescribed to me, so it\u2019s helped me with the weight loss but mainly is for lower the blood sugar.\n\nCostco prescribing Ozempic brings up concerns about making this drug more accessible to non-diabetes patients, since it\u2019s not FDA-approved for weight loss specifically. But USC Professor Scott Kanoski, a co-director of the USC Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute, says that increasing accessibility is a net positive.\n\nScott Kanoski: Making Ozempic and other GLP-1 analogs that are used for weight loss or diabetes, more affordable is certainly a good thing. Kanoski said Ozempic is safe and effective, but research has only been conducted with people who have diabetes and/or obesity. Kanoski: The impact of these GLP-1 analogs in healthy, lean individuals is a lot. It\u2019s more poorly understood. So there\u2019s just a lot that we don\u2019t know about.\n\nOzempic has been labeled a \u2018miracle drug\u2019 by some online. Kanoski, however, says it shouldn\u2019t be presented as the best and only solution for weight loss. Kanoski: I think that our society would benefit from focusing more on prevention, prevention and differences in lifestyle and the food landscape if you will, because these these drugs, they\u2019re not preventing anything. They\u2019re just dealing with a problem once it\u2019s already there.\n\nSo next time you stop for groceries, look into getting an Ozempic prescription if you meet the necessary health requirements. And, make sure you speak to your health care provider about what\u2019s best for you.\n```"}

Customers of the store are mourning the loss of this economic chain which sold produce, merchandise, and other goods at a reasonable price. The shutdown of the company raises concerns of problems with the economy and whether an inexpensive alternative exists. Los Angeles community members are struggling with how they will access affordable goods at big retail chains.\n\n99 Cent store customer, Samuel Riviera, believes that the store closure will prevent access to cheap food for his community. Riviera: \"It will affect a lot of people because most of the people that low econ they come and shop over here they find mostly everything over here. Food and groceries and whatever you need. It\u2019s better to go over here instead of spending more money or other stores.\"\n\nCustomer and USC student Brian Johnson feels they are not enough stores selling low-cost goods like the 99 Cent Stores. Johnson: \"But I feel like Ralph\u2019s and like other stores are just their prices keep raising for just general groceries. So I feel like this was a really good option that we no longer have, unfortunately.\"\n\nMike Simonic, who will be stepping down as Interim Chief Executive Officer, released a statement in the company\u2019s press release announcing why the company will be closing. Simonic: \"Unfortunately, the last several years have presented significant and lasting challenges in the retail environment, including the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, shifting consumer demand, rising levels of shrink, persistent inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic headwinds, all of which have greatly hindered the Company\u2019s ability to operate.\"\n\nFrancisco Roman, Clinical Professor of Accounting at USC Marshall, believes the shutdown is due to several factors. Roman: \"There\u2019s a profit motive, they are not in the business of being altruistic and altruistic organization and inflation is what basically drove them out of business combined or coupled with the pandemic.\" Roman thinks that the closure will negatively affect customers. Roman: \"A lot of people are going to suffer here in the LA community. The closure of the 99 Cents Only Stores will impact LA residents and their access to quality, affordable goods in an economy of rising prices.\"\n```"}

There are now over 11,850 pins on the app\u2019s map, 2,000 of which were added after its release in late February, according to Sprinkman.\n\n\u201cEvery business that applies, I\u2019m just like, \u2018Yes! Another business for a queer or trans person to just feel seen as their true authentic self,\u2019\u201d Sprinkman said. \u201cIt just makes my heart happy.\u201d\n\nEverywhere Is Queer began in 2022 after Sprinkman was inspired by his frustrations searching for LGBTQ+ friendly locations when traveling, as well as his time volunteering at Brave Trails, a LGBTQ+ youth camp. Today, they hope the map helps others have an easier time finding places to visit.\n\n\u201cAs someone from rural America, if I\u2019m back in my small town of 10,000 people and there\u2019s just one pin, even if it\u2019s an online business, if it\u2019s a queer, trans person, or ally that exists in that space, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, cool, there\u2019s another queer person in the city.\u2019\u201d Sprinkman said. \u201cEnd of sentence. I\u2019m not alone.\u201d\n\nFor some, locating LGBTQ+ friendly businesses and community groups can be a matter of safety. Establishing an accepting space was a priority for Elsie Acevedo and Chris Slivar, owners of Deluxe Screen Printing in Los Angeles. Printing since 2008, they\u2019ve learned that some customers feel more comfortable coming to them instead of others in the male-dominated industry.\n\n\u201cThe comments that we\u2019ve got back are that [customers] were intimidated by the men, or the men were not as friendly and the service to women was different. And then especially, you know, for other queer or trans folks out there, [they] didn\u2019t feel comfortable,\u201d Slivar said. \u201cSo we have provided a safe environment, and we have been really lucky to be able to serve our community in that way.\u201d\n\nOne experience that impacted the co-owners was helping a customer who felt he\u2019d been treated differently as a trans man in another shop. For Acevedo, it proved why inclusive businesses are a necessity for the community.\n\n\u201cHe said that the minute he walked in, he just felt that the energy was not safe, not good,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cHe just decided to just get out of there as soon as he could. And that\u2019s to me, that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important, because we want people to feel comfortable and safe when they walk in the door.\u201d\n\nOne industry where inclusivity is especially important has been on the Everywhere Is Queer map since the beginning: real estate. L.A. real estate agent Sammy Lyon added themselves the map earlier this year, joining over 270 other real estate professionals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not necessarily like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m a queer realtor,\u2019 in all my marketing, but anyone who knows me in my life knows I\u2019m queer, and it ends up being pretty word of mouth,\u201d Lyon said. \u201cThere are people who are specifically looking for a queer realtor.\u201d\n\nAlong with having a place to connect with customers, Lyon was excited for the app to be a conversation starter between business owners looking to strengthen their community, something they\u2019ve found harder after COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like any other kind of media that\u2019s intended to connect folks with really thinking about how to build the queer community in your own city. Because frankly, it\u2019s hard,\u201d Lyon said.\n\nIn efforts to make the map more accessible, Sprinkman worked with LA-based developer Chris Redrich to create the new mobile app. This included creating safety measures like requiring people to sign up for an account before accessing the map.\n\n\u201cIt is 2024, technology exists, people will do whatever they want to get whatever resource they want. And that\u2019s really sad,\u201d Sprinkman said. \u201cBut it\u2019s 2024. I\u2019m not letting sad people stop us from building this amazing resource. We\u2019ve connected millions of queer and trans and allied individuals with safe spaces, so we\u2019re not stopping.\u201d\n\nSprinkman released the app after seven months of development on February 20. After all the work involved in the process, Sprinkman said the feedback they\u2019ve gotten from the new businesses and customers who\u2019ve used the app to connect have been incredibly rewarding.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had so many people, hundreds of people, message me and be like, \u2018It\u2019s working, people are finding me,\u2019 Sprinkman said. \u201cThe messages of, \u2018I was able to invite my trans nephew out to visit me in small town, Bend, Oregon and take him to all trans-affirming spaces.\u2019 Those messages are always worth it.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of Carter Kawaguchi)  By   Amrita Vora April 09, 2024 at 10:24 am PDT\n\nThis past Wednesday, USC\u2019s  APASA  (Asian Pacific American Student Assembly) hosted  Lana Condor  at Bovard Auditorium. Moderated by two APASA members, Ashley Kim and Sage Muthy, the night consisted of Condor discussing her identity as a Vietnamese American and an adoptee, as well as her favorite memories from her breakout film \u201cTo All The Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before.\u201d Condor provided more insight into the highly popular movie, explaining that the first \u201cTo All the Boys\u201d movie was actually made independently. \u201cIt was almost like the stakes were really low so you could really just trust your gut instincts,\u201d Condor said. \u201c[Once Netflix bought the film] it was really important for me to one, stick to, as close as I could, to the character from the book and also genuinely show her truly growing up.\u201d Condor also discussed balancing the romance of the content with the coming-of-age story, saying that she \u201cnever wanted it to feel like she [Lara Jean] was solely defined by her romantic relationships.\u201d While Lara Jean made memories throughout high school, Condor, too, had many memorable moments on set, some of which she highlighted during the event. \u201cMy favorite days were when the whole cast was working together,\u201d Condor said. Additionally, she was able to share her experience of her immediate rise to fame with Noah Centineo, stating that they got to \u201cnavigate this very weird [...] instant exposure\u201d together. It was her castmates who understood the nuances of the situation and she said they made her feel less alone. She mentioned that a humorous moment of meeting a few fans in a sauna was when she realized that things truly had changed for her in terms of recognition. Condor also gushed over her love for Anna Cathcart, who plays her younger sister, Kitty, in \u201cTo All The Boys\u201d and that her appearance on \u201cXO, Kitty\u201d is \u201cup to whether they [the show makers] want me to be in it and [...] my availability.\u201d However, Condor did mention that \u201cif Anna ever wanted anything from me, I would do anything for her in a heartbeat.\u201d Condor also discussed what it meant to be a trailblazer for Asian American representation in more fun and carefree films. \u201cWhen I first got that pre-read audition [...] I remember being so shocked out of my mind that it said that they were looking for an Asian American actress,\u201d Condor said. After the pre-read, she knew \u201cI have to have this role.\u201d Once she did book the role, she knew she had a responsibility to honor the representation hoping she would make at least one person feel noticed. \u201cThe world represented on screen and the [real] world doesn\u2019t look one way,\u201d Condor said. \u201cIf I can make one person feel seen then I feel like I succeeded.\u201d She also acknowledged that there has been an improvement in casting, with studios not boxing in roles and people, but she knows that there is always more work to be done. Another aspect of Condor\u2019s identity is that she is an adoptee who was adopted from Vietnam very young. \u201cI wanted to be open about my adoption because adoption is really beautiful,\u201d Condor said. \u201cI hope that people feel less alone.\u201d Condor has also worked with the Asian Foundation to open a scholarship in her name to give girls from her hometown in Vietnam a four-year high school education. She was able to collaborate with the Girls Opportunity Alliance, Michelle Obama\u2019s foundation to empower young girls through education and build schools in Vietnam. As the night concluded, Condor\u2019s biggest piece of advice to her younger self and college students is to listen to their gut instincts no matter the consequences.\n```"}

Despite the video only being 2 minutes long, it became the start of a movement.\n\nWhen Jeff, known on X as @jeffie_not, posted the first of his \u201cTeam 0%\u201d videos, his original goal was to rally players across the world to try and clear every Super Mario Maker level from the game\u2019s release year of 2015. However, with a rapid influx of volunteers willing to step up to the task, the scope expanded. The project evolved into a quest to beat every single level in the game\u2019s history.\n\nLong after most players had moved on from the game, this community stuck around, determined to leave no level uncleared.\n\nSuper Mario Maker was released for the Wii-U in September of 2015. The game allowed users to create and upload their own Mario levels, as well as play the levels uploaded by other users. A version was later released on the 3DS, but without the ability to upload levels.\n\nDespite the relative unpopularity of the Wii-U compared to other Nintendo consoles, the game struck a chord with audiences. Players were excited at the opportunity to finally take a crack at designing courses with some of the most iconic power-ups and enemies in all of gaming.\n\nBy the time Nintendo deleted the option for users to make new uploads in early 2021, 10.5 million levels were on the games servers. By the time Team 0% went public on X with the mission to clear every level, more than 33,000 of these uploads still remained unbeaten.\n\nSome of the levels were just normal creations that had gone untouched. Many of them, however, had a good reason for being uncleared after all these years. In Super Mario Maker, anyone could upload a level, so long as they themselves could beat it first. Because of this, the game\u2019s skill ceiling was insanely high.\n\nThe game\u2019s hardest stages often tested just how difficult a level can be before it is legitimately humanly impossible. Advanced techniques like shell jumping and ground pound canceling \u2013 which are virtually never asked of a player in a normal Mario game \u2013 were commonplace in these levels.\n\nThat tricky movement, alongside some of the most unforgiving level design creators could muster up, meant that the game\u2019s unbeaten levels were not to be taken lightly. But if there\u2019s one thing online gaming communities love, it is ridiculously difficult challenges.\n\nSo, when Nintendo announced that the games servers would be permanently shut down on April 8th 2024, Team 0% got to work.\n\nA community united\n\nWhat followed Nintendo\u2019s announcement of the game\u2019s inevitable end was an influx of new players dedicated to the cause. Team 0% gained online traction. Video essays were made covering the team\u2019s story, and creators like TheRileyC posted themselves beating some of the games hardest levels, complete with breakdowns explaining just how hard the levels truly were.\n\nTeam 0%\u2019s X account encouraged the movement by posting \u201cdaily countdowns\u201d that kept track of the slowly whittling list of uncleared courses, as well as reposting players who posted their impressive clears.\n\nAs the days went by, more and more ridiculously difficult levels were beaten for the very first time. Players racked up hundreds of level clears all by themselves, with the record holder for most first clears going to SchwozW6803, who alone beat 4,736 levels.\n\nBy March 14th, only two levels remained. The Last Dance, and an unexpected controversy\n\nOne of these two levels was, fittingly, titled \u201cThe Last Dance.\u201d The level is a gauntlet of demanding tricks and tight timing, with an end product that truly does look like a dance as both Mario and the different items he juggles throughout the level glide through the air in an elegant choreography.\n\nCreated by Japanese player \u305d\u3046, \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d was beaten for the first time on March 15th, by Team 0% member Yamada. Now, only \u201cTrimming the Herbs\u201d was Left.\n\n\u201cTrimming the Herbs\u201d was unlike any level before it. The level required frame perfect input (1/60th of a second window) after frame perfect input as Mario bounces off of bombs and narrowly avoids spikes. People would have ruled this level off as nigh-impossible, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that, in order to upload a level to the Mario Maker servers, you have to show that you can beat it first.\n\nSo, if the creator can beat his own level, the community thought they should be able to as well. But, in this case, the creator hadn\u2019t beaten his own level. Ahoyo, the levels creator, created Trimming the Herbs with the intention of using it as a showcase for his recently developed TAS tools for Mario Maker.\n\nTAS stands for tool assisted speedrun, but generally refers to any use of computerized inputs to assist in gameplay. When used correctly, TAS is actually a big help for a game\u2019s community. They allow players to dissect their game and explore possibilities beyond what is humanly possible.\n\nBut in this case, the use of TAS allowed Ahoyo to make a level that, while physically possible, went far beyond anything even some of the world\u2019s most skilled players could do; especially under such short notice.\n\nThe level was ruled off as impossible, and Team 0%\u2019s quest came to a bittersweet end. They had beaten every single level they could, technically accomplishing their goal, yet there would forever and always be an asterisk next to their victory.\n\nAnd yet, on April 5th of 2024, Sanyx91SMM2 did the impossible, and beat Trimming the Herbs. A level thought to be humanly impossible, completed just three days before the game\u2019s servers shut down for good.\n\nThe Legacy\n\nThere is a bizarre trait in the gaming community \u2013 one that is not really found in any other field, and one that Team 0%\u2019s mission showcases perfectly: a desire for completion. Developers can make a game, can tell you what they want you to do, when they want you to be finished, but they can not make you do anything.\n\nIt is up to the players to decide when to put the controller down and walk away. It is an awe-inspiring thing to see a community of people place their minds towards some impossible goal no one is asking them to achieve, and then seeing them achieve it anyway.\n\nAlong the way, strangers become teammates, heroes find their moment to shine, and a story unfolds, far beyond the control of any higher power. Players can find meaning where developers never intended there to be any.\n\nFrom speedruns of Super Mario Bros on the NES, to coinless runs of Super Mario Wonder on the Nintendo Switch, Mario has been the face of this movement of player expression for generations.\n\nThere is no telling what the next big challenge for the gaming community will be, but one thing is for sure. It\u2019s in the hands of the players to decide.\n```"}

(AI-Generated Image)\n\nBy Mathis Delestre April 08, 2024 at 10:19 pm PDT\n\nThe Collegiate Tetris League has just ended and that marks the first official season of the newly formed Trojan Tetris Team. What began as a personal project from a USC freshman, turned into its own USC esports team. It all started at the beginning of the semester, when user Qep, better known online as Qepsi, a USC freshperson and global top 100 ranked player, posted a message on various USC esports Discords in search of fellow Trojans sharing their love of competitive Tetris. \u00ab I\u2019m looking for Collegiate Tetris League teammates - please reach out if you\u2019re interested, or know someone who may be! \u00bb the message read. This call to Tetris action quickly garnered attention around the USC gaming community and, in less than two weeks, a full roster of five players and three substitutes was established to face off the rest of the collegiate scene.\n\nWhen asked what drove them to start this Tetris project, Qepsi answered: \u00ab I think my plan was more to find Tetris players, because I like talking to Tetris players. I think Tetris is such a huge part of who I am that it\u2019s very easy for me to be friends with someone who plays Tetris. [...] I really just wanted to establish that community at USC. \u00bb Their teammate Lian \u00ab neonLian \u00bb Fouse, who is a USC freshman, agreed that the spirit of the team was much more around camaraderie rather than competitiveness. \u00ab I mostly just find it as an opportunity to have fun. I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019re even an official esports or anything like that, but being able to represent the school is cool. \u00bb\n\nCompetitive Tetris? When thinking of competitive gaming, an almost 40 year old game is not the first thing that comes to mind. Yet, the Tetris competitive scene is well established both in the collegiate and professional realm. For the collegiate league that our Trojans participate in, the format is a Swiss stage bracket until a top 4 emerges, which then goes on to compete in semi and grand finals. The games are played in 5 sets with each one being a 1v1. Each round won in a set is a point earned for your team, with the winner of the overall set getting an additional point. You win your set by reaching 7 round winds before your adversary. Thus, a person who wins 7-3 over an opponent will bring back 8 points to their team. Their opponent will only bring back 3. The team with the most points after 5 sets, is the winner!\n\nTetris Tactics: On and Off the Grid Modern-day competitive Tetris is much more tactical than one might think. While the gameplay resembles the 1985 classic, the 1v1 format adds layers to the competition. For the first two 1v1s, each team sends in a chosen player without knowing their direct adversary. After these two matches, the losing team can counter pick their opponent. These counterpicks can be the difference in a game. A worst ranked player scratching a few rounds away from a stronger adversary can be the decisive factor. Teams will even purposefully send their lesser-ranked player to try and neutralize a tougher opponent, so their own higher-ranks can easily beat their adversaries. \u00abBeing one of the relatively lower ranked, compared to most players in the league, that means I get matched up against players that are a lot better than me a lot of the time. But that makes it so when I do even just scrape one round away from somebody who\u2019s considerably better than me, that\u2019s an amazing feeling, \u00bb explains Lian. Qepsi adds that the gameplay in itself is much more rigorous than one might expect. \u00ab At a high level, you have to mentally place six pieces or so on your board in a fraction of a second and then execute it; obviously, with precision. But the thinking is really the important part. \u00bb\n\nThe team's competitive set up, in a dormitory common room.\n\nA Successful First Season The Trojan Tetris Team ended their first season towards the bottom of the seedings. Yet, Qepsi explains that the team did not necessarily focus on good performances this year. The goal was to establish a Tetris community at USC. Which has been successful, according to its founders. When asked if they were excited about being the first Trojan Tetris team and if they would continue, Qepsi answered: \u00ab I think it\u2019s really sad that we\u2019re the first but I\u2019m pretty glad I found these people to play with. I think that we\u2019re going to be around for a while. \u00bb Lian shared the same motivation. \u00ab I had a lot of fun with it this year. So I definitely look forward to joining again next year. \u00bb Annenberg Media Gaming & Esports reached out to USC Esports Program Director Joe Jacko on whether the team would be included in the Trojan Esports roster next year. \u00ab We\u2019d love to have them! Trojan Esports\u2019 goal is to support teams and titles that our students want to play and compete in, so in a case such as this where a student created and captained a team in a grassroots fashion that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re looking to develop! Congratulations to the team on such a great start! \u00bb```"}

(AP/Ryan Sun)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner April 08, 2024 at 9:26 pm PDT\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 Left unpicked through almost three rounds in the 2023 NHL Entry Draft, the Ducks took a chance on winger Yegor Sidorov at No. 85 overall. And since going undrafted in 2022, Sidorov\u2019s trajectory has skyrocketed. The 19-year-old has been a force in the Western Hockey League this season, offering a clutch gene and crafty scoring ability to the Saskatoon Blades, who have a run into the second round of the WHL playoffs.\n\nSidorov has comfortably been more than a point-per-game player in the last two seasons, posting 76 points on 40 goals and 36 assists in 53 games in 2022-23 and in 2023-24, he even improved. He\u2019s tallied 88 points on 50 goals and 38 helpers in 66 games since being drafted, presumably giving the Ducks even more confidence in their choice.\n\nHis 50-goal season\u2014the first for Saskatoon in decades\u2014placed him top-five in goal-scoring in the WHL, which nudged Anaheim to offer him an entry-level deal. These two stout campaigns followed a 2021-22 season in which Sidorov only recorded a mere 35 points in 58 games, figures not enticing enough for NHL personnel to bring him aboard.\n\nSidorov signed with the Ducks on April 3 to a three-year contract with an $865,000 average annual salary beginning next season. With a second-round playoff series against the Red Deer Rebels on the horizon, Sidorov will aim to cap off his amateur career with a bang and report to Southern California as polished as can be next season.\n\nSidorov was also a force during Belarus\u2019 gold-medal run during the 2022 D1A World Juniors, registering three points in five games. The 6-foot, 183-pound forward often uses his deceptive stickhandling ability to force his way into the offensive zone and fire accurate shots. Sidorov is also a clutch catalyst when called upon; he led the WHL with 12 game-winning goals in 2023-24. Additionally, he thrives on the man advantage, leading power play chances with ease.\n\nSidorov\u2019s clutch ability even extends to tense postseason situations. During the 2023 WHL Playoffs, Sidorov led the Blades on an improbable run to the conference finals, which featured a first-round takedown of Connor Bedard\u2019s Regina Pats and a second-round comeback series victory over Red Deer where Saskatoon overcame a 3-0 series deficit. Sidorov notched a whopping 19 points in 16 playoff games in 2023, setting him up for his electric 2023-24 campaign.\n\nThe Vitebsk, Belarus native develops plays methodically in the neutral zone, taking his time to set up his teammates and make a push for the net. While his patience sometimes inhibits him from pursuing plays on his own, he can still overpower weaker defenders to get open for dangerous scoring chances. His speed could be improved, but his shot creation overshadows this flaw.\n\nSidorov\u2019s one-timer is a pretty sight and his release is fast and punishing. His snipes are powerful and lethal and he isn\u2019t afraid to take a lot of shots, even from unconventional angles. As a winger, he often relies on his center to lead rushes, so he\u2019ll look to enrich his playmaking prowess in order to become a more prominent offensive leader.\n\nSidorov already seems like a draft steal, but the biggest question will be if his skill can translate to the American Hockey League level, and eventually, the NHL. While only 19 years old, Sidorov already has a hefty sum of North American experience for an international prospect. But since he\u2019ll turn just 20 in June\u2014and whether he reports to the American Hockey League right away or not\u2014Sidorov will need to continue improving his game in order to rise up the ranks of the Ducks\u2019 deep prospect pool.\n\nPotential areas for improvement aside, if Sidorov has displayed one thing, it\u2019s that he can score at will. Dialed in on a new contract, he\u2019ll look to adjust to the professional level and show once again that he shouldn\u2019t be overlooked like he was in the 2022 draft. Anaheim has been touted for its stacked blueliner pipeline, but Sidorov, plus other promising forwards like Nathan Gaucher and Nico Myatovic, have put the hockey world on notice for the Ducks\u2019 future offensive core.\n```"}

New York Times political reporter Amy Chozick discussed these struggles after screening the first episode of her new Max series, \u201cThe Girls on the Bus,\u201d Monday afternoon in the Sheindlin Forum.\n\n\u201cI hope the series shows how hard the job of a journalist is,\u201d Chozick said. \u201cYou see their personal lives, a dumpster fire because they\u2019re giving their lives for this job.\u201d\n\nChozick\u2019s new series is inspired by elements of her 2018 memoir \u201cChasing Hillary\u201d which explored her first-hand experience covering Hilary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign for The New York Times. \u201cThe Girls on the Bus\u201d centers around four female political reporters who struggle with making a name for themselves while balancing friendship and relationships in modern day journalism.\n\n\u201cI think what was beautiful about having these various four different types of journalists is that we could get into these debates and ideals that are happening in campaigns, or in your classrooms and newsrooms,\u201d Chozick said.\n\nIn the series, Chozick challenges the theme of objectivity in new-age reporting with each of the characters representing different takes. Lola, one of the protagonists, struggles to follow her editor\u2019s wishes and write purely objectively, or to write from her heart. Chozick explained that through her experience as a political journalist, she is not entirely sure if objectivity fully exists in the industry.\n\n\u201cHow can you not bring your own personal perspective or life experiences to a story?\u201d Chozick asked. \u201cWe are all human. Is it dishonest in a way to say we are all sentient human beings with our bringing of our own perspective?\u201d\n\nIn a continuously changing technology-dependent industry, Chozick provided advice for aspiring journalists. She explained that writing with a deadline, especially through her experience riding on a noisy bus with spotty WiFi, is a muscle that you develop over time.\n\nStudents agreed that central themes of challenging objectivity and authenticity were addressed. \u201cYou start to wonder what is the most correct way to report,\u201d journalism student Sara Alsowaidi said after the presentation. \u201cIt is this tug-of-war between being more objective or should I be more authentic in my writing.\u201d\n\nChozick noted that this adaptation from non-fiction reporting to fictional storytelling has been a fun experience for her to collaborate with other female journalists such as Ashley Parker from The Washington Post and The New York Times\u2019 Maureen Dowd. Their experiences were often referenced in the series.\n\nChozick described the empowering privilege in narrative-fiction writing to create things that never happened in real life, and romanticize the beauty of creating imaginary friends who serve as the protagonists that resonate with her and her colleagues\u2019 experiences.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted to put the focus on women and friendships rather than politics,\u201d Chozick said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the sound of a family of female journalists covering a fictional Democratic primary and coming together.\u201d\n\nThe series received mixed reviews online, including a 55% on Rotten Tomatoes.

From your neighbors dog to the giraffe at the zoo, many animals change their behavior during an eclipse due to the rarity of the astronomical event. In previous years, weird animal sightings have occurred during solar eclipse totality. Tortoises began to breed and giraffes began to gallop at the peak of the eclipse NC State University researcher Adam Hartstone-Rose told the LA Times.\n\nKari Streiber, vice president of marketing and communications at the Dallas Zoo, shared her observations from today\u2019s event. Kari Streiber: \u201cThe elephants got together in a space and the giraffes and zebras did move around quite a bit and the ostriches were moving around in a kind of a shared space [and] were galloping and moving around quickly back there. But they ended up getting still moving toward their behind the scenes areas like they were going in for the night when we were in totality\u201d\n\nAccording to a journal published in the National Library of Medicine, 75 percent of animals studied at a zoo in South Carolina had a behavior response to the 2017 total eclipse with many showing their nighttime behaviors and some even expressing obvious anxiety during the event. Streiber mentioned one of their Gorillas exhibited strange behavior during the event. Streiber: \u201cThere were animals that ended up being in different places in their habitats than they normally would. I know one of our gorillas, who typically has a favorite spot, was in a different spot in the habitat. And so we definitely noticed some changes in behavior, but again, nothing extreme and nothing kind of too out of the ordinary for what you would think about how they would respond to the their surroundings changing in the way that they did.\u201d\n\nAnother study published to The Royal Society focused on American birds in the wild and found that during the 2017 eclipse birds and insects stopped flying as the sky got progressively darker. Scientists said the behavior exhibited was similar to when a storm is approaching and birds seek shelter. David Rodrigue, executive director of the Eco Museums in Montreal, Canada, talked about how this affected the birds and other wildlife. David Rodrigue: \u201cWe did see at the point of totality something really did happen and we saw it in two different areas at the same time. The wild birds and the frogs, [who] were singing already, just stopped completely during totality. It just stopped abruptly, and it restarted afterwards.\u201d\n\nThe recommendations from Best Friend\u2019s Animals Society, a leading national animal and welfare organization, gave some tips to keep your pets safe during the eclipse. For the next eclipse, consider closing your blinds or curtains to avoid exposure to the eclipse, and if you are outside with your pet make sure you keep them leashed and close to you.\n```"}

Because Los Angeles is not in the path of totality, Trojans on campus were able to see a partial solar eclipse, in which the sun appears like a crescent. Some Trojans made the trek across states to view the astronomic event.\n\nMiguel Silva, a senior studying business administration, returned home to Carbondale, Illinois to get a look at the eclipse. \u201cThe animals were quiet, no birds were chirping,\u201d Silva said. \u201cYou could see the moon slowly take over the sun with the glasses on and then it became pitch dark. It wasn\u2019t dark like it was nighttime, it was dark like someone turned the brightness down. It did not have that nighttime glow. The wind even stopped.\u201d\n\nFor Carbondale, a small town of about 20,000 people primarily built on small family-owned businesses, the event brought tourists, and thus, a boost to its business. \u201cIt was very heartwarming,\u201d Silva said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those times, where as someone who graduated high school during [the COVID-19 pandemic], I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to everyone from high school. This was the one time where everyone came back to Carbondale. I was able to catch up with people that I had not seen since high school and it was the eclipse that brought us all together.\u201d\n\nThe California Science Center, in Exposition Park, hosted a viewing event from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. Nor Oropez, the director of community and exhibit programs at the California Science Center, said that the event would help educate people about the eclipse in addition to wearing the proper eyewear to view it safely. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that people had resources here at the Science Center so we can view the eclipse in a safe manner,\u201d Oropez said. \u201c[Viewing the eclipse] is always kind of fun, because it\u2019s not something that happens all the time. So a lot of people are here, and they\u2019re all pretty excited, and hopefully it inspires them to study science more in the future.\u201d\n\nDespite only being able to view part of the eclipse, students said that they were stoked to see it. Kylar Flynn, a junior majoring in astronautical engineering, viewed the partial eclipse on campus. He said he was glad to see others taking interest in the event. \u201cI\u2019ve always really liked space growing up \u2014 my dad was an astronomer, I\u2019m majoring in engineering for space, and it\u2019s just something I\u2019m really passionate about,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see the general public appreciating something so scientific and celebrating that aspect of our solar system. It\u2019s really cool to see this eclipse coverage reach such a large audience.\u201d\n\nPaige Kaufman, a junior majoring in astronautical engineering, said that the eclipse was an important event to her because it reinvigorated her love for space. \u201cThe community around space discussion is what really attracted me to study space, so I always love when people are brought together for events like this,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cWitnessing events like this and seeing the space shuttle across the street gets me very excited and reminds me why I\u2019m working hard to become an astronautical engineer.\u201d\n\nTuojin Yin, a junior studying physics and mathematics, said she was excited about having everyone gather to view the eclipse. \u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime experience,\u201d she said. \u201cI think [having a watch party] is a great way to bring everyone together for science.

The array of adventures is reminiscent of the California Challenge: visiting the ocean, desert, and mountains within a day. Permission granted by Questival event organizers. (Collage by Olivia Siu)\n\nBy Olivia Siu\nApril 08, 2024 at 4:13 pm PDT\n\nThe USC student experience is vast and exciting and can be defined by a thousand different things. One of those is saying \u201cyes\u201d to over 200 challenges in a 24-hour adventure race. If you put those opportunities onto a well-researched list of more than 200 \u201cmissions\u201d and throw it into a 24-hour pressure cooker of a scavenger hunt race, you would get a Questival custom-made for USC students.\n\nThis past weekend, student teams competed for points to win grand prizes of Cotopaxi outdoor gear by accepting missions of different difficulties, like photo-op scavenger hunts, community service for local organizations, and acts of kindness for strangers.\n\nSince 2014, the outdoor equipment company Cotopaxi has been launching Questivals to \u201cempower people to see the world and make it better\u201d by completing local challenges or \u201cmissions\u201d to service communities in under 24 hours, according to Jeffrey Steadman, Cotopaxi\u2019s community engagement director in an interview with Outdoor Sportswire.\n\nIn 2024, Questival has been brought into University students\u2019 hands through the collaboration of on-campus club leadership (SC Outfitters, Peaks and Professors, SAGE, Spoon, TACO, EMSC, SC Garden Club, USC Climbing, and USC Triathlon) and local non-profit partners (Ronald McDonald House of Los Angeles, EcoDorm, Guayak\u00ed, Skratch Labs, Mountain House, Sunbum, Quinn Snacks, Tony\u2019s Chocolonely, and Sunski) to customize missions unique to the colleges\u2019 areas and are achievable for self-led student teams to complete within 24 hours.\n\nThe extreme coordination and collaboration behind USC\u2019s first Questival are communication student and Cotopaxi campus connector, Gretchen Rudolph, and her student team who designed, planned and ran the event live through an interactive experience app called Goosechase.\n\nGretchen Rudolph, second from the left, tabling for the first Questival at USC by outdoor equipment brand, Cotopaxi.

(Photo by Olivia Siu)\n\nWhen handcrafting activities to best connect USC communities with LA-based opportunities, Rudolph and her team channeled Cotopaxi\u2019s Questival mission statement: \u201cto change the world by having adventures, seeing the world, and working to make it better by doing good.\u201d She aims for Questival to be a longstanding USC tradition, and hopes that future organizers will collaborate with UCLA\u2019s Questival.\n\nFor now, we can only imagine what a city-wide scavenger hunt would look like between LA\u2019s two biggest universities (and brutal rivals).\n\nWhat did USC\u2019s first Questival look like in action? \u201cIt\u2019s like the reality show \u2018Amazing Race,\u2019\u201d said Lily Wang, one of the 10 student organizers, as she monitored the competing teams\u2019 points on the live leaderboard using Goosechase. Competitors used the app to receive their next mission, find surprise gear drop hidden locations, and post their proof-of-completion photos in an Instagram-like feed.\n\nThe main rule was that the official USC 2024 Questival sticker needed to be included in all completed mission photos to qualify for points.\n\nProfessor Martzi Campos, who teaches at USC\u2019s newly formed themed entertainment program, weighed in on how to combine the element of play with real community impact, saying \u201cThe fact that [Questival] has a scale of challenges makes it approachable. It\u2019s not so much about creating something challenging enough, but creating options for players to build their own experience and goals for them to reach for.\u201d\n\nOne such competitive strategy done by members of the team called \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d was doing as many missions close to the USC campus as possible during the first 12-hour leg of the race. So, they set aside snorkeling and hiking to the Baldwin Hills summit until the second day and instead made gourmet s\u2019mores with USC\u2019s food club Spoon, ran a lap at Allyson Felix Field, and set up an SC Outfitters tent in under three minutes at the Village Lawn.\n\nWith clever insider knowledge, they also racked up major mission points and snapped a picture of the Hollywood sign from a high vantage point without ever leaving campus. By the start of the second half of the race, they steadily held their place in the top 3 teams\u2013all of whose members would earn free Cotopaxi gear from a selection valued at more than $300.\n\nTeam \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d posing with their Questival sticker inside a SC Outfitters tent they built in 2 minutes and 29 seconds on the Village lawn.

I needed that.\u201d\n\nBipshyana Khanal of the \u201cT.E.A.M\u201d team, who used only an e-bike and the Metro for long-distance transportation, held first place at the beginning of the race and found the free Cotopaxi bag hidden on-campus by following clues in an unlabeled picture posted under the Questival\u2019s surprise prize announcement.\n\nWhen turning the L.A. area into an adventure game map, Jonathan Ogilvy, USC professor of game development fundamentals, sent words of encouragement to future Questival student organizers. \u201cThe sacrifices we make by venturing out of our comfort zones get rewarded in ways no tightly closed system could ever afford,\u201d he said.\n\nWhether through social good, physical challenges or following clues, USC student teams came together alongside campus and local organizations during Questival\u2019s 24 hours to build lasting relationships and experiences through compassion and discovery that can make for a kinder world at large.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/07/kings-los-angeles-takes-down-rival-canucks-in-offensive-showcase/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 This season, the Kings have proved that although the Canucks have ruled the Pacific Division, Vancouver still needs to watch out for hungry Los Angeles. On Saturday night at Crypto.com Arena, the Kings trounced their potential playoff opponent in the Canucks, winning 6-3 and extending their victorious streak to three games. The result secured the season-series for Los Angeles over Vancouver, as the Kings will finish the regular season with a 3-0-1 record against the Canucks. The game was the second time LA scored at least five goals on Vancouver and just the first time the Kings allowed more than two goals against their divisional rival.\n\nLos Angeles wasted no time creating offense. The Kings drew two penalties in the first period, resulting in two early power play goals. A slashing call against the Canucks allowed Kings winger Adrian Kempe to light the lamp on the power play and a roughing call mere minutes later gave defenseman Drew Doughty a chance to find the back of the net on a one-timer. Kempe and Doughty would each finish the game with multi-point performances, in addition to winger Kevin Fiala.\n\n\u201cNot good at all in San Jose,\u201d said interim head coach Jim Hiller about the team\u2019s power play. \u201cWe needed to bounce back, you get up two-nothing, the building gets alive, so it was great to get the goals, get the lead.\u201d\n\nVancouver winger Brock Boeser took advantage of a flat-footed LA defense just past the midway point of the first period that gave him his 17th career goal versus the Kings in just 20 matchups. Heading into the first second period, however\u2014Los Angeles didn\u2019t get complacent\u2014and shut down the Canucks\u2019 offensive chances. LA had barely stepped back onto the ice before scoring again. Winger Alex Lafferriere deflected in a slap shot from blueliner Jordan Spence to give the Kings a two-goal cushion just over two minutes through the second, before forwards An\u017ee Kopitar and Fiala connected for arguably the play of the game. Deep in his own end, Kopitar flung the puck to Fiala, who was making his way up the neutral zone with one Canuck to beat. Using his speed, Fiala was initially denied at the crease by Vancouver goaltender Casey DeSmith, before finding his own rebound and tapping it in. At second intermission, Los Angeles led 4-1.\n\nIn the third period, the Kings shattered the Canucks\u2019 hopes of completing a comeback. After winger Dakota Joshua brought Vancouver back within two, LA winger Trevor Moore, who notched a hat trick against the Seattle Kraken just three days before, reached a new personal milestone: a 30-goal season, which leads the team.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think when we made that trade we expected 30 goals out of [Moore], no offense,\u201d said Doughty. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty special for him and his family, but it\u2019s special for all of us too. We\u2019re really proud of him and he really earned it.\u201d\n\nCenter Phillip Danault, who returned from an upper-body injury after missing four games, earned the lone helper on Moore\u2019s goal. Offensive special teams were lackluster for both squads down the stretch. Blueger scored on a shorthanded chance for Vancouver, and Kempe did the same for Los Angeles almost five minutes later, as he flew up the ice to beat DeSmith for the score. Kempe\u2019s goal totalled him at two with three points on the evening, extending his goal streak to three games.\n\nNetminder Cam Talbot had a phenomenal night, saving 39 of 42 between the pipes. The Kings were outshot 42 to 29, so Talbot was busy, but he rose to the challenge. The 36-year-old faced Vancouver in all four bouts this year, so this matchup was nothing new for him.\n\n\u201cThe goalies, since the All-Star break, have been terrific,\u201d said Hiller. \u201cThey\u2019ve certainly done their job when called upon.\u201d\n\nThe win, along with some beneficial scores elsewhere, allowed LA to climb out of the Wild Card and into the third spot in the Pacific Division. The Kings\u2019 magic number is two; if Los Angeles gains two points or the St. Louis Blues or Minnesota Wild drop two points, the Kings clinch a playoff spot. This scenario could occur as soon as Sunday evening pending results from both the Blues\u2019 and Wild\u2019s games. As shown this season, consistently defeating the Canucks has been achievable for LA, so the Kings might benefit from slipping back into Wild Card position to schedule a first-round date with Vancouver as opposed to possibly the Dallas Stars, Edmonton Oilers or Colorado Avalanche. The Nashville Predators and Vegas Golden Knights currently reside in Wild Card spots but Los Angeles only holds a one-point cushion over both.\n\n\u201cGood mood, good vibes,\u201d said Fiala. \u201cBut now we have to look forward.\u201d\n\nThe Kings\u2019 remaining five regular-season games will all be against non-playoff teams and four will be at home, with the exception of a short trip down to Anaheim to face the Ducks.\n\n\u201cPlayoffs is a whole new season,\u201d said Doughty. \u201cWhatever happened in the season really doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles will take on Anaheim on Tuesday at 7 p.m. at Honda Center.\n```"}

(Photo by Kim Ly)\n\nBy Sammie Yen April 07, 2024 at 12:45 pm PDT\n\nDrained. Exhausted. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. These are all feelings one might have assumed the No. 13 USC men\u2019s volleyball team (12-12, 3-7 MPSF) felt at the beginning of its match against the No. 6 BYU Cougars (16-8, 7-4) at Galen Center. Just the day before, the Trojans posted declining performances in a four-set defeat (22-25, 25-21, 25-19, 25-13) to the Cougars, with each set showing a progressively stark deficit. But Saturday was a different story. Energy was high. Emotions were charged. Above all was the significance of Senior Night and a fitting farewell to outside hitter Jackson Reed, opposite hitter Jack Deuchar and middle blocker Kyle Paulson.\n\n\u201cThere was a sense of urgency about the game,\u201d USC head coach Jeff Nygaard said. \u201cThis one was for the seniors.\u201d\n\nIn the last home game of the regular season, USC spectators witnessed a contemporary twist of an old-fashioned comeback, as the Trojans prevailed in a five-set marathon over BYU (20-25, 27-25, 26-28, 29-27, 18-16). How did it happen?\n\nA Cougar domination characterized the first set. BYU never relinquished its lead, even gaining a seven-point 16-9 advantage over the Trojans. Although the Trojans came as close as 24-20 \u2014 led by offensive firepower from sophomore outside hitter Dillon Klein and freshman setter Caleb Blanchette \u2014 it wasn\u2019t enough to prevent the crusade. BYU ran away with the first set.\n\n\u201cFor me, the hardest set was the first one. You have to get into the groove,\u201d junior middle blocker Markus Olsson said.\n\nInitially, the Trojans did not appear to find their groove as the Cougars amassed a comparable 18-12 lead in the second set. But the battle was far from over. From back-to-back Klein aces to a beautiful Reed-Blanchette-Paulson sequence, the uphill climb was dutiful and gritty. The Trojans embraced it wholeheartedly.\n\nNygaard commended the team\u2019s perseverance. He characterized the players\u2019 behavior as \u201cflying around but controlled, 100% bought-in but poetic.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans cemented a diligent and earnest comeback to tie the game 23-all, backed by redshirt freshman Noah Roberts and Olsson. USC took the second match 27-25, prompting wild cheers from cardinal-and-gold supporters.\n\nRoberts and Olsson were two genies out of a bottle, putting career-high attacks that contributed to Saturday\u2019s comeback. Going six for six, Roberts had a perfect hitting percentage in the second set. His unanswerable kills devastated BYU\u2019s defense and carried onto the third set as well, where he added five more kills. Olsson notched a career-high nine kills overall. He also refused to let anything fly by defensively, with a personal-best six blocks.\n\nPer usual, Nygaard had his players\u2019 backs, issuing and winning numerous challenges that completely shifted the momentum in the favor of the Trojans. These calls were consequential to USC\u2019s persistence, as BYU\u2019s 28-26 third-set victory set the stage for the one-and-done nature of the fourth set.\n\nThe fourth set, a true dogfight, saw kill for kill. Neither the Cougars nor the Trojans were able to pull away with a major lead. Despite four of the five matches going into extra points, Nygaard\u2019s composure set the precedent for the team.\n\nWhen the Cougars reached match point first in the fourth set, USC\u2019s future hung by a thread. The set was as much of a mental battle as it was a physical, skill-based one. Fans were on the edge of their seats as Paulson was everywhere in the final plays, both contributing a block and the last kill to keep the Trojans alive, tying the game 2-2.\n\n\u201cJust play. That\u2019s what it comes down to at the end,\u201d Roberts said. Paulson added, \u201cWe wanted to leave it all out on the floor.\u201d\n\nThe entire game eclipsed three hours, making it the Trojans\u2019 longest match of the season. Through it all, Nygaard never wavered to demand a thorough review of a play. The reason is simple: he trusts his players\u2019 judgment. When Trojans at the net see something obscured to the benches and call for a challenge, he listens.\n\nThe most important challenge came at the conclusion of the game. BYU had registered a kill in the fifth set to seemingly take the game 16-14, but Nygaard called for a net violation on the Cougars. The successful reversal lifted the Trojans out of defeat; USC nailed a block and subsequent attack for its final two points that sealed the game, 18-16.\n\nMost importantly, the match was a testament to the legacy and impact of the Trojan seniors. Reed, Deuchar, and Paulson were all instrumental in the triumph, either by off-court influence or in-game impact. The camera may focus on the visible plays that led to USC\u2019s win, but it always fails to zoom out and see the bigger picture.\n\nReed\u2019s unparalleled work ethic on the court is merely a fraction of what you don\u2019t see outside of the game as the Trojans\u2019 inspirational anchor. Reed was the \u201cemotional center for us before the game,\u201d according to Nygaard. \u201cHe wanted this one. He almost willed this team to victory.\u201d\n\nDeuchar earned the first point for USC in the second set. While he did not have action in the successive matches, the stat sheet could in no way measure his character and leadership, both of which Nygaard praised postgame.\n\n\u201cIt was for him,\u201d Roberts said, attributing the triumph as homage to Deuchar.\n\nPaulson reached double-digit kills for the first time this season. A major offensive threat, Paulson is the golden standard for several other Trojans.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always out there. I idolize him. I watch him. I want to try being like that,\u201d Olsson said with a wide smile.\n\nThe team\u2019s reverence for one another is just one piece of the puzzle falling into place for them. This pivotal game comes at a critical time nearing the end of the regular season. The MPSF tournament is on the horizon. This win \u2014 with the Trojans fighting through 241 rallies and four sets going past the deuce \u2014 proves USC\u2019s ability to be battle-tested and enduring.\n\nThe Trojans will carry this momentum forward into their upcoming road matches against Stanford next weekend, before returning to Galen Center for the playoffs the following week.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)\n\nBy Adam Bradford April 07, 2024 at 12:12 am PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 So far, so good for the Los Angeles Dodgers. After entering the 2024 campaign with sky-high expectations thanks to a historic offseason, the Dodgers mostly lived up to them during their first homestand of the season. Following a two-game split with the San Diego Padres in Seoul last week, the Dodgers returned home to LA and took three of four from the St. Louis Cardinals before sweeping the rival San Francisco Giants. As the team now gets set for its first domestic road trip of the season, they do so with the best record in the National League at 7-2.\n\nAgainst St. Louis in particular, it was the Dodgers\u2019 pitching that carried the way. Across all four games, starting pitchers Tyler Glasnow, Bobby Miller, Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Gavin Stone combined to allow just four earned runs over 22 innings pitched. The bullpen also locked games down, with Evan Phillips and Daniel Hudson each earning a save during the series.\n\nMeanwhile on offense, it has been the Mookie Betts show thus far for the Dodgers. The all-everything utility man has come out of the gate on fire, recording multiple hits in five of the team\u2019s first nine games. He also has five home runs already\u2014the most of any player in baseball\u2014to go along with 10 RBIs. Outfielder Teoscar Hernandez, who signed with the Dodgers in the offseason after spending last season in Seattle, has four home runs and 14 RBIs of his own. Catcher Will Smith is batting an incredible .482 on the young campaign, while star first baseman Freddie Freeman has been his usual dependable self with a .382 average. Not to mention two-time MVP Shohei Ohtani, who has enjoyed a very solid start to his time in Dodger blue, including smashing his first home run with the team in Wednesday night\u2019s 5-4 win over the Giants.\n\nObviously, it is a long season, and we are just over 5% of the way through the schedule.

Expand Graduate attacker Ella Heaney led USC with five goals Saturday. (Photo by Cl\u00e9mence Feniou)  By   Eniola Adeleke April 06, 2024 at  8:05 pm PDT \n \nConcerns of rainy weather loomed over Pap\u00e9 Field as USC women\u2019s lacrosse took on the Oregon Ducks Saturday in Eugene, Oregon. While it did not rain for all 60 minutes of this matchup, it was raining hat tricks all game long for head coach Lindsey Munday\u2019s squad. The No. 21 Trojans completely dominated the Ducks on their home field, defeating them 19-8. Five Trojans recorded a hat trick in Saturday\u2019s matchup. Graduate attacker Ella Heaney led the Trojan charge with five goals. Redshirt junior attacker Isabelle Vitale, junior attacker Maddie Dora, and senior attackers Shelby Tilton and Maggie Brown each added three goals apiece. With this win, the Trojans advance to a 10-3 record and remain undefeated in Pac-12 play (4-0). USC is now 14-3 all-time against Oregon. \u201cThis group is super bought-in and has done a great job of getting better and committing to the full season,\u201d Munday said. \u201cWe want to play our best at the right time, and I think we\u2019re starting to do that, which is really exciting.\u201d Contrary to what the scoreline may suggest, this game wasn\u2019t always going in the Trojans\u2019 favor. Oregon (7-4, 1-3 Pac-12) raced to a hot start this afternoon, putting two quick goals on the board. Head coach Jessica Drummond\u2019s squad settled into its offense first, often sprinting down the field faster than USC could catch up. The Trojans also committed five fouls to Oregon\u2019s one in the first period, which made it tough for USC to settle into a rhythm. But once Tilton opened up the scoring for USC, the visitors were able to claw their way back from a 2-0 deficit and end the first quarter tied 3-3. The second quarter was a tight back-and-forth battle for the two squads. The Ducks opened the quarter the same way they opened the first, as junior midfielder Emma Ing faked out freshman goalkeeper Annie Shields before burying the ball in the back of the net, securing her first hat trick of the season and a 4-3 lead for the Ducks. However, no lead was safe this quarter, as Dora soon responded for the Trojans. The two squads traded scores until late in the quarter, when USC started to get some separation, going up by three with less than a minute remaining. \u201cWe did a better job on draw controls in the second quarter,\u201d Munday said. \u201cWhen you can score a goal and then get the ball back, I think that\u2019s always a way to create momentum for your team.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t just the Trojans\u2019 offense that made an impact. On the brink of halftime, senior goalkeeper Kait Devir, who was subbed in for Shields in the second quarter, came up with a big stop to deny Oregon\u2019s attempt to get one on the board. From then on, it was all USC. In true USC lacrosse fashion, the Trojans outscored the Ducks 7-1 in the third quarter to advance to a 17-8 lead. While Oregon tried to execute its offense, its defense just couldn\u2019t stop the bleeding, and Munday\u2019s squad just kept on scoring. When it came to shots on goal, the Trojans outshot the Ducks 25-12 in the game. To make matters worse for Oregon, it gave up some costly fouls that allowed USC to capitalize on free position shots. The Ducks also turned the ball over 17 times, while the Trojans had just nine turnovers. Munday credits Saturday\u2019s win to her squad\u2019s unselfish play. \u201cThere were so many players who maybe didn\u2019t get on the stat sheet or get a goal at the end of the day, but created a lane for some of our dodgers,\u201d Munday said. \u201cI think the group really bought in to waiting for the best opportunity and really setting each other up for success.\u201d Coming into this matchup, the Trojans led the Pac-12 in total assists (74). On the defensive end, USC really made it tough on Oregon by limiting its space near the goal, making it difficult for the Ducks to execute plays. The Trojans held Drummond\u2019s squad scoreless for nearly 25 minutes to close the game. Although they started slow, the Trojans were able to turn the jets on and grab control of this game. After all, Munday\u2019s squad is no stranger to coming from behind. Last Sunday, the Trojans overcame a 6-3 halftime deficit to defeat Cal 9-8. In both close-game situations and times when the team is down a couple goals early on, Munday encourages her squad to have a \u201c60-minute mentality.\u201d \u201cIf you can commit to the game plan and just stack up little plays and string those together, they end up being really big plays,\u201d Munday said. USC continues conference play next Saturday on the road against No. 11 Stanford. The Trojans and the Cardinal are the only two squads that remain undefeated in Pac-12 play this season. \u201cWe need to come in with confidence,\u201d Munday said. \u201cWe need to prepare as best we can because Stanford is a great opponent, but we\u2019re excited for the opportunity.\u201d First draw is scheduled for 1 p.m. at Maloney Field.\n```"}

Their spot in the playoffs is almost all but guaranteed, with the 11th-place Houston Rockets sitting six-and-a-half games behind the ninth-place Lakers. The Lakers have the chance to make up some ground late in the Western Conference. They sit a half-game back of the eighth-place Sacramento Kings, and can even move out of a play-in spot as they\u2019re only a half-game back of the sixth-place Phoenix Suns. But looking at the Lakers\u2019 schedule, four of the five teams they\u2019ll face to end the season will more than likely make the playoffs, so the Purple and Gold will need to play their best basketball down the stretch. They\u2019ll start off against the two toughest opponents left on their schedule, as the Lakers will take on the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday and the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday. Cleveland currently sits in third place in the Eastern Conference, even after going 4-6 in its last ten games. The Cavaliers are currently in a battle with the Milwaukee Bucks for second place in the East as they only sit one-and-a-half games back. The Cavaliers are a dangerous team when they\u2019re playing their best basketball. They\u2019re a younger team with tons of scoring options as they have six players averaging 12+ points per game. Donovan Mitchell is having another outstanding season, leading the team in scoring averaging 26.8 points per game. Besides their all-around offensive ability, the Cavs are known for their exceptional defense ranking sixth in the league in points allowed per game with 109.8. Mitchell, Darius Garland and Caris LeVert are all averaging over a steal per game. The twin towers of Jarrett Allen and former USC Trojan Evan Mobley are a dominant force inside with each averaging over a block per game. Meanwhile in Minnesota, no Karl-Anthony Towns, no problem for the Timberwolves as they boast the best record in the Western Conference. Towns underwent surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee on Mar. 12, but there is growing optimism that he could be back before the regular season ends. Without Towns, the Timberwolves haven\u2019t skipped a beat. Led by their young star Anthony Edwards and Defensive Player of the Year candidate Rudy Gobert, the T-Wolves have been excellent as of late going 8-2 in their last two games. Naz Reid, Mike Conley and Jaden McDaniels provide great depth for Minnesota as they all are averaging over ten points per game. Unlike the Cavaliers, this team is mixed with young talent and experience as Gobert and Conely have an ample amount of playoff experience. But the Lakers have been playing exceptional basketball lately, with LeBron James and Anthony Davis having their best stretch of form in the team\u2019s last ten games. The starting rotation is thriving, with Rui Hachimura settling in nicely alongside D\u2019Angelo Russell and Austin Reaves. If the Lakers really want to do damage in their remaining games, they\u2019re going to need more production from their bench. Their younger players struggled late last game against the feeble Washington Wizards, so these next two games will be a great test for the Lakers as they enter the playoffs. Both of this weekend\u2019s games will be at the Crypto.com Arena, with Saturday\u2019s game against the Timberwolves scheduled for 12:30 p.m. and Sunday\u2019s game against the Cavaliers scheduled for 7 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo by Shantala Muruganujan)\n\nBy Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier April 05, 2024 at  7:20 pm PDT\n\nLess than 24 hours after being  announced as the new head coach of USC men\u2019s basketball , Eric Musselman was formally introduced by USC President Carol Folt and athletic director Jennifer Cohen at a press conference on Friday morning at Galen Center.\n\n\u201cThis is a transformational day for USC men\u2019s basketball. I want to thank you all for being here today to welcome Eric Musselman, his wife Danyelle, his absolutely incredible family to our Trojan family,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThroughout our conversations and all the other conversations that we had with other people that knew Eric, worked with Eric, competed against Eric, it became very clear that he was the right person at the right time for USC men\u2019s basketball.\u201d\n\nMusselman, who grew up in Southern California, opened his speech by reflecting on how coming to USC was a great opportunity for everyone in his family.\n\n\u201cWhen opportunities like this are put in front of you, leadership and the top of the leadership becomes so important for a coach to make a decision on the next opportunity,\u201d Musselman said. \u201cAnd certainly, through the conversations with Jen and Dr. Folt, it became clear that this was a great, great place for not only myself, but also our family.\u201d\n\nFolt, who was the first to welcome Musselman to USC during the press conference, spoke about the importance of making the right hire as the Trojans prepare for their first season in the Big Ten next year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really great to be celebrating today. Most of you know that USC Athletics was one of the five presidential moonshots that we started getting going when I arrived,\u201d Folt said. \u201cThis is no small step. In fact, it\u2019s a giant leap into the Big Ten as we move forward. It\u2019s a new era for Trojans men\u2019s basketball. We know that you are the right person for that job, Eric.\u201d\n\nMusselman also believes that the success that the USC women\u2019s basketball team had this year will be very beneficial on the recruiting trail.\n\n\u201cI will say that the women\u2019s basketball team\u2019s success and what coach [Lindsay] Gottlieb has done is incredible,\u201d Musselman said. \u201cDuring the interview process, they were making a huge run. It was so cool to watch her team play with such great passion.\u201d\n\nBecause of the success of the women\u2019s team, Musselman said he hopes to partner with Gottlieb in order to help with recruiting. Musselman said that a lot of recruits that he has talked to were watching USC in March Madness, especially after Gottlieb\u2019s squad made it all the way to the Elite Eight before losing to UConn on Monday.\n\nIn addition, Musselman also said that he plans to go and support as many other USC teams as possible and be an active member of the campus community. He even asked Cohen if he could join the football team on its charter flights for away games.\n\nMusselman knows that he has a lot of work to do in order to construct the roster for the upcoming season. He said that he planned to speak with the team after the press conference and was seen talking with freshman guard Isaiah Collier once the conference had ended.\n\nMusselman\u2019s conversation with Collier leads many to wonder if the former No. 1 recruit will stay at USC for his sophomore season and not declare for the draft. So far, Musselman\u2019s only commitment is UMass transfer forward Josh Cohen,  who announced that he was flipping his commitment from Arkansas to USC in order to play for Musselman.\n\nDespite the commitment from Cohen,  USC lost three players, Kijani Wright, Oziyah Sellers and Kobe Johnson, to the transfer portal last week , with  Johnson announcing on Thursday that he will be transferring to crosstown rival UCLA . In addition, freshman guard  Bronny James  and sophomore forward  Vincent Iwuchukwu  also announced their intentions to transfer on Friday.\n\nWhile Musselman still is unsure what his roster for next season will look like, he knows that he wants to try to play with a style that is different from how most Big Ten teams play.\n\n\u201cStylistically, we have to have some of the Big Ten characteristics,\u201d Musselman said, \u201cbut also we want to be different, so that when we play teams in conference, maybe it\u2019s not a steady diet of what they see every night.\u201d\n\nMusselman will now look to put together a roster that can compete in the Big Ten, as the Trojans prepare to transition to their new conference next winter.\n```"}

(Photo by Madison Hogue)\n\nBy Suzanne Schofield April 05, 2024 at 6:44 pm PDT\n\nAt USC, the linebacker corps, under the tutelage of coach Matt Entz, is making waves and drawing attention for its impressive performances during spring practice sessions. Entz singled out veterans Easton Mascarenas-Arnold, Mason Cobb, and Eric Gentry as the linebackers who have impressed him the most, highlighting their leadership qualities and adaptability to the new coaching structure. Entz further elaborated on the playmaking abilities of Cobb and Gentry, noting their knack for delivering impactful plays, despite the demanding learning curve imposed by the new system. He emphasized the importance of their contributions in a fast-paced environment where adaptability is key.\n\n\u201cThe three veterans, from a leadership standpoint ... new structure, the new terminology, they have really kind of understood it the quickest. We are seeing more impact plays from those three... leading the communication on the field.\u201d\n\nRegarding the development of a defensive identity, Entz shared his perspective, acknowledging the cohesive subculture within the linebacker room. He commended the veterans for their mentorship of younger players.\n\n\u201cI really like how guys like Eric, Mason, and Easton are leaning into and helping guys like Des and Elijah ... as they continue to develop. Because, at some point [on] special teams or defense, we\u2019re going to need those guys to step up.\u201d\n\nAccording to Entz, an upcoming force to be reckoned with is Desman Stephens II, a four-star recruit from Clarkston, Michigan, who has been making waves in the USC camp. Standing at 6-foot-3 and weighing in at 235 pounds, Stevens II possesses the physical attributes coveted by college coaches. However, despite his imposing stature, Desman remained overlooked in the cutthroat world of recruiting.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about his development. He\u2019s 235 right now and he moves really well. He\u2019s one of those kids that you know didn\u2019t know a lot about him.\u201d\n\nHe expressed excitement about Stephens\u2019 development and natural aptitude for the game, affirming his belief in the young linebacker\u2019s potential. Desman\u2019s journey to USC was not without its twists and turns. Initially committed to Boston College, his decision to decommit opened the door to new opportunities. It was a pivotal moment, one that allowed Stephens to reassess his options and find a program that truly valued his potential.\n\n\u201cOnce you get him on the grass, he just kind of has that naturalness. He understands football. He kind of has a natural feel for it. ... The transition from high school to college can be a huge step for a lot of kids, and he\u2019s made it pretty gracefully right now.\u201d\n\nIn discussing player development, Entz underscored the importance of nurturing the talent of Elijah Newby. Despite Newby\u2019s initial inclination toward playing on the edge, Entz recognized his potential to excel in a broader role within the linebacker corps praising his extensive football knowledge.\n\n\u201cHe was naturally more of an edge kid in the high school level, a little raw playing off the football,\u201d Entz said. \u201cThe upside is that he has great football IQ, understands the game and is very intentional about questions and watching films.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Entz noted Newby\u2019s ambition and drive to succeed, noting his propensity to ask pertinent questions and seek mentorship from more experienced players. In observing Elijah\u2019s development within the team environment, Entz identified a promising trajectory characterized by limitless potential\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m talking to someone over here, he\u2019s asking one of our veterans. He wants to be good, and I think that\u2019s a huge indicator of an unlimited ceiling for that young man.\u201d\n\nTransitioning from a head coach position to an assistant head coach role, Entz shared his perspective on the shift in responsibilities. He appreciated the opportunity to focus on coaching a specific group of players while still contributing to the overall defensive strategy.\n\n\u201cIt has been a good thing for me. I know when you\u2019re a head coach, you\u2019re worried about everybody. I get to worry about just a room.... Coach [Lincholn Riley] has moments or has those issues. ... He\u2019s allowed me to interject and asked me questions.\u201d\n\nRegarding recruitment, Entz emphasized the importance of USC\u2019s reputation and the opportunity to be part of a program that prioritizes player development and success. He also highlighted the appeal of joining a team that is building momentum and fostering a culture of excellence.\n\n\u201cHere, you have a brand known from coast to coast,\u201d Entz said. \u201cThis is a place where you\u2019re going to get on the front end of something that\u2019s building and growing right now.\u201d\n\nAs USC football continues its spring practice, the performances and progress of linebackers under Entz\u2019s guidance offer glimpses of a promising season ahead. With a mix of seasoned veterans and emerging talents, the linebacker corps stands poised to make a significant impact on the field.\n```"}

We are less than 10 days away from the conclusion of the 2023-24 NBA regular season, and some former Trojans have continued to light up NBA floors with their stellar play: Evan Mobley has scored 20-plus points in four consecutive outings. His average shooting percentage is above 70% from the field in his last three games for the Cleveland Cavaliers, who are currently third in the Eastern Conference. DeMar DeRozan extended his double-digit scoring streak to 34 games after scoring 31 points against the Atlanta Hawks on April 1. He is currently the favorite to win Clutch Player of the Year, according to FanDuel. Jordan McLaughlin scored 11 points and dished out seven assists against the Houston Rockets to help the Minnesota Timberwolves get a huge win and remain first in the Western Conference standings.\n\nHowever, this week, we will be highlighting other former Trojans who have elevated their play in the past seven days with the playoffs looming ahead.\n\nNikola Vucevic\n\nAlong with his former college teammate DeRozan, Nikola Vucevic has proven vital for the Chicago Bulls as they clinched a play-in tournament spot for the second consecutive season. With former UCLA Bruins duo of Zach Lavine and Lonzo Ball out for the rest of 2024, Vucevic has become the secondary scoring option for the Bulls. Despite having career-low 3-point efficiency this season, the Montenegrin has made it up for his efficiency from the charity stripe, shooting 82.1% from the free-throw line this season. Vucevic has scored 10-plus points in 64 of his 71 games this season, including a few from the penultimate week of the regular season.\n\nAgainst the conference rival Brooklyn Nets, the two-time All-Star dropped 13 points and collected 10 rebounds. However, he was one of the few bright spots for the Bulls en route to a double-digit loss in Barclays Center on March 29. Vucevic recorded his 42nd double-double of the season in this matchup. Two nights later against the No. 1-seeded Timberwolves, Vucevic carried more of a well-rounded offensive load. The former First-Team All-Pac-12 honoree scored 19 points on 50% shooting against one of the best defensive teams in basketball this year. He added six assists and eight rebounds to guide the Bulls to an unlikely win against Minnesota.\n\nVucevic and the Bulls took on the Atlanta Hawks in the last game of the week. In a likely preview of a matchup in the play-in tournament, the 13-year NBA veteran contributed differently than simply scoring. He had a game-high 14 rebounds \u2014 including 13 boards on the defensive end. Vucevic performed well defensively, matching up against one of the best offensive rebounders today in Clint Capela. However, the defensive effort was not enough, as the Bulls lost an important home game by double digits to the Hawks, who currently sit one game behind Chicago in the East standings.\n\nThe Bulls currently sit at 36-39 with seven games remaining. Vucevic and Chicago hope to eclipse the .500 mark and earn a solidified playoff berth for the first time since 2021-22.\n\nChimezie Metu\n\nAfter previously playing 34 times this season for the Phoenix Suns, Metu was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies and eventually waived during the trade deadline window. The 27-year-old got another opportunity by signing a 10-day contract with the Detroit Pistons on March 20, and he has proved his worth. During his time with the Pistons, he has been hyper-efficient with his shooting, making 62% of his 2-pointers and 94% of his free throws. The Pistons extended his deal until the conclusion of the regular season.\n\nMetu and the Pistons started the week away from home against the Washington Wizards. In limited minutes, the 2017 Pac-12 Most Improved Player scored five points and collected three rebounds to help the Pistons even the season series with the Wizards at two apiece. On April 1 \u2014 against the team that waived Metu earlier in the season \u2014 the former Trojan showed out off the bench. He went 6-for-10 from the field and made all four of his free throws, scoring 17 points and grabbing eight boards en route to a devastating 110-108 loss to the Grizzlies.\n\nIn Detroit\u2019s final game of the week versus the Hawks, Metu further proved his value on the hardwood, especially on the defensive end. In 27 minutes, he logged a plus/minus of +20. Metuscored nine points and recorded a career-high five steals, but the Pistons lost by eight points to Atlanta.\n\nThe Pistons have the option to extend his deal until the end of the 2024-25 season. If Detroit decides not to trigger that option, many hopeful suitors will look to add Metu as a veteran piece.\n\n\u201cFight on, Dribble on\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

Los Angeles capped off its recent journey to Western Canada with three straight losses \u2014 against the Edmonton Oilers, Calgary Flames and Winnipeg Jets \u2014 where it allowed four goals in each game. With the St. Louis Blues not far behind in the Wild Card race, the Kings picked up their act against the Seattle Kraken and San Jose Sharks, bringing Los Angeles to 91 points in the standings. With just six games left on the schedule, LA is one point shy of the Nashville Predators for the first Wild Card seed, one point back of the Vegas Golden Knights for third in the division and four points behind the Oilers for second.\n\n\u201cAll anybody cares about tomorrow is, \u2018did you get the two points or [not]?\u2019\u201d interim head coach Jim Hiller said postgame after defeating San Jose. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time.\u201d\n\nThe injury bug has been hitting the Kings hard recently. Center Alex Turcotte was recently placed on long-term injury reserve because of an upper-body injury and center Phillip Danault has been sidelined for several games with an upper-body wound of his own. With a vacant spot on the roster, Los Angeles called up center Akil Thomas, who had tallied 43 points with the American Hockey League affiliate Ontario Reign this year.\n\nWinger Adrian Kempe has continued to be a force since returning from injury. With a goal and an assist against Calgary, Kempe finished March with 14 points in 11 games. He has brought his March success into April, scoring in each of the Kings\u2019 wins against Seattle and San Jose.\n\nAgainst the Kraken, team-leading goal scorer Trevor Moore secured a hat trick to help his team get out of its three-game funk. The winger dominated the game with ease, scoring twice in the second period to bolster Los Angeles\u2019 cushion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the coolest thing ever,\u201d Moore said about scoring hat tricks.\n\nCenter Pierre-Luc Dubois registered his first three-point performance of the season, tallying three assists versus Seattle. Because of the injury to Danault, Dubois has taken over as the second-line center, which has given him more time to perform.\n\nWinger Kevin Fiala had a sweet breakaway goal in the game, as he went coast-to-coast to effectively put the game out of reach. Fiala has also surged lately, keeping himself as a reliable point producer for the Kings\u2019 offense.\n\nIn just his second career game, Thomas notched his first career NHL goal against the Sharks. The 24-year-old\u2019s lamp-lighting was crucial, as the Kings narrowly won 2-1.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s kind of crunch time and every game, every shift, every play matters,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cJust to have this game to play a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable, it\u2019s definitely going to help me.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, LA should look to take advantage of a lighter schedule to close out the regular season. Following a date with the Canucks on Saturday, the Kings\u2019 remaining opponents will all be non-playoff teams, including matchups with the Anaheim Ducks and Chicago Blackhawks, two of the league\u2019s most underperforming squads this season.\n\n\u201cWe just have to go and just keep doing our thing,\u201d Hiller said. \u201cWe\u2019re just in a playoff race, we\u2019re trying to get into the playoffs. That\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now.\u201d\n\nTo avoid the Dallas Stars in the first round\u2014a team that has dominated Los Angeles all season\u2014the next six games are extremely crucial for the Kings. The Golden Knights\u2019 resurgence hasn\u2019t helped LA in the Pacific standings, but the Kings will have a chance to head into the playoffs looking sharp, now on a two-game winning streak and thriving at home since the All-Star break.\n\nLos Angeles will welcome Vancouver on Saturday at 7 p.m. and will look to win the season series against its divisional foe.\n```"}

James has declared for the NBA Draft, but will maintain his college eligibility and enter the portal, per an announcement on James\u2019 Instagram Friday morning.\n\nThe decisions by Bronny follow a week of massive changes at the head coaching position of USC men\u2019s basketball. Long-tenured head coach Andy Enfield resigned on Monday, taking a job at Southern Methodist University for the same position. Enfield\u2019s decisions shook the USC men\u2019s basketball landscape, seeing the decommitments of three 2024 players in USC\u2019s upcoming recruiting class \u2013 Trent Perry, Liam Campbell, and Brody Kozlowski. In a quick response from Athletic Director Jennifer Cohen, the Trojans filled the position three days later. USC hired Arkansas head coach Eric Musselman to fill the vacancy, a coach with a lengthy and qualified resume.\n\nThe path for James to even play basketball this past season was a miracle, as he battled severe health problems as soon as he came on campus. During a summer workout last year, James suffered from cardiac arrest due to a congenital heart defect. His injury derailed the first half of the freshman\u2019s season, forcing him to miss the first eight games.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a year with some ups and downs but all added to growth for me as a man, student and athlete,\u201d James wrote in his statement.\n\nWhen James finally stepped on the court, his body of work was very raw. In 25 appearances this season, James averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. James\u2019 play time fluctuated throughout the season, filling a starting role on occasion for fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis and freshman guard Isaiah Collier, who missed several weeks due to injuries. James showed flashes this season, including scoring a career-high 15 points versus Oregon State in December and recording a career-high seven assists versus Oregon.\n\nWhile his offensive performances were inconsistent, James made up for it on the defensive side. James recorded two steals in five games this season, showing his quick hands and versatility as a player.\n\nIn recent NBA mock drafts, James\u2019s name has been left off, making it possible that the former four-star goes undrafted. However, with James retaining college eligibility, there is a real chance he will be back in the college scene for at least one more year, whether it be at USC or elsewhere.\n```"}

The scholarly honorees were recognized at the USC Academic Honors Convocation on Tuesday night.\n\nBy Nebai Esaias, Marco Haynes, Qais Adawiya, and Solana Espino April 05, 2024 at 4:01 pm PDT\n\nUSC President Carol Folt named Asna Tabassum as valedictorian and both James McColl III and Lisa Tchitchkan salutatorians in the Town and Gown ballroom on April 2. The event recognizes the achievements of students and faculty at the university. The valedictorian and salutatorian honors are determined by a combination of grade point average, involvement in the university, and an interview process. This year, 236 students were eligible to receive the honors at USC.\n\nFor a student to be eligible, they must have a grade point average of at least 3.980 or higher and complete the number of course units needed at USC. A student has to have complete knowledge of an academic program and contribute to university and community life. Also, they must submit an essay reflecting on their USC journey and be willing to accept the award. The student named valedictorian must have the ability to deliver a short commencement speech at graduation.\n\nStudent candidates can apply and receive interviews, then will be selected from the Valedictorian and Salutatorian Selection Committee. USC 2024 valedictorian, Asna Tabassum, is a fourth-year student from Chino Hills, California. She will be graduating with a major in biomedical engineering and a minor in resistance to genocide, which includes her studies on how technology, immigration, and literacy play a role in the type of medical care people will receive.\n\nAfter receiving the phone call from USC Provost Andrew T. Guzman, Tabassum felt thankful for being awarded valedictorian. \u201cI think I had come to peace with the fact that whether I got it or whether I didn\u2019t get it, I was really proud of how I had grown. So just ultimately, I was grateful.\u201d\n\nDuring her four years at USC, Tabassum did a lot of work for the community, first joining LACI (L.A. Community Impact), which works with nonprofit organizations around Los Angeles. Then she co-founded the club Blueprints for Pangaea with other fellow USC students. Its goal is to reallocate medical supplies from the Keck School of Medicine to areas in need around the world.\n\n\u201cOver the course of the next three years, I was in the club as president, I was able to send medical supplies to Ukraine, right after the war broke out, Turkey and Syria right after the earthquake, various different places around the world, which is really cool. Definitely the experience that I got the most out of and the I grew the most,\u201d said Tabassum on the work she had achieved in the club.\n\nShe is also a student ambassador for Viterbi School of Engineering and part of the USC mobile clinic, which goes to homeless shelters in Skid Row conducting hypertension screenings. Tabassum wanted to tell her parents about the honor with a cake that said \u201cVal part two\u201d on it. She was also valedictorian in high school but couldn\u2019t celebrate it due to Covid-19.\n\n\u201cOf course, they were really happy and my mom started crying and my dad was like, I don\u2019t get it, what\u2019s on the cake?\u201d said Tabassum.\n\nOne of the salutatorians for the Class of 2024 was James McColl. McColl is a senior from Chicago with a computer science major and entrepreneurship minor. He was proud of himself and the experiences he underwent in order to get to this point.\n\n\u201cThe title itself is great. But it\u2019s really just the experiences that have led to this point, I would say, have meant the world,\u201d said McColl.\n\nMcColl founded a club called USC Theater Showcase Group (TSG) during the first semester of his sophomore year. The club would meet up once a week to rehearse a group musical theater song in preparation for the end of their semester performance. The ticket money from that performance goes towards the Harmony Project, whose mission was to fund and provide arts programs for underfunded schools in the L.A. area. They raised about $5,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great to see just the community that\u2019s come out of that. People are super passionate about just performing and what we do, which is awesome,\u201d said McColl.\n\nMcColl credits his collegiate accomplishments and opportunities to USC. \u201cTo become salutatorian, I think it takes a lot of hard work. It takes even being passionate about helping the USC community but it also just takes really loving the school and being excited about taking advantage of as many USC opportunities as you can.\u201d\n\nThe second salutatorian for the class of 2024 was Lisa Tchitchkan. Tchitchkan, who\u2019s originally from Belarus, was a human biology and psychology major but changed to a double major in neuroscience and Spanish because it was the perfect mix of everything she was looking for.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I really love those two [majors] is because I really like understanding how people essentially think \u2013 and not just how they think on an interpersonal basis, but also just the molecular reasons behind how people are perceiving what they\u2019re perceiving, why people are the way they are, and I think science really allows you to explore that a little bit more,\u201d Tchitchkan said.\n\nTchitchkan has two primary clubs that she has been involved with since she started at USC. Since her freshman year, Tchitchkan has been a part of USC InterAxon, a K through 12 outreach organization for local underserved schools.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really fun to essentially teach kids about not only its existence but also teach them that it\u2019s possible to pursue neuroscience at a higher level. That it\u2019s possible to get to graduate school, and go to medical school and [we] encourage these kids to follow whatever interests they like,\u201d Tchitchkan said.\n\nShe also helped in the creation of the Trojan Health Interpretation Services (THIS). The club trains bilingual students in Spanish and English to become volunteer medical interpreters and help bridge the gap between English-speaking physicians and Spanish-speaking patients.\n\nTchitchkan reflected on her journey from where she first started at USC until now as a salutatorian. \u201cI think being a salutatorian now, and comparing that to where I was my freshman year when I was first admitted to USC, serves as an example that even though things might be tough when you first come to USC, it is possible to kind of still do well here because there\u2019s so much support that USC gives you,\u201d she said.\n\nTchitchkan\u2019s two biggest supporters who she credits for her success are her parents. She has a strong relationship with her parents and said she feels thankful that they have been supportive of her throughout her life.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve supported me throughout this entire journey: encouraging me, especially during that freshman fall when I didn\u2019t feel like I belonged here. They told me to believe in myself and essentially, make it through college and get to where I am now, which I\u2019m very, very fortunate to be at,\u201d Tchitchkan said.\n\nThe valedictorian and salutatorians will be recognized for their academic achievements, consideration, service, and leadership during this year\u2019s graduation alongside a speech by the valedictorian.\n\nCORRECTION: The story has been updated to clarify that the valedictorian and salutatorian honors are not determined by the highest GPA but by a multitude of factors including involvement and a formal interview process. The story was also updated to reflect that James McColl founded the club Theatre Showcase Group, and the story has been updated to clarify where Lisa Tchitchkan is from originally.\n```"}

(Photo by Zainab Malik)\n\nBy Zainab Malik\nApril 05, 2024 at 2:19 pm PDT\n\nFor years, Assya Aallouche\u2019s typical suhoor, the meal before sunrise, included a traditional Moroccan breakfast dish called Khobz o zit, made of whole wheat bread dipped in olive oil. Now, the law student from Lyon, France can get her pre-dawn meal ahead of a day of fasting from Everybody\u2019s Kitchen \u2014 along with many others observing Ramadan on campus. The meal kit is just one of the initiatives taken by USC to provide students with resources that allow them to more easily observe their faith.\n\n\u201cThis year, the president\u2019s office generously established a Ramadan Fund in perpetuity to ensure that we will continue to be able to offer iftars for students moving forward,\u201d Varun Soni, Dean of Religious Life, said.\n\nRamadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, observed by more than a billion Muslims worldwide. It is characterized most often by fasting; the observation of Ramadan involves abstaining from food and drink from dawn until sunset for the entirety of the month to increase Taqwa, or God-consciousness, serving as a reminder that if basic physical needs can be refrained from, then other aspects of character and personal vices truly can be overcome. Ramadan is also significant as the month of the Quran\u2019s initial revelation to the Prophet Muhammad, encouraging spiritual reflection and discipline through various forms of worship. This is often through the night prayers, namely Taraweeh and Qiyam.\n\n\u201cThe month allows me to experience this intense feeling of His (God\u2019s) closeness in a way that is beyond words,\u201d said Julia Carrigan, a junior at Occidental College majoring in mathematics and media, arts and culture. \u201cIt\u2019s an insane feeling of knowing He is with you in every moment and knows you better than you know yourself. More than anything, it\u2019s about realizing how finite you are and how infinite God is.\u201d\n\nDespite not attending USC, Carrigan was drawn to the strong, vibrant community cultivated by the USC Muslim Student Union (MSU) three years ago and began participating in Ramadan with the student body. She said that she hasn\u2019t missed one since.\n\nFor Saeed Dardas, a junior majoring in neuroscience, Ramadan brings back fond memories from his time overseas. Originally of Palestinian descent, Dardas was born in Chicago and spent part of his childhood in Palestine and Jordan before returning to the United States.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d wake up for suhoor to a guy beating a drum in the neighborhood,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prevalence of Ramadan is so immersive, and it feels like the whole culture: the whole work and school shift changes to accommodate for fasting and nightly worship, the streets are live and bustling throughout the night, and the melodic recitation of Quran can be heard from mosques filling the city.\u201d\n\nFor observant Muslims, the end of a day of fasting marks the start of a night immersed in prayer. At USC, in addition to hosting various Ramadan-centric events throughout the week, after providing free iftar for worshippers from Monday through Friday, the MSU hosts Taraweeh prayers providing students with ease of access to a spiritual space for communal worship and reflection after a communal iftar.\n\nThe Muslim Student Union prepares to host a daily iftar at the University Religious center on March 28, 2024. (Photo by Erum Mushtaq)\n\n\u201cI find that anything you could ever want to confide in anyone else is most perfect when said to Allah, and He already knows but He loves for you to tell Him, which is just a paradox of His kindness, and it\u2019s hard to feel that spiritual ecstasy if you picture you and Him as separate,\u201d Carrigan said. \u201cIt takes a lot of practice, and Ramadan is the time to build those habits that last.\u201d\n\nHowever, for many students at USC and across the globe, the emotion surrounding this year\u2019s Ramadan feels void of the joy and life that typically defines the holy month due to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. As of Thursday, the official death toll stands at more than 33,000 Palestinians in 181 days, with Muslims, Americans, human rights activists, and humanitarian organizations among others continuing to call for an immediate ceasefire. With the cancellation of President Biden\u2019s inaugural iftar dinner due to Muslim leaders and representatives\u2019 refusal to attend, communities are directing their worship towards calling for change.\n\nCarrigan explains, \u201cIslam is not a monastic tradition. The ideal being to be fully present and feeling a sense of responsibility to be involved in all aspects of society from spiritual to socioeconomic.\u201d\n\n\u201cTraditionally, the privileges of being able to practice Ramadan in a supportive environment that we typically yearn for now ceases to exist in Gaza,\u201d Dardas said. \u201cMost people are the lone survivors of their entire neighborhoods and communities and don\u2019t have anyone to break fast with, much less anything to eat due to the blockade on the entry of critical food and aid.\u201d\n\nHe continues,\u201dSeeing their undying faith as they participate in Ramadan, praying in the rubbles of their mosques and homes posed a question to me personally. I have things going on as a college student sure, but it\u2019s nowhere near what is going on there, so what excuse do I have to not participate in extra worship?\u201d\n```"}

UT Austin and LSU also got special appearances earlier this week from the performer who was greeted by adoring fans \u2014 students and non-students alike \u2014 eager to get their hands on the collection and meet the artist himself.\n\n\u201cTravis Scott, he has been a very influential artist in my life. I\u2019ve been listening to his music since middle school,\u201d Ahhad Tahir, a junior studying business administration said. \u201cI just want to show my support now that he\u2019s collabed with my dream school USC. So I\u2019m very excited.\u201d\n\nBut getting inside the bookstore was no easy feat. People started camping out as early as 9 p.m. on Wednesday just for the chance to even see Scott, nevermind meet him. Students who did the overnight stay felt it was worth it even if they had to wait in the dark and cold for hours. Not everyone was lucky enough to get their hands on the piece of memorabilia, even though some gave up on the line due to its length. Lee said he was in the first two groups allowed into the bookstore and they had already run out of his size for the shorts. Others decided to skip the line completely, opting instead to place orders online.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point in staying overnight or coming in this morning,\u201d Brandon Willis, a business law graduate student said. \u201cMost people are here for Travis Scott. People that want the clothes would have been in line waiting since last night.\u201d\n\nThe collection ranged in price from $68 to $160 featuring pieces like backpacks, tees, sweatpants and more. Some fans had a game plan. Multiple groups took a shift approach, rotating in and out members of the group as needed while still maintaining their place in line. To keep morale up, they brought games, played a few rounds of poker, and made TikToks while the overnighters brought chairs and pillows too.\n\nPlenty of people waiting in line did not attend USC or have any affiliations with the school, but they felt it was important to wait in line for a chance to see the celebrity. \u201cI follow his music and do a lot of collectibles. I have a ton of his shoes,\u201d Steven Valdez said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an opportunity to actually be in an intimate setting to actually speak with him, talk with him and not be a show..\u201d\n\nScott seemed to enjoy himself too, engaging with the crowd and meeting with freshman basketball stars Isaiah Collier and Juju Watkins, even expressing interest in attending the school if he were to go back to college. He also spoke about how this collaboration was in support of college students and young fans.\n\n\u201cWe are celebrating college, college students, college athletes, just the idea of college. It\u2019s one of the most amazing places,\u201d Scott said in an exclusive interview with Annenberg Media. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the places you find yourself as you\u2019re going into college. It\u2019s where you really become yourself. I admire anyone who can commit themselves to how many years they want to do.\u201d\n\nTravis Scott was not alone. By his side was Michael Rubin, CEO of Fanatics. The pair gave the students a memorable experience and are looking to keep on moving forward together.\n```"}

In what was an unusually low-scoring affair, the Clippers were led by Paul George\u2019s 28 points, while James Harden, who has been struggling offensively as of late, tacked on 20 more. LA also received significant contributions from their bench, outscoring Denver\u2019s bench 34-9, which became all the more important as the Clippers came back from a 17-point deficit in the first quarter. Russell Westbrook, who connected with Harden for two monster alley-oops, was especially important for the Clippers.\n\n\u201c[Westbrook brought] energy, attacking the basket, getting to the free throw line, defensively he got a couple of deflections and steals,\u201d said Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue after the game. \u201cJust bringing that energy off the bench, and we need him to play that way.\u201d\n\nNikola Jokic, the reigning MVP, led Denver with a triple-double, recording 36 points, 17 rebounds and 10 assists. Jokic got off to a slow start but quickly picked up the pace after scoring 10 points in the latter part of the first quarter. He continued scoring in the second quarter with another 10 points, but in the third quarter, Mason Plumlee and Ivica Zubac switched off defending Jokic and slowed him down, holding him to just four points.\n\nIn previous games where the Clippers have been down, like when they played the Indiana Pacers last week, the effort toward a comeback was minimal. However, in their recent four-game road trip and against the Nuggets, that script was completely flipped around. The main reason for that was because the Clippers transition defense and turnovers, two of their biggest issues this season, were much more under control.\n\n\u201cIt was our defense, it was our mindset,\u201d said Lue when asked what the Clippers\u2019 keys to success were. \u201cOverall our defense was really good, I thought we did a good job paying attention to detail, executing the game plan. I thought PJ [Tucker] and Zu[bac] did a good job mixing it up guarding Jokic just giving him different looks. We were right on point with a lot of things tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers, who typically rely heavily on their star players to contribute the most offensively, were without Kawhi Leonard, their leading scorer. Harden, who has been able to be more of a true point guard this year thanks to the Clippers\u2019 well-rounded roster, has been in a bit of a scoring slump recently. However, Harden\u2019s passing and driving abilities have been huge for LA as he leads the team in assists with 8.5 per game. Harden\u2019s fix for getting out of his slump? \u201cShooting the ball.\u201d Harden took 23 shots against the Nuggets, which accounted for over 25% of the team\u2019s total shots. 13 of those shot attempts were from beyond the arc, \u201cand if four more go in that\u2019s a killer game,\u201d said Harden.\n\nGeorge, who rounds out the Clippers trifecta, has been able to do whatever he wants to offensively. The Clippers have a lot of faith in him, and they even let him go one-on-one to end the game knowing he\u2019s their best scoring option when Leonard isn\u2019t playing.\n\nThe Clippers, who had lost five consecutive home games before taking down Denver, finish the season with five home games. A home and away with the Phoenix Suns, who are only three games behind the Clippers in the standings, headlines the rest of their schedule. LA also has a rematch against the Cleveland Cavaliers, who beat them earlier in the season during their Grammy road trip back in January. The win against the Nuggets was huge for playoff purposes, but the Clippers need to keep winning if they want home-court advantage in the first round. The top-three seeds in the Western Conference are in a fight for first, while six teams are competing for the fourth seed. As it stands, the Clippers will face Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks to start the playoffs.\n```"}

Lernazang means \u201cbell of the mountain\u201d according to Zare Arakelyan, a member of the ensemble and a sophomore studying applied and computational math who said the group has been practicing for this event for a months. The group sang seven songs and performed six dances. \u201cMy heart swelled up when we were dancing and singing the songs,\u201d Arakelyan said. \u201cThese are songs and dances that are passed down from generation to generation. They\u2019re passed down from farmers [and] from warriors and the everyday life of those peoples reflected in these songs and dances, so when you sing and dance them, you feel the energy of your ancestors and of your land and there\u2019s nothing stronger than that.\u201d Satine Cumming, a media arts and practice major who attended the event, said it was clear how much these songs and dances meant to the performers. \u201cIt was very nice to see them show their culture and their dance and their song, and I fell emotional, because I understand what it feels like to have culture be erased in a lot of sense,\u201d Cumming said. \u201cSo I\u2019m just proud for anyone or any culture out there who has been erased to have a time to shine and to be in the spotlight.\u201d Attendee Nona Nersisyan, a computer science major, said the ensemble\u2019s performance was her favorite part of the event. \u201c[Since] I\u2019ve also previously been a dancer, it was amazing seeing them also how they danced and how they carried everything together,\u201d Nersisyan said. The afternoon event also featured speeches from USC President Carol Folt and the Director of the USC Institute of Armenian Studies, Dr. Shushan Karapetian. In her speech, Folt spoke about how Armenians have had their culture lost and erased, referencing the events that occurred in Artsakh, a formerly independent Armenian enclave in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region that was  invaded by Azerbaijan last year, leading to the displacement of more than 100,000 Armenians.   \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to even fathom how hard that is for people and the ensuing humanitarian crisis, the destruction of Armenian cultural and religious heritage,\u201d Folt said. \u201cI think that makes this event even more important and more special for us.\u201d Karapetian used her speech to call on Armenians to share their stories with the wider USC community. \u201cWe at the Institute of Armenian Studies, along with the Armenian Students Association and our many wonderful partners on this campus, are committed to enriching the Trojan community with the Armenian experience,\u201d Karapetian said. USC\u2019s Armenian heritage month comes after Karapetian, along with  Armenian students and faculty, levied heavy criticism against the university  last year for an Annenberg event hosting ambassadors from Turkey, not long after the country backed Azerbaijan\u2019s military offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh. The next event for Armenian History Month  is the Cultural Showcase at the Trojan Grand Ballroom on Monday at 6 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo by Nick Charles Currie)\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie\nApril 05, 2024 at 1:56 am PDT\n\nIn both his heat race and in the final, Alex Palou was untouchable. The driver of the No. 10 car took home his heat race by five seconds over teammate Marcus Armstrong (No. 11) in second. The Ganassi drivers were over ten seconds ahead of third place Graham Rahal (No. 15). In the Million Dollar Challenge, Palou again won by over five seconds, never facing serious challenges for the top spot. The podium was set from the start.\n\nThe Spanish driver took the lead at the start and fended off Scott McLaughlin (No. 2) for the first lap before driving off into the sunset. McLaughlin started third and passed Felix Rosenqvist (No. 60) at turn one after spending the whole first heat race behind the Swedish driver.\n\nPalou insisted he didn\u2019t have too easy of a day though. \u201cYou always have to work,\u201d Palou said. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy to grow a gap to McLaughlin.\u201d\n\nAs expected, tire wear dominated the race discourse. Drivers lost seconds of lap time in the 10-lap heat races. \u201cIn heat one, I pushed to the max to see what the limit was,\u201d Palou said. \u201cI saw that that was not the way to do a 20-lap stint.\u201d\n\nPalou and the rest of the field spent the first half of the main event focusing on their tire life to optimize the second half of the event. \u201cOnce I saw that, during the main race, everybody, especially McLaughlin and [Rosenqvist] were saving tires, I was like \u2018okay, that\u2019s the best thing that they could have done for us.\u201d\n\nAfter other drivers \u2014 most notably fourth-place finisher Colton Herta (No. 26) \u2014 spent the first half of the main event seconds off the pace, the race winner floated the idea of an elimination-style round. After a set interval of laps, the last-place car would be eliminated until only one remains. \u201cEveryone should be pushing,\u201d Palou asserted.\n\nAlthough Palou wasn\u2019t a fan of the choice, Herta felt good about his choice not to push for the first half. \u201cI think our strategy worked,\u201d Herta, who started the race last, said. On pace, the team expected to finish no better than sixth. The tire advantage gave the No. 26 team the chance to gain two more positions and an additional hundred thousand dollars.\n\nThe race was an unusual one \u2014 shorter and, as a result, less strenuous. For that reason, the exclusive nature of the Thermal Club and strategies like Herta\u2019s, many fans were vocally opposed to the race on X (formerly known as twitter). Drivers, though, enjoyed their experience.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s the most challenging track we\u2019ve been to in a while,\u201d Rosenqvist said. \u201cIf someone gets a lap done, you\u2019ll normally be four or five tenths in front of everyone.\u201d\n\nPalau went further, advocating for the race to move from an exhibition event to a race for points. \u201cI don\u2019t know why this is a non-points race,\u201d Palou said. \u201cIf we come back here, we need to keep it as a points race.\u201d\n\nPalou wasn\u2019t alone in wishing to remove the exhibition tag from the race. \u201cToday, we proved that we can race here like any other track,\u201d Rosenqvist said. \u201cI think that would be really cool.\u201d\n\nEven though many drivers enjoyed this format and were not opposed to having more exhibition events, the reigning champion shot down the idea of making heat races and short, interrupted races a core part of the IndyCar schedule. \u201cI like to sweat and to suffer,\u201d Palou said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want this every week.\u201d\n\nA different format, such as the elimination-style round Palou suggested, could allow for more of the sport\u2019s stars to shine. Six-time champion Scott Dixon (No. 9) failed to transfer from his heat race into the main event after a collision on the first lap led to a drive-through penalty for the New Zealander. Two-time champion Will Power (No. 12) and McLaren\u2019s Pato O\u2019Ward (No. 5), possibly the most popular driver in the series, also failed to advance from their heat races, along with a host of other established, successful drivers.\n\nIt could also have led to a less disappointing main event for Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing. The team shocked the paddock when all three of its cars transferred out of their heat races, but the wheels fell off the bus early in the 20-lap race. Pietro Fittipaldi (No. 30) had to drop to the back of the field after the team realized it hadn\u2019t put enough fuel in the car to make it to the tenth lap. He was then disqualified, as IndyCar had mandated that tanks be full of fuel. Graham Rahal (No. 15) dropped out of the race on lap nine, compromised by a stuck throttle. Christian Lundgaard (No. 45) showed pace all weekend, but he had to drop to the back to start the main event after the team made repairs to his car, which was damaged in the lap one incident in the first heat race. Although he finished the race \u2014 unlike his teammates \u2014 he struggled to make any headway once the race got underway.\n\nFor now though, Palou views the event positively. \u201cI think it was a success and a win for IndyCar,\u201d Palou said, before suggesting a similar event in January or October to bookend the season. IndyCar will be back April 21 with the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach, as the series returns to Southern California.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Abbie Parr, File)\n\nBy Mia Nu\u00f1ez\nApril 04, 2024 at 9:18 pm PDT\n\n\u201cGameChangeHERS\u201d is a column by Mia Nu\u00f1ez highlighting women\u2019s accomplishments in sports. The Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League promised to be \u201ca first-of-its-kind women\u2019s hockey league,\u201d and it\u2019s living up to its promise. PWHL just started in January of this year and it\u2019s been a success. It may be surprising that the PWHL isn\u2019t the first women\u2019s hockey league, as it was announced last summer after the fall of the Premier Hockey Federation after eight seasons. Before the end of the PHF, there was also the Canadian Women\u2019s Hockey League, which dismembered in 2019.\n\nThe ending of the PHF and CWHL was attributed to a statement released by over 200 prominent women\u2019s hockey players refusing to play for North American leagues unless they got  \u201cthe resources professional hockey demands and deserves.\u201d  Some issues that players had with the PHF were a lack of health insurance benefits and salaries as low as $2,000.\n\nThe PWHL was created to give women\u2019s hockey players the resources they deserve, with the goal of giving the world\u2019s best women\u2019s players the opportunity to pursue the game full-time. While the PWHL isn\u2019t fully developed to have each player make a livable wage while playing professional hockey, they\u2019re already on a better track than the other leagues. Players are signed to contracts worth $35,000 to $80,000. No more than nine players on a team can be paid the minimum.\n\nThe league was bought by tennis legend and activist Billie Jean King and billionaire Mark Walter. Each team will play 24 regular-season games from January to May, with the championship happening in June. There are six teams, based in New York, Toronto, Boston, Montreal, Ottawa and Saint Paul, Minnesota. These teams don\u2019t have names yet, and it\u2019s not known when they will.\n\nThe better benefits for players is not the only thing that\u2019s different from the other leagues. PWHL has their own set of rules; one of the most unique rules is the point system. For example, in the National Hockey League, a team earns two points for a win \u2014 whether it\u2019s in regulation or in overtime. They earn one point if they lose in overtime. However, in the PWHL, they have a 3-2-1-0 point system, three points for a regulation win, two points for overtime and shootout wins, one point for an overtime loss and zero points for a regulation loss.\n\nAnother notable rule change is in the shootouts. In the NHL, the shootout is a best-of-three shots format, and if no one wins, it goes to sudden death. Players who shot in the shootout aren\u2019t allowed to shoot again until every player in the lineup shoots. In contrast, the PWHL rule is that it\u2019s best-of-five shots, and if no one wins, they also go to sudden death. But, any player is allowed to shoot again without any limitations.\n\nThe PWHL is continuously growing, breaking attendance records every week. The league\u2019s first game on January 2 in Ottawa broke the attendance record for a women\u2019s professional hockey league with 8,318 people. However, they shattered the attendance record at the Toronto vs. Montreal game on February 16 with 19,285, the most people to ever watch a women\u2019s hockey game, including the Olympics.\n\nIf you want some background knowledge before your first watch, here\u2019s some key things to know. Toronto leads the league with 36 points, but New York is just behind them at 35. If you\u2019re looking for a favorite player, I suggest Toronto\u2019s Natalie Spooner, who is currently leading the league in points and goals. Additionally, they just announced the name of the championship trophy, the Walter Cup, to recognize the PWHL\u2019s biggest financial backer, Mark Walter.\n\nThe best thing about the PWHL is that the games are free to watch on the league\u2019s YouTube! The games being free and there only being six teams right now makes it easier than ever to get into women\u2019s hockey. The playoffs are about to start, so watch now to see teams compete for the Walter Cup.\n\n\u201cGameChangeHERS\u201d runs every other Thursday.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nBy Maddy Myer\nApril 04, 2024 at 8:18 pm PDT\n\nThe most exciting night in sports entertainment is upon us. This weekend in Philadelphia, WWE brings its \u201cSuper Bowl\u201d \u2014 WrestleMania 40 \u2014 to town, and it\u2019s gearing up to be one of the company\u2019s biggest. There are exciting storylines that have been brewing all year, like the main event matchup between Cody Rhodes and Roman Reigns. There are also newer storylines that will make for impressive matches, like the six-pack ladder match challenge for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship. Overall, this is a can\u2019t miss weekend if you\u2019re a professional wrestling fan.\n\nThat being said, let\u2019s look at the matches to expect this weekend.\n\nNight 1 (April 6, 2024)\nTwins, brothers and once allies, Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso will face off one-on-one. This is a match that has been brewing since Jey left the Bloodline. Jimmy has been hell-bent on ruining Jey\u2019s life since; this match will finally allow the two to go at it and take out all their frustration.\n\nThe ring general vs. the underdog, Gunther will take on Sami Zayn for the Intercontinental Championship. Zayn has been training extra hard with Chad Gable for this match, but we\u2019ll have to see if it\u2019ll be enough for him to take out Gunther, the longest reigning Intercontinental Champion to date. Whatever the outcome, with two great in-ring performers, this will be a great match.\n\nRey Mysterio and Dragon Lee vs. Dominik Mysterio and Santos Escobar should be another good match. Lee is an up-and-coming NXT talent teaming with the returning legend Rey Mysterio, who was sidelined by Escobar and has an ongoing bone to pick with his son Dominik Mysterio. Expect fast-paced action and frequent tags.\n\nJade Cargill, Bianca Belair and Naomi vs. Damage CTRL should be a beatdown for Damage CTRL (finally). The faction has been dominant since stepping on the scene, but this trio seems to be on the same page, and all have their beef with the group. It\u2019s also very exciting to see Cargill\u2019s first match since the Royal Rumble.\n\nThe Six-Pack Ladder Match features DIY, Awesome Truth, The New Day, New Catch Republic, The Judgment Day and Grayson Waller/Austin Theory. This ladder match will hold both sets of belts above the ring. To win, a member from the tag team must secure all belts, and with this being a ladder match, it\u2019s sure to have some unforgettable spots.\n\nBecky Lynch vs. Rhea Ripley for the Women\u2019s World Championship is a matchup of the Man vs. Mami, two of the most popular female superstars in WWE going at it once and for all. Ripley hasn\u2019t had many title defenses since becoming champion, so this should be the biggest challenge to date for her reign. Let\u2019s see if the Man can knock her off her pedestal.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s Seth Rollins and Cody Rhodes vs. The Rock and Roman Reigns. A duo some thought would never team up, Rollins and Rhodes are now on the same page and ready to take on the Bloodline. If they win, Rhodes will have no interference in his main event match versus Reigns on the next night, but if they lose, the Bloodline will have their reign.\n\nNight 2 (April 7, 2024)\nLA Knight vs. AJ Styles is one of the most exciting matches after Styles cost Knight a win at the elimination chamber. Knight has been insistent on fighting Styles since, even attacking Styles at his own house, which resulted in Knight being arrested. But that didn\u2019t stop him!\n\nRandy Orton vs. Kevin Owens vs. Logan Paul for the United States Championship will be one to watch for sure. Orton and Owens both hate Paul and all three are great entertainers and wrestlers. I\u2019m not sure who will walk away with the win, given Paul\u2019s track record of cheating in matches.\n\nBayley vs. Iyo Sky will battle for the WWE Women\u2019s Championship. Once teammates and now foes, Sky against Bayley should have main-evented night one of WrestleMania, given Bayley\u2019s Royal Rumble win. But since it\u2019s not, I\u2019m sure the two will make sure to deliver extra hard. They have history together, a story to tell and, most of all, great in-ring chemistry.\n\nSeth Rollins vs. Drew McIntyre for the World Heavyweight Championship is next. Rollins will have already competed the night before and will now have to take on McIntyre, who has acted entitled this entire feud.

Andy Enfield left USC after 11 years as head coach and 4 straight NCAA tournament appearances.\n\n(Photo courtesy of AP/John Locher)\n\nBy Jake Petroff April 04, 2024 at 5:33 pm PDT\n\nThis week marks the end of Andy Enfield\u2019s 11-year tenure at the University of Southern California as the men\u2019s basketball head coach. He will soon assume the mantle of head coach at Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Dallas.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m sad to see Coach Enfield go,\u201d Riley Haine, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said. \u201cI feel like he put USC basketball back on the map. He was able to recruit big names, but also win big games.\u201d\n\nAlong with Coach Enfield\u2019s decision to go to SMU, a number of key Trojan players have entered their names into the NCAA Transfer Portal, including sophomore shooting guard Oziyah Sellers, sophomore forward Kijani Wright, and junior guard Kobe Johnson who announced Thursday he was committing to cross-town rival UCLA. And while there has not been a formal announcement, speculation around freshman guard Bronny James has also begun to circulate, with his father Lakers forward LeBron James fielding questions after Tuesday\u2019s win over the Toronto Raptors.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where it came from, but at the end of the day, Bronny is his own man and he has some tough decisions to make and when he\u2019s ready to make those decisions, he\u2019ll let us all know,\u201d the L.A. Times reported he said in a post-game interview. \u201cBut as his family, we\u2019re going to support whatever he does.\u201d\n\nDuring his time coaching for the Trojans, Enfield had six players drafted in the NBA draft, three of them in the first round with two in the Top 10. Enfield also led the Trojans to five March Madness Tournament selections and one Sweet Sixteen run, but after a disappointing year with a top-three recruiting class, Enfield and the university decided to part ways.\n\n\u201cIt looked like he could recruit pretty well and develop the players pretty well, but every time they would go into a game, the offense looked stagnant and their sets didn\u2019t look great,\u201d Jaden Frazier, a freshman engineering major, said. \u201cBut, I am excited for the new coaching coming in.\u201d\n\nThe new coach is former Arkansas men\u2019s basketball Head Coach, Eric Musselman, whose California roots date back to the 1980s when he played for the University of San Diego. During his tenure at Arkansas, Musselman led the Razorbacks to back-to-back Elite 8 performances in 2021 and 2022, along with a handful of Sweet Sixteen appearances.\n\nWith this big announcement, many Trojans have been given a newfound sense of hope regarding our men\u2019s basketball program.\n\n\u201cLooking at our offense this year, there were too many dead plays. Boogie would have to come up with something and do everything last second,\u201d Zaid Ahmed, a sophomore computer science/business administration major, said. \u201cI do think it was time for him to leave, and I\u2019m happy that we brought in a new coach.\u201d\n\nA formal press conference introducing Musselman to the wider UCS community is set for Friday morning at 10:30 in the Galen Center.

We have photography, we have paintings,\u201d Maideh Orangi, a senior studying philosophy, politics, and law and MENASA co-creative director, said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been telling ourselves throughout the whole process that we want MENA art to take space on campus.\u201d\n\nCreator of one of the larger pieces, Javaid painted a series that he said explored hens and their role as the primary commodity of the poultry industry and how that was symbolic of the reproductive social labor expected of women in a patriarchal capitalist society.\n\n\u201cThe consumer society in which we live utilizes chickens in perverse, exploitative ways, as seen through the exhaustive mass-poultry industry,\u201d Javaid said. \u201cThe humor and absurdity of my chickens is underlined by implicit reflection on humans\u2019 tendency to diminish the lives of other beings, despite our own likeness to them. We are the chickens. The chickens are us, the chickens are nature.\u201d\n\nHosted in collaboration with USC Undergraduate Student Government, Orangi explained that this was MENASA\u2019s first year as a recognized student organization with a full budget, and the student body chose to put on the art exhibit in hopes of attracting students who they believed typically did not see other assemblies attempting to showcase the work of MENA artists.\n\n\u201cArt is such a huge industry, especially in L.A., and this exhibit shows that we, too, are part of that narrative and can do that,\u201d Orangi said.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Nicholas Muller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nBy Tripp Carrington\nApril 04, 2024 at 5:02 pm PDT\n\nAfter a slew of shocking results and a few victories that most fans expected, this year\u2019s Final Four field is set. Will a Cinderella squad cut down the nets? Or will a No. 1 seed leave the season victorious for the 13th time in the last 17 years?\n\n(1) Purdue vs. (11) N.C. State\n\nThe N.C. State Wolfpack was the only double-digit seed to survive the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament, and they followed that up by besting No. 2 seed Marquette and No. 4 seed Duke to advance to the school\u2019s first Final Four appearance since 1983! N.C. State is the certified Cinderella story of the season. In fact, they could be the most unlikely Final Four team in NCAA Tournament history. Including N.C. State, only six No. 11 seeds have ever won their region of the bracket, and not a single team seeded higher than that has ever made it this far.\n\nSince the start of the ACC Conference Tournament on March 12, the Wolfpack have won nine straight must-win games. If you combine Kenpom\u2019s minimum win probability for N.C. State in each of those games, the \u201cchances\u201d of winning all of them would be 0.000013%. Even rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, their chances of being here are theoretically zero.\n\nWith eight seconds left in the ACC Conference Tournament semifinals, the Wolfpack were down by three against the Virginia Cavaliers with Isaac McKneely (an 84.7% free throw shooter) at the line. McKneely missed, Casey Morsell grabbed the defensive board and Michael O\u2019Connell made a buzzer-beating 3-pointer that sent the game to overtime. Had McKneely made his free throw or O\u2019Connell not made the clutch three, N.C. State\u2019s season would be over, and head coach Kevin Keatts may very well be looking for a new job.\n\nThe Purdue Boilermakers\u2019 season has gone a bit differently. They are the No. 1 seed in this tournament, and they have been seeded higher than N.C. State\u2019s No. 11 spot in every tournament since 2014. However, the Wolfpack have been to the Final Four more recently than the Boilermakers\u2019 last trip in 1980. Maybe N.C. State wasn\u2019t \u201csupposed\u201d to go this far, but Purdue has been expected to be here year after year and failed to deliver on their potential until now.\n\nHead coach Matt Painter\u2019s squad is finally over the hump, in large part due to the back-to-back Naismith Men\u2019s College Player of the Year, 7-foot-4 senior sensation Zach Edey. In this tournament, Edey is averaging 30 points per game on 65.6% shooting, along with about 16 rebounds and two blocks per game. In his Elite Eight matchup against the Tennessee Volunteers, he scored a career-high 40 points, which is tied for the most in a game for any player throughout this year\u2019s tournament.\n\nAfter the game, Edey said, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of been the story of my life: people have doubted me, people looked past me... can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Edey will match up against the most challenging defender of his tournament so far, N.C. State\u2019s DJ Burns, who is himself having a historic run. To knock out the Duke Blue Devils for the second time in the last nine games, Burns led the Wolfpack with 29 points, his season-high in scoring.\n\nUltimately, the outcome of the game will come down to its two stars. N.C. State rarely double-teams bigs in the post, which means Burns could be on his own guarding the best post scorer in the history of college basketball. If the Wolfpack stick with their play style from this season and Edey plays even close to his standards, Purdue will advance to its first National Championship Game since 1969.\n\n(1) Connecticut vs. (4) Alabama\n\nRemember how N.C. State\u2019s \u201cchances\u201d of being in this spot were approximately zero percent? The No. 1 overall-seeded Connecticut Huskies\u2019 lowest win probability at any point in this year\u2019s tournament was 72.9%, when they were tied 23-23 with Illinois in the Elite Eight with just under two minutes left in the first half. After that point, Connecticut went on a 30-0 scoring run and dominated their way to the Final Four.\n\nIn other words, the Huskies would not fit into any Cinderella slippers. Connecticut operates on the strength of their elite half-court offense, which is based on historically effective ball screen pass-outs. The Huskies\u2019 ball movement and slow, methodical offensive tempo forces opponents to have near-perfect performances to beat them.\n\nAll three of their losses were in true road games, and in those contests, Connecticut shot a combined 27.7% from three, whereas their opponents shot 52% from beyond the arc.\n\nThe No. 4 seed Alabama Crimson Tide have shot 41.4% from three in their four tournament games, which is indicative of how talented their own offense is. Alabama has four different double-digit scorers, and their leading scorer, Marcus Sears, is averaging 24.3 points per game on 44.7% shooting on 3-pointers in the tournament so far.\n\nIf the Crimson Tide are going to send Connecticut home, it will be on the heels of Sears and the rest of the team\u2019s shooting. The other teams that beat the 2024 Huskies needed strong 3-point shooting performances and off-nights from Connecticut, which doesn\u2019t seem likely from head coach Dan Hurley\u2019s squad this late into the season.\n\nThe Huskies are bigger than the Tide, and there is no reason to assume they don\u2019t have the upper hand in this matchup. Crazier things have happened, but we would be lucky to see the two best teams in the country face off in the National Championship Game.\n\nThe last time two No. 1 seeds met in the last game of the season was in 2021, when Baylor bested the No. 1 overall-seeded Gonzaga Bulldogs.\n```"}

This year, however, Arkansas recorded a losing record for the first time since 2009-10.\n\nMusselman will be tasked with reforming a struggling USC men\u2019s basketball program, which secured the No. 3 recruiting class in 2023 but was unable to advance beyond the Pac-12 tournament in March. With a 15-18 (8-12 Pac-12) record for the season, the Trojans fell short of expectations. USC ranked second in preseason Pac-12 media poll, but it fell to ninth in the conference by the end of the season and missed the opportunity to make their fourth straight appearance in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Enfield isn\u2019t the only one leaving USC. Junior guard Kobe Johnson, sophomore guard Oziyah Sellers and sophomore forward Kijani Wright all recently entered the transfer portal, leaving the Trojans\u2019 roster short-staffed. McDonald\u2019s All-American guard and No. 26 overall recruit in the 2024 class Trent Perry decommitted from USC the day after Enfield was announced as SMU\u2019s new head coach. And, if that weren\u2019t enough, rumors have been circling about freshman guard Bronny James and his future with the Trojans.\n\nSo, USC\u2019s new head coach clearly has his work cut out for him as he makes a move to Los Angeles. But Musselman is poised to contribute positively to a program desperately in need of leadership. Before coming on as head coach at Arkansas, Musselman served four years as the head coach for Nevada, where he led the Wolf Pack to three straight Mountain West regular season titles. In 2017-18, the team secured a No. 7 seed in the NCAA Tournament and advanced to the second Sweet 16 appearance in program history.\n\nMusselman has a career 10-6 record in the NCAA Tournament throughout his time at Nevada and Arkansas. \u201cHis track record of building winning programs and his unwavering commitment to a culture of excellence make him the perfect fit for USC,\u201d said USC athletic director Jennifer Cohen, who made Musselman her first coaching hire as a Trojan. \u201cAs we move to the Big Ten and enter a new chapter for USC Men\u2019s Basketball, there is no better fit than Eric Musselman to launch our program to new heights.\u201d\n\nMusselman\u2019s formal introduction will be held Friday at 10:30 a.m. at Galen Center, according to a statement from USC Athletics. Prior to his NCAA coaching career, Musselman served as head coach for the Golden State Warriors (2002-2004) and Sacramento Kings (2006-2007). He has also been an assistant coach for several programs at the college and professional levels, including the Orlando Magic, Atlanta Hawks, Memphis Grizzlies, LSU and Arizona State throughout his 35-year coaching career.\n\nMusselman has connections to Southern California, having played college basketball at the University of San Diego from 1983-87 and coached the Los Angeles D-Fenders (now the South Bay Lakers) of the NBA G League in 2011-12.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Chris O'Meara)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nApril 04, 2024 at 1:16 pm PDT\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d is a column by Kasey Kazliner about the National Hockey League. Last week, I wrote about every team currently holding a playoff spot. While some squads, like the Dallas Stars and New York Rangers, have officially secured their trips to the Stanley Cup Playoffs, a handful of teams still have yet to solidify their spots, like the Philadelphia Flyers, Washington Capitals and Los Angeles Kings. These teams sit in playoff positions, but they could very well be jumped by fringe teams just barely staying alive. It\u2019s time to dive in on the potential postseason teams hoping to catch a spark in the final games of the regular season.\n\nIn this column, I define fringe teams as those within 10 points of the second Wild Card spot in their respective conferences (sorry Ottawa Senators, Montreal Canadiens and Calgary Flames).\n\nEastern Conference\n\nDetroit Red Wings\nFinishing top-three in the Atlantic Division is out of the question for the Red Wings, but they\u2019re even with the Capitals for the second Wild Card spot in the East, with one more game played. Detroit\u2019s story has been a puzzling one; following a six-game winning streak in February, the Wings immediately proceeded to lose seven straight, which plummeted their playoff chances. Goaltender Alex Lyon has been up and down this year. Lyon stood tall in Detroit\u2019s win over the Tampa Bay Lightning but was also entering the game on a personal 10-game skid. The Red Wings will need the 31-year-old to stay resilient in the final stretch.\n\nAs far as skaters, winger Patrick Kane knows what it takes to make a playoff push; the three-time Cup winner has tallied points in nine of his last 10 games and should continue to provide veteran mentorship to younger players like winger Lucas Raymond. Raymond is having a phenomenal season \u2014 with a team-leading 61 points \u2014 but he was a nonfactor in Detroit\u2019s recent slide, so he\u2019ll also need to step up when it matters.\n\nThroughout all the turmoil, the Red Wings are still breathing. Detroit lost four straight to conclude March but took an extremely crucial victory over the division-rival Lightning to get back in the win column. With eight games left on the calendar, Detroit will have quite a few critical bouts, but it will be fiending to take down the Caps on April 9, a game that could heavily influence the playoff picture.\n\nNew York Islanders\nThe Islanders still have a shot at finishing top-three in the chaotic Metropolitan Division, as they only trail the Flyers by two points. The Wild Card could also be an option for New York, as it sits behind Detroit and Washington by one point. The Isles have been inconsistent under the helm of head coach Patrick Roy, who was hired on January 20. Like the Red Wings, New York is also very streaky. From late February to mid-March, the Islanders went on a six-game winning streak, including wins over the dominant Stars and Boston Bruins, but then lost six consecutive games, including back-to-back shutouts. Since then, New York has recorded some crucial victories to keep it in the thick of the race, including a gritty one over Philadelphia in overtime on April 1.\n\nNetminder Ilya Sorokin finally got back in the win frame against the Chicago Blackhawks on April 2 after a series of subpar performances. The other half of the tandem, Semyon Varlamov, has provided consistency between the pipes lately and is looking to rise up as the more reliable option. Center Bo Horvat has scored in the Islanders\u2019 last two games following a stretch of six goalless games. Horvat, alongside forwards Mathew Barzal, Brock Nelson and others will look to anchor a New York offense that has been shaky lately.\n\nThe Isles will have some tough matchups on tap to close out the regular season. They\u2019ll notably face the dangerous Nashville Predators, plus the Rangers twice. Consistency will be key for the Islanders if they want to sneak into the Stanley Cup Playoffs and potentially make a run.\n\nPittsburgh Penguins\nThis season has been an utter disappointment for the Penguins. While acquiring reigning Norris Trophy winner Erik Karlsson was supposed to make Pittsburgh dangerous, the Pens have been very underwhelming and frustrating. They had no choice but to deal superstar winger Jake Guentzel at the trade deadline and have had their fair share of peaks and valleys. However, more recently, Pittsburgh has made noise in the Metropolitan race. The Penguins have won four of their last five games and have tallied points in their last six.\n\nFour points behind the Flyers in the division and three back of the Wild Card, the Pens have a legitimate chance to put this season\u2019s woes in the past and make a playoff run. Pittsburgh\u2019s upside is its experience. This is not Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin\u2019s first rodeo by any means, and both have been on tears lately. Crosby has registered a whopping 20 points in his last 11 games and Malkin is coming off a huge three-point performance in the Penguins\u2019 intense comeback victory over the New Jersey Devils.\n\nGoalie Alex Nedeljkovic has also been a bright spot in Pittsburgh\u2019s recent games. The 28-year-old has started in the Penguins\u2019 last six contests and has been significantly more dependable than Tristan Jarry, who\u2019s currently injured. The Pens won\u2019t be able to slack off in their upcoming games, as every matchup remaining on their schedule will be tough. Pittsburgh will have meetings with the Capitals, Lightning, Maple Leafs and other playoff teams. However, the Penguins might\u2019ve found a spark and will look to ignite their energy heading into the final games.\n\nBuffalo Sabres\nThe Sabres have the NHL\u2019s longest active playoff drought, 12 seasons, and will need to be nearly perfect to end it this year. Buffalo has only alternated wins and losses since taking three straight games in mid-March. The Sabres are five points back of the Wild Card with six matches to play. It\u2019s no secret that winger Tage Thompson has been disappointing this season; he\u2019s posted a mere 52 points following a 94-point campaign in 2022-23. Thompson missed significant time this year with injuries, but it\u2019s still a surprisingly low total.\n\nHowever, his last few games have shown that he has the capacity to step up when it matters. The 26-year-old posted three points in a crucial victory over Washington and notched four goals in a win over New Jersey. Winger JJ Peterka has also been hot as of late, scoring in five of the last six games. Alex Tuch has been a needed assist machine recently and has helped his linemates score in all but one game since March 14.\n\nBuffalo may not be star-studded, but it has some quality depth. Crucially, the Sabres will need netminder Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen to stay composed. The 25-year-old collected personal win No. 25 on April 2 and has been a bright spot for his inconsistent team this year. However, he has had some blunders lately, including allowing eight goals to the Edmonton Oilers, so he\u2019ll need to tighten some screws if he wants to lead his team to the postseason.\n\nBuffalo has some important games coming up. The Sabres will especially need to avoid complacency against the Red Wings and Capitals, who they\u2019ll see this week.\n\nNew Jersey Devils\nThe Devils are another team having a shockingly frustrating season following a playoff series victory in 2023. New Jersey has fallen in its last three games, slimming its playoff chances significantly. The Devils sit six points back of the Wild Card and will need a miracle to make the postseason.\n\nNew Jersey made changes to its goaltending cast at the trade deadline, bringing in Jake Allen and Kaapo K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen. Both have crumbled during the losing streak; Allen completely fell apart against the Penguins and K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen allowed a goal late to seal the Devils\u2019 losing fate against the Rangers.\n\nOn the bright side, winger Jesper Bratt has been on a tear. Bratt is riding a six-game point streak despite his team\u2019s woes. Captain Nico Hischier has been productive offensively as well, but it\u2019s just not translating to victories.\n\nNew Jersey will need to completely turn things around and will need a bit of luck to make the playoffs. The Devils will have four consecutive matchups with playoff teams following a date with the Senators and will close out the regular season against the Islanders.\n\nWestern Conference\n\nSt. Louis Blues\nThe Kings\u2019 recent woes have allowed the Blues to step right into the playoff conversation in the West. St. Louis has played a solid brand of hockey over the past month; the Blues have only lost three games since March 11, placing them just five points behind Los Angeles for the second Wild Card spot.\n\nUnsung hero Brandon Saad has been St. Louis\u2019 reliable scorer lately. The winger has tallied goals in five of his last six games, but critically, has notched three game-winners over the stretch. Goalie Jordan Binnington has had some nice starts lately and appears vastly improved after a couple of down years. He\u2019s taken the Blues through three overtime games recently and stayed confident to win two of them.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not technically out of the question, St. Louis likely won\u2019t make the playoffs. The Blues will have a variety of opponents ranging from contenders to tankers in the final stretch, so they\u2019ll hope to surprise the doubters.\n\nMinnesota Wild\nThe Wild are eight points back of the second Wild Card spot and it\u2019s pretty much safe to say they\u2019ll be making offseason plans early. But alas, they\u2019re hanging on by a thread and are still alive in the race, with only one regulation loss in their last 10 games.\n\nWinger Kirill Kaprizov has been Minnesota\u2019s point-producing catalyst for some time now, and he\u2019s picked up his game even more as of late. The 26-year-old tallied 19 points in March and along with the team\u2019s young core including blueliner Brock Faber and center Marco Rossi, could help the Wild become a more successful team down the line.\n\nLike St. Louis, Minnesota will battle teams with varying levels of success to close out the year. Both the Blues and Wild will be praying for the Kings to crumble, which would make the Western Conference playoff picture a bit more interesting.\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Chikinbun licensed under CC by Pexels)\n\nBy Sophie Sullivan April 04, 2024 at 1:08 pm PDT\n\nCarnitas or carne asada, black beans or pinto, green sauce or red: just a few of the decisions that go into crafting the perfect burrito. To celebrate National Burrito Day, we took a look into the comfort food\u2019s origins, and recommendations on where to get yours whenever the cravings hit.\n\nCurious about why it\u2019s called a burrito? It\u2019s widely accepted that the word \u201cburrito\u201d is a diminutive of \u201cburro,\u201d the Spanish word for donkey \u2014 so a \u201cburrito\u201d is a \u201clittle donkey,\u201d however why it\u2019s referred to as a \u201clittle donkey\u201d is a little less clear. The burrito likely originated from northern Mexico, where donkeys were used to carry huge amounts of goods on long roads. David Thomsen theorizes in his book \u201cBurrito! Hot on the Trail of the Little Burro\u201d that burritos, like donkeys, can carry huge amounts of ingredients in one wrap \u2014 hence, a little version of a donkey.\n\nSome theories suggest that the burrito was actually a sidekick to the donkey and those traveling with one. The good-for-travel, handheld nature of the food made it easy to bring on long trips. While another suggests that a vendor named Juan M\u00e9ndez was the first to wrap his food in a tortilla and travel with it by miniature donkey. Some say that \u201cburrito\u201d doesn\u2019t refer to a donkey at all, but dimwitted school children for whom a vendor invented the food item.\n\nWhatever the origin, it was a success. It seems nearly every street corner in Los Angeles has a late-night burrito vendor. Today, both Taco Bell and Chipotle rank in the top 10 food chains in America. And most students have a go-to spot to satisfy their craving.\n\nFor some, it isn\u2019t far from home. Bailey Johnson, a senior studying industrial and systems engineering, said her go to is the pre-made sausage burrito from Seeds Marketplace. Off-campus, Armin Bazarjani, a first-year student in the psychology doctorate program, recommended El Huero, Chichen Itza in the Mercado la Paloma or Taco Bell for a \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d meal.\n\nHowever, most agreed that the best time of day for a burrito was not during the day at all. The ideal time? \u201cDefinitely 2 a.m. when you\u2019re drunk,\u201d Nick Galland, a student in the master\u2019s of international trade law and economics program, said. His favorite spot is Cerveteca in Culver City, or a street vendor that can put together his go-to order: al pastor with pineapple, cilantro and onions.\n\nThe pop-up stands around campus remain the favorite for freshman Quame Pierre in the theater program. \u201cThere\u2019s this one down Vermont I love called Taco Zone \u2014 it\u2019s always where I go to get my tacos and burritos. Best time of day ... 2 a.m.,\u201d Pierre said. He recommended the avocado sauce. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\nIf waiting until the street vendors set up this evening is too painstaking, check out some of the offers below to get a better burrito bang for your buck:\n\nTaco Bell: half off the second burrito you order on the Taco Bell app\nChipotle: $0 delivery fee with code \u201cDELIVER\u201d\nEl Pollo Loco: buy one, get one free under the loyalty program\nBaja Fresh: buy one, get one free under the loyalty program, or with code \u201cBURRITO2024\u2032\u2032\nRubio\u2019s Coastal Grill: $8.99 burritos with code \u201cBURRITO\u201d on the Rubio\u2019s Coastal Grill app\nQdoba: free burrito with order of an entree and drink under the loyalty program\nDog Haus: buy one, get one free when you order on the Dog Haus app\nWahoo\u2019s Fish Taco: $1 off the citrus slaw and outer reef burritos until April 8 ($10.95 each)\nDoorDash: $5 off when you spend $20 or more on Taco Bell\nUber Eats: buy one, get one free beefy five-layer burrito from Taco Bell\nGrubhub: free burrito when you spend $22 or more on Taco Bell\n```"}

Negotiations with the industry\u2019s biggest companies for the same parameters are ongoing. (Photo courtesy of Stuart Locklear/Stuart Locklear Photography)\n\nBy Olivia Siu April 04, 2024 at 12:45 pm PDT\n\nIn a world of content and community moderation on business models as low as free-to-play, using AI to make a video game is entirely a different beast as opposed to a film or TV show. At the Game Developers Conference (GDC) this past March, representatives of Meta, Xbox and SAG-AFTRA attempted to address the biggest questions about AI in a panel discussion titled, \u201cWhat Companies Need to Know about Deepfakes.\u201d At this time, agreement over equal AI protection policies with the biggest game studios remains unsettled. This umbrella term encompasses equal recognition among performance types (voice recording, motion capture, etc.), fair compensation rates, and specifically when to notify performers about AI usage, intent of use and negotiating portions of an actor\u2019s performance to create a digital replica. This \u201cstandstill\u201d puts the Union in such a posture to strike in \u201ca matter of weeks,\u201d said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director and chief negotiator of SAG-AFTRA.\n\nThe first tiered game agreement was announced earlier in the year for low-to mid-sized game companies, including best practices and workplace language for AI deepfakes, or \u201cdigital replicas,\u201d according to the agreement. The GDC panel emphasized that in order to determine who is protected from being replaced by AI, we must first determine how the AI is used. For production processes or for performance capture? In defense of on-the-rise, or \u201cindie\u201d developers, Meta representative Wei Wang stated that AI could introduce a \u201clower barrier of entry to creating high-quality experiences\u201d for platforms as content-rich as virtual reality. AI has a historical use in game development to engineer the behavior of non-player characters (NPCs) because of the labor-intensive process of designing crowds. However, even after launch, an unofficial production phase unique to games lies outside of the studio\u2019s hands: user-generated modified content, or \u201cmods\u201d \u2014 to which Xbox/Microsoft representative, Jessica Henderson, nods to censorship tools, \u201cyounger players who may be vulnerable to bullying... AI could actually yield a content mod solution.\u201d\n\nCapabilities of technology cannot be considered without discussing the impact of what implementation actually means, Crabtree-Ireland said During the week-long conference. Alongside Sarah Elmaleh, the interactive media agreement negotiating committee chair, Crabtree-Ireland connected with the co-party of their latest successful agreement, indie developers (where students fall under), who also represented a whopping third of GDC attendees \u2014 the highest percentage in any one category according to the annual GDC State of Industry survey report.\n\nIn a sense, the push for an AI protection agreement reflects the top workforce concerns felt in GDC. The same 2024 attendee survey also reveals questions developers had about AI at the workplace, along with layoffs from major studio companies. Statistics from the Game Developers Conference's annual State of Industry Report which collects and summarizes survey responses on top questions from its attendee community. (Graphic by Olivia Siu)\n\nJust as developers adjust to AI tools as part of their programming skills, Elmaleh discussed whether performers consider digital replicas as part of their portfolio. \u201cYes, you could start to have [digital replicas] as a new revenue stream. But that big \u2018if\u2019 is if those protections are in place,\u201d Elmaleh said. \u201cEveryone in the community all at once, has to stand up and say here\u2019s the baseline. Anything above is opportunity and below is exploitation.\u201d Elmaleh, an acting workshop teacher at USC, continues to directly speak to students and new talent, saying that now more than ever actors must treat themselves as business people by understanding that building a career in this space, means building a business. As for new developers, Elmaleh herself began her actor/director career voicing mods for her favorite games before joining household name franchises like Final Fantasy, Halo Infinite and Fortnite. She states that the spirit of collaboration is crucial and irreplaceable no matter the budget. \u201cI think it is possibly convenient to sit at a machine and get something back out of it,\u201d Elmaleh said. \u201cIt\u2019s not actually impossible for anyone at any budget level to collaborate with a performer.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Marcus Heatherly)\n\nBy Julius Johnston April 04, 2024 at 11:22 am PDT\n\nThis past year, USC was fortunate to rack up several top recruiting classes. Immediately, when people hear this, their mind goes to the signings of Isaiah Collier and JuJu Watkins for men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball, both of whom were No. 1 recruits out of high school. What doesn\u2019t get mentioned is USC men\u2019s volleyball, which also brought in the No. 1 recruiting class and the No. 1 player in the nation in Wesley Smith. This was largely due to the strong recruiting ability of head coach Jeff Nygaard, who signed the No. 3 recruiting class in 2022.\n\nWesley Smith\nLeading the Trojans\u2019 2023 recruiting class is the 6-foot-10 giant middle blocker Wesley Smith. Growing up in Carlsbad, California, Smith\u2019s first love wasn\u2019t volleyball, which often shocks people. Basketball was Smith\u2019s primary sport up until just three years ago, when he decided to pick up volleyball. Once he started playing volleyball, he fell in love with \u201cthe tight-knit community\u201d he found, and the rest is history. With only three years under his belt, it shocks some that Smith was able to rise atop the 2023 rankings in such a short time. Smith, along with others, acknowledges his physical stature as the reason why this was possible; Nygaard even explained his physicality as \u201cungodly.\u201d\n\nSmith doesn\u2019t let the buzz and pressure of being a No. 1 recruit get to him, even though he quite literally stands out. When asked about the pressure that comes along with being the No. 1 recruit, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s definitely pressure from other people, but I don\u2019t really let it affect me. I just go out there and play my best and do my part for the team.\u201d Smith doesn\u2019t act like he has everything at his disposal just because of his ranking. He feels as if he has to earn his spot every day both on and off the court. Coach Nygaard, along with the assistant coaches, are seeing this. \u201cHe works his butt off,\u201d Nygaard said. \u201cHe is crushing the weight room, the training room and all these things. He\u2019s developing every single day and is still learning the reactions of the game.\u201d\n\nSmith credits his ability to block out pressure and the urge to be better to Peyton Manning, the Hall of Fame quarterback, who is his sports hero.\n\nJakobi Lange\nNext up is outside hitter Jakobi Lange from Hinsdale, Illinois. Even though it\u2019s 1,700 miles from home, USC stood out to Lange. \u201cThe combination of academics, athletics and a social life set USC apart from other schools I was being recruited by,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, the weather here is amazing.\u201d\n\nThough being from the Midwest, where volleyball isn\u2019t as popular compared to the West Coast, Lange was still a top player in the 2023 class. Beginning to take volleyball seriously in his freshman year of high school, he rose to the top of the ranks locally, becoming the No. 1 recruit out of Illinois. Lange was named to the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) High School All-America First Team in his senior year.\n\nWith such accolades coming out of high school, one would assume that college playing time would follow. However, following an early-season injury, he was forced to take a backseat role for the first few games. Most would take this in a negative light, but Lange sees it in the opposite way. \u201cYeah, being injured sucks, but I get a chance to learn from [sophomore outside hitter Dillon Klein] and all the other great outsides on the team,\u201d Lange said. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome to have all these amazing players around me, because it pushes me to be better everyday.\u201d\n\nLange credits his dad and older brother for making him want to compete and be better. \u201cBeing a younger sibling taught me from an early age that you had to be competitive,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dad inspires me to be better \u2014 he is a big role model for me.\u201d\n\nJack Ebertin\nAnother standout outside hitter \u2014 Jack Ebertin from Saratoga, California \u2014 also contributed to the Trojans\u2019 top-ranked class. Standing at 6-foot-6, Ebertin played both basketball and volleyball in high school. \u201cWhat made me choose volleyball over basketball was simply just the fact I was better in high school,\u201d Ebertin said. \u201cBoth of my parents attended USC, my dad played football here and my older sister played on the beach team here a few years ago. It was always USC for me. So when they offered, it felt like a dream come true.\u201d\n\nWinning is at the top of Jack\u2019s \u201cto-do\u201d list while at USC, and nobody showed him how to win better than his sports hero \u2014 his older sister Mollie, who was a standout on the women\u2019s beach volleyball team from 2019 to 2022. \u201cShe showed me that it is possible to win a national championship and I want to do the same,\u201d Ebertin said.\n\nNygaard believes Ebertin will contribute and help the team achieve the goal of a national championship. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to have Jack. He can challenge for a starting spot and provides crucial depth,\u201d Nygaard said. \u201cDepth sets great teams apart, and with Jack, we aim to push for a national championship soon.\u201d\n\nOutside of volleyball is where you find who Ebertin truly is. Despite the pressures of balancing academics with his athletic career, he decided to stick to his passion of coding. Ebertin majors in computer science out of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work and I spend a lot of my free time working, but after volleyball, I want a career in something I\u2019m passionate about,\u201d Ebertin said.\n\nBrad Pan\nRounding out the class is the shortest of the four freshmen, 5-foot-10 libero Brad Pan from Cupertino, California. Born in Taipei, Taiwan, Pan attributes his love for volleyball to his head coach at Mountain View Volleyball Club, Ken Shibuya. \u201cWhat started off as something I just did for fun at recess quickly turned into something I loved,\u201d Pan said. \u201cI give a lot of that credit to my club coach, because he always believed in me and kept pushing me to be better.\u201d\n\nDespite being one of the smallest players on the team, Pan doesn\u2019t think of his height in a negative way, but rather uses it to his advantage. \u201cBeing short isn\u2019t good for a lot of things, but on the court I use it to get to balls that most players can\u2019t get to,\u201d Pan said.\n\nJust like his counterparts, Pan was also a VolleyballMag Top 50 player in the country this past year. As a result, he was recruited by a plethora of schools around the country, but USC stood out to him the most. \u201cUSC definitely offers the most amount of resources and opportunities for not only student-athletes, but for students in general,\u201d Pan said. \u201cI think USC sets you up very well for success post-grad.\u201d\n\nComing in with an already established libero in junior Austin Stuard, Pan isn\u2019t expecting anything to just be given to him off the jump. \u201cI want to come in and help in any way possible, whether it be in the locker room or if I get the chance to play, I just want to do what will help us win,\u201d Pan said.\n\nJeff Nygaard agrees with Brad\u2019s mindset on wanting to help the team. \u201c[Assistant coach Gary] Sato identified Brad early at a camp as a guy who could come in and do some things for us,\u201d Nygaard noted. \u201cIf you\u2019re on the squad, I have the belief that you can do what needs to be done to be successful.\u201d\n\nEven being such a young squad \u2014 with over half the roster being underclassmen \u2014 these fantastic freshmen are striving for nothing shorter than a national championship. When asked about what they want to accomplish at USC, all players mentioned wanting to be the best. Wesley Smith went as far as saying, \u201cPrimarily, we want to win a national championship, we want to be the best; we want to leave a legacy here.\u201d\n```"}

The Hebrew word \u201cChai\u201d translates to life and is often used in this pun to demonstrate Israel\u2019s resilience. And a new report suggests the concept is in wide use in Israel.\n\nDespite five months of war with Hamas, Israel placed in the top five in the World Happiness Report. The annual report, which is conducted by Gallup, the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre and the UN, was released on March 20 and ranked 143 countries in terms of their happiness. Israel dropped one spot from last year, but it still surpassed the United States, which came in at 23.\n\nThe report measures happiness and subjective well-being according to life evaluation and positive and negative emotions. The report uses the Cantril ladder, which asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a zero. They are then asked to rank their current lives on a zero to 10 scale. More than 100,000 people from 130 countries participate in the poll each year.\n\nLogan Barth, a senior at USC studying law, history and culture, was one of 25 students on a selective trip led by the Maccabee Task Force in early January to explore what happened when terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and the impacts of the ongoing conflict. He said the experience was \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d elaborating on how much the country and people have changed since the war broke out. He said almost everyone there currently is or knows someone serving in the army, has friends or family who were at the Nova Music Festival or Kibbutzim or has been impacted by Oct. 7 in some other way.\n\n\u201cWhen something that tragic and so repulsive happens to a country that the spirit of the country is hindered, you can really feel that people are upset,\u201d Barth said. Barth explained that Israel lost its \u201cChutzpah,\u201d a Yiddish word that is often used to describe the loud and rambunctious personality and sport that is often associated with Israelis or Jewish people together. Barth said he sees fewer people joking around with each other on the streets. On his trip, he did not take on the Tel Aviv nightlife as he believed it felt wrong during the times of war.\n\nStill, he is not surprised by the country\u2019s high ranking. On Barth\u2019s recent trip to Israel, he spoke to a worker from ZAKA \u2014 Israel\u2019s emergency response team that processes and handles all of the bodies from mass casualty events, including Oct. 7. He said speaking to the ZAKA employee was an extremely difficult experience where he heard some of the most graphic scenes he had ever heard in his life from a person who actually saw the carnage.\n\nIn the presentation, Barth said, the ZAKA employee discussed what it was like driving around the Gaza envelope, filling his truck up with bodies, seeing bodies disintegrate in his hands, helping victims of sexual assault and dealing with children who have died. After Barth\u2019s group heard this story, they all gathered to take a picture with the ZAKA employee in which none of the students on the trip smiled because they were all so horrified by what they heard. But the ZAKA worker told the group they had to smile and said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t smile, then we won\u2019t survive.\u201d\n\nBarth then explained that happiness is a central part of religious values and that for 3,000 years, the Jewish people and Israel had faced difficult situations. \u201cIf you never have joy, then you know, it\u2019d be difficult for the Jewish people to move on,\u201d Barth said.\n\nPatricia George is a professor at USC with a PhD in Brain and Cognitive Sciences who now focuses on studying happiness and teaches a class at USC called PSYC-468: Happiness: Research in Neuroscience and Positive Psychology. George said she is not surprised with the happiness report\u2019s placement of Israel, saying that Israel is in an unstable political region and the people have always lived with that. But she also noted that much of the data collected for this year may have been collected before the war broke out.\n\n\u201cIsraelis, despite living in an unstable political, and socioeconomic climate, they do really value the things that bring them happiness,\u201d George said. She explained that Israel values social connection and religion \u2014 two factors in which George says are factors to a country\u2019s happiness.\n\nSophie Muncy, a freshman studying international relations at USC, had a similar perspective and described Israel as a \u201ctight-knit community.\u201d While Muncy has only traveled to Israel once, in 2019, her mom is Jewish and from Iran, and now calls Israel her second home. She describes the country as where everyone is \u201cpeaceful and spreading love\u201d and it is easy to go up to anyone and have a meaningful conversation.\n\nGeorge is also not surprised by the United State\u2019s happiness drop as she said the United States has a \u201cloneliness epidemic\u201d where there are a lot of people moving away from family and friends. She also said that religiosity is at an all-time low in the United States. A 2024 study conducted by Gallup states that religious services in the United States have significantly declined.\n\nMuncy describes the culture in the United States as \u201cmore reserved.\u201d \u201cPeople just tend to stick to what they find familiar,\u201d Muncy said. \u201cI found that quite different in Israel.\u201d\n```"}

And I think that\u2019s been really big instead of just like teams and schools. There\u2019s actually like, these big characters like Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese, and like, Angela Reese, and all these other people that are like good players, but also like good personalities, and I think it\u2019s gained a lot of traction with fans.\n\nThis increase in interest has also translated into ticket prices as well. According to Forbes, the ticket prices for the women\u2019s semifinal tournament saw a 190% increase from last year\u2019s average price. Additionally, the average price for the women\u2019s national championship tripled the cost of last year.\n\nAt USC, Trojans have also expressed their support for the media frenzy surrounding women\u2019s basketball. Jinny Kim, a sophomore studying Journalism, noted how players such as star Trojan player JuJu Watkins could be credited for the women\u2019s basketball team gaining popularity.\n\nJinny Kim: There\u2019s been lot more noise for women\u2019s basketball, which I\u2019m really happy about. I think in previous years, there\u2019s been more focus on not just men\u2019s basketball, but just men\u2019s sports in general. So I\u2019m happy to see that there\u2019s more hype and energy for the women\u2019s basketball team.\n\nRobin Ryu, a sophomore studying Computer Engineering and Computer Science, also felt that this season\u2019s women\u2019s basketball games had a lot more energy and support.\n\nRobin Ryu: I will definitely say the woman\u2019s is like way more hype. There\u2019s a lot of superstars this year. And there\u2019s just so much competition going on. Women\u2019s basketball has been overlooked for a while, but this season, they finally got the same or more recognition than men\u2019s basketball did across the country.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s the end of the season for Trojans, but USC is looking forward to next year.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Yeji Jong.\n```"}

Donor Matthew Brady has given blood a dozen times and explains why it continues to be important. Brady: It seems that there\u2019s a shortage of blood at all times. So that\u2019s something that we can give and it replenishes replenishes itself. So why not? Brady said it\u2019s a good way to give back especially if you have a universal blood type. Brady: To me, personally, it\u2019s just one good way to pay it forward in the world, and it\u2019s something that I\u2019m blessed to have. I have O positive blood, which goes a long way with helping people.\n\nLifeStream Blood Bank is the blood supplier for Keck Medicine at USC and organized two other campus blood drives back in February and in March. This blood bank also provides services to medical facilities in six counties and in more than 80 Southern California hospitals.\n\nDonor Naomi Tanaka is one of many who have a personal connection with the shortage issue. Tanaka: My dad recently got his appendix removed. And so surgery, and like just making sure that like they have enough supplies is really important... it\u2019s like 10 minutes out of your day to help save some other people. Tanaka said donations can go a long way to those who experience a variety of health issues. Tanaka: I\u2019ve heard that like, one donation of blood can help save roughly three lives. And so people who have had cancer or who have gone through other surgical projects typically do need a blood donation or blood product...and so it\u2019s basically about just giving back.\n\nThis was the last opportunity of the school year to participate in the monthly campus blood drives.\n```"}

Dornsife students were underwhelmed when they heard who their 2024 commencement speaker would be.\n\nUSC Dornsife sent an email to students today, announcing that Jaren Lewison will be the commencement speaker for the 2024 grad season. Lewison, who graduated from USC Dornsife in 2022, is an actor most well-known for his role as Ben Gross in the Netflix series \u201cNever Have I Ever.\u201d\n\nLewison\u2019s name doesn\u2019t carry enough weight for some. \u201cIt would be special to get to have a speaker that is a well-known name like Will Ferrell,\u201d said Ashley Singleton-Comfort, a senior majoring in chemistry.\n\nEarlier this week, Annenberg announced that their commencement speaker would be tennis legend and LGBTQ+ rights activist, Billie Jean King. Some students think Lewison doesn\u2019t come close to King in terms of excitement.\n\n\u201cI saw this announcement this morning in the email they sent and I was partially disappointed,\u201d said Maggie Torstrick, a senior USC student majoring in Biological Sciences. \u201cThere\u2019s some other really cool speakers like at Annenberg and Marshall. I don\u2019t really know him.\u201d\n\nTo some, Lewison is simply a classmate or friend. \u201cI have people in my class who are still friends with him, so he\u2019s more of a peer,\u201d Torstrick said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have student speakers.\u201d\n\nLewison is 23 years old. Some are concerned about his age and level of professional experience. \u201cIt takes like five or 10 years to see how someone\u2019s career path goes,\u201d Ma said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about his acting. It\u2019s also about his reputation, and that\u2019s not something that can be developed in two or three years.\u201d\n\nThere is a flip side of that coin, though: relatability and inspiration. \u201cFor some, the short time kind of makes it inspirational to the student being like, \u2018I\u2019m about to graduate, which means I\u2019m on the brink of doing something great in my life. I don\u2019t need to be 50 years old to become a big name,\u2019\u201d Singleton-Comfort said.\n\nSome even prefer a younger speaker. \u201cI don\u2019t buy into the idea that the speaker needs to be older than us and lecture us,\u201d said Andrew Tarazon, a senior studying economics. \u201cI think the fact that he\u2019s so close in age with us makes it more relatable. It gives us an extra drive to say if someone our age is doing this, so can I.\u201d\n\nTarazon thinks Lewison embodies what it means to be a Trojan. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy who\u2019s young, evolving, reaching the pinnacles of his profession,\u201d Tarazon said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what we want? Isn\u2019t that what USC is all about? Getting remarkable people together.\u201d\n\nFollowing the main commencement ceremony on May 10, Dornsife will hold two ceremonies that same afternoon. Ceremony one will be at 11 a.m. and ceremony two will take place at 2:30 p.m.\n\nIn an email sent by Dornsife, to all their seniors, a blurred-out image of Lewison can be seen. Featured is also a link to Dornsife\u2019s LinkedIn where the school uploaded a video of him in front of the Traveler statue.\n\nLewison said in the video, \u201cUSC Dornsife Class of 2024, it\u2019s almost graduation season. I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m going to be your commencement speaker. I\u2019m so excited! And I\u2019ll see you all on May 10th. It\u2019s going to be amazing. Fight On!\u201d\n\nThe actor graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology in 2022. He graduated summa cum laude in three years while filming the show.\n\nThe 23-year-old is originally from Dallas, Texas but moved to Southern California to pursue his career at USC. His first on-screen role was on \u201cBarney and Friends\u201d in 2008. Right before starring in \u201cNever Have I Ever,\u201d Lewison also played a minimal role in the 2018 film called \u201cTag\u201d as the younger version of Ed Helms.\n\nA previous version of this article stated that Lewison said \u201che\u2019s a guy who\u2019s young, evolving, reaching the pinnacles of his profession.\u201d It was Tarazon.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Adisah Grimes)\n\nBy Makai Singleton\nApril 03, 2024 at 3:35 pm PDT\n\nIn the spring semester at USC, some Black students start to go missing. You won\u2019t see them at social gatherings or walking around campus like any other day. Usually, this means one thing in the Black community: these \u201cmissing students\u201d are joining a Divine Nine fraternity or sorority. They keep their dealings a secret so that later in the Spring semester, there\u2019s a big reveal of who they are to the rest of the student body. This big reveal is known as a new membership showcase or presentation, and all nine fraternities and sororities organizations in the National Pan-Hellenic Council do them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always exciting to see more people coming into these organizations. That\u2019s the core of it all,\u201d said Devin Walker, the director of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development at USC. \u201cI care so much about the experience, and I\u2019m always excited to see new faces.\u201d\n\nA new membership showcase brings a nervous excitement to students on USC\u2019s campus because they want to know who is being presented. \u201cWhen I go to a show I\u2019m excited to see who we get to celebrate,\u201d said Payten Briscoe, a sophomore business administration major with a marketing emphasis. \u201cIt is a great time to celebrate the accomplishments that these people have made and the hard work that they\u2019ve put in to be a part of the organization.\u201d\n\nPeople from all over the country come to multiple new membership showcases to support both the performers and the organizations, and students travel from different schools as well to support their friends. Historically at USC, these showcases happen on the Physical Education Building steps directly in front of the building. In a showcase, the new members march out in masks, usually singing or humming a song that is historic for their organization, before presenting the information about their organization. They then unmask and introduce themselves to the crowd.\n\nThe experiences vary at different colleges across the country. But, to students, it is interesting to compare showcases. \u201cI literally just went to North Carolina for my best friend\u2019s showcase at North Carolina Central University, and it\u2019s just fun to see,\u201d said Arija Martin, a junior majoring in international relations. \u201cEvery organization and chapter does things different and comparing the showcases is fun to do.\u201d\n\nSo far this Spring, there have been four new membership showcases, and there is one more coming up on Saturday, April 6. The performers participating in the showcase are excited for their moment and appreciate the support. \u201cAt first I was a little anxious, but as the show went on I became more comfortable and really performed,\u201d said Tarrus Richardson Jr, a senior studying business administration. \u201cIt definitely was cool seeing all the folks who came out and supported. From our friends to the broader USC community, it meant a lot.\u201d\n\nSome people like Richardson have the honor of sharing this experience with their fathers, sometimes grandfathers, and other family members who are in the same organization. \u201cIt was really a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me and my Dad,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBeing a member of the organization is something I\u2019ve wanted for a really long time, and something that my dad is incredibly prideful in. For it to all come together my senior year at USC was a full circle moment for real, just pure joy and love.\u201d\n\nThe older members of the organizations do a lot of work to make sure the showcases go well, but they say it is worth all of the hard work. \u201cAs a member of Greek life, having to do a bunch of work behind the scenes to get our own showcases together makes me appreciate the show a lot more,\u201d said Aaron Shields, a senior studying computer science and business administration.\n\nThrough all of this hard work, the big picture behind a new membership showcase is a celebration for the people coming into an organization after you. \u201cAt the core of everything, when I\u2019m at a show it\u2019s all excitement for what these new folks can bring to this experience and then what they can do for the next lines that come behind them,\u201d Walker said.\n\nMakai Singleton is a member of the Beta Omega Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.\n```"}

{"key": "/2024/04/03/12-year-old-junior-olympic-diver-makes-a-splash-at-usc/", "response": "```\n12-year old Junior Olympic diver makes a splash at USC\n\nWebber Meade-Sofield is a competitive diver that trains at USC\u2019s Utyengsu Aquatics Center.\n\nBy Stephen Knobel April 03, 2024 at 3:10 pm PDT\n\nFor the past four years, 12-year-old Webber Meade-Sofield has, for three hours a day, every day, more or less thrown himself off a 10-meter cliff. He is a competitive diver. Who already competed at the Junior Olympic National Championship. Who, at 12, has \u201cso much energy and so much love.\u201d A \u201clove for life.\u201d Who is the \u201cfirst\u201d to comfort a scared younger diver. Webber also stands at a figurative precipice: he has been in action at nationals but has not progressed to the semifinals. Are the Olympics anything of a viable dream when the national semis are yet beyond reach? Or is that just stupid to be concerned with \u2013 at 12? So, the question, as he confronts the years ahead \u2013 adolescence, a changing body, the realization that it only gets harder from here\u2014is at once profound and yet elemental: Who is Webber Meade-Sofield, and how bad does he want it?\n\n\u201cWhen I don\u2019t do well in practice or a meet,\u201d Webber said. \u201cIt does affect my daily life and mood, but when I dive well, it\u2019s the best feeling.\u201d Webber began diving at 6. He immediately fell in love with the sport\u2019s competitive nature. \u201cMy favorite thing is the adrenaline and the success that you feel when you do dives,\u201d he said. His early dives were not graceful. Not hardly. Webber\u2019s father, Andy Sofield, said, recalling those early dives, \u201cWebber tried to do a front flip and completely smacked, flat out mangled it.\u201d \u201cHe got back up and dusted himself off and wanted to keep going and learn how to do it.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Webber took beginner lessons at UCLA. Just as he began to improve, the pandemic shut down the world. Training in the pool was not an option, but virtual workouts and masked tumbling sessions in the gym were. \u201cCOVID ended up being a silver lining. Webber probably wouldn\u2019t be as involved in diving as he is,\u201d said Drew Meade, Webber\u2019s second dad. \u201cI\u2019d also say that it in a lot of ways diving kept him sane during COVID.\u201d\n\nWebber\u2019s coach and private trainer, Katrina Young, said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the same room as Webber you know he\u2019s there.\u201d On the pool deck, Webber can often be spotted taking dance breaks, making others laugh between dives and cheering on his teammates. She added, \u201cI think that he\u2019s so energetic and has a love for life. It overflows into his diving, relationship with his coaches and relationships with teammates. It\u2019s a very joyful, buoyant energy.\u201d\n\nThe UCLA program is female-dominated. Webber, with pool time starting to open, wanted a team with more boys and divers his age. \u201cWhen we went over to USC, they had boys across age groups, and we thought that would be good for Webber, to not only have these amazing female athletes as role models, but it would be nice for him also to see these amazing male athletes as role models,\u201d said Sofield. D\u00f6erte Lindner, the Trojan Dive Club coach, said he was immediately welcomed. \u201cI could not imagine our team without him,\u201d Lindner said. \u201cHe has so much energy and so much love, and I really appreciate his personality as part of our team.\u201d\n\nWebber\u2019s dads said he is the \u201cteam mascot,\u201d comparing him to \u201ca kaleidoscope of social butterflies.\u201d Webber trains with divers ages 6 to 18. His parents said this has boosted his confidence. \u201cWith younger kids, he gets to step up into being a role model. With the older kids he gets to not be afraid,\u201d said Meade. \u201cHe\u2019s just very comfortable with himself around a lot of different ages and types of people.\u201d Meade added, \u201cWebber used to shrink and withdraw himself when a classmate would cut him off or he would have a disagreement.\u201d \u201cWith diving, he has to overcome his fears multiple times a day, every single day. It\u2019s just made him extraordinarily more confident. He has a much greater and stronger sense of self.\u201d\n\nWebber, many say, is emotionally driven and given to instinctually comfort those around him. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a diver who cries because they are scared of a dive,\u201d Lindner said, \u201cWebber is the first to go over and sometimes he cries with that dive. He\u2019s very compassionate.\u201d This emotion, they also say, can cut two ways \u2013 in particular when Webber is 33 feet up. Which Webber himself acknowledges. \u201cThe fear is not your normal daily life kind of stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more that you\u2019re scared that you might hit the board which could kill you or you flop and that could lead to serious injuries.\u201d\n\nIn diving, fear can also lead to regression in a diver\u2019s performance, as with a dive that is now bedeviling him, one he used to do with ease \u2013 a back one-and-a-half. He sometimes freezes on the board. He becomes too scared to jump. \u201cWhen you\u2019re younger,\u201d Young said, \u201cand you\u2019re learning, you\u2019re like, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll just do what the coach says to do.\u2019 And as you get older, you realize it\u2019s not quite as easy as you thought it was before.\u201d\n\nAt 9, Webber was diagnosed with ADHD. His coaches said his energy and emotionality bring up the team morale but can also distract Webber as he tries to clear his mind, overcome his fears and focus on his dives. \u201cFor new dives,\u201d Webber said. \u201cI don\u2019t think about anything. I just go up there and throw it.\u201d Diving also helps Webber cope with his ADHD, said Sofield. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a form of therapy. There\u2019s a part of ADHD that allows you to really lock in.\u201d \u201cIf you can lock in and start to train yourself, you make something that some might call a disability an ability and superpower.\u201d\n\nLindner said, \u201cHe is hard on himself, like most athletes are,\u201d and has a deep sense of compassion for the people who help him train. When Webber can\u2019t complete a dive, he obsessively acts it out on land. He goes through the motions and movements of the dive repeatedly until he can shut off the fear in his brain and jump off the board. \u201cI feel sometimes bad for my coaches when I can\u2019t push through something,\u201d said Webber, \u201cbecause they work so hard to help me push through things.\u201d\n\nWebber said he can see himself diving in college. That, though, is far, far away. This upcoming season \u2013 he has big goals. \u201cI want to make the semifinals at nationals,\u201d Webber said. \u201cI made it to nationals all the years I\u2019ve tried, but I\u2019ve never made it to the semi-finals, and I\u2019d like to know what that feels like.\u201d If he makes it to semis, then what? \u201cWe\u2019ll support Webber to take diving as far as he wants to take it,\u201d Sofield said. \u201cFor now, I think what\u2019s great is it\u2019s healthy, he\u2019s active. It\u2019s a great community.\u201d \u201cMy biggest goal,\u201d Young said \u201cis to see him walk out on the board with total confidence that he can nail the dive.\u201d \u201cAnd whether he does or doesn\u2019t, just seeing that chin-up attitude that I know he carries in his life.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want him to worry about the results.\u201d```"}

We\u2019ve had a lot more joy than sadness.\u201d\n\nWith the No. 1 recruit JuJu Watkins suiting up in cardinal and gold, USC women\u2019s basketball had high expectations coming into this season. It\u2019s safe to say that the Trojans more than answered the call. The freshman guard led USC to an overall 29-6 record, their best finish since the 1993-94 season. On top of winning the Pac-12 tournament title, the Trojans were the No.1 seed in the NCAA Tournament and made a bid to the Elite Eight for the fourth time in program history.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that USC dominated its crosstown rivals twice this season \u2013 first in January during the regular season and again in double overtime in the Pac-12 Tournament semi-finals. As a freshman, Watkins proved herself as an elite scorer who\u2019s more than worthy of being in discussions of the NCAA\u2019s best players. Her 51-point game against No. 4 Stanford broke a USC scoring record and drew national attention, garnering well-deserved praise from many of the NBA\u2019s elite, such as LeBron James and former Trojan DeMar DeRozan.\n\nFrom breaking the DI freshman scoring record on Monday night against UConn to finishing second in the nation in scoring (26.9 ppg), Watkins was raining buckets all season long. \u201cShe\u2019s a competitor. I could trust her with my life,\u201d junior center Rayah Marshall said. \u201cWhen it comes down to winning, she\u2019s going to do what she has to do.\u201d \u201cJu is a winner,\u201d graduate guard McKenzie Forbes added. \u201cWe see the work that she puts in, so I never lack confidence in her. She\u2019s not just a scorer, she\u2019s a playmaker.\u201d\n\nAside from Watkins\u2019 star power, several other Trojans stepped up big time this season. Forbes was a mature presence for this Trojan squad. \u201cWe have a special relationship,\u201d Watkins said of Forbes after their Sweet 16 win over Baylor. \u201cShe\u2019s always just encouraging me and really speaking to me in times when I needed during the game. She\u2019s just a great leader and I\u2019m just glad to have that type of leadership my first year.\u201d The Harvard transfer stepped up every single game, most notably in the Pac-12 tournament championship game where she led the Trojans with 26 points.\n\nAdditionally, Marshall\u2019s huge presence in the post should not be overlooked. Her aggressiveness in the paint helped her snag offensive and defensive rebounds, which were often the key to the Trojans coming away with a win. \u201cIf she\u2019s in the paint, and [the ball] is in her vicinity, around a 10-foot circumference, she\u2019s getting it,\u201d graduate forward Kaitlyn Davis said of Marshall\u2019s rebounding abilities. \u201cShe\u2019s determined to get the rebound, so honestly, I don\u2019t know if anyone can stop her if she\u2019s really putting her mind towards rebounding the ball.\u201d\n\nIn her third season as USC\u2019s head coach, Gottlieb managed to lift USC to its highest NCAA ranking in program history at No. 3. Gottlieb kept her players poised in big moments. Her stellar coaching led to her being named a finalist for the Naismith Women\u2019s Coach of the Year award.\n\nOf the Trojans\u2019 many accomplishments, the most special was the attention and admiration they brought to women\u2019s basketball \u2013 both at USC and beyond. A record 10,657 fans were in attendance at Galen Center on February 23 to witness the Trojans defeat the Colorado Buffaloes 87-81. \u201cThis season of USC women\u2019s basketball has gotten me so excited to go to USC games again,\u201d said Arike Coker, a senior studying biomedical engineering. \u201cFrom the beginning of the season, the girls have had me so excited to show up to their games and track how they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nFrom rapper Travis Scott to Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 guard Damian Lillard to USC students, everyone was tuned into Monday night\u2019s Elite Eight matchups. \u201cI would\u2019ve really loved to see them go all the way for my last year, but honestly just watching them make history and do as well as they did was really fun,\u201d Coker added. And it\u2019s not just their skill that grabbed the hearts of Trojans fans. It\u2019s who the players are \u2013 the camaraderie, the teamwork. The Trojan family rallied behind them all season long.\n\nUSC women\u2019s basketball seemed to check off nearly all the boxes this season. So, what went wrong? This year was USC\u2019s first time on this big of a stage in a while. The Trojans did enough to establish themselves as true competitors and return to the national stage, but a win against UConn Monday night would\u2019ve meant that the Trojans would have to face some really tough competition moving forward. The giants of women\u2019s college basketball today \u2013 South Carolina, LSU, Iowa, UConn \u2013 are all accustomed to the spotlight, the tough matchups and the win-or-go-home situations. After all, two of the aforementioned four schools appeared in last year\u2019s NCAA Championship game. The Trojans are the newcomers on the scene. Naturally, they\u2019ll experience some growing pains while learning how to be at the top again.\n\nWith that being said, the future of women\u2019s basketball is incredibly bright for USC. The team has gotten a taste of the spotlight and will not want to relinquish that anytime soon. While the Trojans\u2019 will miss the likes of Forbes, Davis, and graduate guard Kayla Padilla, the program is in great hands with Gottlieb and Watkins. The Trojans will also be introducing some young star power to their lineup next season \u2014 California\u2019s top recruit Kennedy Smith will be joining the Trojans for 2024-25. Smith led her school to the 2023 Open Division State Championship and the Southern Section title in 2022. \u201cKennedy has the full package: defensive tenacity, offensive skill, size, athleticism. But what sets her apart further is her competitive drive,\u201d Gottlieb said in a statement. \u201cKennedy\u2019s decision to stay home will have a lasting impact on our program, and is really significant as we take steps to become a national power in women\u2019s basketball.\u201d\n\nJoining the five-star recruit will be 6-foot forward Avery Howell and guard Kayleigh Heckel. Smith, Howell and Heckel were all named McDonald\u2019s All-Americans, a coveted honor for high school players across the nation. \u201cEven though we\u2019re going to be so young next year, we\u2019re going to be in a different stratosphere where [winning] is the standard and so that\u2019s going to drive us,\u201d Gottlieb said of the Trojans\u2019 tourney run. \u201cI know that we\u2019ll respond.\u201d It\u2019s safe to say that the Trojans will be back next year.\n```"}

(Photo by Wesley Chen)\n\nBy Suzanne Schofield April 03, 2024 at 10:25 am PDT\n\nAs the spring sun bathed Howard Jones Field \u2014 the practice area for USC football \u2014 on March 28, the Thursday practice marked both the grinding exertions of drills but also by the underlying pulse of camaraderie and determination. The Trojans, under the tutelage of their newly appointed coaching staff and the addition of various transfers, are ready to embrace the challenges ahead.\n\nDefensive line coach Eric Henderson brings a wealth of experience and a fresh perspective to USC\u2019s big men up front. Despite the challenges of implementing a new defense, Henderson is impressed with the effort and dedication shown by his players.\n\n\u201cI do like what I\u2019m seeing from a lot of the guys, we are getting better,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just patience in terms of learning the new defense and some of the new drills and techniques that I\u2019m looking to get out of these guys. But they are giving me the effort, so I can\u2019t complain, you know they\u2019re working their tails off.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, when asked about the recruitment process, Henderson emphasized the importance of building relationships and fostering a genuine environment, highlighting USC\u2019s unique selling points. According to him, the key lies in caring for the players and their families, coupled with top-notch developmental opportunities.\n\n\u201cSC sells itself ... I think when you really care about people ... people can feel that,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cIf you really have someone that truly cares about you, then there\u2019s not a better school than SC.\u201d\n\nRedshirt senior safety Akili Arnold, a transfer from Oregon State, brings a sense of camaraderie and determination to the Trojan defense. For Arnold, the transition back to California and joining forces with his brother, senior linebacker Easton Mascarenas-Arnold, at USC feels like a homecoming and fulfillment of a childhood dream.\n\n\u201cObviously, when you\u2019re a little kid in Southern California, you want to go to SC,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI really wanted to come here. That was always a dream, but it didn\u2019t happen at first, but I got the opportunity to do it now and I\u2019m just grateful.\u201d\n\nArnold\u2019s focus lies in mastering the defensive playbook and fostering unity within the team. He acknowledges the competitive spirit among players while emphasizing the importance of supporting each other\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s competitive, always, but that\u2019s what makes the team good,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cYou know you got to compete against each other and make each other better at the end of the day. I also think we\u2019re a brotherhood at the end of the day, and we always support each other.\u201d\n\nJoining Arnold in the defensive ranks is redshirt senior defensive lineman Isaiah Raikes. As a transfer from Texas A&M, he chose USC for its potential to elevate his game and make a meaningful impact on his team by being a dominant force on the field.\n\n\u201cI want to prove that I can be a dominant football player,\u201d Raikes said. \u201cI want to improve the players around me. My teammates are everything to me. I want to make sure we all play at the highest level possible.\u201d\n\nUnder the guidance of Henderson, Raikes saw an opportunity for growth and development, fueled by the shared goal of reaching the NFL.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to work with him knowing he came from the NFL,\u201d Raikes said. \u201cI know he can show me exactly what I need to do and know exactly what he wants to see out of me to get drafted as high as possible. ... Just the experience you can tell from being at that NFL level, like some of the things he teaches are different than I\u2019ve heard from the college coaches.\u201d\n\nAmidst the defensive intensity is redshirt sophomore safety Kamari Ramsey, a transfer from UCLA. For Ramsey, the path forward was clear: to continue giving his all, both on and off the field. The redshirt sophomore remains focused on excelling both academically and athletically, embodying the spirit of perseverance and dedication.\n\n\u201cI just continue to do what I\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI attack my books and keep my grades right. Since football is football, it doesn\u2019t change, it just gets a little faster and people get a little bigger, but football is football. So I just prove to myself that I can keep making plays and just continue to give my full effort on the field.\u201d\n\nAs USC\u2019s spring practice unfolds, these insights provide a glimpse into the team\u2019s forging identity of resilience, unity and the unwavering pursuit of excellence.\n```"}

While the NCAA Tournament has always been exciting on both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s side, there seems to be more intrigue and excitement about the women\u2019s bracket in 2024. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the men\u2019s tournament was filled with upsets and incredible games (a personal favorite was No. 7-seeded Florida against No. 10-seeded Colorado). However, the women\u2019s side has definitively been more star-powered, and even tracked more viewership throughout the regular season. According to FOX Sports president of insight and analytics, Michael Mulvihill, women\u2019s basketball games averaged more viewership per game than the mens when broadcasted by FOX \u2014  981,000 to 946,000 . It\u2019s not that suddenly the men\u2019s games aren\u2019t fun to watch, but the women\u2019s game currently has more star power. When you compare the faces of men\u2019s and women\u2019s college basketball, the men\u2019s stars just seem ... boring Purdue senior center Zach Edey and Tennessee senior forward Dalton Knecht are phenomenal players, and we even had the chance to watch the two duke it out in the Elite Eight, where both finished with incredible stat lines \u2014 Edey with 40 points and Knecht with 37. But the pair are just not that fun, both as personalities and in their style of play. Edey is 7-foot-4 and he practically just shoots free throws and drops the ball in the net under the basket. Knecht has a more varied offensive arsenal, but his game just feels un-memorable. For example, it felt like there was absolutely zero social media reaction to Knecht dropping 37 points on one of basketball\u2019s biggest stages. When you compare it to the star players on the women\u2019s side, where you have Iowa senior guard Caitlin Clark sprinting around and chucking up threes from the logo, USC\u2019s freshman guard JuJu Watkins \u2014 who has broken the all-time NCAA scoring record for a freshman \u2014 and even the entire LSU roster and coaching staff, who took on a villainous role as the defending champions. It\u2019s just more fun. The only men\u2019s player who has star power comparable to the women is North Carolina State center DJ Burns Jr., whose basketball aura has undeniably been awesome during the NCAA Tournament. Burns\u2019 personality on and off the court has captured the hearts of fans across the country. His large frame and fantastic footwork is like watching an offensive lineman do ballet: Absolutely beautiful. Womens basketball this year has just been more entertaining. It is hard to pinpoint why the popularity of women\u2019s basketball has risen so sharply in the past year, but storylines in this NCAA Tournament likely have a lot to do with it. Stories are what drive sports, and when you look at the storylines in women\u2019s basketball, they are better. Iowa\u2019s matchup with LSU in the Elite Eight had as many storylines a fan could ask for. There\u2019s the recent drama surrounding LSU head coach Kim Mulkey, Clark\u2019s historic, record-breaking year and the fact it was a rematch of last year\u2019s national championship game. When you look at the men\u2019s side, there are just two mildly interesting story lines that come to mind, 11-seeded NC State\u2019s run to the Final Four and Purdue seeking redemption after losing to a 16 seed the year prior. The problem is that we\u2019ve seen these both happen before. An 11 seed has made the Final Four and a team has revenged themselves after losing to a 16 seed: Virginia in 2019. They are entertaining, but when you combine the star power and the story of both men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball, the women\u2019s side has the advantage. I believe that both men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball should be appreciated in their own facets of the game. Both have star players, both have interesting story lines and it\u2019s great that both are receiving the recognition they deserve this year. However, when it comes to stacking up which is more popular right now, women\u2019s basketball takes the cake. \u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

(AP/Rui Vieira)\n\nBy Marco Haynes April 02, 2024 at 6:51 pm PDT\n\n\u201cHat Trick\u201d is a column by Marco Haynes about the English Premier League in which he breaks down the week\u2019s three most consequential results.\n\nArsenal holds Man City to a tense goalless draw\n\nA highly anticipated top-of-the-table clash ended 0-0 between Manchester City and Arsenal on Sunday, with neither side creating any notable opportunities at the Etihad Stadium. City dominated an otherwise dull first half with their suffocating possession play, trying to break the Gunners\u2019 back line, but ultimately couldn\u2019t manufacture a goal-scoring chance. Quiet performances from both teams\u2019 forwards, Erling Haaland and Kai Havertz, continued in the second half, effectively guaranteeing the game to finish as a stalemate.\n\nThe Citizens have failed to take points off their title rivals this season, losing to Arsenal 1-0 in October and drawing against Liverpool twice, in addition to the past weekend\u2019s result. That has left themselves three points behind league leaders Liverpool and sitting in third place. This is the first time that City has failed to score at the Etihad for 47 consecutive league matches since a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace in October 2021; this is the first goalless draw in 75 consecutive league games for City since March 2021, which also came against the Eagles.\n\nThe title-defending Citizens will play again at the Etihad on Wednesday against top-four hopefuls Aston Villa. The Gunners, on the other hand, will be heading back to London much happier, two points behind Liverpool and claiming four out of six points from both league meetings against City this season. Heading into the weekend, in the previous five league matches at the Etihad Stadium, Arsenal had lost five straight. Arsenal are only the fourth team to keep two clean sheets in both league encounters against Manchester City since Pep Guadiola was appointed in July 2016. However, Arteta\u2019s men attempted only six shots during the game \u2014 Arsenal\u2019s lowest since 2021 against Liverpool at Anfield.\n\nArsenal returns against Luton Town at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.\n\nSalah\u2019s winner jumps Liverpool to the top of the table\n\nLiverpool secured the comeback to beat Brighton 2-1 after conceding in just the second minute, earning an important three points in the title race. The Seagulls started the match with a bang on a Simon Adingra-led counter-attack, in which the Ivorian winger crossed towards the edge of the penalty box. The ball landed at the feet of forward Danny Welbeck, who thrashed a strike into the top right corner of the net to stun Liverpool early.\n\nDespite the poor start, the Reds didn\u2019t take too long to turn the match around, ratcheting up the pressure on Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verburggen\u2019s goal. Liverpool\u2019s official response came in the 27th minute, after Brighton defender Joel Veltman failed to make a clearance after a Liverpool corner kick. The ball fell to winger Luis Diaz in behind the defense, who toe-poked the ball into the center of the net.\n\nIn the second half, Liverpool\u2019s immense attacking pressure continued and was rewarded in the 65th minute. The brilliant ex-Brighton midfielder Alexis Mac Allister \u2014 now a regular starter for Liverpool \u2014 slotted a through ball into the right side of the penalty box that found winger Mohamed Salah, who curled a shot into the bottom left corner of the net.\n\nThe Reds are now in full throttle at the top of the Premier League, sitting on a two-point advantage over second-place Arsenal. They\u2019re undefeated in the previous five league matches, winning four and drawing one. Liverpool\u2019s star man Salah has been directly involved in 15 goals against Brighton in the league in his career, scoring nine and assisting six \u2014 this is the most the Egyptian has contributed against any opponent in the Premier League. This season, Salah is now tied for second-leading goalscorer in the league with 16 goals from 23 matches played.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s title charge continues at Anfield on Thursday against Sheffield United. European chasers Brighton dropped to ninth in the league and experienced their fourth defeat in their last six matches in all competitions. Brighton\u2019s Welbeck scored his fourth goal of the season. The English forward\u2019s goal at 1 minute and 45 seconds is the quickest by a visiting opposition at Anfield since Harry Kane for Tottenham Hotspur in October 2019. Brighton will travel to Brentford on Wednesday as they look to return to winning ways.\n\nSuper-sub Barnes\u2019 late strikes wrap up chaotic Newcastle comeback\n\nA thrilling contest saw Newcastle United claiming the 4-3 victory over West Ham United at St. James\u2019 Park. In the opening three minutes, Hammers defender Vladimir Coufal committed a clumsy foul on Newcastle winger Anthony Gordon that was awarded a penalty by VAR. Newcastle forward Alexander Isak dispatched it to the bottom left corner to give his side the early lead.\n\nWest Ham\u2019s equalizer came in the 21st minute, a lofted through ball over the top of the Newcastle defense from midfielder Lucas Paqueta that forward Michail Antonio received before quickly taking a touch and finishing into the bottom right corner from inside the penalty box. The Hammers then took the lead just before halftime after a quick free kick found winger Jarrod Bowen, who then laid a pass back to the edge of the six-yard box for Mohammed Kudus to finish into the top right corner.\n\nJust after the break, Kudus led a swift West Ham counterattack, picking out Bowen in acres of space at the halfway line. The English forward then dribbled 40 yards and produced a clinical finish into the bottom left corner to give West Ham a 3-1 lead. It looked like the Hammers had sealed the match.\n\nHowever, the Magpies found a spark after a controversial VAR review for a foul by substitute Kalvin Phillips on Gordon awarded Newcastle another penalty, which Isak again scored. The momentum continued, as substitute Harvey Barnes equalized with a run in behind the Hammers defense, shooting between the gap in West Ham keeper \u0141ukasz Fabia\u0144ski\u2019s legs.\n\nBarnes became the ultimate hero in the 90th minute, taking a touch across Phillips at the edge of the penalty box and unleashing a powerful strike into the bottom right corner to cap off an entertaining spectacle and give Newcastle three points.\n\nThe Magpies moved up to eighth position and sit one point behind the Hammers as both clubs aim to play European soccer next season. This is Newcastle\u2019s first time coming back from a two-goal deficit since March 2019, when they eventually defeated Everton 3-2. Newcastle\u2019s next match is also against the Toffees, as the team will travel to Goodison Park to face Everton on Tuesday.\n\nNewcastle substitutes have now scored 13 goals in the Premier League this season, the most by any team. Additionally, Magpies forward Isak now has 14 goals this season, with four coming from penalties. That ranks him seventh in Premier League play, just behind West Ham\u2019s Bowen. Bowen\u2019s 15 leaves him tied for fifth alongside Spurs\u2019 Heung-Min Son. Only Paolo Di Canio has scored more Premier League goals for West Ham than Bowen, with the Italian scoring 16 during the 1999-00 season.\n\nWest Ham will be frustrated to not come away with three points in the match and are surely furious at the two penalty decisions by VAR. The Hammers hadn\u2019t lost a match when leading by two or more goals since a 4-2 defeat against Watford in September 2016 at the London Stadium. West Ham returns to action in a London Derby against Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday.\n```"}

(Photo by Vishu Reddy)\n\nBy Vishu Reddy and Quinten Seghers\nApril 02, 2024 at 6:13 pm PDT\n\nOn a bright Tuesday afternoon in front of the Hancock Foundation Building, students assembled huge paper trees and gazed upon sustainability-themed artwork for the Arts & Climate Collective\u2019s (ACC) annual festival. There, students listened as their fellow Trojans featured their sustainability-themed creations, from murals and sculptures to video games and drawings. Off by the side was a group of musicians who rhythmically played drums for the event\u2019s duration.\n\nThe Arts & Climate Collective is a collaboration with USC Arts in Action, the USC Office of Sustainability and USC Annenberg Innovation Lab. Students from seven different USC schools have been awarded an annual grant. The grants go towards a multimedia or community-based project.\n\n\u201cThe Arts and Climate Collective is where we want to look at the intersectionality between art and climate justice and really help fuel student-led projects,\u201d said Au Chung, the ACC\u2019s community engagement coordinator. The grant takes applications every fall semester, awarding students $1,350 and providing \u201cmentorship, programming, and networking opportunities\u201d according to the ACC\u2019s application guidelines.\n\nAt the event\u2019s entrance stood a large mural which attendees could draw on to answer the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s one thing you want to see in a healthy, inclusive, sustainable Los Angeles?\u201d Sprawled across its surface were drawings of trees, whales, flowers and hearts, interspersed with text calling for a cleaner environment. In charge of overseeing the mural\u2019s creation and handing out the markers was Monty Hughes, a senior majoring in public policy and an intern for the ACC.\n\n\u201cWe love to do a co-creative thing like this at all of our events, just to get people thinking and drawing,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWe\u2019re the Arts & Climate Collective, so of course we want people to make art.\u201d\n\nStudent artists in the ACC\u2019s cohort of annual grant receivers get to publicly showcase their projects that were funded by the ACC during the festival. Students assembled paper trees during the Arts & Climate Collective annual festival. (Photo by Vishu Reddy)\n\nTucked next to the wall of student artwork, stood a booth for a sustainability-themed video game called Deseo y Dise\u00f1o. It took three students five months to create the game, according to Sol Lagos, a junior majoring in English and the game\u2019s design lead. The game developers are also a part of the ACC\u2019s 2023-2024 Cohort.\n\nSprawled across the table were various drawings and illustrations that made their way into the final game. The player follows Chuy, a lifelong Angeleno, as he serves up raspados, a Mexican dish of shaved ice topped with fruit syrup. Players explore the West Whittier-Los Nietos, East LA and University Park communities, except L.A. has been completely reimagined as a sustainable city. The city is brimming with native plants and trees, with tons of green spaces and walkable areas. Most notably, huge multi-family apartment complexes feature storefronts and bridges and stairways that connect compounds, something Melanie Guevara, a senior majoring in design, said was done to help foster a sense of community.\n\n\u201cI really love reinventing housing,\u201d Guevarea said. \u201cJust trying to find comfortable housing for large families here in LA where they can be comfortable but also it\u2019s a communal base ... I liked [the stairways and pathways] because it encourages activity within the unit, but it also allows neighbors to cross the street to converse and have fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf work is put into it and effort is put into it, it\u2019s possible to be able to reinvent this community ... in a very sustainable, very friendly [and] comfortable way,\u201d she said. While Guevara doesn\u2019t see this reinvention of Los Angeles happening in her lifetime, she hopes that L.A. will eventually implement some of these proposed changes.\n\nThe Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation (SCALE) booth, an organization of USC Students using their grant to partially fund a solar community fridge, was operated by club member Grace Zhang. According to Zhang, SCALE used to volunteer at the community fridge on South Hill Street every week until it got \u201cswept\u201d by the city in what Zhang described as an ongoing issue across the city of Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cAnd so what we\u2019re doing now is trying to build a solar community fridge based off of one that was built in Koreatown, and build one closer to campus,\u201d said Zhang. \u201cSo that we can build a longer term, more sustainable fridge that doesn\u2019t need to be powered by ... a local power source.\u201d\n\nJillian Gorman, a senior majoring in narrative studies, said she went to the fair because her friends had booths, and she was pleasantly surprised by the music.\n\n\u201c[The event] definitely exceeded my expectations,\u201d said Gorman. \u201cI expected there to be a lot more hard science-focused tables, so it was very cool to see how much creative work and humanities were integrated into this whole event.\u201d\n\nThe ACC festival is the first event as part of the wider Earth Day celebrations taking place at USC during April.\n```"}

Cactus Jack announced the collaboration via Instagram last Thursday.\n\nAccording to Fanatics, Cactus Jack is teaming up with 28 universities \u2014 including USC, UCLA, and the University of Michigan \u2014 to create \u201cunique, specially designed products, ensuring students can rep their school in true Cactus Jack style.\u201d Merch will be branded with Cactus Jack and university branding, and retail prices for these products will range between $68 and $160 per Fanatics.\n\nThe collab line will include snapback hats, T-shirts, crewnecks, hoodies, shorts, sweatpants, and backpacks. Mitchell and Ness, a brand owned by Fanatics, secured licenses with all 28 universities and Cactus Jack, allowing the universities and Cactus Jack to earn royalty payments based on product sales.\n\nFanatics CEO Michael Rubin took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to express excitement about the collaboration. \u201cSuch a unique collab,\u201d Rubin posted. \u201cFusing our university partnerships with Trav\u2019s incredible vision and Cactus Jack\u2019s high-end signature streetwear to give sports fans something they\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nThis collaboration is one of many for the Houston-born rapper, who has previously collaborated with brands like McDonald\u2019s, Nike, and Fortnite. Scott has shown support for USC by attending women\u2019s basketball games. The rapper took to X on Monday before USC\u2019s game against UConn in the Elite Eight of March Madness. \u201cTonight might be one of the illest days in women\u2019s sports history. Let\u2019s get it.\u201d\n\nStudents shared their reactions to news of the collab between the university and Scott. Maddie Reinoso, a junior majoring in health and human sciences, said the collab would help bolster USC\u2019s reputation. \u201cWe\u2019re a very internationally popular school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I guess it\u2019s reaffirming that our reputation is still getting out there and a reputation still being built, which I think is what we all want.\u201d\n\nDespite the benefit of recognition, Reinoso noted that the collaboration has its negatives. \u201cI think it\u2019s frustrating to see that we\u2019re prioritizing collaborations with artists who don\u2019t go to USC or have no other affiliation when, instead, we could be prioritizing the facilities that are here for the students,\u201d she said.\n\nOther students shared a similar view on collaboration. \u201cI think it\u2019s a cash grab. I think this university is very interested in keeping its own money or making more money,\u201d said Montserrat de Allende Silva, a junior majoring in earth sciences. Silva believes that USC could have instead collaborated with someone who is known to use their platform for good and that \u201cif it\u2019s someone that has had controversies, and it\u2019s really not benefiting anyone, I don\u2019t see the point.\u201d\n\nUSC Bookstore personnel \u2014 who have cleared space at the front of the bookstore for a new display \u2014 declined to provide further information on the collaboration.

The total solar eclipse will be the last one in decades.\n\nAn annular solar eclipse, in which the moon does not completely cover the sun, will create a \"ring of fire\" effect Oct. 14. Southern Californians will see a less dramatic, partial view of the eclipse.\n\nBy Jinny Kim and Marcel Lacey\nApril 02, 2024 at 5:42 pm PDT\n\nMark your calendar: The first total solar eclipse visible from the U-S in seven years is happening Monday on April 8th. That\u2019s one week from today! And USC students are already preparing for it.\n\nYi Chen, a graduate student studying business analytics, said she\u2019s already made plans to see the solar eclipse.\nYi Chen: I do have three classes in on one day. And I am probably going to skip one because I\u2019m just like, I need to see this. Like, I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to see it again.\n\nOther students, like second-year law student Yassi Soleymanlou, is avoiding possible bad mojo.\nYassi Soleymanlou: It affects your aura in like, a bad way. So I\u2019m probably going to stay in and make sure I\u2019m not outside for this.\n\nIf you are planning to view the eclipse from L-A, protecting your eyes from the sun is vital. Senior cognitive science major Chrystal Nhan said she\u2019s looking into eye safety precautions.\nChrystal Nhan: I don\u2019t want to ruin my vision. I don\u2019t know what it would do but like, if my mom\u2019s telling me not to look at it, I probably should get something to protect my eyes.\n\nLA is outside of the eclipse\u2019s path of totality -- meaning that a sliver of the sun will still be visible during the eclipse. Wearing proper eclipse viewing glasses or using a pinhole projector is necessary, according to Vanessa Alarcon, an astronomical observer at Griffith Observatory.\nVanessa Alarcon: When it is kind of obscured a little bit, you might be tempted to stare at it for longer, but it\u2019s still very dangerous, it\u2019s still a lot of light coming at you. So you still have to be very careful.\n\nUnlike LA, everyone in San Antonio, Texas will experience the total eclipse. Michael Kezirian, an adjunct professor of astronautics practice at USC, is taking a group of 16 students to San Antonio to fly a helium balloon that will take images of the event. He said the student team is well prepared to successfully launch the balloon.\nMichael Kezirian: Normally, these things take a year to put together, but these are just students working a few months, but they\u2019re experienced, they\u2019re energized and kind of been working long hours, in addition to all their schoolwork.\n\nIf you won\u2019t find yourself in Texas next Monday, you can still view the eclipse safely from campus. The USC department of physics and astronomy will have a table by Tommy Trojan for students to watch it. Vahe Peroomian, a professor of physics and astronomy, encourages students to come by for the event.\nVahe Peroomian: The whole thing might take you a minute. And given that the next was not till 2045 I would say take advantage of this opportunity and stop by.\n\nTheir table will set up around 10 a.m. on Monday and provide eclipse glasses.\n```"}

LA metro recently announced that 3 sections will be added to the line, making it a reality. This undertaking represents more than just a mere extension project. It is the first metro line that connects Koreatown to West Los Angeles, near Westwood. The 3 sections, which comprise of eight stations, are set to be completed by 2027.\n\nIn a press conference with officials and city council members this morning, speakers celebrated the completion of the tunneling operations and spoke of the future of the project. The Metro\u2019s Executive Officer for Community Relations, Anthony Crump, who has been with the LA Metro for 9 years believes the project will bridge Los Angeles residential areas, expanding opportunities for Angelenos.\n\nAnthony Crump: I think it\u2019s not about the specific communities that are just along the D Line route itself. It\u2019s actually about connecting Los Angeles as a whole... So really, we\u2019re talking about connecting people all the way from downtown Los Angeles to the west side and providing better access to jobs, opportunity, housing, etc, etc.\n\nLindsey Horvath, the chair of Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, feels the extended D-line will provide residents with new possibilities in all areas of life.\n\nLindsey Horvath: This is a critical transportation solution, to make sure that people can get to jobs can get to health care centers, to arts and culture, arts and culture destinations.\n\nCrump says that the line will provide Angelenos other mobility resources besides automobiles.\n\nCrump: Hopefully, once the purple line opens up, the D line extension opens up, it\u2019ll be another option that people have, rather than sitting on the 10 freeway or you know, sitting in traffic all day, it\u2019ll be another option that\u2019ll be a viable.\n\nHorvath also recognizes how this project could benefit the influx of visitors for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nHorvath: But as we look to welcoming the world into our backyard for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, we know that this will be a vital transport transportation solution for people who are coming from all over the world who are used to riding transportation systems, and who deserved to have the opportunity to ride this one here.\n\nThis D-Line extension could transform the ways Angelenos navigate not only the city but the new opportunities available to them.\n```"}

Kieran Black, a sophomore studying architecture, described his watching experience as \u201cdepressing.\u201d Black did show optimism for the team moving forward. \u201cI did not expect them to go this far,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they definitely exceeded my expectations this year, and they\u2019ll probably do the same next year.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time USC made the Elite Eight since 1994, when Lisa Leslie was leading the Trojans. The team was looking to reach the Final Four for the first time since 1986, but will have to wait another year to try and get back to that stage.\n\nThe Trojans have hoisted the national championship trophy twice in their history, winning back-to-back titles in 1983 and 1984. The season for USC was a magical one as the Trojans hit heights they haven\u2019t reached in over two decades.\n\nIt originally began when USC was ranked No. 21 in the AP preseason poll, the first time the Trojans were in the preseason rankings since 2011. Led by Watkins, the No. 1 freshman recruit of 2023, USC returned to relevance after having a marvelous 29-6 season and earning the No. 1 seed for the first time since that 1986 season.\n\nWatkins became the fifth freshman to earn AP All-America First Team honors, as well as being the Pac-12 and national freshman of the year. Plus, she broke the all-time points record for a player in their freshman season with 920.\n\nWatkins wasn\u2019t the only Trojan that was recognized for their stellar efforts this season, as graduate guard McKenzie Forbes was named to the All-Pac-12 team, junior center Rayah Marshall was an All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention and head coach Lindsay Gottlieb was nominated for the Werner Ladder Naismith Coach of the Year award.\n\nThe popularity surrounding the USC women\u2019s skyrocketed this season, with the total attendance jumping up from 17,622 last season to 75,162 this season. The average attendance shifted dramatically as well, going from around 1,000 fans a game last year to almost 4,500 fans a game this season.\n\nOne of the highlights of the team\u2019s increased popularity was during the crosstown showdown against rivals UCLA, selling out the Galen Center and recording the highest attendance for a game ever at the arena at 10,657.\n\nSilvina Herrera, a junior majoring in theater and cognitive science, said her interest in the women\u2019s team was sparked this season. \u201cI didn\u2019t know much about women\u2019s basketball until this season,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we started doing so well...it definitely made me a fan more this season.\u201d\n\nNotable USC figures attended games this season including Cheryl Miller, football head coach Lincoln Riley, Heisman winners Matt Leinart and Caleb Williams and Natalia and Vanessa Bryant.

In early November, the team announced the addition of a decorated incoming class for the 2024-2025 season, which was ranked as ESPN\u2019s No. 1 recruiting class.\n\nCoach Gottlieb announced the signing of three recruits for the class of 2024: five-star guard Avery Howell, four-star guard Rian Forestier and four-star forward Laura Williams \u2014 all top-100 prospects nationally. The team announced just days later that Kayleigh Heckel and Kennedy Smith, who were both named McDonald\u2019s All-Americans in January, would also join the team.\n\nPatterson expressed his excitement for the future of the team. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot to be proud of, especially moving forward with a great recruiting class coming in,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is a great building block for a new culture for USC women\u2019s basketball.\u201d\n```"}

In his four years at Harvard-Westlake, Perry won two CIF state championships and was named the Mission League MVP twice. The 6-foot-4 guard averaged 18 points, six assists, six rebounds and one steal per game in his final season with the Wolverines.\n\nPerry was named the California Gatorade Player of the Year after a stellar senior season. The Harvard-Westlake product chose USC over Notre Dame, Stanford, Santa Clara, UCLA, Cal and Vanderbilt.\n\nThe dominoes continue to fall for USC men\u2019s basketball following an underwhelming year that was cast with high expectations. After a sluggish 15-18 record, the Trojans had three players \u2014 Kobe Johnson, Oziyah Sellers and Kijani Wright \u2014 nearly immediately hit the transfer portal in search for a new home.\n\nOn top of the transfers, fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis and freshman guard Isaiah Collier are likely leaving the program for the 2024 NBA draft. Perry looked to be the bright spot of a USC 2024 recruiting class that featured zero five-star prospects.\n\nWith Perry decommitting, the Trojans\u2019 2024 recruiting class falls to No. 41 nationally according to 247Sports. Brody Kozlowski, a three-star power forward, and Liam Campbell, a three-star shooting guard, are the only remaining commits. Before Perry left, the incoming class was ranked No. 16 overall.\n\nWith a poor recruiting class, no coach and veteran players leaving, USC men\u2019s basketball will have a long road ahead of itself to get back to winning ways.\n```"}

Kennedy Jr. downplayed the idea that he could be a \u201cspoiler\u201d candidate for former President Donald Trump or President Joe Biden at a rally on March 30. \u201cI\u2019m about to do a press conference after this. I guarantee you, and most of them are going to say to me, are you a spoiler for President Trump or President Biden? That\u2019s what they want to know. And I say, well I\u2019m not a spoiler for both of them,\u201d he said, evoking loud applause from the audience.\n\nKennedy, an environmental lawyer and vaccine skeptic, commemorated Cesar Chavez Day with a rally where he talked about his family\u2019s relationship with Chavez. Kennedy is the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy and the son of former New York Senator and United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. This event comes days after he picked lawyer and philanthropist Nicole Shanahan to be his running mate, which he announced at a rally on March 26 in Oakland.\n\n\u201cI want to pay tribute to this extraordinary American today. I\u2019m so happy that the state of California has designated this weekend Cesar Chavez Day, a holiday in California, and it\u2019s an honor that is well deserved,\u201d Kennedy said. The family of Cesar Chavez criticized the campaign for the event, endorsing Joe Biden\u2019s reelection just days before the event.\n\nThe rally was held at Union Station\u2019s Old Ticket Concourse, located approximately 5 miles from USC. Speaking to a crowd of more than 500 people, he discussed campaign issues including a commitment to end what he described as the corporate capture of government agencies. \u201cWe can\u2019t end the war machine because the companies that are financing them are the companies that are profiting from the war machine,\u201d Kennedy said, who argued that government agencies are captured by corporations and are subject to their bidding.\n\n\u201cThe fulcrum of this problem is the capture of our agencies and I\u2019ve sued almost every one of these agencies. When you sue them you get a PhD in how to unravel corporate capture. I\u2019ve sued FDA, CDC, NIH, EPA, USDA, DOP,\u201d Kennedy said. He called chronic illness an \u201cexistential problem\u201d and said that this is an issue that political leaders need to be discussing.\n\n\u201cWhen my uncle was president, 6% of Americans had chronic disease,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cToday 60% have it. When I was a kid a typical pediatrician would see one case of juvenile diabetes in his lifetime, his entire career. Today 1 out of every 3 children who walks through his office door is either diabetic or pre-diabetic.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you ever hear President Trump talk about that? Did you ever hear President Biden? It\u2019s something they ought to be talking about,\u201d he added. Nationally, Kennedy has 10.4% support, compared to Donald Trump at 42.1% and Joe Biden at 39.6%, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls as of April 1.\n\nIn swing states, Kennedy\u2019s poll numbers may mean the difference between a Trump or Biden victory. In Arizona, he averages at 9.7%. He is polling 10.3% in Nevada, 9.8% in Wisconsin, 8.2% in Michigan, 8% in Pennsylvania, 5.5% in North Carolina and 6.7% in Georgia. The latest poll in California conducted by Emerson College from Feb. 24-27 showed Kennedy with 6% of the vote among likely voters.\n\nOne rally attendee, a Republican from North Hollywood, is planning on voting for Donald Trump and said Kennedy was her backup plan. \u201cI think Mr. Kennedy has some wonderful ideas, and if our candidate doesn\u2019t make it for some reason and ends up jailed I would look at him,\u201d she said in an interview with Annenberg Media. She said she is drawn to his campaign because of his skepticism around vaccines.\n\n\u201cHis questioning of all the medical procedures that children were being put to are a lot of my beliefs and I think that those things needed to be questioned and he has taken a lot of heat for it which is unnecessary,\u201d she added. Kitty Hoksbergen, said that she is supporting Kennedy \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d and that she didn\u2019t have a backup plan right now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not new to the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. admiration club, I am a strong environmentalist,\u201d Hoksbergen said. \u201cFor me, it started with cleaning up the water, cleaning up the air, getting off fossil fuels, regenerative agriculture, so it started there. I\u2019m also in alignment with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about medical freedom, there\u2019s no one size fits all.\u201d\n\nKennedy now faces the challenge of garnering signatures to get on the ballot. He said at the event that he needs 75,000 to get on the ballot in California. \u201cWe just need to convince enough Americans that they\u2019re done, that enough is enough,\u201d Kennedy said as he concluded his speech. His campaign announced on April 1 that they had met the threshold for ballot access in swing state North Carolina. His campaign is currently on the ballot or has reached the required signature amount in Utah, New Hampshire, Nevada and Hawaii.\n```"}

She was met with a cease-and-desist order. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe I was in a situation where I wrote a story and ultimately had to pay for it,\u201d Kwon said recently in an interview with Annenberg Media. \u201cThat just was nauseating to me.\u201d\n\nKwon, a full-time content manager and a freelance reporter, wrote a story for the nonprofit newsroom Knock L.A. in 2021 about illegally operated Airbnbs exacerbating the housing crisis in Los Angeles. The landlord named in the story filed a lawsuit against Kwon in retaliation. After a nearly two-year-long legal battle, they settled on Jan. 29. But Kwon was left with $10,760.58 in legal and court fees \u2014 with no financial support from Knock L.A.\n\nBurdened with the massive fees, Kwon opened a crowdfunding campaign on Feb. 8, detailing her legal and financial situation. It was a last resort after Knock L.A. confirmed they did not have the resources to assist. Less than 24 hours after she posted the campaign, Kwon raised over $12,000 on GoFundMe to pay off her legal fees. She\u2019s still processing the display of mobilized community support. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it went well or where it went well,\u201d she said, shaking her head slightly. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to ask questions about it. I\u2019m thankful.\u201d\n\nA lifelong L.A. resident who has lived in Koreatown for several years, 32-year-old Kwon began writing to learn more about her neighborhood and communities. She said many of her stories are \u201crooted in community organizing,\u201d which also led her to the sources for her Airbnb story. Kwon wasn\u2019t surprised when the named landlord, Simone Shah, served her an individual cease-and-desist order; She had already \u201cweighed the risks,\u201d she said. What she didn\u2019t know was that she would be essentially on her own in the legal battle.\n\n\u201cI knew that [the story] would come back around in some way or form,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cI think I was more so not expecting the lack of support that I would get from the newsroom that published me.\u201d Kwon notified Knock L.A. about the individual cease-and-desist served to her, but she said there was a period of \u201cradio silence\u201d for the past years that she was involved in the lawsuit. When she finally settled with Shah, Kwon reached out to Knock L.A. asking for a contribution to her fees, but the newsroom said they could not offer financial assistance \u201cat this time,\u201d according to Kwon.\n\nRight after Kwon posted the GoFundMe, thinking that it was the end of that conversation, Knock L.A. restarted communication. \u201cI heard back from them at several points that day, asking if I want to talk now,\u201d Kwon said with a laugh. Knock L.A. wrote a public apology to Kwon, which they allowed her to review before posting to social media on Feb. 15. Kwon also spoke to the editor of her Airbnb story to discuss why this situation was disappointing and why she wanted Knock L.A. to \u201cactually uphold what they say when they say that they\u2019re a progressive newsroom,\u201d she said.\n\nThe newsroom wrote in a statement to Annenberg Media that their \u201cusual support mechanism faltered\u201d when Kwon received the individual cease-and-desist. In tandem with their \u201cextremely limited\u201d financial resources, Knock L.A. stated that their pro bono lawyer did not follow up with Kwon about her request for legal assistance. Knock L.A. apologized and expressed gratitude to Kwon in the statement for underscoring the importance of \u201crobust support systems\u201d within the organization. \u201cHer feedback has been crucial in guiding us toward improving our support for freelancers, ensuring they feel secure and backed as they tackle critical issues affecting our community,\u201d Knock L.A. wrote in the statement to Annenberg Media.\n\nDespite this setback, Kwon said she feels \u201cmore equipped\u201d to take on complex stories after her legal battle. \u201cIf anything, I think I just come in with more knowledge now of how to protect myself and how to ask for what I need from a newsroom to do something like this,\u201d Kwon said.\n\nWhen Kwon isn\u2019t interviewing sources for an investigative piece or trying a family restaurant for a food review, she\u2019s working full-time as a content manager for Flight Club, a high-end sneaker marketplace under GOAT Group. The office, a redone warehouse in the Crenshaw neighborhood, is bustling but laid back, full of other young creatives like Kwon. David Kim, a content associate on Kwon\u2019s team at Flight Club, follows her writing but said he wasn\u2019t aware of the full scope of her legal situation. \u201cLisa kept it low-key. She kind of just grinded like a soldier on her own for most of it,\u201d Kim said. \u201cShe is always very fearless with reporting. Her work that most inspired me was the stuff relating to Los Angeles and Koreatown.\u201d\n\nKwon is passionate about presenting her communities accurately. Many mainstream publications, she said, present Koreatown as simply a destination or tourist spot. Her motivation to explore the \u201chuman center\u201d of Los Angeles is the core of why Kwon writes \u2014 and why she said she\u2019ll keep writing. \u201cI know we were joking about it earlier that the news industry is kind of in shambles right now,\u201d Kwon laughed, referencing a previous conversation in the studio. \u201cBut it\u2019s all the more reason for you to try to find the right outlets for more of these stories. There are other external forces that will try to sway narratives right and left if you\u2019re not in there trying to tell the story honestly and from the perspectives that matter.\u201d\n\nHer long-term goal is to write full-time, whether it\u2019s shifting to a more editorial role at GOAT or becoming a published author. For now, though, Kwon is content with having a stable income to support what she likes to do \u201coutside of working hours,\u201d since many nonprofit newsrooms struggle with having the funding to hire staff writers. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t always been smooth,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cBut I found a good balance here.\u201d\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/02/some-usc-students-forced-to-walk-due-to-high-shryft-wait-times/", "response": "```\nSome USC students are opting to walk alone late at night instead of taking a shared Lyft ride, complaining that the free USC service has long wait times and unreliable service. \u201cSometimes I had to wait like 30 minutes to an hour. And at that point, [I] just walk\u201d said Rebecca Tao, a junior studying business.\n\nThe university first partnered with Lyft in 2016 to provide free rides to USC students following an increase in the demand for transportation prior to the pandemic. Students could take free shared rides, called a \u201cShryft\u201d by students, through Lyft anywhere within a two-mile radius of the campus. During the pandemic, the university switched to single-rider Lyfts where students could get a free, direct ride to any destination without sharing their ride with another Lyft user. In Spring 2023, the university decided to reinstate the shared rider system. This decision has been met with criticism from students who claim that it increased wait times in the area.\n\n\u201cI remember my first year when it wasn\u2019t shared, And I think that was a better experience. It was just faster,\u201d said Tao, \u201cAnd I think now, if I leave pretty early, like six when it starts, there\u2019s not many drivers, so it\u2019s really hard getting a ride.\u201d Now, shared rides are adding time to what would be a short trip. \u201cTrips take way longer now,\u201d said Ellie Friedewald, a sophomore psychology major, \u201cSometimes I struggle finding a ride, or it takes like 20-plus minutes to get to my place, which is just a mile away.\u201d\n\nBut for many USC students walking isn\u2019t always the safest option, especially considering that from 2021 to 2022 criminal offenses of rape on or around the university have increased by 30%. Additionally, there has been a 38% increase in robbery and a 36% increase in aggravated assault, according to crime report statistics from USC\u2019s Department of Public Safety.\n\n\u201cA lot of us that started before the shared Lyft program was implemented, were promised free access to transportation around the area,\u201d said sophomore Charlotte Calmes. \u201cI mean, we get emails every day about things that are going on around campus that may not be the safest... So following up on the promise we were made in committing here is pretty important.\u201d\n\nThe lack of available rides for students may be traced back to a lack of incentives for Lyft drivers around the USC area. \u201cI live across the street on King from the BMO stadium. So I turn on my app, and it\u2019d be going crazy for the USC students,\u201d said a Lyft driver who asked not to be identified. Despite the high demand for shared Lyft rides, or as students call it Shryft, the Lyft driver said he still chooses not to take rides in the USC area. \u201cI don\u2019t come here unless I have a bonus,\u201d said the Lyft driver, \u201cThey gave us bonuses. But now they don\u2019t give it no more. So, this is my first time in USC in three months.\u201d\n\nAccording to the driver, Lyft will randomly distribute bonuses of increased prices for completing a certain number of rides on days when higher demand is expected from students, such as events and holidays. However, in recent months there have been almost no bonuses distributed around the area.\n\nFor students who do not have housing on campus, walking is often the only option. \u201cI do think it\u2019s a safety issue because a lot of people go out at night. And that\u2019s when Shryft works. And some people are waiting for Shryfts even just to get home, within two miles of campus,\u201d said sophomore Jessica Deol. \u201cIf they\u2019re waiting, they have to walk home, which is very unsafe in the neighborhood we live in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like location is so important when you\u2019re choosing housing, like, that\u2019s why locations on campus are so coveted.,\u201d Tao said, \u201cAnd it\u2019s unfair because typically, those apartments in unsafe areas are cheaper. So that\u2019s disproportionately affecting a demographic of students.\u201d\n\nDespite this, USC Transportation said that according to their weekly reports from Lyft, wait times are not significantly affected by the Shryft program. \u201cIn our breakdown, I just noticed recently just a slight increase [in wait times], but 88% of our rides are still five minutes or less. 97 percent are less than 10 minutes,\u201d said Michelle Garcia, Senior Associate Director of USC Transportation. \u201cSo I think the issue is pretty rare. But we encourage students to report that issue if they have a long wait time they should report it to Lyft support.\u201d\n\nLyft did not respond to Annenberg Media\u2019s request for comment. In the case of long wait times, Chief Lauretta Hill of the USC Department of Public Safety advises, \u201cNever put yourself in a situation where you are not in control of getting from point A to point B. Call somebody, wait, or if there is a group of people walking in front of you, walk behind them... Be mindful of your surroundings and try to do things in groups as opposed to single and individual.\u201d\n\nStill, students are disappointed and angered with the Shryft long wait times, feeling as if the university is not fulfilling its safety promise to students. \u201cI remember my parents really liking the [free Lyft] feature,\u201d said Lillie O\u2019Loughlin, a sophomore screenwriting major, \u201cAnd that being like a selling point for them on safety, knowing this can be in a potentially unsafe area, having that feature was really important to them. And so to not have that as accessible and useful anymore is definitely disappointing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring back Fryft,\u201d Deol said.\n```"}

It has not been smooth sailing for the Clippers post-All Star break, but Los Angeles is slowly starting to gain momentum as the postseason approaches. The Clippers are in the midst of a four-game winning streak and would like to secure a top four spot in the Western Conference.\n\nAfter Los Angeles\u2019 thrilling win over the Philadelphia 76ers last Wednesday, the Clippers picked up two more wins against the Orlando Magic on Friday and the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday. Los Angeles\u2019 game against the Magic had a playoff feel to it as the Clippers managed to escape with a 100-97 victory. Kawhi Leonard led the way with a double-double, collecting 29 points, 11 rebounds and five assists. Leonard also carried the load on the defensive end with four steals and two blocks. No other player for the Clippers scored 15-plus points and Los Angeles\u2019 other stars struggled mightily. Paul George and James Harden went a combined 7-26 from the field and the pair had a collective six turnovers. Russell Westbrook, who recently made his return to lineup following hand surgery, scored just five points off the bench.\n\nThe victory gave the Clippers a sweep of the season series against Orlando. Following the win, the Clippers traveled to Charlotte to take on the Hornets in a game that Los Angeles secured a little more comfortably. Following a poor performance against Orlando, Paul George led the way for the Clippers with 41 points, which included eight made three-pointers. This came even after George airballed his first shot and had another shot blocked. The Clippers\u2019 offensive attack was much more balanced against Charlotte as Kawhi Leonard poured in 23 points and Ivica Zubac scored a season-high 24 points on 7-8 shooting. Zubac was also a perfect 10-10 from the free-throw line.\n\nDespite these efforts, Charlotte still kept the game close mainly because rookie Brandon Miller and Miles Bridgers combined for 55 points. In the end, the Clippers managed a 130-118 win and earned their 12th straight over the Hornets.\n\nThe final stop on the Clippers\u2019 road trip is Sacramento for their fourth and final matchup against the Kings this season. The Clippers have gone 2-1 in the previous three matchups and will look to take the season series on Tuesday night. The first three games between these teams were not particularly close as the Clippers won the first two matchups by an average of 17 points. And in the most recent matchup, the Kings came out on top in a 123-107 win.\n\nIf the Clippers are going to get their third win against the Kings this year, they will have to contain the duo of De\u2019Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis. With Kevin Heurter out for the rest of the season and Malik Monk sidelined with a sprained MCL, Sacramento will rely on their two All-Stars heavily the rest of the way. The Clippers will have their hands full with Sabonis. The Kings forward leads the league in triple-doubles this season and is averaging 19.6 points, 13.6 rebounds and 8.3 assists per game. The Lithuanian big man also recently broke the record for consecutive games recording a double-double, previously held by Kevin Love at 53 games in a row. Sabonis\u2019 54th consecutive double-double came against the 76ers last week.\n\nThis season, Fox is averaging a career high in scoring at 26.4 points per game and even though his efficiency has dropped compared to last year, the former Kentucky guard is still one of the most electric young point guards in the league and has had his way with the Clippers this year. In their three matchups, Fox has put up 29 points per game against Los Angeles on nearly 51% from the floor.\n\nPaul George may be the x-factor in this game as the Clippers will need him to step up. In two games played against Sacramento this season, George has averaged just 14 points per game on 40% shooting from the field.\n\nIt has been an up and down season for the Clippers this year and in these final eight games of the season, they have an opportunity to continue to find their rhythm and enter the postseason playing their best basketball.\n```"}

These events were just part of USC\u2019s activity lineup for National Public Health Week. This year\u2019s theme, \u201cProtecting, Connecting, and Thriving: We Are All Public Health,\u201d resonated throughout the event, particularly with the launch of the Community Readiness Champions initiative.\n\nBuilding upon the success of the 2023 Heart Heroes campaign, which trained over 500,000 LA County residents in hands-only CPR, this initiative aims to empower individuals across diverse communities, with a special focus on communities of color. \u201cFormal CPR training is less readily available in black and Hispanic communities, and those communities are also less likely to receive bystander CPR. A campaign like Heart Heroes eliminates obstacles that often discourage people from seeking training and instead meets people where they are,\u201d said Kristen McCowan, the Vice President of Government and Community Affairs for the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe festivities also included a press conference featuring representatives from the Los Angeles Department of Public Health (LADPH), Los Angeles Fire Department, the American Heart Association, and USC\u2019s Keck School of Medicine. According to the American Heart Association, 500,000 people die from cardiac arrest in the US alone, and only 46% of people who suffer cardiac arrest receive help from a bystander. If more people learn CPR, more lives can be saved.\n\n\u201cThis could happen to anyone. Anyone could suffer from this no matter who it is, and it\u2019s so important that everyone learn CPR because it can save so many lives and help out so many people,\u201d said Cash Hennessy, a press-conference speaker who suffered a cardiac arrest at 13 years old. He was resuscitated by bystanders using hands-only CPR and now works as a CPR-readiness advocate.\n\n\u201cWe are here to serve the public and we do everything we can to help people when they need us the most. But the truth is we cannot possibly be everywhere when medical emergencies strike. That is why we need to urge everyone to step up and be part of our Emergency Response Team,\u201d said L.A. County Fire Department Chief Anthony Marrone.\n\nLADPH Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer is excited to build off of last year\u2019s initiative and introduce new life-saving skills to L.A. residents. \u201cWe know that there are people in our communities that have been really hungry to build their skills, so that they can play a role when there\u2019s an emergency situation,\u201d Dr. Ferrer said in an interview with Annenberg Media.\n\nUSC students, particularly those from the American Association of Psychiatric Pharmacists chapter, have played a pivotal role in increasing access to naloxone and training others in its use.

We also know that when individuals have knowledge, skills and confidence, they can be an active bystander, and they can save a life.\u201d```"}

But, many faculty members pointed out that universities in Gaza won\u2019t be able to do the same.\n\n\u201cThe massive assaults against educational infrastructure, educators and students at all levels and throughout Gaza since October 7 have emerged as part of a larger campaign of ethnic cleansing intending to destroy the very foundations and bases of continued Palestinian life in Gaza,\u201d Laurie Brand, a retired political science professor who specialized in international relations and Middle East studies, said during USC\u2019s Palestine Justice Faculty group\u2019s opening statements at the demonstration.\n\nTwelve members of USC\u2019s Palestine Justice Faculty group held a demonstration honoring Palestinian academics killed by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, condemning Israel\u2019s attacks against Gazan academics. This demonstration was the first of its kind for the faculty group who had previously only organized educational teach-ins about the war in Gaza.\n\nBrand said the group hoped to raise awareness for the conflict in Gaza in the context of academia. \u201cPeople are inside, listening to President Folt talk about what is happening at USC and we were outside telling people about the terrible state of the academy in Gaza,\u201d Brand said.\n\nSince October 7, Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza has killed over 30,000 people, including many educators. The Palestinian Ministry of Education reports more than 800 teachers have been injured and 239 staff members have been killed.\n\nProfessor Laurie Brand holds a picture of Dr. Omar Saleh Farwana, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of The Islamic University of Gaza. Dr. Farwana was killed in his home along with 14 of his children and grandchildren in an airstrike on Oct. 15.\n\nTwo professors held up a large sign reading \u201cUSC Faculty Against the Genocide in Palestine,\u201d while others held up pictures of Palestinian academics who were killed in the war.\n\n\u201cToday, as you hear about the state of USC, and have no concern on this spring morning that the hall you gather in will be bombed, that the library or archives in which you work will be flattened, that your colleagues and students will be absent because they have been killed, detained or disappeared,\u201d Brand said. \u201cWe gather in honor and remembrance ... [of those] who have been killed by the ongoing Israeli genocidal attacks on Gaza.\u201d\n\nIn the past six months, all 12 of Gaza\u2019s universities have been bombed and destroyed. In addition, several cultural heritage sites such as libraries and museums have been damaged, looted or demolished.\n\nKate Levin, a creative writing professor, said the event was to highlight Israel\u2019s ongoing \u201cScholasticide\u201d in Gaza, a term coined by Oxford Professor of Politics and International Relations Dr. Karma Nabulsi in 2009 to describe the \u201csystematic destruction of Palestinian education by Israel.\u201d\n\nIsrael has a recorded history of attacking Gaza\u2019s educational and cultural institutions spanning decades.\n\n\u201cWe aim to call attention to the wholesale destruction of the educational sector in Gaza, from the bombing of every single university to the murder of thousands of students and faculty,\u201d Brand said in the opening statement.\n\nBrand called for an immediate ceasefire and criticized the Israeli military\u2019s \u201cgenocidal violence against the Palestinians of Gaza\u201d on behalf of the faculty group. She criticized the Biden administration\u2019s continued rhetorical and monetary support of the IDF.\n\nFollowing the statement, the faculty read out loud a translated version of \u201cI Grant You Refuge\u201d by Hiba Abu Nada, a Palestinian poet, novelist and teacher. The opening lines read, \u201cI grant you refuge / in invocation and prayer. / I bless the neighborhood and the minaret / to guard them / from the rocket.\u201d\n\nIDF soldiers killed Nada in her home in South Gaza on October 20. She was 32.\n\nDr. George Salem reads a short biography of Khalil Abu Yahia, English teacher and climate researcher in Gaza City. Yahia was killed on Oct. 30 at the age of 24 along with his wife and two daughters.\n\nThe group also read out loud the names of 23 Palestinian educators who have been killed since Oct. 7 along with short biographies for each person.\n\nAccording to the group, the fallen educators honored included: Abdel Nasser al-Saqqa Adham Hassouna Ahmed Mahmoud Al-Qara Ahmad Hamdi Abo Absa Amin al-Bahtiti Do\u2019aa AlMasri Ibrahim al-Astal Isma\u2019il Abu-Saada Khalil Abu Yahia Mohammed Awad Mohammed Dabbour Muhammad Eid Shabir Nahed Al Rafati Nasser al-Yafawi Nidal Qudura Omar Saleh Farwana Raed Qaddoura Refaat Alareer Refat Lobad Said Al-Zubda Shaher Yusuf Yaghi Sufjan Tayeh Tareq Thabet\n\nSome onlookers of the vigil stopped to listen to the names and stories of the educators. Some stopped to take photos, some clapped, while others simply passed by the demonstration.\n\nMultiple viewers of the demonstration refused to comment when approached by Annenberg Media.\n\nFollowing a moment of silence, biomechanics professor Dr. George Salem closed out the demonstration by reading \u201cIf I Must Die,\u201d a poem by the late Refaat Alareer, a Palestinian poet and professor at the Islamic University of Gaza. Alareer, along with six of his family members, were killed in an airstrike on Dec. 6. His poem, pinned to the top of his X account, was posted a month before his death and has since been reposted over 118,000 times.\n\nSarah Kessler, an English professor, holds up a picture of Muhammad Eid Shabir, former President of the Islamic University of Gaza. Shabir was killed on Nov. 14 along with three members of his family.\n\nAli Pearl, lecturer at USC Dornsife, said she was motivated to attend this demonstration because she is Jewish and a faculty member.\n\n\u201cI feel like as a Jewish person, as a Jewish faculty member, it\u2019s especially important for me to stand up and say, \u2018Israel is occupied Palestine. Israel is currently committing a genocide in Palestine,\u2019\u201d Pearl told Annenberg Media. \u201cI need my colleagues to realize that they\u2019re working at a university that gets to exist and stand and not be bombed into oblivion.\u201d\n\nTensions about Israel\u2019s war in Gaza have been rising on college campuses across the country since October 7. Pro-Palestinian faculty and students nationwide have alleged censorship and fears of physical violence, blacklisting, doxxing and loss of employment.\n\nAnnenberg Media reported on free speech concerns on USC\u2019s campus back in November.\n\nPearl, who is not a tenured employee, said she\u2019s observed fear among students and faculty to speak about Palestine.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice to not be afraid to get fired for saying that Israel should not be killing 30,000 plus people,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cI think my dream would be for people to stop intentionally conflating anti-Zionism and antisemitism.\u201d\n\nBrand, who also serves as Chair for the Middle East Studies Association of North America\u2019s Committee on Academic Freedom, said she\u2019s heard rising fears of Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian sentiment from her colleagues at USC.\n\nBrand noted her status as a retired professor gave her more security to speak up.\n\nLater in the day, USC Hillel and the student organization Trojans for Israel held a demonstration calling for the return of the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza and supporting Israel\u2019s campaign in the region.\n\nAnnenberg Media reached out to Trojans for Israel for comment on the faculty demonstration but did not receive a response.\n\nBrand expressed her hope that the university will take steps toward assisting educators in Gaza with its resources, stating that she hopes the administration will be \u201cwilling to look at the tremendous destruction that has taken place.\u201d\n\nBrand says the faculty group is \u201cwilling and ready to provide ideas and suggestions to try and work with the administration to see if USC can be a part of what ultimately is rebuilt in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThe Palestine Justice Faculty group emailed the Provost asking for the constitution of an advisory committee on Palestine. The group says the committee will \u201cprovide support to our students and partner with the administration in creating a campus that accounts for the needs of our Palestinian and Arab students, as well as those who advocate for Palestinian human rights.\u201d\n\nThe group included additional requests for the University that read:\n\n1. Affirm a clear, steadfast commitment to protecting the academic freedom of all our faculty, staff, and students.\n2. Affirm First Amendment and free speech rights for all our faculty, staff, and students.\n3. Reject calls to condemn, monitor, or punish students, staff, and faculty who criticize Israel and Zionism and organize and advocate for Palestinian rights and freedom, and ensure that they do not experience retaliation for such political speech.\n4. Ensure that any member of the USC community who is accused of antisemitic speech or action is accorded complete due process, and that such accusations do not have the effect of chilling legitimate criticism of Israel and Zionism.\n\nAdditionally, Pearl hopes to see the school take steps to divest from Israel.\n\nIn response to Israeli military campaigns in Gaza, there have been calls for universities to divest as a part of the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Some student assemblies of universities in California have voted and passed resolutions calling to divest from companies that have ties supporting the IDF, including UC San Diego and UC Davis.\n\nWhile there is no formal campus group campaigning for divestment, a few students are trying to revitalize DivestSC, a campaign calling for USC to divest from the fossil fuel industry.\n\nJessica Hatrick, a Ph.D. candidate at Annenberg, says this new effort hopes to divest \u201cfrom other forms of violence than just fossil fuels, including militarism, police, prisons and the State of Israel.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles that Hatrick says the student group has been facing in terms of getting their divestment campaign off the ground is the conflation of anti-Zionism with antisemitism.\n\nThis comparison has been a topic of heavy debate along with the conversation of censorship.\n\n\u201cPeople equate critiques of the state of Israel to antisemitism, particularly under the narrative that Jewish campus members do not feel safe on campus,\u201d Hatrick said. \u201cThese narratives always speak to a few Jewish campus members and argue they reflect the experiences of all Jewish campus members, despite Jewish students, staff and faculty making up a large percentage of those critiquing the State of Israel.\u201d\n\nHatrick, who found the campaign through USC\u2019s Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation (SCALE), said the campus and the country perpetuate the \u201cPalestine Exception.\u201d\n\nThe Palestine Exception is a report conducted by Palestine Legal documenting the \u201cwidespread and growing suppression of Palestinian human rights advocacy in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cFree speech and freedom of expression are prioritized in the U.S., except when it comes to discussions of Palestine,\u201d Hatrick said.\n\nPearl echoed similar sentiments.\n\n\u201cWhen I get emails from this university that put Jewish students in the position of victim when those Jewish students aren\u2019t actually experiencing antisemitism, they\u2019re experiencing anti-Zionism. It really takes all the air out of any actual incidents of antisemitism,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cIf we\u2019re conflating anti-Zionism and antisemitism, then we\u2019re actually doing a huge disservice to our Jewish population here.\u201d\n\nPearl hopes to see the university protect students and faculty speaking out in support of Palestine.\n\n\u201cI think making sure that Palestinian students feel supported and safe to be themselves to speak out against what\u2019s happening to their people,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cit would be nice to be able to talk about this in class and know that the university has my back.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of Bryce Dechert/Daily Trojan)\n\nBy Cam Kauffman April 02, 2024 at 9:03 am PDT\n\nDespite graduate guard McKenzie Forbes nailing a game-tying 3-pointer with 7:36 remaining, USC women\u2019s basketball couldn\u2019t make baskets down the stretch to pull itself ahead of UConn, falling 80-73 Monday night in the Elite Eight in Portland, Oregon. After Forbes\u2019 three, UConn called a timeout to slow the game down and set up a play to get in front before the Trojans could do it themselves. The timeout worked, as UConn took the lead back and never relinquished it.\n\nBeyond UConn\u2019s inability to miss when the game was on the line, however, the story of the night was USC\u2019s inability to make a basket late. The Trojans (29-6) went on to miss 11 shots in the remaining minutes, including three crucial ones within the final 29 seconds, while the Huskies almost couldn\u2019t miss from the field. UConn ended the game shooting 48% from the field compared to under 33% for USC.\n\nRedshirt junior guard Paige Bueckers, who was the Portland 3 region\u2019s most outstanding player, led UConn with 28 points and 10 rebounds. Nine of her points came after Forbes tied the game. For USC, freshman guard JuJu Watkins led the way with 29 points, but her shot looked off all night. She shot 9-for-25, just below her season average of 40%. On Monday, many buckets she might usually make fell just short, hitting the front of the rim and bouncing out multiple times.\n\nBoth Forbes and head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said guarding the Huskies was a tough task \u2014 both in planning and actually doing it. \u201cIf you guard any single action the wrong way \u2014 if you try to take a shortcut \u2014 they capitalize on it,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cI think they just capitalized off of every one of our mistakes. We battled to the end, but I think they were just the better team today.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to gameplan because they\u2019re on the move a lot,\u201d Gottlieb said. Senior forward Aaliyah Edwards was also tough to guard for the Trojan bigs, as she put up 24 points and made more than 50% of her shots. Edwards fought strong through Trojan defenders while tossing up halfway hook shots or putting in easy layups on assists from Bueckers and others.\n\nUSC held its final lead of the game, 19-17, with 7:52 left in the second quarter, but a 3-pointer by Bueckers gave UConn a lead that it never fully relinquished. At halftime, they were tied at 33 apiece, but the Huskies were in the driver\u2019s seat in the second half. UConn opened up the second half scoring eight points from three different players before USC could notch one.\n\nWatkins credited UConn\u2019s defense with making it difficult to score all night. In the end, despite UConn\u2019s shallow bench and lack of height, the team\u2019s overall NCAA Tournament experience may have been the deciding factor on Monday. As a program, UConn has won a Division I-best 11 national championships, all under the guidance of head coach Geno Auriemma, who coached a masterclass of a game against a taller and fresher-legged Trojan squad. In addition, in 2022, the Huskies reached the national championship with six of the current players on its roster appearing in the title game. Three of those players were healthy Monday night against USC, including Edwards, Bueckers and senior guard Nika M\u00fchl.\n\nDespite the loss, Gottlieb commended her team for its fight and its willingness to prove the doubters wrong all season. \u201cWe did a lot more celebrating than a lot of teams get to do,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot more joy than sadness, but this one really hurts.\u201d\n\nWatkins said she is excited to get back in the gym in Los Angeles and reflect on the lessons she learned this season and take them into next year. \u201cJust coming up short, I think that adds a lot of fuel to the fire for the next couple of years,\u201d Watkins said. Adding to her outstanding first-year campaign, Watkins also broke the freshman all-time scoring record during the second quarter on a statement 3-pointer. But, it was clear she cared less about the record and more about her teammates. \u201cThe record is great, but the moments I\u2019ve gotten to spend with this team have meant everything to me,\u201d a tearful Watkins said postgame.\n\nWith seven incoming freshmen and six exiting seniors and graduate students, the Trojans will be a much younger \u2014 and completely different \u2014 team next season. But Forbes said she\u2019s sure the future of the program is bright with Watkins at the helm. \u201cShe\u2019s selfless; she\u2019s mature; she\u2019s a winner,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cThis program couldn\u2019t be in better hands than with her.\u201d\n```"}

(AP/Marta Lavandier)\n\nBy Matt Kim April 02, 2024 at 12:27 am PDT\n\nTo open the 2024 MLB season, the Halos went into Camden Yards knowing they were the clear underdogs to a team that won 101 games just a year ago. Not to mention, the Orioles only improved over the offseason, with their biggest acquisition being three-time All-Star Corbin Burnes in a trade with the Brewers. And Burnes would make the start for the Orioles on Opening Day, only for Mike Trout to hit a solo home run to put the Angels up 1-0 in the top of the first.\n\nBut that was the only run the Angels would score off of Burnes in his six innings of work. Burnes would proceed to collect 11 strikeouts while only allowing two baserunners, a walk and Trout\u2019s solo shot. On the bump for the Angels was Patrick Sandoval, who struggled with his command early in the game. He walked two, in addition to allowing a hit to load the bases for Anthony Santander. The O\u2019s cleanup hitter would drive in a run on a fielder\u2019s choice before back-to-back hits by Adley Rutschman and Jordan Westberg put the Orioles up by two.\n\nSandoval\u2019s troubles would continue into the second, so skipper Ron Washington went to the bullpen early. His final line was 1.2 innings, three earned runs, six hits, two walks and two strikeouts. After Sandoval\u2019s early exit, the wheels fell off, as the Angels bullpen would allow six runs over the remainder of the game. The offense would remain quiet too, scoring two more runs en route to a 11-3 opening day blowout.\n\nAfter an embarrassing start to the season and a day of rest, they looked to bounce back in game two. In typical Angels fashion, it was much of the same. The Halos would next turn to Griffin Canning for the start and in the bottom of the first, Gunnar Henderson hit a leadoff home run. Ryan Mountcastle would then drive in another with an RBI double, before striking again in the third inning with another RBI double.\n\nWashington pulled Canning after he allowed back-to-back baserunners in the sixth, giving way to Luis Garcia, who was making his Angels debut. Garcia\u2019s outing was nothing short of disastrous, as he allowed both inherited runners to score, while also permitting three more runs before he recorded a single out. He was pulled \u2014 but the damage had been done.\n\nThe Angels would go on to lose Saturday\u2019s contest by a final score of 11-4. The pitching staff in the first two games allowed a total of 23 runs, setting a new franchise record. The lineup showed some signs of life offensively, as Taylor Ward hit a two-run homer in game two of the series,, but they were unable to keep up with the Orioles\u2019 powerhouse lineup.\n\nThe Angels struck out 13 times against Grayson Rodriguez and the Orioles bullpen, nearly matching their 14 K\u2019s the game prior. New manager Washington has been around the game of baseball for decades, and the one thing he wanted to make clear was that the season wasn\u2019t decided in the first two games. In a meeting he had with the players, he \u201c[j]ust wanted to let them know they\u2019ve played only two games and we can\u2019t get off track,\u201d said Washington, per ESPN.\n\nIn the final game of the series, the Angels showed a dramatic shift in energy, especially on the pitching side, proving Washington\u2019s speech may have worked wonders. In the first, Ward put the Angels on the board early with a two-run homerun off of Orioles starter Tyler Wells, his second in as many games. That was about all of the offense they needed as Reid Detmers stepped onto the mound.\n\nDetmers was tasked with helping prevent a sweep at the Orioles\u2019 hands, and in Monday\u2019s outing, he looked dominant. In five innings, Detmers would strike out seven while only allowing two hits and a single earned run. He displayed his diverse arsenal that features a mid-90s fastball and two different curveballs. One sat in the mid 80s and acted more as a sweeper, while the other registered in the mid-70s and had more vertical break.\n\nThe lefty did have his fair share of command issues, as he walked three, including one that brought in a run in the third. This is something that Detmers has struggled with in his young career, but if he can hone in on his command and keep his pitch count low, he\u2019ll be a potential breakout candidate for the 2024 season.\n\nAfter his departure, the Angels bullpen\u2014led by Jose Soriano and Carlos Estevez\u2014would pull a complete 180. Soriano went three innings in relief and didn\u2019t surrender a run to a lineup that had just scored double-digit runs in back-to-back games. Carlos Estevez then pitched a clean ninth inning, as the Angels took the final game of the series 4-1.\n\nThe Angels then headed to Miami, where they\u2019ll face a Marlins team that the Pittsburgh Pirates just swept in a four-game series. Chase Silseth got the start in game one and looked serviceable in his short outing. In three innings, he allowed three runs and struck out five. The bullpen took over from there, and only allowed one run (unearned) in six innings of work.\n\nThe offense kicked it into another gear on Monday, as the Angels star center fielder Mike Trout went yard twice alongside a solo shot from rookie Nolan Schanuel. Ward had his third consecutive game with an RBI, however Angels third baseman Anthony Rendon is still without a hit as Washington continues to put him in the leadoff spot.\n\nThe Angels will turn to Tyler Anderson in game two on Tuesday as the rotation turns back to Patrick Sandoval in the final game of the series. The Halos will look to improve on their quick turnaround and hopefully win their first series of the year.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/04/01/ducks-prospect-spotlight-nico-myatovic/", "response": "```\nDUCKS: Prospect spotlight: Nico Myatovic\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 A broken leg might have prevented winger Nico Myatovic from playing a full campaign with the Western Hockey League\u2019s Seattle Thunderbirds in 2023-24, but that didn\u2019t stop him from nearly playing at a point-per-game pace on a transitioning team. Myatovic was the Ducks\u2019 most recent prospect offered an entry-level contract, as on March 29 he inked his name to a three-year deal beginning in the 2024-25 NHL season.\n\nThe Ducks selected the 19-year-old standout with the No. 33 overall pick in the 2023 NHL Entry Draft and he immediately reported back to Seattle with a strong WHL title season under his belt from 2022-23. The Thunderbirds\u2019 championship-winning season featured a loaded roster that prevented Myatovic from having an everyday, top-line role. However, the Prince George, British Columbia native still managed to post an outstanding 60-point season with 30 goals and 30 assists in 68 regular season games.\n\nThat came on the heels of a less productive campaign for Myatovic in 2021-22, as he tallied just 28 total points in 67 games, showing huge year-on-year improvement. In 2023-24, the Thunderbirds didn\u2019t have the championship-level dominance of the year prior, giving Myatovic time to shine in a bigger role, even with the broken leg he suffered in October. He was among Seattle\u2019s most consistent contributors, posting 0.88 points per game and totalling 30 in 34 outings. He frequently skated for upwards of 21 minutes in games when healthy.\n\nAfter he signed his new contract, Myatovic became an official member of the American Hockey League\u2019s San Diego Gulls on an Amateur Tryout for the rest of this season. His deal will yield him an average of $950,000 per year. Standing 6-foot-3 and weighing 187 pounds, Myatovic\u2019s size allows him to play the puck with a physical edge. He is a defensive-minded forward that forechecks without hesitation and can also stand his ground in the defensive zone.\n\nIn the offensive zone, Myatovic capitalizes on chances set up by his teammates; his fluid skating helps him find open lanes on rushes and position himself near the crease to tip in deflections and screen opposing goaltenders. His cerebral style of play allows him to perform in different roles alongside a variety of linemates, which will benefit him in the future as he transitions to the pro game.\n\nMyatovic doesn\u2019t always lead attacks, but as a strong, elusive winger, he gets open and sets himself up to fire in wrist shots\u2014his specialty. He\u2019s not afraid to wait for a play to develop in order to take a high quality shot as opposed to a contested one. Myatovic\u2019s biggest challenge will be taking initiative at the pro level. His numbers are solid, but he often depends on his linemates to do the dirty work.\n\nBut if Myatovic proved one thing during his amateur career, it was that he has the capacity to rapidly improve and adjust to change in a short period of time. His 22-point increase from 2021-22 to 2022-23 is one example of this and Ducks general manager Pat Verbeek clearly took notice of Myatovic\u2019s promising potential. The Athletic had the young winger ranked as 2023\u2032s No. 45 draft prospect, which would\u2019ve projected him as a mid-second rounder. Instead, the Ducks picked him first in round two, which might\u2019ve seemed like a reach at the time.\n\nBut almost a year later and at a young age still, he\u2019s already risen to the AHL and will look for a potential NHL call-up in the coming seasons. Since signing his entry-level contract, Myatovic has played in two AHL games. Spending time on the bottom lines, he\u2019s yet to tally a point and will look to adjust to a much faster, more physical level of hockey with the Gulls. San Diego will likely miss the playoffs and only has 10 games left on the calendar, so Myatovic will have less of an opportunity to end the year on a high note heading into the first year on his new contract than Ducks brass would\u2019ve hoped.\n\nMyatovic will also have to stay healthy to have a smooth track to becoming an everyday Duck. Owning an NHL-level frame at just 19 years old, he should continue to build strength to better absorb contact and avoid missing a bulk of the season like he did in the WHL. While not as highly touted as some of Anaheim\u2019s other forward prospects like Leo Carlsson or Cutter Gauthier, Myatovic could be the kind of high-level bottom-six player that contending teams need to keep the lower lines afloat. And considering Anaheim\u2019s future core might be filled with elite talent, Myatovic has a chance to be exactly that type of player who rounds out a roster. Before then, though, the promising winger will aim to start next year\u2019s AHL season on the right foot and rise up the lines.\n```"}

The Ring Foundation has partnered with the USC Annenberg School of Journalism to present the award for 35 years. It is the largest journalism prize in America, granting $50,000 to the recipient journalists or organizations. The award is presented to published investigative journalists whose reporting has brought a notable and tangible impact on local, national and international communities.\n\nUSC Annenberg Dean Willow Bay introduced the award and highlighted the 35-year-long partnership with The Ring Foundation, which also established an investigative reporting fellowship program at USC in 2017. \u201cThis remarkable commitment not only ensures that we are continuing to honor and celebrate extraordinary investigative journalism, but it also means that we are able to train the next generation of Selden Ring Award winners,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like to express our deep gratitude for the partnership.\u201d\n\nGordon Stables, the director of the school of journalism, introduced the reporters and the panelists and presented the award. \u201cThis is one of the best days of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a day that we get to celebrate journalism that is both remarkable in quality and has demonstrated impact.\u201d\n\nThe ceremony included a panel discussion with the reporters who broke the story \u2014 Justin Elliott, Joshua Kaplan, Brett Murphy and Alex Mierjeski. Kirsten Berg, who was also on the team, was not present. Through analyzing flight records and poring over thousands of documents and public records \u2014 while also scouring the internet for leads \u2014 the team found that Justice Thomas had received luxury vacations from billionaire Harlan Crow for decades, raising ethical questions about the Supreme Court justices\u2019 behavior.\n\nAfter the publication of the story and dozens of members of Congress pushing for ethics reform, the Supreme Court adopted an ethics code for the first time in its history. One of the first codes reads that a justice \u201cshould neither knowingly lend the prestige of the judicial office to advance the private interests of the Justice or others nor knowingly convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence the Justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting, if you contrast the judiciary with other branches, all of these rules that you face in the executive branch, all these rules you face in Congress weren\u2019t really created out of the goodness of the affected entities,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cMost of the ethics rules in the federal government were created in response to Watergate.\u201d\n\nRing Foundation Fellows and journalism master\u2019s students Accalia Rositani and Raymon Troncoso were part of the panel. They asked the reporters about their process and how ProPublica approached the reporting without access to judiciary records. \u201cCongress, in its wisdom, exempted both itself and the judiciary from that law [Freedom of Information Act],\u201d Elliot said. \u201cSo you can\u2019t just ask for public records; they won\u2019t give them to you. There\u2019s sort of a culture of secrecy at the court itself. We were able to piece a lot of this together by really kind of coming at it from the outset.\u201d\n\nOne of the ways they found an outside lead was through an oil painting commissioned by Crow. \u201cSome billionaires who we\u2019ve tried to report on are incredibly reclusive and have a tight circle around them and basically have impenetrable lives,\u201d Elliot said. \u201cBut for whatever reason, [Harlan Crow\u2019s] gifts seem to have this compulsion to document his relationships. So we came across an oil painting he had commissioned that shows him with Justice Thomas and a few other kind of important people at one of his estates in upstate New York and, you know, ended up calling the guy that painted it, and he talked to us and told us about the circumstances.\u201d\n\nDuring the panel, Kaplan emphasized fairness and accuracy, especially when reporting on individual people. \u201cWe reached out to the Court ahead of time, and we sent an incredibly detailed letter with every single fact we were planning to publish,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cFor all the students here, this is a fundamental process for making sure you\u2019re being fair to the person at the center of your story and then also for just giving as much contextualization as you possibly can.\u201d\n\nKaplan said that the most concrete impact of the reporting is the adoption of an ethics code. \u201cThis is a step that people have been calling on them to do for well over a decade,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cIt\u2019s significantly less than really, any other government official has, but they do have rules now. And that\u2019s, I think, a sign of how it\u2019s being felt inside the court.\u201d```"}

The event included live music, dance performances and classic Arab foods for attendees to enjoy, bringing together a tight-knit group that students referred to as their \u201cfamily.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis community means, honestly, everything. These are my friends, my family, my brothers, sister[s],\u201d said Abdallah Khlifat, a junior economics and data science major and the Assistant Director of the Middle Eastern North African Student Assembly. \u201cThe recognition of our students, Arab Americans, is relatively very new, so seeing stuff like this happen brings a smile to people\u2019s faces.\u201d\n\nWhile the first celebrations of the Arab American identity began in the 1980s, National Arab American History Month (NAAHM) was not established until 2017. The movement towards a designated month for NAAHM was led by the Arab America and Arab American Foundation. However, only a handful of states recognized the initiative at the time. In 2021, President Biden officially recognized April as NAAHM \u2014the first acknowledgment by an American President. The following year, Congress, the U.S. Department of State and 45 state governors issued proclamations commemorating the initiative.\n\n\u201cArab Heritage Month is like any other month in the U.S., but for Arab Americans specifically, it\u2019s just something more special just because a lot of Arab Americans are sons of immigrants or immigrants themselves,\u201d said Monira Alkidim, a sophomore industrial engineering student. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly a way to connect back to your culture and back [to] your country.\u201d\n\nArab Americans came in three waves from Arabic-speaking countries of the Middle East, North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa starting in 1880, according to the Arab American Institute. Now, there are an estimated 3.7 million Arab Americans in the United States with more than 85% of them being U.S. citizens.\n\n\u201cI just think that our culture is so rich, there\u2019s so much to think about, learn about, and practice. I just use this month to practice cultural things and appreciate my history and what it means to be Arab,\u201d Alkidim said.\n\nUSC will host a number of events this month to commemorate NAAHM, including a Middle Eastern North African (MENA) art exhibit, a MENA community dinner and a Mosaic Lamp Workshop.\n\n\u201cI think this definitely means...a recognition of our identity and what we mean to be American, but also a connection to a culture that\u2019s really important to us and impacts our identity,\u201d said Zaina Dabbous, a sophomore communications major. \u201cI think that negative portrayals of our culture are what happens in the media all the time, but I think this event is really special to students because it shows a beautiful part of our identity.\u201d\n\nStudents hope that USC will continue to give the community more opportunities to further acknowledge and uplift the Arab American heritage on campus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely really great to know that this school is allowing us to have a platform to show our culture and push back against those negative narratives of our people,\u201d Dabbous said. \u201cI think [USC] should just keep providing us a platform and a fair space and a platform to definitely keep sharing our voice and sharing our culture and our diversity.\u201d```"}

We\u2019re even coordinating with UCLA on April 24 for a Joint Armenian Students\u2019 Association Candlelight Vigil, at UCLA.\n\nKarapetian has big hopes for this month and expects it to be a success. Based on past smaller events that USC has hosted, Karapetian: Any Trojan or anyone in the larger community who has engaged with any of the programming we\u2019re putting on has something meaningful to say like I had no idea Armenian history spent several 1000 years I had no idea Armenian food was so fantastic. I had no idea, the music and dance was so moving, if Trojans and larger community members have meaningful engagements with any aspect of Armenian culture or heritage, food, history, music, dance language. That\u2019s a, you know, pretty phenomenal thing.\n\nKarapetian says the Dornsife Institute of Armenian Studies eagerly anticipates the participation of the community to make the first Armenian History Month at USC a memorable and meaningful experience for all.

Gordon Stables directs the school of journalism and offered them the glass trophy. Gordon Stables: \u201cWe\u2019d now like to present you with the 2023-2024 Selden Ring award for investigative reporting.\u201d The Dean of the Journalism school, Willow Bay, explained the history of the award. Dean Bay: \u201cIt was established by Selden Ring, a Southern California business leader and philanthropist, to recognize the importance and the value of rigorous investigative journalism to our society and to a vibrant democracy.\u201d\n\nThe series of stories that won this year\u2019s award makes you think that in this country, something\u2019s a little fishy. Maybe it\u2019s the picture of US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on a luxury fishing vacation with a Republican billionaire. This is one of many examples of what the ProPublica team that won this year\u2019s award call \u201cethical violations\u201d surrounding the Supreme Court.\n\nThe reporting team included Justin Elliott, Joshua Kaplan, Brett Murphy, Alex Mierjeski and Kirsten Berg. They worked together to uncover the untold goings on among Supreme Court justices. The team poured over hundreds of documents to understand how, for example, Justice Clarence Thomas accepted numerous gifts and flights from billionaire Harlan Crow.\n\nJoshua Kaplan: \u201cThe main thing we found is that a couple justices, particularly Clarence Thomas had been accepting secret luxury gifts from billionaire political donors.\u201d Joshua Kaplan is one of the reporters. Kaplan: \u201cThomas in particular has accepted a stream of gifts that appears to be unprecedented in the modern history of the court.\u201d\n\nKaplan hopes his teams work will have impact going forward but, he says, accountability would have to change. Kaplan: \u201cI\u2019d like to think that what these stories have done is brought a lot of attention to something that is quite unique about the Supreme Court, which is unlike any other part of the federal government, the justices face virtually zero oversight and accountability.\u201d\n\nKaplan has advice for those looking to break into investigative reporting. Kaplan: \u201cThe great pleasure in it and also the key to kind of making it work, is to always have an open mind and to really put in the work to talk to as many people as you possibly can. And it\u2019s so fun because with every story you are working on a topic that is quite new to you. And you\u2019re talking to people who have lived interesting lives and you\u2019re trying your best to understand their world...The other thing is you have to look around widely and try to stay attuned to when something seems off or when something seems like there could be a bigger story there.\u201d\n\nThis is journalism with an impact. After the series was published, the Supreme Court adopted an ethics code for the first time in its 234-year history. The US Senate held hearings and many Senators pushed for ethics reform. The ProPublica reporting team isn\u2019t sure what their next story will be. But in the United States of America, in 2024, there\u2019s no doubt there\u2019s a lot to cover.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Will Simonds April 01, 2024 at 5:34 pm PDT\n\nThis is far from any normal season for USC lacrosse. It\u2019s a talented squad coming off of a 2023 Pac-12 title that entered with high expectations. But that\u2019s nothing new for head coach Lindsey Munday, whose program has been consistently successful since its inception in 2013. It\u2019s a veteran group of players, which means USC is looking to make the most of their last season together. The Trojans\u2019 top four goalscorers \u2014 plus three other starters \u2014 are all set to graduate this spring.\n\nBut it\u2019s college sports; all teams go through these waves. It\u2019s a farewell tour for the Pac-12, as the team prepares to transition to the Big Ten in 2025. But, again, that\u2019s a common phenomenon not only for many USC teams this year, but also many other schools around the country given the recent surge in conference realignment.\n\nIt\u2019s not common to deal with all of those circumstances on top of not playing at their typical home field. It still hasn\u2019t been enough to rattle the Trojans, though. On Sunday, USC (9-3, 3-0 Pac-12) showed off its ability to handle adversity with a 9-8 comeback win over Cal (4-7, 1-2) at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.\n\nThe Golden Bears dominated the second quarter with five unanswered goals, as the Trojans struggled to gain any possession. Cal had nine draw controls in the first half to USC\u2019s two, fueling the visitors\u2019 early momentum. Still, USC didn\u2019t panic.\n\n\u201cIt was really just sticking to the game plan and trusting each other that we\u2019ll just chip away and, little by little, get back in the game,\u201d Munday said.\n\nWhile senior goalkeeper Kait Devir\u2019s second-half relief effort helped stabilize the Trojans\u2019 defense, senior attacker Shelby Tilton fueled the Trojans\u2019 surge on offense. She scored three of her four goals after halftime, with two of those goals coming in a 10-second span to even the match in the final quarter.\n\n\u201cEven though we dipped in the first half, there was no doubt in my mind that we weren\u2019t going to win that game,\u201d junior defender Lila Murphy said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that can help us moving forward.\u201d\n\nAfter the Trojans played their first five home games of the season at Dignity Health Sports Park, they are closing out their home schedule with a pair of games at the Coliseum, including Sunday\u2019s Easter matchup. USC is currently renovating what will soon be known as Rawlinson Stadium, which will feature upgraded fan accommodations and facilities for the university\u2019s lacrosse and soccer programs. The new and improved stadium is set to open in 2025.\n\nIn the meantime, the Trojans are dealing with some annoying consequences of those future benefits. The team is handling the adjustment to its odd home schedule well; nobody appears to be overly bothered by their unique home environments. If anything, as Dora pointed out, the group is lucky to be playing at the beautiful Coliseum to end the year \u2014 despite the empty, almost eerie game setting.\n\n\u201cWe have really great support from USC Athletics overall to put us up [at the Coliseum] for two games and then to host the Pac-12 tournament later in the year,\u201d junior attacker Maddie Dora, who scored Sunday\u2019s game-winning goal, said. \u201cI think we\u2019re all just really grateful and happy to be here together.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans are trying not to focus on the downsides of their season-long relocation, but it\u2019s hard to imagine that they haven\u2019t been affected at all. USC has already lost twice at \u201chome\u201d this year after not suffering any 2023 losses at McAlister Field, and it nearly lost Sunday to a Cal program that it had beaten 16 straight times.\n\nWith barely any students at games this season \u2014 even superfan Crash Collier (the caution tape guy) wasn\u2019t in attendance for the first five home games \u2014 USC has had to find other ways to develop some sort of a home-field advantage. Brian Ramsay, the father of sophomore attacker Maggie and former Trojan midfielder Katie, has been around the Trojan lacrosse program for several years now. He also praised the athletic department, as well as the other team parents, for working together to add USC signage and branding to bring a more homely feel to Dignity Health Sports Park.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t hard to feel home at a place as synonymous with USC as the Coliseum. Gameday traditions also haven\u2019t been quite the same, but not necessarily in bad ways. On one hand, a pregame walk through the USC Village on the way to McAlister Field was replaced by a 20-minute bus ride to Carson. However, players have gotten to hang out more with their families before games; getting to use the massive football locker room at the Coliseum wasn\u2019t the worst thing, either.\n\n\u201cI think that got the girls really excited,\u201d Dora said. \u201cWe were dancing the entire time and we had a surround sound system. It was honestly a really fun time.\u201d\n\nAll that change has perhaps made this team more resilient in the face of uncomfortable situations, such as the Trojans\u2019 four-goal deficit Sunday. Instead of worrying about the hectic future ahead for the program, players are living in the now.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s a home game, away, Coliseum, Dignity Health, we try to just play the game in front of us in the present moment. I don\u2019t think we really focus on our surroundings,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to go through it together.\u201d\n\nInstead, it\u2019s the prospect of losing seniors and leaving the Pac-12 that\u2019s driving the team forward, Murphy added. And when every game is away from your real home, actual road games aren\u2019t quite as hard, especially when embarking on long trips to the East Coast in nonconference play.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve traveled so much and we\u2019re so used to being able to adjust to a lot of different adversities when it comes to traveling and playing in different areas,\u201d Dora said.\n\nUSC will travel north this weekend to face Oregon on Saturday in Eugene, as the Trojans seek to maintain their momentum from their Easter resurrection.\n```"}

Pec blasted a one-touch shot that came off the hands of Seattle\u2019s goalkeeper Stefan Frei. This was Pec\u2019s first MLS career goal and Paintsill\u2019s second assist of the season. Both Pec and Paintsill were brought in the latest winter\u2019s transfer window for high fees to be in LA\u2019s starting XI. Pec was Galaxy\u2019s club-record transfer fee worth $10 million and Paintsil\u2019s fee was worth around $9 million. Pec, Paintsil, and ex-Barcelona player Riqui Ruig count as Galaxy\u2019s designated players. MLS clubs are only allowed to have 3 DPs.\n\nThe crowd was roaring from the jump even with not-so-favorable weather conditions. The rain started to pour heavily midway through the second half. LA Galaxy fan Jeremy Barahona said this year\u2019s squad is different from previous years. \u201cIt was my first time being in the rain as a Galaxy fan but the atmosphere got way better since last year,\u201d Barahona said. \u201cI went to a game last year and (it was) way better man, way better players. I love it 10 out of 10.\u201d\n\nDuring the first half center-back Martin Caceres suffered a thigh injury and had to be substituted for Salvadoran national team player Eriq Zavaleta. Caceres was able to walk off the pitch under his power, showing that the injury wasn\u2019t too serious.\n\nThe first half ended with the Seattle Sounders not being able to exert much success. The Sounders also didn\u2019t fare much better in the second half. The visitors shot 16 times but only managed to have 2 on target while Galaxy took their chance and scored with only 2 shots. Sounders also had more possession with 54% compared to Galaxy\u2019s 46%.\n\nGalaxy Goalkeeper Jon McCarthy had 3 saves including a crucial save in the 65th minute by Sounders striker Danny Musovski. But not all fans were excited with this win. LA Galaxy fan Marcos Del Agua said this wasn\u2019t a clean game by Galaxy. \u201cWe won but we played pretty sloppy, should have been 1-1 or 2-1. We didn\u2019t have possession of the ball too much, but I\u2019ll take the win and the three points,\u201d Del Agua said. \u201cThe key was trying not to fall down (the rain) and seeing everyone slipping and falling I was like damn.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Los Galacticos stand in 1st place in the Western Conference with a game lead on the Vancouver Whitecaps and tied with Cincinnati for the best record in the league. Galaxy hasn\u2019t seen this level of success since 2014 when they managed to lift the MLS Cup and had U.S. men\u2019s national team legend Landon Donovan. The last time the Galaxy made the playoffs was in 2022 but weren\u2019t able to move past the Conference Semifinals.\n\n\u201cThe plays, the chemistry, the passing, and the communication were all key,\u201d Barahona said. Galaxy\u2019s next game is the \u201cEl Trafico\u201d derby against LAFC at BMO Stadium on Sat, Apr. 6. kickoff at 4:40 p.m.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan April 01, 2024 at 11:26 am PDT\n\nAfter leading USC men\u2019s basketball for over a decade, head coach Andy Enfield will leave Los Angeles for Southern Methodist University, who hired Enfield Monday to serve in the same role for the Mustangs. Enfield departs Los Angeles exactly 11 years after he took over the program, after experiencing a down year in 2023-24. The Trojans finished tied for ninth in the Pac-12 with an 8-12 conference record and a 15-18 overall record, having entered the 2023-24 season with high expectations following the recruitment of Bronny James and the No. 2 prospect in the class of 2023, Isaiah Collier. Enfield also retained high-level college veterans Boogie Ellis and Kobe Johnson from the squads that played in March Madness in 2021-22 and 2022-23.\n\nSMU, on the other hand, seems like an ascendant program where Enfield can create a legacy as he did at USC and Florida Gulf Coast, where his \u201cDunk City\u201d team became the first No. 15 seed to ever play in the NCAA Tournament\u2019s Sweet 16. Due to the conference realignment arms race that broke out following the Pac-12\u2032s dissolution, SMU will join the Atlantic Coast Conference for the 2024-25 season alongside Cal and Stanford, where the Mustangs will play against college basketball \u201cblue bloods\u201d Duke and North Carolina. As recently as 2022-23, SMU lingered around the bottom of the American Athletic Conference. But under now-former head coach Rob Lanier, SMU improved to an 11-7 AAC record in 2023-24 \u2014 good enough to tie for fifth place \u2014 and ended their season with a first-round loss to Indiana State in the National Invitation Tournament, the second-tier postseason competition.\n\nHad Enfield stayed at USC, he would\u2019ve faced a serious roster rebuilding job. Ellis exhausted his collegiate eligibility in 2023-24, Collier will likely declare for the 2024 NBA Draft as a potential lottery selection and  Johnson announced on March 22 that he would both enter the transfer portal and test the draft waters himself , leaving at least three major holes in the Trojans\u2019 roster. Enfield will end his USC tenure as one of the program\u2019s greatest-ever coaches. The Pennsylvania native and former Johns Hopkins standout took over the men\u2019s basketball team when they were a middling Pac-12 program and brought the Trojans back to the NCAA Tournament by his third season.\n\nIn a statement on his departure, USC athletic director Jennifer Cohen thanked Enfield for helping to raise USC\u2019s level in men\u2019s basketball. \u201cHe elevated and established USC Men\u2019s Basketball as a premier program with a strong national presence,\u201d Cohen said. She also announced that her department had begun the search for a new head coach. \u201cWe have a track record of competitiveness, passionate supporters and fans, a robust donor collective, and are about to compete in the nation\u2019s premier athletic conference,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThere is no ceiling to what our program can achieve and I look forward to introducing our next head coach.\u201d\n\nEnfield\u2019s teams would go on to earn five March Madness berths, the best result of which came in 2021, when an Evan Mobley-led team crushed the No. 3 seed Kansas Jayhawks 85-51 in the Second Round and the Trojans would go on to make the Elite Eight. USC also achieved its highest ranking in the AP Poll since in the 1974-75 season, when the Trojans climbed as high as No. 5 in January 2022.\n```"}

You try your hardest to get noticed, but no matter what you do, it will amount to nothing more than second place. You can change your look and do an entire rebrand of the clothes that you wear that follow all the latest trends. Then you start investing in new things like a new car, new house, and the most expensive and outrageous jewelry money can buy. To top it all off, you say to yourself, I need to get in with the IT crowd, so you cut ties with almost every single person you have ever known, and attract an entire new set of friends that only seem to be there for the money and fame.\n\nNo matter how hard you try, there is nothing that beats the original. You cannot get the magic that was once created with the first. Nobody ever remembers \u201cThe Next Karate Kid,\u201d or \u201cMean Girls 2.\u201d I bet some of you didn\u2019t even know the latter existed.\n\nIf any of what I wrote sounds a little too close to home, Clippers, that\u2019s probably because it is. For those who are unaware, prior to the entire world shutting down (outside of some counties in Florida), you Clippers were supposed to be the next big thing. Two superstar signings wanted nothing more than to come back to their hometown of Los Angeles, with new tech money from a man who\u2019s net worth at the time was $60 Billion higher than second place on the list of NBA owners. New logos for your squad had just dropped, along with an entirely new set of jerseys, topped off with a brand new state-of-the-art arena that only Ballmer could buy. I\u2019ve also never heard someone promise 1,100 toilets more than championships in my entire life being a sports fan. But I mean hey, whatever will finally get fans to come watch your games.\n\nFinally an image that will be burned into my head for the rest of time, those damn fuzzy dice. I understand it was opening night of the 2019-2020 NBA season and you guys are about to play the much more relevant Los Angeles Lakers with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. But you thought of some silly advertisement with Kawhi driving a vintage car with fuzzy dice hanging from his rearview mirror: \u201cThe New King of L.A.\u201d It\u2019s safe to say you all tried everything in your power to get out of the Lakers shadow, and none of it worked.\n\nRight now, you sit towards the top of the Western Conference, a whopping six games above your big brother in the Los Angeles Lakers, and guess what... not a single person in the world could care. I don\u2019t care how talented the roster is, I don\u2019t care about the historic month of December where you went 11-2, I don\u2019t care about you somehow playing with the combination of James Harden, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard and Russell Westrboook, and I don\u2019t care that one my dear friends Johnathan Martin continuously tries to point out that he was write about this squad from the early part of the season and that you guys would \u201cfigure out how to play together.\u201d\n\nListen, I will give credit where credit is due. Just kidding, I won\u2019t! Because if I had a single US Dollar for everytime I was told your irrelevant franchise were championship contenders, I could buy out Microsoft Man himself for majority ownership of your team.\n\nPersonally I have no idea how you managed to convince Westbrook to come off the bench, and I have no idea how you convinced Harden that there is only one ball and that Kawhi and PG need to have it in their hands more often than him. It also baffles me how even your home games feel like road games, the same disease that plagues the five Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Charger fans around the world. A classic case of I\u2019d-rather-go-to-the-beach-itis that hurts the majority of secondary teams around the city.\n\nNo matter how many players you sign, no matter how many regular season games you win three things will always reign true. Death, taxes, and nobody giving an absolute s**t about the Los Angeles Clippers. (or instead, and an empty Clipper home game.)\n\nRespectfully, you should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nWorst Regards,\nKamyar Moradi\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/31/usc-womens-basketball-to-fight-for-final-four-bid-monday-night-against-uconn/", "response": "```\nUSC women\u2019s basketball to fight for Final Four bid Monday night against UConn\n\nMonday night\u2019s slate of Elite Eight matchups between USC and UConn and the 2023 title rematch between LSU and Iowa are sure to bring record-breaking viewership numbers across the country. For some teams, getting this far in the tournament isn\u2019t new. UConn has been in two Final Fours since redshirt junior guard Paige Bueckers and senior forward Aaliyah Edwards have been in college. Iowa and LSU, of course, were in last year\u2019s Final Four. But for the No. 1-seeded Trojans, they haven\u2019t made it this far in the tournament since 1994.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s daunting going up against an 11-time national champion in UConn, USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb is \u201cthoroughly confident\u201d in her team\u2019s readiness for the moment. \u201cWe\u2019re creating our own story, and it doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d Gottlieb said during Sunday\u2019s media availability. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to combine that joy for the game and gratitude to still be playing with an urgency and a toughness that you need to win in March.\u201d\n\nGottlieb also credited the tough Pac-12 schedule with helping prepare her squad, saying some of those conference games over the past two months have felt like NCAA Tournament games. This may be USC and UConn\u2019s first meeting since Gottlieb took over as head coach in 2021, but it\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s ever met UConn head coach Geno Auriemma. In fact, the two met initially back when Gottlieb was in high school and Auriemma was recruiting her best friend, Hilary Heieck (ne\u00e9 Howard). She ultimately chose Duke over UConn, but Gottlieb had a behind-the-scenes look into UConn women\u2019s basketball for a brief moment in the mid-90s.\n\n\u201cGeno welcomed us into what they were doing,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI felt like I had a front row seat to that explosion of women\u2019s college basketball.\u201d\n\nBut despite their coaches\u2019 history, how do these storied programs match up against each other in the Elite Eight? Two major storylines emerge when asking this question. First, it\u2019s the height difference. Second, it\u2019s the depth of the bench.\n\nOf the players that traditionally see minutes for USC, nearly all of them are 6-foot or taller. USC\u2019s two junior centers, 6-foot-4 Rayah Marshall and 6-foot-6 Clarice Akunwafo, have led the charge all season for the Trojans. UConn\u2019s two main bigs are just 6-foot-3 (Edwards and redshirt freshman forward Ice Brady). Otherwise, most of its other consistent players are 6-foot or shorter.\n\n\u201cThey have size at every position, honestly. Their guards are tall, their posts are tall, so it\u2019ll be a challenge,\u201d Bueckers said. Bueckers also said rebounding and defending as a team will be crucial if the Huskies want a chance to take down a No. 1 seed to advance to the Final Four.\n\nUConn has struggled the entire season with the depth of its bench, with three of its top shooters and its two backup bigs out with season-ending injuries. That leaves the Huskies with just nine available players \u2014 seven of whom Auriemma puts in on a regular basis. In Saturday\u2019s Sweet 16 matchup against No. 7-seeded Duke, the Huskies only played one bench player. Three of UConn\u2019s players played 40 minutes on Saturday, including Bueckers, freshman guard KK Arnold and senior guard Nika M\u00fchl. Edwards would have played more than her 29 minutes, but she picked up her fourth foul halfway through the third quarter and had to sit for 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cThere is no way to mitigate it; it is what it is,\u201d Auriemma said. \u201cThis is what we\u2019ve got. This is how we got here. This is how it\u2019s going to be, for better or worse. Luckily, there\u2019s a day in between games.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish there was another way, but sometimes you find a lot of strength in this situation,\u201d he continued.\n\nUSC, on the other hand, has a deeper, healthier bench. Against No. 5-seeded Baylor on Saturday, USC played eight total players. Other than freshman guard JuJu Watkins with 39 minutes, none of its other starters played more than 36 minutes.\n\nDespite all of the hardships that UConn has faced and its inferior seed to USC, the Huskies are still 3.5-point favorites against the Trojans, according to BetMGM and FanDuel.\n\n\u201cIf you look at our team, you can definitely say that we\u2019re the underdogs, but our mindset going into the game is that we\u2019re going to play like we do each and every game,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cI just think we can\u2019t get too caught up in the rankings.\u201d\n\nUSC and UConn tip off at 6:15 PT Monday at Moda Center in Portland, Oregon, while LSU and Iowa tip off at 4:15 PT at MVP Arena in Albany, New York. Winners advance to the Final Four.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a great day for women\u2019s college basketball tomorrow,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n```"}

(Photo by Kim Ly)\n\nBy Sammie Yen\nMarch 31, 2024 at 11:12 am PDT\n\nSaturday evening, No. 11 USC men\u2019s volleyball (11-11, 2-6 MPSF) fell in four sets (25-15, 20-25, 27-25, 25-19) to the No. 8 Pepperdine Waves (16-7, 4-5). While the Waves sent USC ashore, it was by no means smooth sailing for either team. The Trojans\u2019 match was characterized by various mistakes at the net, resulting in a total of eight blocking errors.\n\n\u201cWe made a lot of mental errors,\u201d senior middle blocker Kyle Paulson said. \u201cThat got into our heads.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Trojans notched two early kills in the first set from redshirt sophomore middle blocker Teddy Terrill and sophomore outside hitter Riley Haine, the Waves weathered through their early deficit, steadily controlling each possession. However, Pepperdine\u2019s deafening comeback was punctuated with a few spectacular Trojan sequences. Sophomore outside hitter Dillon Klein rolled one over the Waves to cut USC\u2019s deficit to 23-14, and redshirt freshman outside hitter Noah Roberts contributed a couple of kills. Ultimately, the Waves swam away with the first match 25-15 with a solid .421 hitting percentage to USC\u2019s .045.\n\n\u201cIn game one, they came out firing. But I was stoked to see us come back in game two and say, \u2018Our time,\u2019\u201d USC head coach Jeff Nygaard said.\n\nThe Trojans found a groove in the second set, never giving the lead away. Leading the offensive charge were Klein and Roberts, who traded kill for kill and achieved hitting percentages well above .500. The Trojans took the set 25-20.\n\nIt was a block party in the third set with Trojan doubles and triples. Paulson was a defensive powerhouse, rejecting the Waves four times in the third match alone. USC diligently clawed back from a 20-15 deficit, as Klein hammered home unanswerable kills. A triple block by Paulson, Haine and freshman setter Caleb Blanchette kept the Trojans in the game. Back-and-forth rallies sent the third match well past a deuce score of 24-24, but Pepperdine reached that two-point edge first.\n\n\u201cWe had a couple of opportunities to get the game,\u201d Nygaard noted. \u201cThat\u2019s what this journey has been with these guys \u2014 of getting those one or two critical points when they matter.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans fought in the fourth set, even coming as close as one point from a kill by Terrill. Roberts also soared through the air to round out the game with a career-high 10 kills. USC\u2019s effort wasn\u2019t enough to turn the tide, and Pepperdine clinched the fourth set.\n\nNygaard mentioned the game could have belonged to the Trojans if the team had \u201ca more precise dig, a more set, a better transition. I wish it wasn\u2019t the theme, but that\u2019s been the theme for us \u2013 we\u2019ve got to convert those critical moments,\u201d he said.\n\nUSC looks to bounce back against the BYU Cougars on Friday, followed by Saturday\u2019s Senior night. Both matches at Galen Center are set for 7 p.m.\n```"}

USC baseball takes two against Beavers\n\nThe Trojans \u2018swept\u2019 No. 2 Oregon State through two games, third game gets rained out.\n\nGraduate pitcher Jared Feikes potentially cemented his spot in the rotation against Oregon State, tossing four innings of one-run ball. (Photo by Eric Park)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson March 31, 2024 at 8:39 am PDT\n\nHead coach Andy Stankiewicz\u2019s squad, on paper, seemed outmatched this weekend. His USC baseball team was six games under .500, facing off against D1Baseball\u2019s No. 2 team in the country. The Trojans were playing at their third \u201chome\u201d ballpark of the season. The odds were against them.\n\nBut paper means very little in baseball, as USC (11-15, 6-5 Pac-12) took the first two games against the Oregon State Beavers (21-4, 5-3) in what was supposed to be a three-game set, if not for a Saturday rainout at UC Irvine\u2019s Cicerone Field.\n\nThe Trojans displayed their ability to win a 2-1 pitcher\u2019s duel Thursday night, but then come back the next day and bat their way to a 17-4 win.\n\nWhile USC has consistently been able to perform during junior pitcher Caden Aoki\u2019s starts as of late, it has been a different story for the team\u2019s other starting pitchers. In their last three Pac-12 series, the Trojans have a 3-0 record with Aoki \u2014 who has mustered a 1.50 ERA in those starts \u2014 on the mound, but a 2-3 mark with other starters on the bump during weekend games.\n\nGraduate pitcher Jared Feikes \u2014 who moved up to pitch the second game of the series for his second start of the season \u2014 was much more effective than in his first start, tossing four innings and only giving up one earned run.\n\nIt was a \u201chere we go again\u201d moment for Feikes, as he gave up a leadoff home run to Oregon State\u2019s junior infielder Travis Bazzana, who has now slugged a ridiculous five leadoff homers in the last six games. Feikes quickly regained control and seemed to improve as he went along, sitting down the final six batters he faced.\n\nThe graduate pitcher\u2019s move up in the rotation is just one in a series of changes Stankiewicz has made to his squad\u2019s pitching staff. Junior pitcher William Watson \u2014 a transfer from San Joaquin Delta College this past offseason \u2014 and his 2.35 ERA were slated to start on the mound in Saturday\u2019s matchup before it was rained out.\n\nAoki is the only weekend starter from the Trojans\u2019 opening three games who remains in that role. Senior pitcher Tyler Stromsborg and redshirt sophomore pitcher Eric Hammond \u2014 the two Feikes and Watson replaced \u2014 had combined for a 7.68 ERA heading into this weekend.\n\nThe Trojan bats did exactly what USC needed them to do, given who was on the mound for the team. With how exceptional Aoki has been on the mound as of late, the junior pitcher only needed the two runs of support he garnered.\n\n\u201cAnytime you\u2019ve got Caden Aoki on the bump, you feel good throughout the game,\u201d freshman outfielder Brayden Dowd said in an interview with USC Athletics after Thursday\u2019s win. \u201cWe all felt confident in where we were. Obviously, the bats weren\u2019t as hot ... but we felt really good with where we were. Energy in the dugout was really good.\u201d\n\nThe run support came courtesy of a fourth-inning homer from sophomore infielder Ethan Hedges \u2014 his first round tripper all season and his third extra-base hit in five games \u2014 and the continuation of Dowd\u2019s breakthrough.\n\nThe youth movement on offense continued in the ninth inning, as Dowd came up to the plate with one out and two men on after sophomore outfielder Austin Overn and sophomore catcher Jacob Galloway were hit by pitches, in that order. Dowd drove in the winning run on a walk-off single, as Overn trotted home while the Trojan dugout sprinted out to celebrate the biggest hit of the freshman\u2019s career thus far.\n\nThe winning hit came off of the Beavers\u2019 sophomore pitcher Kellan Oakes, who came into the game with six scoreless outings in seven chances.\n\n\u201cI was just mentally preparing for an opportunity like that,\u201d Dowd said. \u201cAnytime you\u2019re playing a really good team like Oregon State, you\u2019ve just gotta do what\u2019s best for the team.\u201d\n\nIt could not have been a more different story in the Friday matchup, with USC putting up 17 runs compared to the two runs the day prior. Every Trojan in the lineup reached base, as five batters recorded multi-hit or multi-walk games. All five of them also had multi-run games, as USC did not struggle to drive in runners on base, only leaving four on the basepaths throughout the entire game.\n\nWith their 10-run fifth inning \u2014 the most the Trojans have scored in a single frame since 2018 \u2014 they put the game out of reach for the No. 2 Beavers.\n\nNow that USC has proven it can win through strong pitching, timely hitting or just putting up a boatload of runs, the next task is to put it all together. While they had a similar 13-run margin in their opening game last weekend to UCLA, the Trojans followed that up with two straight losses to their rivals.\n\nBut USC \u2014 with a midweek win over Fresno State on Tuesday \u2014 is winners of three straight and has proven its mettle against the top of the Pac-12.\n\nInconsistency has plagued the Trojans all season, but if they can finally break that trend with Stankiewicz making necessary changes to the pitching staff, USC can be a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe Trojans will look to keep the good times rolling with two midweeks before hosting the Washington Huskies for a weekend series at Orange County Great Park.\n```"}

The Trojans defeated the Bears 74-70 Saturday in the Sweet Sixteen round of the NCAA tournament in Portland, Oregon. (Photo courtesy of Bryce Dechert for The Daily Trojan)\n\nBy Terence Holton March 30, 2024 at 8:47 pm PDT\n\nIn what can be only described as a thrilling back-and-forth matchup between the No. 1 seeded Trojans and No. 5 seeded Baylor, USC came out on top 74-70 in Portland, Oregon, and kept its national championship hopes alive. After one quarter of play, neither side showed many signs of budging, as the Trojans led 18-16. Freshman guard JuJu Watkins and graduate guard McKenzie Forbes scored 15 of USC\u2019s first-quarter points.\n\nWatkins has impressed fans nationwide; however, she spoke about how important Forbes has been to this team\u2019s success. \u201cShe\u2019s like Yoda,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cShe\u2019s always just encouraging me and really speaking to me in times when I need it during the games. She\u2019s just a great leader, and I\u2019m just glad to have that type of leadership my first year.\u201d\n\nWhile Forbes\u2019 leadership is instrumental for the Trojans\u2019 success, head coach Lindsey Gottlieb discussed how important Watkins\u2019 ability to draw defenders is for USC\u2019s offense to work smoothly. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable what she handles. You cannot put one person on her; she will score. You can\u2019t really put two; you have to show a lot of bodies,\u201d Gottlieb said. \" I think what\u2019s evolved [for Watkins] is seeing the court and understanding where she needs to get the ball and what reads she can make out of that.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans went down quickly to a fast-firing Bears offense. However, with well-constructed defense and a more creative offensive scheme\u2014including a Forbes running deep three\u2014 the Trojans willed themselves to the lead. The end to the first half was not much different than the first quarter of play, as the Trojans took as large a lead as 11 with a bit of beautiful passing. However, as they say, basketball is a game of runs, and this proved to be correct, as Baylor out-scored the Trojans 7-2 to close out the quarter. Meanwhile, USC missed six of its last seven shots. Nonetheless, USC led 37-31 to close out the first half, with Watkins leading all scorers with 15. Marshall was commanding the boards with 11 rebounds.\n\nThe Bears picked up right where they left off at the end of the first half, as USC\u2019s lead grew slimmer by the minute. At the media timeout with 2:53 remaining in the third, Baylor had taken its first lead since the middle of the first quarter, 50-49. Baylor had all the momentum by the end of the quarter, ending the final minute on a 7-0 run, going up 57-53 and out-scoring the Trojans 26-16 in the period.\n\nThe fourth quarter was filled with fireworks and drama, as neither team showed signs of giving an edge to the other. The game came down to the final minute, where USC held a slim lead over Baylor. However, the Bears just kept clawing back. Watkins was the X-Factor in the fourth quarter, as she was perfect from the free throw line, going 7-for-7. \u201cShe\u2019s just a competitor; I would trust her with my life,\u201d Marshall said in a joking manner. \u201cShe\u2019s coming into the huddle after the third quarter fired up saying, \u2018Let\u2019s get our shit together.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Trojans held a four-point lead with 23 seconds to play, but Baylor senior guard Sarah Andrews was not going down without a fight, as she banked in a wing 3-pointer to cut the Trojans\u2019 lead to one. Gottlieb said her team kept itself calm when the game was coming down to the wire. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a lot of close games and close situations, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m coaching poise. It was less coaching their mentality and more trying to coach the situation.\u201d\n\nIn the end, with clutch free throws from Watkins and Marshall, the Trojans got the win and are still dancing through March into the Elite Eight. USC takes on No. 3 UConn on Monday, April 1. Time is TBD.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/30/ados-wish-tour-a-shot-of-adrenaline-from-an-faceless-voice/", "response": "```\nAdo\u2019s \u2018Wish\u2019 tour: A shot of adrenaline from a faceless voice\n\nMysterious Japanese singer Ado arrived in L.A. for her \u201cWish\u201d tour. Her powerful voice echoed in a night of high-octane music.\n\nL.A. Live was crowded to the brim, with little to no empty space in the plaza outside Peacock Theater. Decked out in shirts and hoodies featuring anime-style artwork of a girl with black hair stained in blue, excited fans awaited the performance of a rather unconventional artist: Ado. The 21-year-old Japanese singer has been on the rise since her debut in 2020, but what makes her unique is simple; she has a secret identity.\n\nOn Friday, Ado arrived in Los Angeles on the second to last stop on her first world tour, \u201cWish.\u201d From Taipei to Jakarta to London to New York, the artist embarked on her first journey out of Japan.\n\nAdo got her start when she was a teenager as an utaite: a singer mostly publishing covers of songs on sites like Niconico and YouTube. However, she would make her big break with her single, \u201cUsseewa,\u201d a loud, brash and aggressive song questioning society, that would later chart 41 on Billboard\u2019s Global 200.\n\nAdo made her mark beyond solo work, such as collaborating with K-pop group LE SSERAFIM, singing the opening theme for video game \u201cLost Judgment,\u201d and having her music featured in rhythm games like Wacca and \u201cHatsune Miku: Colorful Stage!\u201d She even got to be a part of one of the longest-running anime series of all time: \u201cOne Piece.\u201d Ado worked on the 2022 film, \u201cOne Piece Film: Red\u201d as the singing voice of the character Uta, where she released an original album to be featured on the film\u2019s soundtrack.\n\nMuch of her claim to fame is her anonymity, with her visual identity primarily being in the form of various artistic avatars. Now, her dark, raspy voice has reached audiences globally, as evidenced by a sold out Peacock Theater.\n\nAs the stage dimmed, the crowd screamed with their blue light sticks glowing in the dark auditorium. On stage, a cube stood in the center flanked by a guitarist, a bassist, a drummer and a keyboardist. It shone blue as the music began, and a figure obscured by a spinning parasol walked onstage into the box.\n\nAs the projections on the cube turned off, the silhouette of a woman with long hair, a draping coat and a pair of high heeled boots stood behind the bars of the mechanical cage.\n\nThe screen behind Ado turned bright, as she opened with her upbeat song \u201cNew Genesis,\u201d as featured in \u201cOne Piece Film: Red.\u201d Ado danced in her box, with her movement being accentuated by the lack of visual clarity. Her silhouette bounced as her voice pierced even the loudest cheers from the crowd.\n\nAfter wrapping up the first song, she immediately switched characters, shifting into \u201cUsseewa\u201d with the screens turning red and blue. Ado\u2019s roaring voice evoked a sense of anger and madness as she began screaming the lyrics. The concert was like a non-stop shot of adrenaline. Songs would play back-to-back with only brief moments of rest in between, many of them embodying Ado\u2019s uniquely aggressive sensibilities set to a mixture of musical style.\n\nWith elements of pop, jazz, EDM and hip-hop all set to a voice that belongs in heavy metal, Ado\u2019s music pushed fans to their feet, jumping, screaming and waving their color-changing light sticks to the beat.\n\nThe set list included a plethora of music ranging from the tone of demented childhood heard in \u201cAishite Aishite Aishite,\u201d to the dark menace of \u201cTot Musica,\u201d to a few joyous and triumphant melodies like \u201cI\u2019m invincible.\u201d Through it all, Ado\u2019s silhouette strutted around the cage, kicking, flipping her jacket, laying on the ground, like a mime trapped in a visible box.\n\nAt one moment, the screen projected a record player, as a familiar riff came on. Fans screamed to the tune, as Ado returned to her roots as a cover artist for her rendition of Miki Matsubara\u2019s iconic city pop song \u201cStay With Me.\u201d The song was a moment for fans to catch their breath after a heavy setlist full of high-energy and furious intensity. They bobbed their heads and sang along to the lyrics while waving their blue and pink light sticks.\n\nOnce the song was finished, Ado spoke her first words to the audience. \u201cHello everyone!\u201d she exclaimed. She thanked the audience in English. \u201cTo be honest, I was worried at first,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is so good to see you are having a good time.\u201d\n\nFor the last song on the setlist, she sang \u201cShow.\u201d In front of a screen featuring dancing zombies, Ado demonstrated her vocal range, from dark raspiness to operatics to high-pitched voice cracks. With a final \u201cShout it out!,\u201d Ado took a bow and the stage went dark.\n\nWhile the band took their leave, fans continued to cheer. For minutes, they called for an encore, and Ado delivered. Re-emerging from behind the box\u2019s projection, Ado sang another batch of songs, including the high-octane \u201cFREEDOM\u201d and her cover of Vocaloid song \u201cSenbonzakura.\u201d\n\nAs she finished her performance, she spoke one last time to the audience. \u201cThis is my passion and I hope to share it with as many people as possible,\u201d she said in English. \u201cThank you so much from the bottom of my heart.\u201d She closed the night with the fan favorite \u201cOdo,\u201d albeit trading out its usual EDM melody with sounds of heavy bass and hard rock.\n\nFans jumped up and down, and as the song came to an end, Ado\u2019s silhouette posed in front of a flashing red screen, waving goodbye to the audience. A digital avatar took her place projected on the box before quickly vanishing.\n\nFans line up to take a picture of an Ado \"Wish\" tour poster after the concert.\n\nIn some ways, it may seem like she sings like a caged bird. However, for Ado, her voice has become her identity, and a greater freedom has been found in allowing those booming melodies to reach the ears of an audience unconstrained by the limits of the eye. To fans, Ado is \u201cseen\u201d as many things: an animated girl with a long coat and a piercing gaze or even an idol with white and red hair from a world of pirates. But regardless of that perception, the one \u201ctrue\u201d Ado is the one that can only be heard.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nBy Katie Simons March 30, 2024 at 2:01 pm PDT\n\nThis week, Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s team stopped the distribution of Plan B and similar contraceptive supplies at concerts. The National Network of Abortion Funds, who ran tables handing out the products, told Jezebel that Rodrigo\u2019s team stopped the distribution because \u201cthe items would be too accessible to young girls in attendance.\u201d This decision came after public pressure over a viral Tweet from Rodrigo\u2019s stop in St. Louis where Plan B was distributed with handouts saying \u201cFunding abortion? It\u2019s a good idea, right?\u201d\n\nAs the father of a daughter, I am horrified by this. Olivia Rodrigo passed out an abortifacient at her concert in St. Louis last night. This was sponsored by the \u201cMissouri Abortion Fund.\u201d Many of her fans are CHILDREN. Abortion hurts women. Physical damage of course, but also...\n\nThis outrage comes out of a growing conversation about who the correct audience for Rodrigo\u2019s shows is. Rodrigo\u2019s performances in the \u201cGUTS World Tour\u201d mirror the content of the album. While some songs are done as solo piano ballads, many of the numbers, like \u201cObsessed\u201d and \u201cBad Idea Right?\u201d are playfully sexual and provocative. The new nature of her performances, along with the distribution of contraceptives, has launched hundreds of TikTok and Tweets about whether the former Disney darling\u2019s shows are too inappropriate for young fans.\n\nYet to me, these debates ignore a simple fact: as a musician, Rodrigo has never censored her artistry for public appeal. Not since she was 13 years old and sang about blobfishes and bad comebacks in her Disney Channel show \u201cBizaardvark\u201d has her music been \u201cfamily friendly.\u201d To demand her concert be more appropriate fundamentally contradicts what made Rodrigo famous: her authentic voice.\n\nThe songs off \u201cGUTS\u201d are more sexual because Rodrigo is an adult now, as opposed to \u201cSOUR,\u201d which she wrote as a teen. Rodrigo\u2019s opinions on the intersection between abortion access and concerts have been clear since she dedicated a cover of Lily Allen\u2019s \u201cFuck You\u201d to the U.S. Supreme Court Justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. The \u201cprovocative\u201d dance moves or \u201cmore revealing\u201d costumes speak to the tone and language of her songs. After all, what did we think lyrics like \u201cI tripped and fell into his bed,\u201d were referring to?\n\nAn artist having a specific audience is not a bad thing. Just as we didn\u2019t pan Taylor Swift for singing about serious relationships with songs like \u201cPaper Rings\u201d or Adele for singing about divorce, we can\u2019t expect Rodrigo to censor her life experiences to better suit certain listeners. Like the case with many child stars, the public still sees Rodrigo as the 17-year-old who rose to fame while on a Disney show. The perception of Rodrigo is frozen \u2014 she is still seen as the naive, codependent and overly sweet Nini Salazar-Roberts from \u201cHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series\u201d (HSMTMTS).\n\nYet even when Rodrigo was on the show, she worked to push back against the Disney image. \u201cHSMTMTS\u201d was an experimental show for Disney. With its Disney+ streaming-exclusive launch, the show was angled more towards teens than children. Rodrigo doubled down on this separation, choosing to sign her record deal with Interscope/Geffen, independent of Disney. Then in her debut single, \u201cdrivers license,\u201d Rodrigo openly swore, marking a clear departure from overtly child-friendly content.\n\nNow three years later, Rodrigo continues to be stuck in a debate she\u2019s actively worked to make her opinion clear on. Ultimately, Rodrigo is successful because of her genuine descriptions of the emotional intensity that is tied to being a young adult. The constant relatability I\u2019ve found through Rodrigo\u2019s music is what has made her my favorite artist.\n\nIn 2019, I fawned over Nini Salazar-Roberts when \u201cHSMTMTS\u201d premiered on Disney+. For those nine weeks that the series aired in my sophomore year of high school, I rushed home after school to watch Rodrigo in her latest episode. I found myself particularly attached to her song \u201cAll I Want,\u201d which was written by Rodrigo, but performed as her character. As a sweet, and somewhat naive, 15-year-old, I too just wanted a \u201clove that lasts.\u201d\n\nA year later, I stayed up until midnight when \u201cdrivers license\u201d came out. I played it so much those first two days, I nearly drove my sister to the brink. In those first days after the explosion of \u201cdrivers license,\u201d there was a sense of shock that Rodrigo openly swore in the song. I couldn\u2019t seem to wrap my head around the drama. She was 17 when the song came out. As a 16-year-old, everything she said felt perfectly reasonable to me. She was heartbroken about a messy relationship that ended terribly, and I could only imagine myself reacting the same way.\n\nWhen \u201cSOUR\u201d debuted a week after my first boyfriend and I broke up, I cried to the album nearly every day for a month. In my high school newspaper review of the album, I wrote \u201cIn \u2018SOUR,\u2019 it feels as though Rodrigo is painting a portrait of the emotions of the modern teen, with lyrics that are both poised and accurate. It is almost as if she is mirroring my very own life.\u201d\n\nThat is the crux of Rodrigo\u2019s artistry: she mirrored my life as a teenager because Rodrigo herself was a teenager. While themes in music can be universal, the \u201cSOUR\u201d album was specifically about the pain and drama of adolescence. Take the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cbrutal,\u201d where Rodrigo sings how \u201cI\u2019m sick of 17/Where\u2019s my fucking teenage dream?\u201d and \u201cI hate the way I\u2019m perceived/I only have two real friends/And lately, I\u2019m a nervous wreck.\u201d The lyrics are angry and messy and honest.\n\nWhen I couldn\u2019t explain to my mom why my anxiety was getting so bad there were days I couldn\u2019t handle being at school for the full day, I played her this song and something clicked. The two-minute and 25-second long song that Rodrigo wrote in one day became a song that was able to explain my own emotions better than I could.\n\nBy requiring Rodrigo to be universally palpable and apolitical, Rodrigo\u2019s music and performance lose its value. If Rodrigo\u2019s songs talk about sex, her fans should be old enough to understand what contraceptives are. Ultimately, the best parts of Rodrigo\u2019s music \u2014 passion and emotion \u2014 are erased when she is forced into an archetype that she never asked to be.\n```"}

(Photo by Mika Panahon)\n\nBy Mika Panahon March 30, 2024 at 1:46 pm PDT\n\nA 150-foot-tall mural featuring baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani was officially unveiled in Little Tokyo Wednesday morning, a day before the Dodgers\u2019 home opener game. Ohtani signed with the LA Dodgers just a few months ago with a whopping $700 million contract, the largest sports contract in history. Native Angeleno Robert Vargas designed and painted the mural which showcased Ohtani\u2019s two-way talents as a batter and pitcher. As an artist honored by the city of Los Angeles, Vargas is known for painting murals of LA icons, such as Kobe Bryant, that can be found throughout Downtown LA.\n\nOn the days leading up to the event, the Boyle Heights artist encouraged fans to watch him complete the mural, painting every day from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.\n\nMuralist Robert Vargas speaks to the crowd before the reveal. (Photo by Mika Panahon)\n\nThe mural scales the side of the Miyako Hotel, beside the Japanese Village Plaza. Ohtani shares a connection with the Japanese American district, as he hails from Japan. Though Ohtani\u2019s LA debut would come the next day, the large turnout for the unveiling was proof that fans were ready to support Ohtani in his new journey as a Dodger. This homage also comes days after Ohtani fired his interpreter who was involved in a theft and sports gambling scandal. Nevertheless, both the Japanese community and Dodger fans alike joined in the festivities on Wednesday.\n\nThis was a union that was particularly special to Vargas. \u201cWe\u2019re team LA and looking at everybody here, I see the whole country of Japan rooting for Shohei,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cWe\u2019re all Angelenos rooting for Shohei. That nation and Dodger Nation are all on the same team.\u201d\n\nPerformers played taiko drums for the crowd as they waited for the mural, which had been covered with a blue tarp for most of the morning. Lowriders, a staple of LA Chicano culture, were displayed for attendees to admire. The cars were featured along East 1st Street, which closed for the event.\n\nA Dodgers-themed lowrider is displayed among a row of the iconic cars.

Local businesses welcomed customers coming from the event for the rest of the day and the Japanese Village Plaza bustled with renewed optimism.\n\nSee the mural, titled \u201cLA Rising,\u201d now up on 328 E 1st St.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)\n\nBy Katie Simons March 29, 2024 at 8:40 pm PDT\n\nEight years ago, Ezra Frech watched in awe as his mentor, Sam Grewe, won a silver medal for high jump at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Paralympics. Frech had competed in plenty of his own track meets, but while watching a fellow above-the-knee amputee on the international podium, inspiration struck. The 11-year-old Frech had an \u201cepiphany\u201d \u2014 he was going to compete in the 2020 Tokyo Paralympic games at 15.\n\n\u201cI was so inspired. I said, \u2018You know what, this is what I want to do with my life.\u2019 So I told everybody I knew,\u201d Frech said. \u201cBut then, sure enough, five years later \u2014 obviously the extra year because the pandemic \u2014 I made that dream happen.\u201d\n\nFrech was born with congenital limb differences, missing his knee, fibula and fingers on his left side. Frech took to sports early, playing soccer, basketball and football. After breaking national youth records at the Endeavor Games when he was 8, Frech began primarily focusing on track.\n\nAt 16, Frech placed fifth in the high jump event and eighth in the long jump event at the 2021 Tokyo Paralympics. Now, as Frech gears up for the Paris Paralympics, he\u2019s given up the typical teen lifestyle in the hopes of winning a gold medal.\n\nWhen his training partner would stop to make a silly TikTok, Frech stepped aside and compulsively took out his massage gun to stretch his calf. While he mentioned having to miss out on a sponsored trip to Coachella because it would interfere with training, giving up the free festival didn\u2019t seem to phase him.\n\nBy delaying college for a year, Frech is able to meticulously plan out each day, fitting in stretching, training, eating, weight lifting, recovery and then 10 to 12 hours of sleep.\n\n\u201cEverything is just focus, laser focus,\u201d Frech\u2019s strength coach, Ariyon Tolbert, said. \u201cI remember one time he had eaten one cookie, and he called me in shambles, like, \u2018Ari, what am I supposed to do? I ate a cookie.\u2019\u201d\n\nEvery uneaten cookie, missed social event and repetitive training cycle pushes Frech closer to achieving his dream day at the Paralympics: he\u2019ll win his gold medal, then celebrate by watching the Eiffel Tower sparkle at 11 p.m. with his family.\n\nEven after Frech won a gold medal in high jump at the 2023 Para Athletics World Championships and set a world record, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about next summer.\n\n\u201cI won that world title, I was walking through the media row, I was having these interviews and in the back of my head, I\u2019m saying, \u2018This doesn\u2019t mean anything if I don\u2019t do it again next year. This is all great, but this doesn\u2019t matter unless I do it again next year.\u2019 So I was sitting there, I was happy. I was proud. I was unbelievably grateful, but I wasn\u2019t content,\u201d Frech said. \u201cI\u2019m not content, I don\u2019t think I ever will be.\u201d\n\nThis mentality permeates all of Frech\u2019s training. The first two hours of his practice are dedicated solely to warming up, from carefully counted-out calf stretches to deep breath yoga. During a rainy Saturday afternoon practice, Frech \u2014 along with fellow Paralympian and training partner Trenten Merrill \u2014 bit their tongues and closed their eyes in pain as they worked out, passing back and forth new stretches and techniques.\n\n\u201cEzra is very driven and motivated,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cHe\u2019s very confident and he\u2019s very goal oriented. It elevates my game. All ships in the sea rise together when you train with Ezra.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of his training for the Paralympics, Frech committed to USC last month. He is the first above-the-knee amputee to commit to a Division-I track and field program.\n\n\u201cI see a beautiful legacy like that [at USC] on the Olympic side and I think, \u2018Now how can we do that on the Paralympic side,\u2019 and this is a step in that direction,\u201d Frech said. \u201cSome of the best athletes in the U.S. competing for our country have come out of the USC track and field program. And I\u2019m excited to put myself in that mix now.\u201d\n\nAnother important aspect of Frech\u2019s commitment to USC came through his hope to help normalize disability. Frech has a booming social media presence with over 141,000 Instagram followers and has co-founded Angel City Sports, a nonprofit that provides adaptive sports opportunities. He believes his presence when competing is paramount to helping the public understand disability.\n\n\u201cAs far as being an example of what\u2019s possible as an amputee, that\u2019s directly aligned with what I hope to do at USC. I hope to, as an above-the-knee amputee, perform for this amazing track program and change perceptions,\u201d Frech said. \u201cI want people to pull up at a track meet, see the kid with one leg out-jumping everybody and go, \u2018What? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile Frech is currently training for Paris, his goals don\u2019t stop when the summer ends. At USC, he\u2019s hoping to be an NCAA champion and an All-American. Once he graduates in 2028, Frech is looking to win what he calls \u201cthe triple crown\u201d at his hometown Paralympics.\n\n\u201cMy plan for LA28 is to win something that I\u2019ve deemed the triple crown, which is a gold in the high jump, a gold in the long jump and a gold in the 100 meter,\u201d Frech said. \u201cNever been done before in the history of the Olympics, Paralympics. Nobody\u2019s won those three \u2014 I plan to win all of those in my hometown ... right after I graduate from USC. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d```"}

A native of Cincinnati, Ohio, Keyyz took a chance and moved to LA back in 2018. Coming from humble beginnings, it wasn\u2019t until she was 16 that she realized she had a passion for making music. More than a vocalist, Keyyz can play the piano and harp, making her a triple threat. Her first project was released back in 2014, a self-titled project, \u201cLove, Keyyz,\u201d a love letter to love. Since then, she has been awarded \u201cBest Female Vocalist\u201d in the Ohio Hip Hop Awards. Shortly after, a video she posted singing an acapella version of Fantasia\u2019s song \u201cRoller Coasters\u201d went viral.\n\nShe is a full-time student at USC, studying popular music at highly competitive Thorton School of Music. And to top it off, she is now a two-time charting independent artist. Keyyz is more than just a student, she is the girl to be watching. Her raw and soulful voice is what grabs her audience\u2019s attention, but it is her heartfelt lyrics that keep people coming back for more. She is often compared to 90s singers for her ability to create that urban soulful sound that we all love. Yet it would be pointless to try and box her music in when she has already shown that she is capable of much more.\n\nHer latest single, \u201cIn My Shoes\u201d, whose music video was just released today, is a testament to that. The song\u2019s use of live instruments and raw vocals felt like a warm hug of rock, gospel, and the perfect pinch of modern R&B. The visuals of the music video add to this hug. The warm and honey-tone aesthetic with pops of street style and clean cuts makes me feel like it\u2019s 2004 again while watching VH1 Soul. The images and story heard in the lyrics are an honest reflection of the day-to-day life of the everyday person just trying to make it. It is no secret that times are hard, and more than ever, we could all use a little motivation to keep pushing because, as Keyyz reminds us, \u201cGod gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Love Keyyz, check out our latest episode of \u201cThe Black View,\u201d where she gave Black. a very intimate and exclusive interview.

However, amidst its male-dominated facade, a silent revolution has been brewing since its beginning \u2013 one led by women, reshaping the very essence of reggaeton.  In a genre filled with subliminally degrading and objectifying lyrics, these women have flipped the patriarchal roles. Here lies a narrative of female resilience, creativity and innovation.\n\n7 - Villano Antillano\nVillano Antillano is a Puerto Rican rapper and singer. She emerged into mainstream reggaeton through her music session with producer Bizzarap. Their \u201cVillano Antillano: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 51,\u201d has over 200 million streams on Spotify and reached No.5 in Spain, becoming the first transgender woman to enter Spotify\u2019s Global Top 50. As an LGBTQ+ icon, Villano was named Them\u2019s 2023 Now Awards honoree in Music, a recognition given to 12 LGBTQ+ people who represent the Queer community in media. In 2018, Villano released a song titled \u201cPato Hasta La Muerte,\u201d a play on words from Anuel\u2019s emblematic \u201cReal Hasta La Muerte\u201d tagline. In this track, Villano called out Anuel for his homophobic and misogynistic lyrics against other women in the genre.\n\n6 - Natti Natasha\nWorking alongside top artists in the genre like Ozuna and Becky G, Natti Natasha produced hits like \u201cSin Pijama\u201d and \u201cCriminal.\u201d Notably, the song \u201cSin Pijama\u201d marked the first time in history two credited women led the list on Airplay\u2019s Latin music chart. Natti Natasha\u2019s rise to fame coincided with a growing movement within the Latin music industry to highlight and uplift female voices. She became a symbol of empowerment for women in music, inspiring a new generation of female artists to pursue their dreams and assert their presence in traditionally male-dominated spaces.\n\n5 - Becky G\nBecky G, full name Rebbeca Marie Gomez, is a prominent Mexican American singer, rapper and actress. Starting her career at a young age with hits like \u201cBecky from the Block\u201d and \u201cShower,\u201d Becky G has become one of the most well-versed artists in the genre at only 27 years old. She first gained popularity within reggaeton and Latin music for her collaboration with Pitbull, \u201cCan\u2019t Get Enough,\u201d establishing herself as one of the only Mexicans and U.S.-born \u201creggaetoneras\u201d to hit mainstream charts. Throughout her time in the spotlight, Becky G has repeatedly been one of the largest Latin artists in the Coachella lineup. She even reached a No.1 spot on Billboard for her collab with Karol G on their song \u201cMami,\u201d an undeniable female anthem. Becky is currently the fifth Latin female artist with the most monthly listeners on Spotify with over 29 million listeners.\n\n4 - Nina Sky\nNina Sky is an American musical duo of twin sisters Natalie and Nicole Albino. They gained fame in the mid-2000s with their hit single \u201cMove Ya Body,\u201d which blended elements of reggaeton, R&B and hip-hop. The song achieved commercial success and peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. To many, their voices may sound similar as they sing the popular chorus on \u201cOye Mi Canto\u201d by N.O.R.E. featuring Nina Sky and Daddy Yankee. Nina Sky was the only woman competing against men in the Latin charts, alongside Ivy Queen.\n\n3 - Rosalia\nRosal\u00eda Vila Tobella, known professionally as Rosal\u00eda, is a Spanish singer and songwriter. Rosal\u00eda gained international recognition for her distinctive approach to flamenco music, blending traditional flamenco elements with contemporary urban sounds. Her second album, \u201cEl Mal Querer,\u201d released in 2018, propelled Rosal\u00eda to global stardom. The album\u2019s lead single, \u201cMalamente,\u201d became a massive hit, earning Rosal\u00eda widespread praise for her boundary-pushing sound and captivating performances. Many members of the Latinx community question whether Rosal\u00eda should be recognized as a Latin artist since she is from Spain, previously nominated for Billboard Music Awards as Top Latin Female Artist, over 12 nominations in Billboard Latin Music Awards and another one for Best Latin Rock or Alternative Album in the Grammys. Whether you love her or not, her chill-inducing voice has brought new influences to reggaeton that no other artist has ever attempted to do.\n\n2 - Karol G\nKarol G, also known as Carolina Giraldo Navarro, is the current female reggaeton powerhouse. Proudly from Medellin, Colombia, the parcera is reaching numbers no other Latina woman has ever seen. The \u201cBichota\u2019' pioneer has created a movement surrounding her brand that uses her music to empower Latinas and break gender norms. In 2017, Karol G released her debut studio album, \u201cUnstoppable,\u201d which included hits like \u201cAhora Me Llama\u201d featuring Bad Bunny and \u201cHello\u201d featuring Ozuna. However, her second studio album, \u201cOcean,\u201d released in 2019, catapulted Karol G to international fame. The album included hit singles like \u201cTusa\u201d featuring Nicki Minaj and \u201cSecreto\u201d with Anuel AA. Karol G is the first Latina artist to score a No.1 album entirely in Spanish on the Billboard 200 chart with her Album \u201cMa\u00f1ana Sera Bonito.\u201d Her previous album, \u201cKG0516,\u201d became one of the largest debut female Spanish albums on Spotify. Recently, Karol G also became the first Latin artist to be awarded the Billboard Woman of the Year where she performed a rendition of her top hits with a salsa ensemble. She even became the first woman to win the Grammy for Best Urban Album. Despite her sold-out stadium tours and No.1 hits, Karol G\u2019s talent and charisma stand alone.\n\n1- Ivy Queen\nLa diva, la potra, la caballota, Ivy Queen, is indisputably the mother of reggaeton music. Martha Ivelisse Pesante Rodr\u00edguez is one of the O.G. Puerto Rican rappers and singers. Early reggaeton music by male artists often included overtly sexual and oftentimes degrading lyrics towards women, Ivy Queen turned that around. \u201cYo Quiero Bailar\u201d is one of Ivy Queen\u2019s most iconic and popular songs, released in 2003 as part of her album \u201cDiva.\u201d While \u201cQuiero Bailar\u201d might not have been a chart-topping mega-hit, it holds a special place in the hearts of fans, becoming a cultural renaissance within reggaeton and the fight for female empowerment, as did most of her other hits. Although Ivy Queen may not have the sold-out tours and No.1 albums, compared to the rest of the equally talented women on this list, none of them would be here without the foundation Ivy Queen laid. Ivy Queen opened doors for Latinas when it was demanding to even be a fan of the genre.\n\nWith National Women\u2019s History Month coming to an end, Dimelo honors the women who changed the genre of reggaeton. Through their lyricism and man-eater characteristics, these women have topped charts, filled sold-out stadiums and received some of the highest awards in music.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Qais Adawiya and Laurie Carrillo\nMarch 29, 2024 at 3:39 pm PDT\n\nImpact, USC Annenberg\u2019s award-winning documentary series, held its spring edition March 28. They featured the work of three students highlighting stories from diverse communities in Los Angeles.\n\nJunior journalism major, Ethan Galbraith, was one of the students selected to show his film. He was able to bring forth a story which he explains, needed to be told. Galbraith\u2019s documentary, \u201cL.A storytellers,\u201d chronicles two Indigenous L.A. based artists who use art to preserve and progress the stories of Native Americans.\n\nGalbraith\u2019s reasoning for choosing this topic was one that hits close to home. \u201cI\u2019m Indigenous myself, and also not from here [L.A.]...,so when the documentary opportunity came about, I knew I wanted to do something with the community here, I just didn\u2019t know how,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd after doing some research, I decided I wanted to do a story about art.\u201d\n\nGalbraith expressed his hopes that the documentary will inspire curiosity and clear the misconceptions of Indigenous people. \u201cThey think we live the same lifestyle. We live on the reservations in the middle of nowhere, and you don\u2019t see us, and we don\u2019t see you, we\u2019re kind of autonomous, and that we do our own thing. Don\u2019t disturb us, We don\u2019t disturb you,\u201d Galbraith said. \u201cWhich is not the case whatsoever.\u201d\n\nGalbraith\u2019s search for artists to tell the story ended when artists River Garza and Pamela Peters at UCLA\u2019s American Indian Studies Center asked him to help tell their story. Garza, who is Tongva, explained his journey and how he tries to be a voice for the community. Peters, while not part of a local tribe, said she uses photographs to explain the history of Indigenous populations.\n\nGalbraith said he is proud to be chosen to present, not because of the work he put in but for the audience to understand the plight of Indigenous people. \u201cTo be selected for the screening was very special to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even about the validation of all the work that I put in, it was that they see the story that I want to tell as well... They see the value in the story that I\u2019m telling, not just about the work...\u201d\n\nGalbraith said the rich culture of the Indigenous people is a story that needs to be told, and education remains at the forefront of that effort. While he acknowledges that there is still a lot of work to be done, he said he remains hopeful about the future. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s been progress being made,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet but I think we\u2019re trending in the right direction.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Galbraith\u2019s documentary, junior communications major Micah Chow focused on an adaptive climbing group who aims to bring in people with disabilities and other climbers together. Being a climber himself for two years, he found an interest in the inclusivity of the activity, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be a certain way to climb.\u201d Chow also acknowledges how Black, brown and other marginalized communities aren\u2019t represented as much in the sport and hopes their documentary can encourage others to explore climbing.\n\nThe final documentary by junior journalism major, Katelyn Do covers the older immigrant community.

The Kings won 4-3. (AP/Jae C. Hong)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nMarch 29, 2024 at 2:54 pm PDT\n\nThe Kings finally won consecutive games when they trounced the Minnesota Wild 6-0 on March 20 after beating the Chicago Blackhawks the night before. They followed up the blowout with a hard-fought overtime victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning and then edged out the Canucks 3-2 on the road. However, LA couldn\u2019t change the negative narrative surrounding its history with the Oilers, as Edmonton dominated the Kings on Thursday, winning 4-1.\n\nWinger Viktor Arvidsson returned to the lineup against Minnesota and tallied a goal and an assist in the game. The Kings have only lost one game with Arvidsson in the lineup this year, although the injury-prone Swede has only skated in eight of LA\u2019s 72 bouts.\n\n\u201cI just try to play my game and go to where I used to go,\u201d said Arvidsson. \u201cAnd I just try to create offense and be responsible and play smarter on the defensive side of the puck.\u201d\n\nWith the exception of its outing against Edmonton, Los Angeles\u2019 defensemen have been carrying the load lately. Against the Wild and Lightning, blueliners Matt Roy, Jordan Spence, Mikey Anderson and Vladislav Gavrikov all lit the lamp over the two-game stretch. In the defensive zone, over LA\u2019s four-game winning streak, the defense didn\u2019t allow more than three goals in a game despite having to play notable Cup contenders like Tampa Bay and Vancouver.\n\nThe Kings\u2019 penalty kill has also been one of the NHL\u2019s best. After returning from injury on March 9, a big question was if winger Adrian Kempe could return to his previously high-flying form amid a playoff push. Kempe has actually exceeded expectations, becoming a point-per-game player in March. Kempe\u2019s linemate, center An\u017ee Kopitar has also surged lately. Kopitar notched the game-winning goal against the Canucks and tallied at least two points per game during the recent win streak.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting the mojo back, we\u2019re getting the confidence,\u201d said Kopitar. \u201cThe last few games we\u2019ve been clicking pretty well and making some plays that resulted into goals and that\u2019s why you\u2019re feeling more confident and more at ease on the ice.\u201d\n\nAgainst Edmonton, winger Arthur Kaliyev posted his first goal since December 5. The 22-year-old has seen up-and-down minutes this season after coming off a decent campaign in 2022-23. With under six minutes of ice time against the Oilers, and playing in his first game in nearly two weeks, it\u2019s clear that Kaliyev doesn\u2019t always seem to have interim head coach Jim Hiller\u2019s approval. But, the fact that the young forward scored his team\u2019s lone goal against a premier team might lead to Hiller sparing him more ice time.\n\n\u201c[Kaliyev\u2019s] had chances, hasn\u2019t played a lot, but at times he\u2019s had chances, hasn\u2019t scored,\u201d said Hiller. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see when he got his chance tonight, he was able to find the back of the net. Maybe that will help him just a little bit with his confidence going forward.\u201d\n\nNetminder Cam Talbot has won four of his last five outings between the pipes and is now up to a .916 save percentage and 2.44 goals against average, some of his best numbers in years. Los Angeles will hope for continued resiliency from the 36-year-old journeyman but will also look to David Rittich to make quality starts on Talbot\u2019s rest days. Rittich\u2019s last two wins were shutouts, so the team will hope he keeps up his focused play as the playoffs approach.\n\n\u201cThe season is winding down, every game is important,\u201d Hiller said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to play and win.\u201d\n\nThe Kings\u2019 biggest challenge will be forgoing the Wild Card and edging out the Vegas Golden Knights in the Pacific Division standings. The Golden Knights only have two regulation losses since March 9 and lead Los Angeles by one point in the standings. Falling to the Wild Card might actually be LA\u2019s best possible outcome, though. If the Kings manage to sneak past Vegas and place third in the Pacific\u2014Los Angeles would almost surely face the Oilers in the first round\u2014the team that has been the Kings\u2019 playoff kryptonite the last two seasons. But if the Kings finish in the first Wild Card slot, they might have to play the Dallas Stars, which could also be a disaster. LA is 0-3-0 against the Stars this season and none of the matchups have been close. Sitting in the second Wild Card spot might not be the worst outcome. If the season ended today, the Kings would face a team that they\u2019ve been very capable of beating: the Canucks. Los Angeles has a 2-0-1 record against the Canucks and will face them once more in the regular season.\n\nRegardless of who they face, the Kings will want to head into the playoffs with some steam. The Calgary Flames, Winnipeg Jets, Seattle Kraken and San Jose Sharks will be on tap next for this week, all teams the Los Angeles should be capable of beating. The Kings will face the Flames on Saturday at 7 p.m. at Scotiabank Saddledome.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/29/clippers-struggles-at-home-continue/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue had two words to describe his team\u2019s identity after a 133-116 loss to the Indiana Pacers on Monday: \u201cWe\u2019re soft.\u201d Los Angeles, currently fourth in the Western Conference standings, have been in a slump as of late. They\u2019ve won four out of their last 10 games, all of which were on the road. Additionally, the Clippers are 2-9 against opponents with a winning record since the All-Star break.\n\nLast week, the Clippers traveled to Portland to battle the Trail Blazers in two games over three days and managed to pick up two big road wins. But the momentum quickly faded when the 76ers came to town and defeated the Clippers 121-107.\n\n\u201cWe know we got to play better basketball going into the playoffs, or it\u2019s going to be an early season,\u201d said Lue after the Clippers loss to the 76ers on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ve still got full confidence in this team and full confidence in what we can do. Just going out and doing it every single night, not every two minutes, not 26 minutes, 48 minutes of doing the right things.\u201d\n\nAs the season has gone on, the Clippers have struggled to play complete games against high-quality opponents. In their matchup against the Pacers, LA led by five points at the end of the first quarter and kept the game close into halftime. But their downfall started in the third quarter, and the Pacers took an eight point lead. By the time the final buzzer sounded, the Pacers had doubled that lead and ultimately won by 17.\n\nOffensively, the Clippers have averaged 119.3 points per game over the last 10 outings, three points above their season average. They\u2019ve struggled the most on the other side of the ball, however. The Clippers rank 17th in the league in defensive rating through the last 10 games and have given up an average of 16.7 points off turnovers per game.\n\n\u201cIt just goes to our defense, we got to be better defensively of where we\u2019re sending the ball and just ball pressure,\u201d Clippers forward Paul George said after Sunday\u2019s the 76ers loss. \u201cJust imposing our will especially on small guards. The more we can impose physicality the better in the long run over a whole game.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers flipped the script Wednesday, however, as they took down the 76ers 108-107 in Philadelphia. George led LA with 22 points, shooting 5-8 from beyond the arc and Norman Powell contributed 11 points off the bench. Powell has proven to be one of the Clippers more consistent scorers during their recent stretch of games, as he put up 22 points against the Pacers and 20 points when the Clippers lost to the 76ers at home, his first game back after injury.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important having Norm,\u201d Lue said. \u201cOffensively, being able to make shots, being able to space the floor, being able to get downhill and attack the basket, but also being able to get to the free throw line. He\u2019s very valuable to what we want to do.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers most recent game against the 76ers proved that they have the ability to win tough games. At the end of the first quarter, the Clippers were down by 12 points as the 76ers got off to a hot start. LA began to find their way during the second quarter and cut the lead to 4. The second half was a battle to the end and despite the controversial ending, the Clippers pulled off a much needed win.\n\nLue was pleased with the way his team played. \u201cWe talked about toughness and having a fight, and I liked our fight,\u201d Lue said after the game on Wednesday night. \u201cWe got down 15 points [in a] tough game on the first game of a road trip. I liked us staying with it, attacking the paint in that second half [when] we went small, they matched us by going small, and we were able to get to the paint and get to the rim.\u201d\n\nThe last time the Clippers went on a long road trip, they returned home with six wins and just one loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. If LA wants to keep their top-four seed heading into the playoffs, picking up wins throughout this road trip will be crucial to earning home court advantage. The Clippers are set to play the Charlotte Hornets Friday evening at the Kia Center.\n```"}

With only two full weeks until the conclusion of this turbulent NBA season, some former Trojans have picked up their form: Nikola Vucevic recorded his 41st double-double of the season against the Indiana Pacers on March 27, collecting 12 rebounds to go along with 22 points in a 26-point victory. Chimezie Metu logged his first two starts of the season, both in the past week. Against the New Orleans Pelicans, the current Detroit Piston scored 17 points and grabbed eight boards, but Detroit lost by 13. Jordan McLaughlin was hyper-efficient against the Cleveland Cavaliers, going 100% from the field to help the Minnesota Timberwolves to a crucial win for the team\u2019s Western Conference seeding.\n\nThis week, two former Trojans we will examine and their recent stellar play in the last week of March.\n\nEvan Mobley\n\nThe 2021 No. 3 overall pick returned to action this week after missing nine games with a sprained ankle. In his 41 starts this season, Mobley is averaging 15.5 points and 10 rebounds per game while winning 61% of the contests he appears in. With the absence of All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell, Mobley has been tasked with more of an offensive load when he steps on the hardwood. In contests when Mitchell missed action this season, Mobley has averaged 16 points per game despite his own hampering injuries throughout the season.\n\nThe Southern California native returned on March 24 against the Miami Heat. In his 21 minutes of action, the 22-year-old forward led his team with 15 points on only six shot attempts, including 2-2 from three-point range. However, he seemed to be the only bright spot for the Cavs, as the Heat blew out their conference rival by 37 points.\n\nMobley would prove his importance for Cleveland in his second game back against the Charlotte Hornets. The 2021 Pac-12 Player of the Year led the Cavaliers again in scoring with 17. He added eight assists and seven rebounds to steer the Cavaliers to a 115-92 victory.\n\nIn a back-to-back series against the Hornets, the Cavaliers traveled to Charlotte to finish off the week. Mobley, who was a candidate for Defensive Player of the Year last season, contributed in a well-rounded fashion yet again. He started the game off hot, scoring nine points in the first quarter. However, he would not make another field goal for the rest of the game, as the Hornets avenged their previous loss with 118-111 victory. Mobley would finish with 10 points, six boards and six assists.\n\nThe Cavaliers and the Hornets will meet on the final day of the regular season, as Mobley and the Cavs hope to earn the No. 2 seed for the playoffs.\n\nDeMar DeRozan\n\nIn his 15th NBA season, DeRozan is averaging 23.3 points and 5.3 dimes per contest. He has also been scarily clutch with the basketball in his hands. DeRozan is second in clutch time points per game in 2023-24 \u2014 only behind the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Stephen Curry. With running mate Zach Lavine ruled out for the rest of the season, DeRozan has seen an increased scoring role in the past month, averaging about 27 points in March.\n\nHe and the Chicago Bulls began their week off against the No. 1 seed Boston Celtics on March 23. The former McDonald\u2019s All-American was one assist shy of a double-double in his 42 minutes of action. However, the Bulls were not able to capitalize on DeRozan\u2019s 28 points, as the Celtics found a hot streak late in the fourth quarter to win by 13.\n\nFrom one side of the standings to the other, the Bulls faced off against the lowly Washington Wizards two nights later. DeRozan proved that he has the clutch gene yet again, scoring 14 of his 27 in the fourth quarter. The three-time All-NBA forward also recorded a season-high five steals. However, his efforts were in vain, resulting in another Chicago loss.\n\nIn the Bulls\u2019 final game of the week \u2014 against their Central Division rival Indianapolis Pacers \u2014 DeRozan logged 27 points for the second consecutive game, including 11 in the fourth quarter. Along with six rebounds, the Bulls were able to halt their three-game losing streak in dominating fashion and beat the Pacers by 27.\n\nThe six-time All-Star \u2014 at 34 years old \u2014 currently leads the entire NBA in total minutes played at 2,669. DeRozan is second in minutes per game at 37.6 minutes, just behind the Hornets\u2019 Miles Bridges. The Compton native has the opportunity to surpass personal records for both total minutes played and minutes per game in a season. In 2013-14, DeRozan averaged 38.6 minutes a night with the Toronto Raptors in 79 games. If he keeps his averages for the final stretch of the season, he will overtake both marks 10 years after setting those extraordinary averages. And, it looks like the Bulls will need him to stay on the court as the team makes a final push toward playoff contention.\n\n\u201cFight on, Dribble on\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/29/sports-mythbusters-no-4-this-march-madness-invest-in-the-underdog/", "response": "```\nSports Mythbusters No. 4: This March Madness, invest in the underdog\n\nBy Sammie Yen March 29, 2024 at 2:10 pm PDT\n\n\u201cSports Mythbusters\u201d is a column by Sammie Yen about common stereotypes in and around sports culture.\n\nEveryone loves a good underdog story. We love to support a team facing seemingly insurmountable odds, which makes it even more satisfying when they succeed. March Madness is perhaps the best example of the underdog\u2019s prevalence. It is one of the biggest American sporting events, generating billions of dollars in revenue. And since we\u2019re in the very heart of the 2024 NCAA Tournament, it\u2019s worth looking back at some of the all-time biggest upsets.\n\nIn 2018, we saw the first instance of a No. 16 seed toppling a No. 1 seed. When the University of Maryland Baltimore County blew out the favored Virginia by 20 points, they made March Madness history. Earlier in their season, the UMBC Retrievers suffered a crushing 83-39 loss to Albany, and yet, they did the impossible less than two months later.\n\nSimilarly, in last year\u2019s tournament, No. 1 seed and 23.5-point favorite Purdue Boilermakers were cut down by the No. 16 Fairleigh Dickinson Knights, who had never advanced past the first round in school history. The Boilermakers\u2019 loss was the biggest upset (in terms of point spread) in NCAA Tournament history and will endure as one of the most memorable March matchups of all time.\n\nThe 2023 madness did not end there. Bouts of upsetting wins led to a novelty: Three of the Final Four teams had never been to the semifinals before. None of them were a top-three seed. The aptly titled March Madness has seen its fair share of \u201cCinderella\u201d victories. But historically, the statistics don\u2019t lead to tournament-long success for these underdog teams.\n\nWhat do the numbers say? Since expanding to a 64-team tournament in 1985, No. 1 seeds have won 63.2% of the national championships. At least one No. 1 seed has appeared in the championship game of 37 of the last 38 tournaments. On the other hand, no team below an eight-seed has won a national title. Moreover, no team seeded below 11 has touched a Final Four game.\n\nSo, from a sports betting perspective, betting on underdogs to go beyond the first couple rounds would do more harm than good. There\u2019s a reason why a No. 1 seed is a No. 1 seed. A team who earns a high ranking coming into the postseason has performed well in the regular season and most likely just notched a conference championship. This steady success is owed not only to skill, but also to the resources and financial investment of the basketball program.\n\nNot every school is pouring millions of dollars into recruiting, facilities and staffing, so it makes sense that schools that put in more get more out. This Vox video breaks down why underdogs in basketball might not necessarily perform as well as underdogs in other sports, albeit the video demonstrates the difference mainly within professional leagues.\n\nWhile you can expect March Madness to contain some Cinderellas, generally, the clock has to eventually strike midnight and end the fairytale. Yet a 1991 study found that in a hypothetical best-of-seven-games playoff scenario of an unidentified sport, 81% of college students would root for the underdog Team B over a \u201chighly-favored\u201d Team A. When those students were told to imagine Team B winning the first three games of the series, 50% of the Team B supporters shifted their loyalties to Team A.\n\nSo, why do we still love the loser? There\u2019s a couple theories why people will always root for the underdog. The first has to do with \u201cschadenfreude,\u201d a German expression that means taking pleasure in other people\u2019s pain. Sometimes, you might root for the underdog simply because you want to see a highly ranked team dethroned and humbled.\n\nIn terms of March Madness, it seems circumstantial. While teams normally perform to their seeding, it isn\u2019t a best-of-seven series like the NBA playoffs. The single-elimination structure of the tournament creates unique pressure for both teams. In early rounds, when several top-seeded teams have looked beyond to \u201cmore challenging\u201d games, this underestimation of an opponent has caused numerous upsets.\n\nAnother theory is that unanticipated wins are more rewarding than anticipated ones. There\u2019s less on the line if your underdog team loses (since that was the expected outcome), and there\u2019s more joy gained with a memorable upset win. Oddly, spectators may unconsciously associate underdogs with winning. From all the Hollywood and media content of rags-to-riches stories (hence, the \u201cCinderella\u201d nickname), perhaps there is a subtle expectation of the \u201cbest\u201d story; it is more entertaining and heartwarming to see someone who struggles and perseveres versus someone who has never struggled or faced failure.\n\nI speculate the reason why we should love a good underdog is simple: hope. Hope in an underdog transcends sports. The underdog is all about capitalizing on the highs and maintaining composure during the lows, proving others wrong and demonstrating the difficult \u2014 and even the impossible \u2014 can be accomplished.\n\n\u201cSports Mythbusters\u201d runs every other Friday.\n```"}

Millions of people have filled out their ideal brackets (myself included), and millions of people have been disappointed by the upsets and outcomes so far (myself included). But to the beverage community \u2014 not to worry! As all eyes are on the upcoming NCAA Sweet Sixteen games, I\u2019ve got a Sweet Sixteen bracket that won\u2019t cause any heartbreak: matcha treats in and around Los Angeles that will have you feeling like a champion no matter which place you try.\n\nNo. 1: Dulce\nIn my Matcha Madness bracket, Dulce would be a No. 1 seed \u2014 one of the top contenders for the title. While the blueberry matcha latte remains its highly-touted star, Dulce is a consistently reliable pick for any style of matcha. Their matcha latte and premium matcha are smooth, light and classically luxurious. Plus, it\u2019s the closest matcha place around campus.\n\nNo. 2: Midori Matcha\nA straight shot from USC to Little Tokyo by Metro, Midori specializes in matcha powder in Kagoshima, Japan. Their must-try is their matcha soft serve, which you can swirl with other flavors like hojicha (green tea) or vanilla rose.\n\nNo. 3: Stereoscope\n\u201cPursuit of depth and simplicity in coffee, in culture, in life\u201d is Stereoscope\u2019s motto, and their entire menu lives up to those standards. With locations in Hollywood and Echo Park, Stereoscope is a pure, undiscovered gem in the coffee community and a top underdog in Matcha Madness often eclipsed by big-shot coffee chains. I would recommend the Ceremonial Matcha Milk, but they have other excellent coffee and tea options, like their Lychee Peach Black tea.\n\nNo. 4: Mandarin Coffee Stand\nFrom my very own hometown Pasadena, Mandarin Coffee Stand is tucked away in an adorable, albeit tiny, mini-plaza full of locally-owned businesses. I love how they spin a range of Asian-inspired palettes into classic drinks: if the Matcha Tonic doesn\u2019t grab your attention, maybe the Gui Hua Latte will.\n\nNo. 5: Maru Coffee\nAesthetic and authentic, Maru uses Ippodo matcha from Kyoto. Most of their production takes place in the Arts District in their minimalistic cafe. One of Maru\u2019s hot items is the Matcha Latte (ask for a Cream Top, too).\n\nNo. 6: DAMO Tea House\nDAMO is another Koreatown favorite. Like other places on this list, their matcha is thoroughly stirred and delicious. Unlike other places, the cafe is tea-focused, which only augments the quality of their lattes. Look out for seasonal drinks, like the Chestnut Matcha Einspener.\n\nNo. 7: Stumptown Coffee\nStumptown is serious about the first sip. To them, it represents years of work and passion. The company chain has locations on both coasts of the U.S., and also Kyoto. Stumptown is more acclaimed for its espresso and flat white, among other coffee offerings. However, their approach to matcha is the same in highlighting the flavor from its particular origin. Overall, a solid No. 7 in my bracket.\n\nNo. 8: Yeems Coffee\nAt Yeems, I would recommend the Rose Matcha, which is made with ceremonial-grade matcha. I like things that are a little bit sweet, and I love a good floral fragrance. Other popular beverages in this Koreatown cafe are the Matcha Strawberry Latte and Vienna latte (for those non-matcha coffee lovers).\n\nNo. 9: Tea Masters Matcha Cafe\nHere\u2019s another great Little Tokyo location that has emphasized and mastered the art form of tea. Tea Masters has made its mark in the L.A. matcha world with its soft serve with a dusting of matcha powder on top. You can even purchase their matcha powder to make your own drink at home.\n\nNo. 10: Memory Look\nWhile on the outskirts of Koreatown, Memory Look still garners huge lines, mostly for that one drink: the Matcha Einspanner. It\u2019s very thick in cream, very rich in flavor, and very memorable (no pun intended). Even if it doesn\u2019t blow your mind, it\u2019ll blow your wallet with a hefty price of over eight dollars \u2014 one of the pricier treats on this list.\n\nNo. 11: LaB Coffee & Roasters\nLaB is a family-owned business northwest of Koreatown. They offer coffee courses if you\u2019re looking to sharpen your espresso expertise. I recommend their Strawberry Matcha. In terms of Matcha Madness, LaB would have a strong postseason showing, as the afternotes in their drinks are heaven for matcha lovers.\n\nNo. 12: Farm Cup Coffee\nWith locations in Century City and West Hollywood, Farm Cup Coffee is relatively far from campus (depending on traffic, of course!). But if you ever find yourself in either area, check out the Pistachio Rose Matcha \u2014 it has an earthy, unique flavor profile!\n\nNo. 13: Kindness & Mischief\nJust off Figueroa in Highland Park, Kindness & Mischief is straight chic. While they do have a decent Matcha Latte, they are more known for specialty drinks like the Pandan Horchata.\n\nNo. 14: Community Goods\nCommunity Goods is a trendy and quintessentially L.A., apparently a top celebrity spot for a morning treat. The Matcha Latte here has received mixed reviews; some say it\u2019s the perfect balance between refreshing and creamy, while others don\u2019t believe the drink lives up to its hype.\n\nNo. 15: Boba Guys\nThis Culver City place is the definite underdog making a Cinderella run in my Matcha Madness. Hailing from San Francisco, Boba Guys develops artisanal milk tea, and I have to mention their Strawberry Matcha Latte, the most popular item on the menu.\n\nNo. 16: Chit Chat Coffee & Matcha\nThere\u2019s a plethora of matcha options here in this West L.A. cafe.

We\u2019re getting a new home,\u201d Lori Ray Fisher, a Vice Dean at the School of Dramatic Arts, said. \u201cI\u2019ve been with the School of Dramatic Arts for over 25 years, so for us to have a new location after so long was so impactful and meaningful.\u201d Elders from the Chumash and Tongva Native American communities, two of the many Indigenous peoples whose traditional land the university occupies, also spoke at the event. \u201cThe Chumash and Tongva elders is also special to me because it\u2019s true that they don\u2019t get enough recognition when we do ceremonies at USC, so that was really special too,\u201d Jaclyn Kalkhurst, a stage management alum who graduated in 2008, said. \u201cI appreciate always that SDA is trying to acknowledge Indigenous people,\u201d adjunct lecturer Alison De La Cruz said. Adam Rosen, who helped plan the event and works for the Cultural Relations and University Events department, said they\u2019ve \u201cbeen working on this [the grand opening] for about six months,\u201d adding that President Carol Folt \u201cwas incredibly instrumental in making it [the new building] happen.\u201d The building was formerly the University Church and is located near USC Village and Taper Hall on 34th Street where the ceremony was held. \u201cIt\u2019s always challenging on a street, closing this space down and having people kind of go through, but I think it went well,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cWhen we look at ribbon cutting and wanting people to celebrate the building itself, I always find that it\u2019s nice to be outside, kind of looking at that space, and then be able to go in and experience it. So it\u2019s always our goal, if we can, to do those outside, and this one just happens to be up against the street.\u201d The building had its  soft opening about two weeks ago , with faculty and staff moving into their offices and students already taking classes there. \u201cWe have two theaters that are in the building. We will open our first production in the next couple of weeks,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very active space.\u201d De La Cruz directed the play \u201cSomewhere Someone is Traveling Furiously Towards You,\u201d which was performed at the Scene Dock Theatre on campus this past weekend. \u201cI\u2019m really excited. The play I just directed for SDA, our costume is on display in the building as a costume made by a student for a production,\u201d De La Cruz said. \u201cIt\u2019s the angel costume in the building, so it\u2019s exciting to see the work the students did on our newer production being a part of today\u2019s opening.\u201d Rosen echoed the excitement. \u201cI\u2019m just super excited about the building,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a beautiful reuse of an incredible building, and I am excited to see where it is in the next 20 to 30 years.\n```"}

(Name courtesy of AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) \n\nBy Anthony Bottino March 28, 2024 at  6:40 pm PDT \n\nAfter four months of waiting, today is finally Opening Day in the world of baseball. Soon stadiums across the country will be filled with cheering fans waiting for the crack of the bat, hearing the umpire yell strike, and of course eating peanuts and Cracker Jack. However, it\u2019s looking like there won\u2019t be a lot of younger people in those crowds. America\u2019s oldest sport might be becoming exactly that, old. What once was the biggest sport in the U.S. is starting to decrease in viewership and a lot of people aren\u2019t too excited for the season to start, especially young people, a trend that continues at USC.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been following it in years,\u201d Ezra Avery, a sophomore studying economics/mathematics, said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many games in a season, and it\u2019s hard to follow individual players. Also the games are long and kinda boring.\u201d\n\nMajor League Baseball just can\u2019t seem to strike a chord with the college generation. Some students just don\u2019t see importance in the game with how many games there are, and how long the season is. The beginning of the season also faces an uphill battle having to compete with the NCAA Basketball Tournaments. March Madness is one of the most highly anticipated times of the year in sports, and unfortunately for the league, its first games are right in the middle of the tournaments. Currently it\u2019s already time for the Sweet 16 and as the season inches closer to the finals people would much rather watch that then the first of 162 games.\n\n\u201cI think men\u2019s and women\u2019s March Madness absolutely overshadows Opening Day,\u201d Tovia Manning, a sophomore studying law, history and culture, said. \u201cWe are seeing the stats, we are seeing how much the viewership is increasing, seeing these incredible athletes break records. There are more underdogs and all of that is just much more entertaining to watch.\u201d\n\nAnd while there are still some die hard fans out there, young people aren\u2019t buying into the baseball hype. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say people aren\u2019t missing out on a lot, because I like the sport, but it wouldn\u2019t be the sport I recommend to someone,\u201d Abby Rowley, a sophomore studying mechanical engineering, said. \u201cYou take baseball at face value, it\u2019s fairly boring and you aren\u2019t guaranteed hits. I feel like more often there are less exciting baseball games than exciting games.\u201d\n\nPart of the reason young people may not be interested in baseball might be due to the fact that other popular sports feature a faster pace and more tension, which can be more exciting for the casual viewer. For example, basketball is constantly moving with players running around the court. Additionally, the football atmosphere heightens the game and makes nearly every play feel important. In a game that can be slow, it manages to keep people on the edge of their seats. Baseball, on the other hand, struggles with both. It can often take multiple innings for a major play to happen, and even then it may not result in a run.\n\n\u201cI play baseball, and I know the game is boring and slow-paced if you are just watching it,\u201d Brian Tewjiayan, a first-year graduate student studying architecture and USC Club baseball member, said. \u201cI feel like the case with professional baseball, if there aren\u2019t a lot of good players on one team, it\u2019s boring to see the worse players.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not like MLB hasn\u2019t been paying attention to this though. The league is very aware of the shrinking viewership and aging fanbase. In an effort to try to combat this last season, the sport instituted a new pitch clock rule to speed up the game. While some fans weren\u2019t too happy with the rule change it did end up having a positive effect on viewership. MLB  reported  86% of people ages 18-24 are more likely to watch the game with the rule changes.\n\n\u201cIs it still America\u2019s pastime, you know I don\u2019t think so. I think with the growing popularity of other sports baseball has taken a backseat,\u201d Miki Turner, Annenberg professor and advisor for USC\u2019s Sports Business Association, said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because it hasn\u2019t evolved into something else or hasn\u2019t made any inroads trying to appeal to this generation.\u201d\n```"}

Jarrin is retiring at the end of the season. (AP/Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\nBy Nicci Barron March 28, 2024 at 6:28 pm PDT\n\nUnless you live under a rock, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the shocking news about Shohei Ohtani\u2019s now-former interpreter Ippei Mizuhara. The Dodgers and Ohtani fired him following allegations that he committed a \u201cmassive theft\u201d of the Japanese star\u2019s money, which has caused international media chaos. He allegedly placed millions of dollars in bets with an illegal bookmaker who is currently subject to a federal investigation. Mizuhara\u2019s actions have impacted several characters, including Ohtani, the Dodgers franchise, the news media and the often-overlooked interpreter community. This controversy brought the role of league interpreters into the limelight, but not for good reasons. However, this does not mean all interpreters are mischievous people! There are plenty of kind and helpful interpreters in the league who shine in their roles, but before we get into that, let\u2019s break down the basics.\n\nThere were over 200 internationally-born players who competed in the 2022 and 2023 seasons. The majority were from the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, but many also hail from Japan and South Korea. Translators are effectively a part of the team. They put in the same amount of hours, attend team meetings and address the press alongside players. Their role is vital to the success of any team as many international players rely on their interpreters to communicate with their coaches and teammates, and vice versa.\n\nAs of 2016, all MLB teams have been required to have at least two full-time Spanish language interpreters who are paid by the team and normally do not have a prior relationship with the player(s) they work with. This requirement ensures that all native Spanish-speaking players can freely and accurately express themselves to the media, as well as simplify the communication between players and their teams.\n\nBut interpreters\u2019 duties don\u2019t end there. In an interview with The Athletic, the now-outcasted Mizuhara explained that in addition to translating, they can also be responsible for finding in-season housing, procuring food, managing visits from family members and friends and translating baseball data into digestible pieces of information. It\u2019s a demanding job with no set hours and undefined responsibilities that only a few brave souls take on.\n\nTranslators play a vital role in the MLB and rightfully deserve their flowers. Shingo Horie \u2014 New York Yankees Horie worked alongside pitcher Masahiro Tanaka during his six-year stint with the Yankees from 2014 to 2020 before Tanaka returned to play in Japan\u2019s Nippon Professional Baseball League. In an interview with ESPN, Horie said that translators work for everybody on the team and that while working with the Yankees, Tanaka\u2019s \u201cteammates [would] come to [him] and ask how to say things in Japanese.\u201d\n\nInterpreters build a bridge between non-English speaking players and those around them to help solidify the team dynamic. Manny Navarro \u2014 Tampa Bay Rays Navarro has been one of the Rays\u2019 Spanish interpreters for the past seven years since 2017, working alongside Dominican outfielder Jose Siri and Cuban-born third baseman Yandy D\u00edaz. Navarro was initially paying a friend a favor by helping out at the Rays\u2019 batting practice and eventually landed a full-time position with the club. His role has transformed over the years, now including throwing in batting practice and assisting Spanish-speaking infielders during warm-ups.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always that comfort and trust that they have toward us. My job is to make them comfortable,\u201d Navarro said in an interview with Fox 13, a Tampa Bay affiliate. Translation is not simply Spanish to English and vice versa, interpreters also have to pick up on the slang terms, accents and speech from various Hispanic-speaking countries, to communicate as effectively as possible.\n\n\u201cBaseball is the universal language,\u201d said Navarro. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what language you speak. Baseball is one language.\u201d\n\nJaime Jarr\u00edn \u2014 Los Angeles Dodgers Famously known for being the Spanish voice of the Dodgers, Jarr\u00edn began working with the team in the 1959 season primarily as a broadcaster. He immigrated to the U.S. when he was 20 years old and landed his first job with the only Spanish radio station in Los Angeles in 1955. The legend, who hails from Ecuador, quickly earned the support and admiration of Dodgers fans, especially those who speak Spanish. Jarr\u00edn most prominently worked as an interpreter in the 1980s for six-time All-Star pitcher Fernando \u201cEl Toro\u201d Valenzuela, a Mexican lefty and 1981 World Series champion. Valenzuela\u2019s fame was so massive that the team\u2019s executive vice president, Fred Claire, asked Jarr\u00edn to translate to not burden another player or coach with the weighty responsibility.\n\n\u201cUp to that day, I was very well-known only in Southern California. But then when I had to travel with Fernando and be with him in front of the media, they knew about who Jaime Jarrin was in Chicago and St. Louis and other cities,\u201d Jarr\u00edn said in an interview with NPR.\n\nThis role boosted Jarr\u00edn\u2019s already extensive credibility, likability and fan base \u2014 even boosting his profile with English-speaking fans due to all his media appearances with fan-favorite \u201cEl Toro.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the Mizuhara incident, one shouldn\u2019t forget that MLB interpreters are valuable and crucial to a team\u2019s success both on and off the field. They eliminate barriers between a player and his coaches, teammates and the media, ensuring the player is accommodated in all aspects of their life.\n```"}

Waymo\u2019s website features an interactive map of its service areas in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nWaymo One is available in Phoenix to anyone with the app, but in San Francisco, you need to join the waitlist to get invited to a ride in a Waymo car. Similarly, rides in Los Angeles and Austin are only available to customers who have received special invite codes or secured a spot through the waitlist.\n\nLogan Barth, a senior studying law, history and culture who attended the Shrine event, is from Scottsdale, Arizona \u2013 part of the Metro Phoenix area. Barth has seen Waymo cars for about a year and a half in his hometown, but hasn\u2019t had the chance to ride in one yet. \u201cI\u2019d like to ride in one because I\u2019ve been seeing them so much,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to actually see the technology in use being inside the car.\u201d\n\nOn March 14, Waymo posted their future plans in Los Angeles on their blog Waypoint. They plan to offer free rides within a 63 square mile area, and \u201ctransition to paid service in the coming weeks.\u201d The company will then permanently allow customers to utilize the Waymo service by \u201cgradually onboarding the more than 50,000 people on our [the] LA waitlist,\u201d of which they say 15,000 rides have been completed.\n\nFor many self-driving car companies, the news hasn\u2019t been as rosy. In Oct. 2023, the California Department of Motor Vehicles suspended the permits that allowed General Motors-owned self-driving car company Cruise to utilize driverless cars. This suspension came after Cruise failed to properly disclose all details of an incident where a Cruise vehicle drove over a pedestrian that was in its path after being injured by a human driver in another hit-and-run accident. This prompted Cruise to pause their operations, and they have yet to restart.\n\nWaymo\u2019s self-driving cars have also been involved in incidents. On Feb. 5, at 10 p.m. a Waymo Jaguar car crashed into the gate at Watt Way and Exposition Boulevard on USC\u2019s campus. Tony Mazza, the Director of Transportation for USC Transportation, discussed this incident in a statement to Annenberg Media emailed, saying that Waymos are not allowed inside campus itself. \u201cIt involved the car barely hitting the entrance gate at Watt. Waymo is required to report that to DMV, but neither DPS or my team even knew it happened since no damage occurred to our equipment,\u201d Mazza wrote. \u201cWe have had discussions with Waymo and requested they set up a geofence around campus so that Waymo vehicles do not enter the streets inside campus, they have agreed to do so. Anyone using Waymo will be directed to pick-up locations outside the university campus.\u201d\n\nDespite these restrictions and incidents, some students still expressed excitement over self-driving cars. \u201cThey\u2019re probably overall a good thing because robots will eventually be smarter than people.

{"key": "/2024/03/28/chavez-ravines-dodgy-history/", "response": "```\nToday is opening day of the baseball season. The Dodgers hosted the St. Louis Cardinals at Dodger Stadium in Chavez Ravine finishing off with a win for the city of Los Angeles. And while we cheer for the Dodgers a new California bill aims to address a decades old injustice that occurred more than half a century ago to allow Dodger Stadium to be built.\n\nKatie Simons has the story. Let\u2019s start with the history of how Chavez Ravine in Los Angeles became home to Dodger Stadium. In the late 1940s, a few hundred mostly Mexican and some Chinese and Italian American families called Chavez Ravine home. They\u2019d been there since at least the 20\u2032s and had maybe not the wealthiest but a very strong community.\n\nIn 1949 during post-World War II, urban renewal and need for more housing in LA, the city told these families that their houses would be torn down. They were promised new and better housing which they never did get. Still, LA evicted them via eminent domain, but after a ballot measure on affordable housing didn\u2019t pass, the project was abandoned.\n\nJournalist Eric Nusbaum wrote \u201cStealing Home: Los Angeles, the Dodgers, and the Lives caught in Between.\u201d Eric Nusbaum; People who live in those communities believe that they should have been given more resources, more infrastructure, more help from the city. Instead, they were being told by the city that they weren\u2019t good enough that their homes were slums, that they needed to make way for something better and brighter.\n\nSeven decades later some measure of justice might be coming to the families or their descendants who were displaced. Last week LA Assemblywoman Wendy Carillo introduced a bill to provide reparations, accountability, and a memorial to those families. It\u2019s called the Chavez Ravine Accountability Act. It reads in part; \u201cFor generations, Chavez Ravine stood as a beacon of hope and resilience, embodying the dreams and aspirations of families who built their lives within its embrace. With this legislation, we are addressing the past, giving voice to this injustice, acknowledging the pain of those displaced, offering reparative measures, and ensuring that we honor and remember the legacy of the Chavez Ravine community.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s kind of the \u201cfirst inning\u201d if you will for this act. No one knows if it will pass or how much money people might receive as compensation. This bill would require a database of former residents to be completed in the next three years. As written, it does not require the Dodgers to pay compensation and it does not involve Dodger Stadium. It was the city that evicted families years ago.\n\nJerald Podair wrote \u201cCity of Dreams: Dodger Stadium and the Birth of Modern Los Angeles.\u201d Jerald Podair; The Dodgers really didn\u2019t have all that much to do with it. They signed a contract with the city for that land, they assumed at the time that it was empty land or, you know, free title, we if you could put it that way. And it turned out not to be the case. So what the Dodgers did basically is step back and say, Well, you know, you\u2019re going to the city of Los Angeles really has to resolve this. We\u2019re not going to resolve this.\n\nWhile baseball games have a winner and a loser, life is not always that clear cut. The history of Chavez Ravine reflects the complicated landscape of urban devolvement. So, the next time you root, root, root for the Dodgers think also about the uprooted.\n\nFor Annenberg Media.

Starting April 1st, fast food restaurants in California will be required to pay employees at least $20 an hour, up from $17.06. But as the day approaches, reactions are mixed. Some are worried the wage increase will come with higher food prices, but others are just happy to be paid more.\n\nMaria Lorenzo, an assistant general manager at Dominoes, says that despite the wage increase, her store will not raise prices. Maria Lorenzo: I know, for a fact that we\u2019re not going to increase prices. We were at a meeting where they said that Domino\u2019s is going to keep the same prices. We\u2019re just gonna have to keep labor under control. Lorenzo is excited for the increase because she works two jobs to support herself and her family.\n\nOlivia Richardson, a manager at the Momota Ramen House, lamented the fact that because the restaurant is a privately owned business, their wages will not increase. Richardson said if their food prices have to be raised, she hopes her salary will increase as well. Olivia Richardson: If we raise prices, then I\u2019m definitely asking my boss for a raise for all of us, because I only think it\u2019s fair. Richardson did mention, however, that the restaurant is currently trying other methods to bring in more profit without raising prices. Olivia Richardson: My boss has been looking into change not only, you know, possibly raising prices, but looking to other items to bring into the restaurant. Like, as you see up on our board, we put some new sushis up there. And I think she\u2019s just looking to do something a little more fresher, you know, still have our old popular items and have old stuff, but just trying to bring something new.\n\nTrinidad Mendez, an assistant manager at Momota Ramen House, attributed the reason for wage hikes to the cost of living in Los Angeles. Trinidad Mendez: Increasing minimum wages is just a response to just higher cost of living. And that is becoming like abundantly, something that has become abundantly clear to be a problem here in the city of Los Angeles, with increasing rent prices. And just overall increasing rates of homelessness\n\nTia Koonse, a legal and policy researcher at UCLA, explained that fears of wage and price increases driving customers away are unfounded. Tia Koonse: We have not seen that there\u2019s been any depreciation in customer base, or in buying power, because fast food workers are fast food customers. So when you pay your fast food workers more, they can buy more food, right? low wage workers tend to spend money in the immediate local economy, a low wage workers spending money on housing, utilities and groceries, it doesn\u2019t get much more local than that. Koonse also said that she has personally witnessed market trends over the past couple of wage increases and always seen that jobs will stay consistent and customers will keep coming back. Tia Koonse: In my, you know, 10, 15 years in the movement, seen a number of minimum wage increase. And every single time the argument is, this is going to drive up prices. This is going to result in layoffs. This is going to kill the economy. And what we\u2019ve seen is that as the minimum wage has gone up in LA County faster, even in the States, so now it\u2019s 1774 or whatever, it is an hour here. Fast food jobs is increased. So I think the data suggest that we can only expect this is going to be a net benefit.\n\nCalifornia will have another chance to prove that customers can remain loyal to the fast food market starting Monday.

And so we\u2019re gonna, like, do a project where we can like, talk to them and learn more about their stories. So I think that\u2019s just something about SCA, where you can learn about people\u2019s stories that aren\u2019t necessarily talked about as much.

Scott\u2019s comments on CNN  followed the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge after a cargo ship collided with the support beams early Tuesday morning. After the accident, images and videos of the crash and aftermath flooded newscasts and social media timelines. \u201cNo one needs to see a possibility of their family member being severely injured, or otherwise, over and over and over again because it\u2019s just traumatizing our community,\u201d Scott said.\n\nMallory Carra, a USC journalism adjunct professor, said journalists must walk a fine line when covering tragedies like these. \u201cThere are human lives lost in certain videos that we take, and we have to take that into account because it can be very traumatic for families, for victims to relive trauma like that,\u201d she said. While the responsibility of journalists is to truthfully report what has happened, Carra questioned whether or not it was necessary for viewers to be exposed to video of traumatic events. \u201cThere are many, many psychological studies saying that if you keep playing traumatic events, it will affect people,\u201d Carra said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that every news outlet has to discuss among themselves to find that fine balance because it\u2019s so, so hard because you need to inform the public.\u201d\n\nGraham Robertson, national Emmy-winning producer for NBC Network News and USC Annenberg professor, said that while he understands Scott\u2019s concerns, he sees sharing video coverage as an obligation to the public. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of our jobs as journalists to be able to show what happened,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy.\u201d From Robertson\u2019s perspective, news outlets should caution viewers before airing the videos, giving audiences the opportunity to decide whether or not they want to continue watching. \u201cIf you warn your viewer that the video could be upsetting, you don\u2019t get complaints,\u201d Robertson said.\n\nStacy Scholder, an Emmy award-winning television news producer and USC Professor of Professional Practice of Journalism, said that while there\u2019s value in showing the footage initially, subsequent coverage should consider potential impacts to the community. \u201cThere\u2019s a point after you show it initially, when it\u2019s the breaking news of the day, that I think when news organizations can respect the wishes of community, city leaders, government officials,\u201d she said. A long-time news producer herself, Scholder compared the bridge collapsing to her personal experience with news coverage of 9/11. \u201cWe decided intentionally \u2014 consciously \u2014 to stop showing the video of the planes crashing into the buildings because it\u2019s so tragic, and because it\u2019s so horrifying,\u201d Scholder said. According to Scholder, news coverage should consider the ethical, moral and philosophical implications of what it shows. \u201cThe biggest reason is not necessarily to obey a request, but more to think about the impact that this can have on other people,\u201d she said.\n\nAs of Thursday, most mainstream media outlets have continued to show the footage of the Baltimore bridge collapse.\n```"}

The Stanley Cup Playoffs don\u2019t begin for nearly a month, but all teams only have about 10 regular games left on their calendars. That\u2019s not enough time to salvage a disastrous season, but certainly enough to head into the playoffs with some steam. As the bracket shapes out, let\u2019s check in on how each current playoff team is doing approaching April.\n\nEastern Conference\n\nBoston Bruins\nThe Bruins have not been playing their best hockey lately but are still contenders to win their second-straight Presidents\u2019 Trophy. Boston\u2019s 15 overtime losses, which co-lead the NHL, indicate its problems closing out games and finding late goals. The Bruins are 1-3-0 in their last four games, with all three losses against fellow playoff teams. On the bright side, Boston defeated the Florida Panthers for the third time this season on Tuesday. Winger David Pastrnak has been a contender for the Hart Trophy all season and forwards Pavel Zacha and Charlie Coyle have had quality performances lately. If the season were to end today, the Bruins would face the Wild-Card Tampa Bay Lightning, who beat Boston in the second round of the 2020 playoffs. The Bruins have struggled against Tampa Bay this season with a 1-1-2 head-to-head record, including a 3-1 loss to the Lightning on Wednesday. With this in mind, Boston will look to win the division and avoid another first-round blunder.\n\nFlorida Panthers\nThe Panthers have had to deal with the absence of blueliner Aaron Ekblad and have cooled off a bit after dominating the league. Florida is 1-4-1 in its last six games and had a four-game losing streak to start it out. Netminder Sergei Bobrovsky is having a career year and will need to continue to be atop his game in the race to win the Atlantic Division. Center Sam Reinhart recently surpassed 50 goals for the first time in his career and is set to become a free agent this summer, so the Panthers know that his days with the organization could be numbered. With that being said, if the season ended now, Florida would take on the Toronto Maple Leafs in the playoffs, the team the Panthers defeated in the second round of the postseason last year. The Bobrovsky-led squad has a 1-0-1 record against the Leafs this season and will play Toronto twice more in the regular season.\n\nToronto Maple Leafs\nToronto hasn\u2019t had the ideal season it would\u2019ve hoped for, and still isn\u2019t guaranteed to finish in the division\u2019s top three. There\u2019s no question that the Maple Leafs are star-studded; center Auston Matthews is on pace to have the best goal-scoring season of his career with a league-leading 59 and winger William Nylander has been proven worthy of his hefty contract extension. However, Toronto hasn\u2019t been playing its best lately and has let close games slip. The Leafs will hope to get hot like they did in February when they won seven straight as the season winds down. As mentioned, Toronto would have a first-round date with Florida if the playoffs started now. Anything can happen in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, but the Maple Leafs would be lucky to stand a chance against the Panthers, who appear set to go on a deep run.\n\nNew York Rangers\nThe Blueshirts are the first team to clinch the playoffs and stand at the top of the league\u2019s standings with 100 points. A divisional title isn\u2019t imminent, however, with the Hurricanes right on their doorstep. New York is 8-2-0 in its last 10 games and is beating other contenders, too. The Rangers\u2019 power play unit has been lackluster recently but this hasn\u2019t hindered their scoring ability by any means. The goaltending pair of Igor Shesterkin and Jonathan Quick has been elite and clutch in overtime and shootout games. Winger Artemi Panarin is top-four in points with 102 and has eight in his last three appearances. New York would match up against the Washington Capitals if the season concluded today in what could be an interesting series; the Rangers are 2-2-0 against the Capitals this season but also haven\u2019t played them since January 14. New York would likely take the series easily as it has been on a tear as of late, but Washington could make things interesting.\n\nCarolina Hurricanes\nThe Hurricanes went all-in at the trade deadline, acquiring forwards Jake Guentzel and Evgeny Kuznetsov. Guentzel has 12 points in nine appearances in Carolina for a total of 64 on the season, while Kuznetsov hasn\u2019t been nearly as consistent. After missing most of the season, netminder Frederik Andersen has returned and looks utterly dominant with a .925 save percentage and 2.05 goals against average in 12 total games. Carolina is 9-2-1 in its last 12 contests and is bracing for a postseason push. The Canes would face the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round if the playoffs began today and would likely take the series with ease. Carolina is 3-1-0 in head-to-head games this year.\n\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nDefensive inconsistencies have plagued the Flyers and the team hasn\u2019t won consecutive games since February. Philadelphia has dealt with a number of injuries on the blue line but will hope to have a more or less healthy squad come late-April. Winger Owen Tippett has had a great month with 12 points in March but his team has been the definition of average. Philadelphia doesn\u2019t match up super well with Carolina. 15 points behind their Metropolitan rival, the Flyers would need to absolutely turn things around with nine games left on the schedule in order to have any sort of chance in round one.\n\nTampa Bay Lightning (Wild Card)\nTampa Bay isn\u2019t the same team that went to three straight Stanley Cup Finals, but is one that you can never count out heading into the postseason. Winger Nikita Kucherov leads the league in points with 124 and the Lightning have been hot as of late, with an 8-1-1 record in their last 10 bouts. The acquisition of winger Anthony Duclair is looking like a great move, as the 28-year-old has tallied at least one point in all but one game in a Lightning uniform. Tampa Bay versus Boston would be an electric first-round matchup. Given their playoff experience and dominance over the past years, the Bolts could very well upset the Bruins in the first round. Just two points behind Toronto, however, Tampa Bay could very well forego the Wild Card altogether.\n\nWashington Capitals (Wild Card)\nAll things considered, Washington has had a very shaky season. But the Capitals are surging at the right time, which is what the postseason push is all about. They are victors of seven of their last 10 games and have seen immense success from goalie Charlie Lindgren lately. 38-year-old winger and future Hall of Famer Alex Ovechkin has also been flat-out dominant, posting nine points in his last six games. Center Dylan Strome is on pace to have his best season and will hope to aid Washington in edging out a handful of other teams to make the playoffs. Defeating the Rangers in the playoffs would be a tall task, but it\u2019s not impossible. The Caps prevented New York\u2019s offensive production in the two teams\u2019 last two matchups, but realistically, Washington will need to play perfect to spoil the Blueshirts\u2019 Cup aspirations.\n\nWestern Conference\n\nDallas Stars\nThe Stars have won their last five games and scored at least four goals in each one. Dallas is a very deep team and hasn\u2019t needed a bonafide superstar to anchor the offense. Instead, the likes of Jason Robertson, Joe Pavelski, Matt Duchene, Wyatt Johnston and Roope Hintz have collectively produced offense at a very high rate. Goaltender Jake Oettinger has had some slips in net, but backup Scott Wedgewood has proven to be a winner with a 16-6-0 record between the pipes. Dallas would have a date with the Vegas Golden Knights in the first round if the season ended today. While Vegas has been up and down this season, it is the reigning Cup champion and shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Nonetheless, the Stars\u2019 depth and consistency should help them once the postseason comes around.\n\nColorado Avalanche\nColorado is recently coming off a nine-game win streak and looks unstoppable. Center Nathan MacKinnon has 123 points and is the frontrunner for the Hart Trophy. In a close Central Division, the Avalanche realistically could finish first, second or third but look the most polished of the bunch lately. Winger Mikko Rantanen has a whopping 20 points in 11 games in March on an offensive front that hasn\u2019t slowed down. The Avs would face the Winnipeg Jets if the season came to a close today. Colorado hasn\u2019t faced Winnipeg since mid-December but lost both contests this season. With a strong chance of finishing with the league\u2019s top record, the Avalanche are undoubtedly Stanley Cup-worthy as they hoisted it just two seasons ago.\n\nWinnipeg Jets\nThe Jets might have peaked at the wrong time. After having an electric start to the season, Winnipeg is currently on a four-game slide and looks sloppy on both ends of the ice. Connor Hellebuyck has been the league\u2019s best goaltender but the Jets\u2019 special teams defense hasn\u2019t done him many favors. Still with a shot at the Central title, Winnipeg must get out of its recent slump in order to go into the playoffs strong. A date with Colorado would be very difficult for the Jets. The two teams will square off for the third and final time this regular season on April 13 and the game could be very telling. Colorado is the better team on paper, so Winnipeg could have its back up against the wall if it can\u2019t turn things around soon.\n\nVancouver Canucks\nVancouver has been the West\u2019s best team for most of this season and has the Pacific Division crown to lose. Star netminder Thatcher Demko has been injured but that hasn\u2019t stopped the Canucks\u2019 defense from playing lights-out on many given nights. To say the Canucks\u2019 cast is star-studded would be an understatement, but they\u2019ll hope for newly acquired All-Star forward Elias Lindholm to make more of an impact in the postseason; he\u2019s only tallied nine points in 22 games as a Canuck. If the season ended today, Vancouver would play the hottest team in the NHL, the Nashville Predators. Although the Preds would be a Wild Card team, they\u2019re a squad no one should want to see in round one. But, the Canucks swept the season series against them, so they might have their number.\n\nEdmonton Oilers\nSince hiring Kris Knoblauch as head coach in November, Edmonton has been a force to be reckoned with. Zach Hyman has 51 goals on the year, Connor McDavid has 119 points and the team has become an offensive juggernaut. The Oilers\u2019 defense could use some work, but the goalie tandem of Stuart Skinner and Calvin Pickard has been consistent overall. After years of disappointment and amid a season of immense Western Conference parity, this season could present Edmonton\u2019s best chance at hoisting a Stanley Cup in the McDavid era. Potentially facing the Los Angeles Kings in the first round of the playoffs would be perfect for the Oilers; Edmonton has defeated LA in the playoffs in the last two years and is 2-1-0 in head-to-head contests this year. The Kings have been dangerous at times, but the Oilers should beat them in a seven-game series.\n\nLos Angeles Kings\nThe return of winger Adrian Kempe from injury has been big for a Kings team that has been very hit-or-miss this year. On a four-game winning streak, though, Los Angeles has looked new and improved since firing head coach Todd McLellan. While LA\u2019s offense has surged as of late, the biggest question will be if it can stay this productive through the postseason. But the Kings clearly know that finishing top-three in the stacked Pacific Division won\u2019t be easy and that is why they\u2019ve shown tons of promise lately, even against contenders like Vancouver and Tampa Bay. Falling to Edmonton in back-to-back playoffs could be a huge motivator for Los Angeles to not make it three times. When the Kings get hot, they put on a show, but the Oilers have the winning formula against them which could be the root of their downfall.\n\nNashville Predators (Wild Card)\nThe Predators have the chance to do the unthinkable after starting out the season in a slump. Nashville hasn\u2019t lost in regulation since February 15 and portrays the definition of heating up at the right time. The scrappy Preds have seen elite success from goalie Juuse Saros lately and the team is playing at a championship level on both ends of the ice. Winger Filip Forsberg has manned the offense while blueliner Roman Josi leads the defensive unit. Nashville could very well upset the Canucks if the two teams play in round one. The Predators have been a completely different team since the two last played on December 19, and look like more than just a Wild Card team hoping for a miracle.\n\nVegas Golden Knights (Wild Card)\nThe Golden Knights have been underwhelming this year, so they were very active at the trade deadline, acquiring defenseman Noah Hanifin, winger Anthony Mantha and center Tomas Hertl. But, Hertl is on long-term injury reserve while Hanifin and Mantha have only recorded five points each as Knights. Combine their woes with a recent injury to goalie Adin Hill, and Vegas looks unstable. Like some of the other playoff teams, the Golden Knights shouldn\u2019t be left out by any means, but they\u2019re not the team they were last year. Facing Dallas in the opening round could be a struggle. The two teams met in the Western Conference Finals last year and Vegas won with ease, but the Stars have been a well-coached, consistent team this season and hope for a lengthy run.\n```"}

(Photo by Kim Ly)\n\nBy Drake Lee\nMarch 28, 2024 at 9:53 am PDT\n\nIn a spacious gymnasium, a 16-year-old boy held his left arm in front of him with a volleyball in hand. He took in the sights and sounds of the arena. The stands were packed and roaring, fit for a youth league national championship game. The stadium was lukewarm, a reprieve from the unforgiving summer heat of the Las Vegas air. But the boy wasn\u2019t focused on any of that. He was focused on winning the match in front of him.\n\nIn the stands sat USC men\u2019s volleyball head coach Jeff Nygaard. He had heard reports there was a talented setter named Caleb Blanchette from Tennessee. It was the only time the coach scouted him that year. And it was the only time that was necessary.\n\n\u201cFor Coach Nygaard to fly out from Florida to Las Vegas to see me play one game, it meant the world to me,\u201d Blanchette said.\n\nSports had always been a part of Blanchette\u2019s life. His mother, Colleen Blanchette, played high school volleyball, while his father, Scott Blanchette, played college basketball. They encouraged Blanchette and his brother to play a variety of athletics, but one that stuck was volleyball.\n\n\u201cMy older brother loved it and so, since he started playing it, I started playing it,\u201d Blanchette said. \u201cI loved the thrill of it, I loved keeping the balloon off the ground.\u201d\n\nHowever, Tennessee isn\u2019t known for volleyball. Blanchette\u2019s high school didn\u2019t even have a varsity boys\u2019 volleyball team. So, he decided to play for the only club team in the state, 30 miles away from home \u2014 C2 Attack Volleyball. Players from seven different states made up the team, and they only practiced once a month.\n\n\u201cIt was almost like an All-Star team on the East Coast,\u201d Blanchette said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t practice together; we couldn\u2019t mesh together really well.\u201d\n\nIn between tournaments for his club, Blanchette played with girls\u2019 teams and adults to hone his skills. But with college coaches looking to other states for volleyball recruits, Blanchette\u2019s play remained under the radar, until he joined the USA Boys National Team and won the gold medal in the 2022 Boys Pan American Cup in Guatemala. Later that year, Blanchette won a title with his club in the U.S. U16 National Championship game in Las Vegas.\n\nBut, he and his family had to devote many hours to get to that point.\n\n\u201cThere were summers that we were home six days out of the summer,\u201d Colleen Blanchette said. \u201cWe were gone the entire summer because we were traveling for Caleb to be able to play both indoor and beach volleyball.\u201d\n\nThe match left quite an impression on Nygaard, who flew from Florida to see Blanchette play. Nygaard saw his elite skills and dedication to the sport and decided to take a chance on him, despite Tennessee not being a volleyball-oriented state.\n\n\u201cI heard one coach say it\u2019s not where you are; it\u2019s who you are,\u201d Nygaard said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a really great volleyball player who grew up in a place that doesn\u2019t have volleyball, why ask why that person popped up? Why not just go get him?\u201d\n\nBlanchette originally signed to play for the Trojans in 2025, but by taking community college courses simultaneously with his high school curriculum, he had only one class remaining for his spring semester of senior year. So, he doubled up on English classes in the fall semester and finished high school early.\n\n\u201cI could go to school early and play volleyball with the guys I\u2019m going to play with five days a week,\u201d Blanchette said. \u201cWe can train, we can lift, we can mesh together. All that just made it a no-brainer for me.\u201d\n\nBlanchette had to adjust quickly. He joined the team in December, with the first matches less than a month away and against opponents that were stronger, faster and better than anything at the club level. But Nygaard trusted the freshman enough to put him in for the first game of the season against Fort Valley State. Sharing time with junior setter Josh Friedman, Blanchette recorded 14 assists to help his team to a 3-0 victory.\n\n\u201cWhen they put him in that first game, I was like, \u2018Okay, we\u2019re doing this,\u2019\u201d Colleen Blanchette said. \u201cI\u2019ve watched him play for so many years, and I could tell he was nervous in the beginning.\u201d\n\nIn the next game, he started for the Trojans and had 23 assists. One week later, against Lincoln Memorial University, he racked up 48 assists.\n\n\u201cIn the first few weeks, it was hard trying to find my voice because I was the little guy who couldn\u2019t really say much, but the other guys on my team lifted me up and pushed me to be a better player,\u201d Blanchette said.\n\nAs of publication, Caleb Blanchette is averaging 9.10 assists per set, the 27th-best mark in Division 1, according to the NCAA. And he\u2019s doing it at just 17 years old, making him one of the youngest players in collegiate volleyball.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure seeing his growth from when he came in December to now,\u201d said Dillon Klein, USC\u2019s sophomore outside hitter. \u201cJust seeing him grow as a player and learn the game of collegiate volleyball a little bit more has been amazing.\u201d\n\nBlanchette\u2019s big-game mentality has extended to social media, as the freshman setter hopes to grow the game from coast to coast.\n\n\u201cI use my social media to show what\u2019s like out in California, where volleyball is the place to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI can give someone who wants to play volleyball a glimpse of what it\u2019s like out here to try and grow the game back on the East Coast.\u201d\n\nAs for the future, Blanchette is focused on helping build this team from the ground up.\n\n\u201cMaybe this year, we won\u2019t win a national championship, but in the future, it\u2019s definitely possible,\u201d Blanchette said. \u201cAll of us will stay together, we\u2019ll grow together and we\u2019ll become one unit. We can go so high.\u201d\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/27/previewing-every-sweet-sixteen-matchup/", "response": "```\nPreviewing every Sweet Sixteen matchup\n\nThe Talk of Troy\u2019s Tripp Carrington gives his take on every matchup in the Sweet Sixteen, including predictions for how the rest of March Madness will play out.\n\nPurdue center Zach Edey scored 25 points in the Boilermakers' last matchup with Gonzaga. (AP/Michael Conroy)\n\nBy Tripp Carrington March 27, 2024 at 10:20 pm PDT\n\nAfter an opening weekend without the usual bombardment of upsets, March Madness is set up for an excellent round of Sweet Sixteen matchups against the nation\u2019s top teams. Here is a breakdown of all of them.\n\nEast Region\n(1) Connecticut vs. (5) San Diego State\n\nIn last year\u2019s National Championship Final, the Connecticut Huskies thumped the San Diego State Aztecs, 76-59. Is that how the rematch will play out? Of the eight players who scored in Connecticut\u2019s championship effort against the Aztecs last season, only three returned to play for the 2024 Huskies. Senior Tristen Newton, sophomore Alex Karaban, and sophomore Donovan Clingan scored roughly 37% of the team\u2019s points in last year\u2019s final, which means that San Diego State is looking at a very different Connecticut team in preparation for their Sweet Sixteen matchup.\n\nHowever, the Aztecs are in a similar position. They also returned three scorers from last season\u2019s championship loss. All seniors\u2014Jaedon Ledee, Lamont Butler and Darrion Trammell\u2014scored more than 55% of San Diego State\u2019s points in the final, a higher proportion than Connecticut\u2019s returners. Does that make the Aztecs more prepared for the rematch? Not necessarily. The three returning Huskies increased their scoring output by a collective 15.5 points per game, and Connecticut added two new double-digit scorers to their roster this season. Freshman Stephon Castle and Cam Spencer, a senior transfer from Rutgers, add a combined 25.2 points per game to the stat sheet this season, including 47 points in this tournament so far.\n\nSan Diego State\u2019s lone double-digit scorer is Ledee, who has scored 58 points himself in the Aztecs\u2019 first two rounds. San Diego State\u2019s round of 64 matchup against the No. 12 seed UAB Blazers unexpectedly came down the last few possessions. They drew another double-digit seed in the round of 32, the No. 13 seed Yale Bulldogs, but easily blew them out. On the other hand, Connecticut has looked completely dominant in their first two games, including a dismantling of Northwestern in which the Huskies once had a 30-point lead.\n\nThe Pick: Connecticut\n\nConnecticut plays drop coverage on ball screens more than most teams in the country, which will give San Diego State some open looks. However, the Aztecs aren\u2019t particularly fond of shooting (or making) 3-pointers, and the Huskies\u2019 top-three offense will be a lot to handle for a defense accustomed to smaller, less talented Mountain West Conference teams. Expect Connecticut to move on to the Elite Eight.\n\n(2) Iowa State vs. (3) Illinois\n\nIn what might be the best matchup of the Sweet Sixteen, the Iowa State Cyclones\u2019 No. 1-ranked defense will face off against the Illinois Fighting Illinis\u2019 No. 1-ranked offense. Illinois is led by their 6-6 senior combo guard, Terrence Shannon, who has averaged 23.3 points per game on the season and 28 points per game through the Fighting Illinis\u2019 first two games of the tournament.\n\nHowever, Shannon\u2019s impressive scoring outburst in the first weekend of March Madness wasn\u2019t against elite competition. Both of Illinois\u2019s opponents were double-digit mid-major schools (No. 14 seed Morehead State and No. 11 seed Duquesne), and neither of them put up much of a fight. The Fighting Illinis come into the Sweet Sixteen having outscored their NCAA Tournament matchups by an average of 21 points, which indicates an encouraging level of dominance so far.\n\nIowa State easily handled their first-round game, but the Cyclones didn\u2019t \u201cdominate\u201d the No. 7 seed Washington State Cougars in the second round. However, Iowa State\u2019s slower tempo and defensive focus does not translate to big margins of victory, and they have proven themselves as worthy opponents against elite competition. Counting their round of 32 victory, the Cyclones enter this week having won their last four games against ranked opponents, including the Baylor Bears and Houston Cougars en route to their Big 12 Conference Tournament Championship victory.\n\nOn the other hand, Illinois has struggled against elite competition this year. They played in five games versus ranked opponents, with their lone victory coming against a Florida Atlantic Owls squad that lost in the round of 64 and hasn\u2019t been ranked in over a month.\n\nThe Pick: Iowa State\n\nThe schematic matchup here is fascinating. Iowa State hedges and blitzes ball handlers in screening action more than any other defense in the country, but Illinois is deadly-efficient from 2-point range and will welcome double teams at the top of the key. The Fighting Illini defense is the opposite: they almost never blitz and play drop coverage more than almost anyone. That will leave Iowa State with 3-point opportunities, which they are hit-or-miss with this season. However, last week the Cyclones hit 48.6% of their attempts beyond the arc. Are they due for regression, or will their hot streak continue? This game is a coin flip, but because Iowa State is more battle-tested, I would lean in their direction.\n\nUltimately, I would take the winner of Connecticut/San Diego State over Illinois/Iowa State to advance to the Final Four.\n\nWest Region\n(2) Arizona vs. (6) Clemson\n\nAlthough this tournament hasn\u2019t had nearly as many upsets as most iterations of March Madness, not many fans expected to see the No. 6 seed Clemson Tigers still alive in the second weekend. One of the trendiest upset picks for the round of 64 was the No. 11 seed New Mexico Lobos to knock out the Tigers, but Clemson more than survived, blowing out the Lobos by more than 20 points. Then the Tigers pulled off an upset of their own, bouncing the No. 3 Baylor Bears, who were favored by about five points.\n\nCan Clemson keep it going against the Arizona Wildcats? Arizona is coming off of two double digit victories, and their star senior transfer Caleb Love scored more than 18 points in both. Love spent his last three seasons with the North Carolina Tar Heels, who are used to playing Clemson in ACC play. Love won each of his last two matchups against the Tigers and scored a combined 33 points on 24 attempts in the wins.\n\nClemson has played against Arizona just three times in school history and never won, but their last matchup was over ten years ago. The Tigers do not often face Pac-12 competition: their last meeting was in an eight point victory over the California Golden Bears in 2022.\n\nThe Pick: Arizona\n\nThe Wildcats are No. 2 seed for a reason, and it would be hard to pick against them here. Clemson lost three of their last four games heading into March Madness and got lucky in the first two rounds with clear schematic advantages over New Mexico and Baylor. With Arizona\u2019s blazing-fast offensive tempo and elite talent on both ends, Clemson will no longer have the schematic upper hand.\n\n(1) North Carolina vs. (4) Alabama\n\nThe North Carolina Tar Heels have a top-20 offense and top-10 defense, and they put their well-balanced attack on full display in the opening rounds of the tournament. In their opener, the Tar Heels blew out the No. 16 seed Wagner Seahawks. While they were favored in the round of 32 against the No. 9 seed Michigan State Spartans, the game did not play out as closely as expected. Michigan State entered the game ranked as the No. 16 team per Kenpom, and they were only 3.5 point underdogs despite North Carolina being the No. 1 seed in the West Region. However, North Carolina more than quadrupled the spread and punched their ticket to the Sweet Sixteen with a 16-point victory.\n\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide similarly cruised to the tournament\u2019s second weekend, albeit against inferior competition. The Crimson Tide dropped 109 points on Charleston\u2019s head in the first round and beat Grand Canyon by double digits in the round of 32. Alabama is characterized by its high-pace offensive tempo, which ranks eighth nationally per Kenpom, but their defense is not very strong.\n\nThe Pick: North Carolina\n\nThe blueprint to beat Alabama is to keep pace with their offense and try to outscore them. In this year\u2019s tournament field, there were five teams that ranked in the top 50 fastest tempos and top 20 most efficient offenses per Kenpom. Two of them are Alabama and North Carolina, two of them were eliminated in the first round (Kentucky and Florida) and one of them could very well be waiting for the winner of this game in the Elite Eight: Arizona. I don\u2019t see Alabama surviving both of those matchups, and with their talent and experience, North Carolina has proven that they have a better chance of playing in Phoenix next week.\n\nSouth Region\n(2) Marquette vs. (11) N.C. State\n\nThe NCAA Tournament is known for parity and lots of upsets, but only one double-digit seed advanced to the Sweet Sixteen this year: the No. 11 seed N.C. State Wolfpack. The Wolfpack started the season an impressive 11-3 before an abysmal 6-11 stretch to end their regular season. Then, N.C. State stole a bid to March Madness by winning five games in five days en route to an ACC Conference Tournament Championship victory. They are the 2024 Cinderella team.\n\nCan they keep it going against the Marquette Golden Eagles? Last season, Marquette bowed out of their No. 2 seed campaign early, but head coach Shaka Smart brought back almost the entire team for this year. Per Kenpom, the Golden Eagles rank third in minutes continuity, which means only two other teams retained more of their contributing roster from last season. Their leading scorer on the year, Kameron Jones, averaged 23 points per game last week and has experience against ACC competition. Since his sophomore season, Jones has averaged 18.3 points per game on 50% shooting against ACC opponents.\n\nHowever, the Golden Eagles have not faced off against N.C. State since 2009, which means they have never faced D.J. Burns Jr, the Wolfpack\u2019s star big man who has taken the country by storm. Burns weighs in at 260 pounds and dominates opposing defenses in the post. During N.C. State\u2019s seven-game win streak since the start of the ACC Tournament, Burns has averaged 16.6 points per game while making 64.9% of his field goal attempts, an absurdly efficient mark.\n\nThe Pick: Marquette ... in a toss-up\n\nWill Marquette be able to stop him? Defensively, the Golden Eagles are prone to giving up threes, which gives N.C. State a chance to win, but only if they shift their style of play. Talent-wise, the No. 2 seed Golden Eagles have the No. 11 seed Wolfpack outmatched, and they have the schematic advantage, as well. Still, this one\u2019s a coin flip based on how hot N.C. State is coming into this game.\n\n(1) Houston vs. (4) Duke\n\nIt took an overtime period for the Houston Cougars to get rid of the No. 9 seed Texas A&M Aggies in the round of 32, easily the closest any of the No. 1 seeds came to missing the Sweet Sixteen. Should fans be worried about Houston\u2019s chances? Houston ranks as the No. 2 defense per Kenpom, and they meet all of the criteria of recent championship teams. However, their strengths are the same as they have been in the past few seasons, and in each of the last three years, Houston was eliminated by a team with a top-10 Kenpom offense. The Duke Blue Devils currently rank as the No. 5 offense, and they have cruised to the Sweet Sixteen behind an average margin of victory of 27.5 points against two mid-major schools, Vermont and James Madison.\n\nNow, against a power-five opponent, the Blue Devils will look to continue their offensive success. Duke has five double-digit scorers and is led by senior seven-footer Kyle Filipowski, who contributes more than 16 points and eight rebounds per game. However, he scored only 17 points last week, which shows that the Blue Devils do not rely on a single offensive option.\n\nThe Pick: Duke\n\nBecause of Houston\u2019s failure to stop elite offenses in past tournaments, I slightly lean Duke in this matchup. However, the Cougars are more battle-tested: against ranked opponents, Duke is 2-3, whereas Houston is 6-2, including wins against Iowa State and Baylor. The South Region is the only quadrant of the bracket where all four teams left have a feasible chance of making the Final Four, and Houston and Duke are the region\u2019s two best teams.\n\nMidwest Region\n(1) Purdue vs. (5) Gonzaga\n\nMost bracket makers picked the Connecticut Huskies to cut down the nets (which seems like a solid pick in its own right), but the No. 1 seed Purdue Boilermakers were the most dominant team through the first two rounds of the tournament. They crushed Grambling State by 28 points, and they led by 41 points before resting most key contributors in their rout of the Utah State Aggies. The Boilermakers are shooting 42.6% from three as a team, and Zach Edey has averaged 26.5 points per game. On Nov. 20, Edey scored 25 against the Gonzaga Bulldogs defense in a ten-point victory. Purdue made less than 25% of their threes in that game and still won by double digits, but Gonzaga has improved since then.\n\nAfter starting 11-5, a far cry from their usual regular season dominance, the Bulldogs have gone 16-2, including wins versus Kentucky, Saint Mary\u2019s, and Kansas in the round of 32 last week. Against the Jayhawks, Gonzaga senior Anton Watson led the way with 21 points. Watson is one of three Gonzaga starters taller than 6-7, but none of them are close to Edey\u2019s height at 7-4.\n\nThe Pick: Purdue\n\nGonzaga\u2019s size will likely be a detriment to them in this matchup, as they don\u2019t have the bodies to stop Edey, and their taller starters will be unable to chase around Purdue\u2019s lethal guard attack that can score from the perimeter. Purdue is a team of destiny, and it would be shocking if they lost in the Sweet Sixteen.\n\n(2) Tennessee vs. (3) Creighton\n\nThe Tennessee Volunteers are buoyed by the most versatile scorer in the country, Dalton Knecht, who averages 21.1 points per game this season and can get buckets from all three levels of the court. Although he struggled shooting in the first two rounds (39.4% from the floor), he has given the Volunteers 20.5 points per game and will need to continue to score while increasing his efficiency if the Volunteers are to continue winning in this tournament.\n\nIn fact, their round of 32 match against Texas went down to the wire, resulting in a narrow four-point victory. On the other hand, it took the Creighton Bluejays two overtime periods to beat the No. 11 seed Oregon Ducks. The Bluejays shot 44.6% from three last week, which is well above their season average. Their main contributors, Ryan Kalkbrenner and Trey Alexander, are playing to their usual standard, while the supporting cast has taken things up a notch.\n\nWhether or not Creighton advances will largely depend on the play of their bench. The Pick: Tennessee\n\nTennessee has the No. 3-ranked defense in the country and plays a multitude of defensive coverages at an elite level. Therefore, Creighton will have to play a near-perfect offensive game to beat the Volunteers. Conversely, Creighton plays drop coverage almost exclusively, which will give Tennessee open looks from beyond the arc and in deep mid-range. With that in mind, expect Tennessee to lean on their top scorer. Where Knecht goes, Tennessee goes, but I would expect either of these teams to lose to Purdue in the proverbial Elite Eight matchup.\n```"}

The pill has since been used in about 63% of all U.S. abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The Biden administration is trying to defend access to mifepristone against anti-abortion and pro-life groups.\n\nThe Supreme Court hearing touched on a variety of potential issues, such as whether doctors would be allowed to refuse to participate in abortions based on their personal beliefs. Dr. Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists, appeared in court to argue against the current accessibility of abortion pills.\n\nChristina Francis: So I have actually taken care of women in our emergency room, who have come in with complications and had to do procedures to finish, you know, removing the contents of their pregnancy from their uterus. But, you know, again, it\u2019s the FDA\u2019s actions and removing these safeguards that would give women an in-person visit. I have been brought down to the emergency room to complete the process that was started by these abortion drugs. And again, this is happening more and more frequently because women are not even receiving in-person medical care prior to receiving these high-risk medications because of the FDA\u2019s decisions.\n\nAmy Hagstrom Miller is the Founder and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, a clinic that provides abortion and gynecological care services. She believes that the conservative party\u2019s argument is \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cextreme\u201d.\n\nAmy Hagstrom Miller: So this isn\u2019t about safety. This isn\u2019t about medical information. What you heard today was justices actually not understanding science. This is about power, it\u2019s about control. It\u2019s about restricting people\u2019s access to safe medical care. This isn\u2019t about science. It\u2019s about a small group of people\u2019s feelings and beliefs being applied to the majority of Americans who don\u2019t agree with those beliefs.\n\nThe Comstock Act, an 1873 law that made it illegal to send \u201cobscene, lewd,\u201d \u201clascivious,\u201d \u201cimmoral,\u201d or \u201cindecent\u201d materials, was also discussed at court. This raised the question of whether mail deliveries of abortion pills violated this law.\n\nOver two-thirds of college students report that their \u201ceducation goals would be negatively impacted\u201d if they had a child, according to the National Institutes of Health. We spoke to women across the USC campus to see what they thought about the hearing.\n\nIvy Kos: Currently, I believe pregnancy is classified as a disability. So restricting that is, is restricting a person\u2019s right to self-defense, essentially, and when we put it in that light, and in that context, which it is what it is, it\u2019s very like it very, it sets a dangerous precedent, if that\u2019s what it\u2019s used for.\n\nSarina Sharma-Welsh: I think it\u2019s wrong and none of the business of congressmen or congress people to make that decision for women. Just the principle of the thing knowing that I wouldn\u2019t be able to access something that I believe is my right.\n\nEva Kracht: I needed that in the future, and I wasn\u2019t allowed access to that. I think that would I get angry with that, especially knowing that the government took that right away from me.\n\nThat was Ivy Kos, Sarina Sharma-Welsh, and Eva Kracht, 3 USC women who feel that their rights over their own body are being threatened.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, no decisions from the hearing have been released.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Tamara Almoayed.\n```"}

The University\u2019s expanded U-Pass program rolled out last semester and thousands of students have used it.\n\nThe Metro U-Pass is available to all USC students. (Photo by Nina Moothedath)\n\nBy Nina Moothedath\nMarch 27, 2024 at 6:31 pm PDT\n\nIt\u2019s a Friday afternoon. Under a clear, blue sky six people wait for the next Metro train at the Expo Park/USC station. Some stand, some sit and one student with a bright red backpack practices his kickflips. One of those people is Desirae Ridley, a sophomore Business Administration student waiting to go home. She scans in with her U-Pass card, which she uses to go to and from campus.\n\nDesirae Ridley: I heard about it originally from my roommate, and I was like, oh, yeah, we\u2019re getting that so we can go as many places as we can.\n\nU-Pass, short for Universal College Student Transit Pass, allows students like Ridley to take unlimited rides on LA Metro and buses. Last semester, they became available to all USC students for the first time, under the $93 transportation fee every student pays. That fee funds USC\u2019s Lyft Rides program, commonly known as Fryft, campus shuttles and this newly expanded U-Pass program.\n\nRidley: For, like, even specifically the Metro, it takes you virtually almost all over L.A., and it\u2019s free for students, you know you can ride it any day of the week. It runs all throughout breaks and stuff like that.\n\nBefore, U-Passes were only available for graduate students and cost 90 dollars to purchase. Data from USC Transportation shows that around 480 graduate students purchased or renewed a U-Pass card the spring semester before the change. In comparison, over 10,000 students received U-Passes last semester.\n\nAssociate Director with USC Transportation David Donovan said the split between undergraduate and graduate students who applied for these U-Passes surprised him.\n\nDavid Donovan: So what we thought would happen would be that since it was being offered for undergraduate students for the very first time and since it was being offered for free for the very first time, that there would be an incredible uptake among the undergraduate students of the program. But of the 10,000 we distributed, there were about it was really, again, about 50/50 right down the line between graduate passes and undergraduate passes. And that was, to us, a surprising result.\n\nUSC Rideshare coordinator Eddie Soule hopes that U-Pass and other services supported by the transportation fee give students access to more convenient and sustainable transportation options.\n\nEddie Soule: We\u2019re offering alternatives, right? In this goal of being more sustainable, we\u2019re providing solutions for people, like, real solutions that people can participate in daily.\n\nHelping students travel to and from campus is a major benefit of the expanded U-Pass program. However, Donovan also hopes students use it for more.\n\nDonovan: By the end of calendar year 2024, they\u2019ll have the opportunity to use this pass to go to LAX. We really look forward to students taking advantage of the opportunities they have to explore Los Angeles, travel for free using their Metro card. And be on the lookout for announcements from us. I know that transportation emails aren\u2019t the sexiest thing, but when you see a transportation email come across, please do pay attention to it.\n\nFor Ridley, the U-Pass has been helpful for visiting concerts, the beach, and downtown with friends. In fact, she said she\u2019s started telling other students to use it too.\n\nRidley: You\u2019re here only here for, you know, three or four years, depending if you\u2019re a transfer. And like, just go out and do things because you\u2019re only in college once, you\u2019re only this young once and so, like, go out and have the fun when you can.\n\nWhether students are trying to be more sustainable, don\u2019t have access to a car or just want to have options, the expanded U-Pass program provides a new way to get around LA.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Nina Moothedath.\n```"}

USC women\u2019s basketball gave students the unique experience of watching their team play two March Madness games on their home court.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity to attend the games because we are a 1 seed and were able to host is kind of unparalleled,\u201d said Adam Jasper, who graduated from USC last winter.

USC defeated its first opponent, 16th-seeded Texas A&M-Corpus Christi, 87-55 on Saturday at Galen Center. Over 8,000 students and other fans began flocking in one hour before tipoff.

Not one person really carries a team. It\u2019s a whole collective unit compared to some of the other sports.\n\nLuden countered the idea that baseball is boring by saying that every sport has slow moments. He likes to watch all the players on the field - there\u2019s always something going on in the game. And in recent years, MLB has reacted to the critiques of the sport. To make games more watchable on TV, the MLB instituted rules including pitch clocks, shortening games.\n\nLuden: I think after last year, no, just because of you know, the rule changes, I think, got more people into watching baseball. And you can see that, you know, like attendance numbers rose, viewership rose across the board last year, because of the rule changes. They made the game faster.\n\nSo what does Luden suggest someone who is on the fence about watching baseball do? Luden: Supporting your local team would be step number one. And step number two would be to actually go and see a game, because baseball is the cheapest sport in terms of ticket prices. So that\u2019s another thing too, if you want to go watch a game, it\u2019s going to be probably your best bet to save money compared to you know, a basketball game, hockey game and NFL game, just because of how many games are in season, and experiences unlike any other.\n\nRight now, you can get tickets to Dodgers Stadium for as little as $15 and Angels tickets for just $1, if you\u2019re willing to make the drive out to Anaheim.

The award winners each presented results and lessons learned from their grant programs, each aimed at integrating sustainability into brand new or existing undergraduate courses.\n\nJill Sohm, the Academic Director for the Sustainability Across the Curriculum Initiative, said the initiative is important for increasing conversations of sustainability in the classroom.\n\nJill Sohm: This initiative started out as a way to give support through grants to faculty who wanted to incorporate sustainability into their classes; either existing classes or create brand new classes and also to give them resources to be able to learn how to do that and actually produce those classes.\n\nColin Maclay, an SACI grant winner and Director of the Annenberg Innovation lab, agreed saying the initiative and symposium are important for sharing ideas and developing new teaching strategies.\n\nColin Maclay: The opportunity to have an interdisciplinary conversation to hear how others are teaching how others are learning what others are seeing, is just hugely valuable to kind of help us to reflect on our own practice, and ideally, to improve it.\n\nThe symposium was primarily for USC faculty to share information and learn how participants in the SACI program approached teaching sustainability in their classrooms.\n\nMaclay taught Climate Stories, a brand new class in which journalist and communications students worked on how to talk about climate change in a way that everyone would be able to understand. Maclay added that the students were very engaged.\n\nMaclay: We were on a learning journey together. And we recognize that this big suite of really complex topics, we all had lots to learn, and we all had something to share. And so we kind of took it on together and really encouraged students to follow the things that they were excited about an interested in.\n\nAs for the future, the initiative is not accepting new applications currently but is hoping to start accepting new applications before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Tobey Groome.\n```"}

Tolson is the first Black person and second woman to hold the position in the school\u2019s 123-year history. President Carol Folt expressed excitement over Tolson\u2019s appointment in a letter from the provost that went out Wednesday. The letter said Tolson would be elevated from her position as interim dean, which she has held since July 1, 2023.\n\nThis historical significance of Tolson's appointment was not lost on students at Gould. \u201cObviously, we all know she\u2019s our first African American dean and our second female dean, and I think that is a signal for female students of color,\u201d said Zarifah Shahid, a first year law student at USC. \u201cI\u2019m sure that will be encouraging for a lot of students to see a person like that in such a high place.\u201d\n\nStudents at the Gould School of Law said they were thrilled to see the permanent job went to someone who already knows the school. \u201cHiring in house can be really good to create a lot of stability,\u201d said Lincoln Currie, a first year law student at Gould. \u201cYou also encourage people to stay and develop roots, and that\u2019s a really good thing for us.\u201d\n\nTolson, who will hold the Carl Mason Franklin Chair in Law, brings years of expertise to her new role. Before her time at USC, she worked as an assistant professor of law and Betty T. Ferguson Professor of Voting Rights at Florida State University, as well as serving a visiting assistant professorship at Northwestern University. Tolson has also published two books, numerous essays and opinion pieces. A nationally recognized expert in election law, Tolson has provided commentary for such notable outlets as The New York Times and CNN.\n\nDuring the fall of 2020, Tolson worked as an election law analyst for CNN, as well as co-hosted an election themed podcast, \u201cFree and Fair with Franita and Foley,\u201d alongside Ned Foley of the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law. \u201cI\u2019m really happy that we\u2019re choosing somebody who has a lot of experience in voting rights,\u201d Currie said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to be talking about the law and how it intersects with voting rights, election rights, how these issues are getting litigated in courts, and laws are being passed right now.\u201d\n\nGould students excitedly welcomed Tolson into her new position as someone they already knew. \u201cShe does have an open-door policy,\u201d Shahid said. \u201cShe\u2019s been very involved, at least with first-year law students.\u201d Currie said the students\u2019 familiarity with the new dean helps give her credibility with the students. \u201cThere can be a problem if the leader is just there when something goes wrong, or they need to make a big pronouncement about something,\u201d Currie said. \u201cIt is good that we do see her around and she is a familiar face.\u201d\n```"}

The flavors that will be offered are original glaze, chocolate iced with sprinkles, and chocolate ice Kream filled.\n\nEgor Cherkashin, a Junior computer science and Business student said he\u2019s interested in this collaboration as he thinks it will benefit Krispy Kreme noting McDonalds popularity.\n\nEgor Cherkashin: I think it\u2019s a it\u2019s a good way for both the brands to kind of like just promote mutual consumption. It\u2019s an unexpected collaboration for me, you know I would not expect McDonalds to go doughnuts.\n\nDallas Gardner, a freshman human biology major said he\u2019s willing to try it out even if it isn\u2019t the same quality as an actual Krispy Kreme doughnut.\n\nDallas Gardner: I did see that yesterday on Instagram. I think it\u2019s a good idea. I haven\u2019t been to Krispy Kreme in a long time, even though I do love their donuts. And I think that I could go there more often with the availability of McDonald\u2019s everywhere.\n\nJulie who was unaware of the launch said she didn\u2019t have much of an opinion on the union of the two fast food establishments.\n\nJulie: I guess when I go to McDonald\u2019s. I\u2019m not really looking for doughnuts but I guess I could see it happening a late night, Ron, you know 4am Where else are you gonna go? Maybe you want to donut? Suppose that could happen.\n\nFor Julie she thinks this might cause competition with other donut establishments.\n\nJulie: I think people would buy doughnuts from McDonald\u2019s, but it seems like they\u2019re competing with Dunkin Donuts that point.\n\nWhether you knew about it or not Krispy Kreme and McDonalds will be joining forces in just under two years to be offered nationwide. This comes after an initial successful test run of 160 McDonalds locations in the Lexington and, Louisville, Kentucky areas.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Joel Robles.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Alea Motwane and Malcolm Caminero\nMarch 27, 2024 at 5:57 pm PDT\n\nOver the last few weeks, USC had been declaring and changing their decisions about the status of the Academic Achievement Award and Exceptional Funding. The AAA is a program that provides a tuition benefit for students to register for up to 21 units per semester at the standard full-time tuition rate given that they meet GPA requirements of 3.75. This award is beneficial to those pursuing a multiple major or minor degree. Exceptional Funding covers tuition for Presidential and Trustee scholars who wish to enroll in more than 18 units during a semester. Exceptional Funding can be used to afford additional academic courses throughout the duration of scholarship eligibility.\n\nIn an email sent out on March. 8, USC shared that the Academic Achievement Award and Exceptional Funding will be discontinued starting Fall 2024. However, On March. 15, Andrew McConnell Stott, USC\u2019s vice provost for academic programs and the dean of the graduate school, said the Academic Achievement Award (AAA) program wouldn\u2019t be completely discontinued, and that the AAA would be available to students who graduate by August \u201825. On the other hand, Stott had this to say.\n\nStott: No new incoming students with Presidential or Trustee scholarships will be able to access Exceptional Funding moving forward, but current students who have that as part of their admission letter, they can still access it until they graduate.\n\nThese decisions spiked outrage from the students at USC. Among them, senior theater major Shaina Franks had this to say about the issue.\n\nShaina Franks: I did know that you know the university doesn\u2019t always respond to outrage from students but I also knew that this was like a new level.\n\nFinally, on March 25th, the Academic Achievement Award and Exceptional Funding was reinstated with the same eligibility criteria. Andrew T. Guzman, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs wrote in a letter to Annenberg Media: We received feedback from the community about sunsetting the programs, including from students affected by this change, and we listened. Supporting our students is a top priority of all of us at USC.\n\nThere are no additional details available beyond the provided letter.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Alea Motwane.\n```"}

Springfest will take place on April 6 at 4 p.m. The concert is the first event hosted on USC\u2019s newly renovated McCarthy Quad, according to Co-Executive Director of USC Concerts Committee Shea Hanke.\n\n\u201cThis is the last show of the year,\u201d said Hanke. \u201cWe have five incredible acts who are all hand-picked because we believe that the students would love them. It\u2019s a big end-of-year congratulations to all of the hard work that all of our students have been putting in.\u201d\n\nFunding for Springfest comes from the Undergraduate Student Government\u2019s programming budget. USG allocated $560,000 to put on three concerts: Welcome Back, Conquest and Springfest, according to Riley Wheaton, the other co-executive director of USC Concerts Committee. The USC Concerts Committee works with college agents to create the best possible lineup that fits within the committee\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mix-match game of what can we afford within our budget range and what\u2019s going to be appealing to the masses,\u201d said Wheaton. \u201cYou want to make sure that we\u2019re representing a lot of different communities and putting together a holistic lineup that people are going to be excited about.\u201d\n\nThe USC Concerts Committee has to pay for \u201ceverything you see on the quad,\u201d from the stage to security, said Wheaton. \u201cI remember last year, when I looked at it, it ended up being around 73% that goes towards production costs, and only 27% goes towards artists,\u201d said Wheaton. Inflation has increased production costs and has been a challenge for the USC Concerts Committee since the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWhen you scroll back on a lot of our archive posts on Instagram and see the magnitude that the shows used to have on campus, it looks like a Coachella stage,\u201d said Hanke. \u201cI think that they had a much larger budget and at that time, money went a lot further.\u201d\n\nDespite these challenges, the USC Concerts Committee \u201cgot creative\u201d and has big plans for this year\u2019s show. The Concerts Committee is changing up the layout of the event. They are planning on having two stages across from each other for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe have a dueling student stage, which is something new we\u2019re doing this year,\u201d said Hanke. \u201cSo you can run back and forth kind of like a real music festival.\u201d\n\nThe USC Concerts Committee said they work hard to ensure McCarthy Quad, a space students typically use as a study space, play frisbee on and walk through to get to class, transforms from a university quad to a festival grounds.\n\n\u201cWe really try to reinvent the space,\u201d said Wheaton. \u201cFor Conquest, we had a Ferris wheel and different blow-up obstacle course things. Last year at Springfest, we had this big colorful obstacle course there as an art piece.\u201d\n\nAccording to the USC Concerts Committee, Springfest strives to involve students as much as possible. This spring\u2019s concert will feature a student vendor village and student artist showcase.\n\n\u201cOur student vendor village is something we have had for the past few years, at least since COVID,\u201d said Hanke. \u201cWe really love highlighting student talent. We actually have student artists in some format at every one of our shows.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoing it with a dueling stage will hopefully bring a little bit more of a platform to student artists,\u201d said Hanke.\n\nThis school year, Pi\u2019erre Bourne headlined the Welcome Back concert, and Icona Pop headlined the Conquest concert. Jace Smolansky, the assistant executive director of the USC Concerts Committee, said they are excited to make Springfest their best concert to date.\n\n\u201cOur committee had a lot of turnover following COVID, so Welcome Back was a lot of our committee\u2019s first show,\u201d said Smolansky. \u201cFor this show, we\u2019re just excited to bring everyone\u2019s past experience from the past two shows and let every committee shine in their field.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason you wouldn\u2019t want to see  \u201cEscapism,\u201d   \u201cDanielle\u201d and   \u201cGhost Town\u201d  go down live,\u201d said Wheaton. \u201cLike how can you get Kanye and Fred again.. at the same time?\u201d\n```"}

(AP/Ryan Sun)\n\nBy Matt Kim March 27, 2024 at 4:35 pm PDT\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 In their final spring training series, the Angels looked sharp against Dodgers, defeating their crosstown rivals twice in three games. The Angels now have their sights set on Thursday\u2019s Opening Day matchup against the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nThe Angels finished with a 14-15 record in Cactus League play, as newly-hired manager Ron Washington gave plenty of auditions to fill the holes on a now Shohei Ohtani-less roster. As the Angels finalized their 26-man Opening Day roster, they optioned RHPs Zach Plesac, Ben Joyce and Victor Mederos to Triple-A.\n\nPlesac and Joyce struggled throughout the spring, especially Joyce, who walked nine batters in just 7.1 innings. Mederos had a solid showing, pitching to a 3.12 ERA, but the Angels felt it would be best if the 22-year-old began the season in Triple-A to continue his development as a future starter.\n\nThe Angels Opening Day starting rotation will feature Patrick Sandoval, Reid Detmers, Tyler Anderson, Griffin Canning, Jose Soriano and Chase Silseth. As a group, they posted middling results throughout the spring and they\u2019ll be put to test against an Orioles lineup that helped them win 101 games in 2023.\n\nThe Angels pitching staff will have to limit walks and pitch deep into ball games in this series. This staff has shown in the past that they\u2019re capable of competing at a high level on individual outings, but they\u2019ll all need to be in sync to succeed in a competitive AL West.\n\nIn other roster news, OF Aaron Hicks cracked the Opening Day roster alongside fellow outfielders Jo Adell and Mickey Moniak. Hicks had a tremendous spring and showed that his strong showing with the Orioles last summer wasn\u2019t a fluke. After it seemed like Hicks\u2019 career had completely fallen off he\u2019ll be competing for the final outfield spot.\n\nFor Moniak, the former first overall pick in 2016 started Cactus League play slowly, but finished with an .825 OPS to build off of an above-average 2023 season. Although Moniak mostly faces right-handed pitching, if the Angels see him as part of the future, they\u2019ll need to show him more at-bats against lefties to ease him into a starting role.\n\nRHP Corbin Burnes will most likely be the Orioles Opening Day starter, so skipper Ron Washington may give Moniak the nod against the righty. Adell, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t quite find his footing, as his lackluster spring may leave him on the bench to begin the season.\n\nAdell has always possessed the raw power, but he hasn\u2019t been able to translate that against big league pitching. The Angels have a tough task ahead of them against an Orioles lineup that features some of the best young talent in baseball.\n\nC Adley Rutschman and SS Gunnar Henderson are already considered to be some of the best players in the game, while RHP Grayson Rodriguez, OF Cedric Mullins and OF Austin Hays\u2014just to name a few\u2014have all been above average contributors at the major league level.\n\nThe Angels still have Mike Trout of course, alongside 3B Anthony Rendon and INFs Luis Rengifo, Zach Neto and Nolan Schanuel. If this core manages to produce while staying healthy, this Angels team can compete with anybody in the American League.\n\nWith Trout, while he\u2019s towards the back half of his prime, he\u2019s still a superstar centerfielder when healthy and he\u2019ll be in the MVP conversation alongside younger stars like Aaron Judge and Yordan Alvarez.\n\nMost baseball fans have counted out the Angels, as their roster looks completely different from when they were vying for a playoff spot last season. However, with the expectations lower than years past, they surprise the baseball world and make their first playoff appearance since 2014.\n```"}

(Photo by Ethan Thai)\n\nBy Suzanne Schofield March 27, 2024 at 2:08 pm PDT\n\nAs USC football continues its spring practice sessions, the atmosphere is charged with anticipation and enthusiasm. Under the guidance of head coach Lincoln Riley, and with the addition of transfer redshirt freshman quarterback Jayden Maiava, the Trojans are undergoing a transformation, both in terms of play style and team dynamics.\n\nRiley aims to bring a fresh sense of purpose to USC\u2019s football program through his meticulous approach to practice and player development. He prioritizes fundamentals and technique to enhance the team\u2019s physicality and competitiveness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been two really physical days and the guys have gotten after it,\u201d Riley said after Tuesday\u2019s practice. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get more physical, you have to get bigger and stronger. ...We\u2019ve really tried to kind of slow down and to be able to really spend time and emphasize the technique and fundamental side with these guys.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the team\u2019s performance, Riley emphasized Maiava\u2019s maturity and work ethic, underscoring his swift adaptation to the team\u2019s offensive schemes, despite his limited time with the program.\n\n\u201cGiven that it\u2019s his first few practices with us, he\u2019s off to a good start. He\u2019s not some true freshman coming in here that\u2019s wide eyed. He\u2019s played; he\u2019s learned how to prepare and you see that out on the field.\u201d\n\nMaiava\u2019s journey from UNLV to USC underscored his unwavering commitment to excellence. Reflecting on his decision to transfer, Maiava expressed admiration for Riley\u2019s coaching expertise and determination to make an impact on the team.\n\n\u201cI wanted to play under Lincoln Riley and just the things that he\u2019s done, the accomplishments that he has underneath his belt, and being able to go out there and compete against the best,\u201d Maiava said.\n\nAll eyes are focused on the relationship between Maiava and fellow teammate Miller Moss as they compete for the quarterback position.\n\n\u201cI love that guy [Miller Moss]. Hats off to him for what he\u2019s done in his past and all his accomplishments,\u201d Maiava said. \u201cAll I do is just try to learn from, not just Miller Moss, but everybody else in the QB room.\u201d\n\nMaiava\u2019s attitude alludes to a sense of camaraderie and mutual respect within the USC football family. He also spoke highly of the team\u2019s receivers, acknowledging their talent and dedication to excellence on the field.\n\n\u201c[Freshman receiver Zachariah Branch is] electrifying; he\u2019s just such a great guy. He runs fast every time \u2013 even during walk-throughs you see him running 100 speed, so it\u2019s been fun,\u201d Maiava said. \u201cEverybody in that receiver room stands out to me.\u201d\n\nIn addition to on-field dynamics, Riley addressed USC\u2019s recruiting efforts and the evolving landscape of Name, Image and Likeness opportunities. He acknowledged the significant strides made in NIL growth while stressing the importance of continued support from donors and stakeholders to maintain USC\u2019s competitive edge.\n\n\u201cNIL has taken some monster leaps since we\u2019ve been here, ... which has been really positive,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see our fan base and our supporters. I think, for everybody, it\u2019s just been gaining an understanding of what it is and how it\u2019s not important \u2014 it\u2019s imperative.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s spring practice offers a promising preview of the team\u2019s evolution under Riley\u2019s leadership. With a mix of experienced transfers and talented young players, the Trojans are geared to make waves next season.\n```"}

Just a few weeks ago, they upset the Bucks in similar fashion without LeBron James, winning after upsetting the Bucks again without LeBron James, 123-122 at Crypto.com Arena on March 8. This time, the win took place in Milwaukee to kick off a six-game Lakers\u2019 road trip and increase their winning streak to four in a row. The team\u2019s secondary stars shined bright even away from Los Angeles by filling the void left by James, who\u2019s experiencing left ankle soreness.\n\nIn typical Lakers fashion, they started poorly on offense, only making one shot out of their first ten field goal attempts. In the first quarter, the Lakers were down as many as 19 points thanks largely to Giannis Antetokounmpo, who posted 17 points and 11 rebounds in the first half. And again, just as many Lakers games have gone this season, they started to shoot better as the game progressed. Rui Hachiumura led the charge, reaching double digit points in the second quarter. He would go on to finish the game with 16 points and a career-high 14 rebounds.\n\nD\u2019Angelo Russell also started to find his groove behind the arc as well, starting off the second half by nailing three straight threes. Russell had a fantastic game on Tuesday just like on March 8, when he scored 44 points. This time, Russell finished with 29 points, 12 assists and seven rebounds.\n\nDespite the building momentum, the Lakers still had their work cut out for them in the fourth quarter, entering the period down 14 points. Instead of collapsing without their leader in James, the Lakers answered the call, going on a 16-2 run with 9:52 left in the quarter to start erasing the Bucks\u2019 lead. By the end, Austin Reaves was leading the Lakers\u2019 comeback , hitting clutch shot after clutch shot to tie the game and force it into overtime. His late momentum would carry him to his second career triple-double, finishing with 29 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists.\n\nDamian Lillard scored a solid 27 points, but on further glance his stat line seemed  empty after he shot only 9 for 29 from the field and 3 of 14 from three-point range\u2014a measly 21.4% from distance. Plus, Davis blocked Lillard\u2019s late three-point attempt that would\u2019ve pushed the game to double overtime. Davis\u2019 fourth block of the game put the exclamation point on his incredible night, leading the Lakers with 34 points and a game-high 23 rebounds.\n\nThe Bucks had the chance to tie it late in the second overtime, with Antetokounmpo missing a free throw late that sealed the Lakers\u2019 victory. Antetokounmpo\u2019s one-for-six shooting from the charity stripe surely left a sour taste in Bucks fans\u2019 mouths, even though he finished with a triple-double of 29 points, 21 rebounds and 11 assists.\n\nThe Lakers will look to continue their four-game winning streak, moving on to Memphis to take on the Grizzlies at 5 p.m. on Wednesday.\n```"}

But, the audience gathered for the Human Rights Campaign dinner responded by simultaneously chanting \u201cfour more years.\u201d\n\nAs part of the effort to raise campaign funds for President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection bid, Jill Biden delivered a keynote speech at a dinner hosted by the civil rights organization in Century City on March 23. The Human Rights Campaign is the largest civil rights organization that champions equality for the LGBTQ community in the nation. It also has a strong and consistent track record in supporting Joe Biden and the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nLast October, the Human Rights Campaign PAC announced that it is endorsing Biden\u2019s reelection campaign. The organization also endorsed Biden while he was running for his first term in 2020. The Biden\u2019s made significant appearances at the HRC\u2019s events during previous campaign seasons, such as at last year\u2019s Human Rights Campaign national dinner and a Los Angeles dinner in 2014.\n\nAfter an introduction by her daughter Ashley Biden, the first lady stepped on stage to the beat of \u201cThis Is Me,\u201d a number from \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d that champions the authentic self.\n\nBut, the beginning of her speech was marked by brief disruption. Just 14 seconds into the address, a group of Israel-Hamas war protesters began chanting \u201cceasefire now\u201d in the back of the banquet hall. Some of the protesters were holding banners that said \u201cNo Pride in Genocide\u201d and \u201cQueer Jews Say Ceasefire.\u201d\n\nSecurity personnel quickly attempted to escort the protesters out of the room. In direct response to the hecklers, the room began to chant back \u201cfour more years.\u201d\n\nJill Biden restarted her speech after the protesters were cleared out and following a standing ovation from the crowd. She focused her speech on how \u201c[the LGBTQ] community is under attack\u201d and tied many Republican efforts to democratic backsliding. \u201cRights are being stripped away. Freedoms are eroding,\u201d Jill Biden said passionately to the room.\n\nShe elaborated on how democracy and equal rights are being threatened. \u201cJust last night, we had to fend off more than 50 anti-gay amendments that Republicans tried to force into the government spending bill,\u201d she said. \u201cThese were extreme measures aimed directly at this community. They served only one purpose: to spread hate and fear.\u201d\n\nThe White House signed off on the new government funding bill on the morning of March 23, shortly after the Friday midnight deadline. While President Biden claimed that he was successful in defeating 50 \u201cpolicy riders\u201d \u2014 additional policy changes that \u201cride\u201d on top of a must-pass bill that would be difficult to pass on their own \u2014 a small number of them were included in the signed package, such as the ban on U.S. embassies from flying the Pride flag.\n\nThe first lady reinforced Biden\u2019s track record of protecting equal rights for the LGBTQ community. \u201cThanks to President Biden, marriage equality is now the law of the land,\u201d she said. She listed other policies in support of the LGBTQ community that were pushed by the president, such as lifting the ban on gay and bisexual men donating blood, allowing trans-Americans to serve the military openly and \u201cstanding firmly against conversion therapy.\u201d\n\nThe room erupted into applause. The end of the address was marked by several well-received jabs at MAGA Republicans. Referring to the lawmakers who support a far-right political agenda and Trump as \u201cMAGA extremists,\u201d Jill Biden said that they \u201care seeking to erase these hard-fought gains, trying to unwind all the progress we\u2019ve made. They want us to be afraid.\u201d\n\nShe rallied the audience with a call to action: \u201cThey want to take our victories away, but we won\u2019t let them. Your president won\u2019t let them. I won\u2019t let them. We\u2019re going to fight. And we will win.\u201d\n\nBefore her speech, a celebrity-studded blue carpet kicked off the event. The guest list was filled with Hollywood stars, internet celebrities, and equal rights activists. Jesse Tyler Ferguson, an actor known for his work in Modern Family and also a board member of the Human Rights Campaign, spoke to Annenberg Media before the speech.\n\n\u201cOn nights like this when I get to hear these keynote speakers speak, I always leave feeling inspired,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cAnd I have a fire within me to continue to do this great work and support these organizations that are really in the trenches and fighting the good fight.\u201d\n\nFerguson said the current administration is not doing enough to advance equal rights. \u201cIf I had to give them a grade, I could go with B minus to B plus. We are OK. We are not doing great. We could do more,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is just politics. It\u2019s an impossible job to please everyone. I am happy with a lot of what they are doing, and I think there is a lot of room for growth as well.\u201d\n\nMadison Werner, an internet celebrity and Los Angeles-based queer activist, spoke to Annenberg Media before the speech about what she was looking for in the first lady\u2019s keynote, and the administration\u2019s efforts to advance LGBTQ rights.\n\n\u201cWhat I am looking for is her speaking to the future of hopefully another four years when we hopefully don\u2019t have Trump in office, and how she is going to uplift every community that is being marginalized right now \u2014 particularly trans people across the nation who are being banned their health care,\u201d Werner said.\n\nThe popular content creator said \u201cwe are leaps are bounds better\u201d than the previous administration\u2019s efforts to protect LGBTQ rights. \u201cWe have a president right now who is so understanding and so supportive of the queer community that the best thing we can do is to keep having him in office and to see what he does next,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m also really appreciative of how outspoken he has been about the support for the LGBTQ community.\u201d\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/27/padres-2024-season-preview/", "response": "```\nSAN DIEGO \u2014 After an extremely disappointing performance in the 2023 season and an offseason full of cutting salaries, the Padres enter Opening Day this year with a less-heralded roster, at least on paper. But did they take one step back in the offseason to take two steps forward on the diamond? That\u2019s the question. Over the winter, the Padres lost their best hitter (Juan Soto), best starter (Blake Snell), best reliever (Josh Hader), and more than half of the starting rotation. The loss of three-time Manager of the Year, Bob Melvin, does not help either. Even if the pieces didn\u2019t mesh as expected in 2023, those departures left major holes in the roster. New manager, Mike Shildt, will have to put last season squarely in the rearview mirror to lead the Padres to the playoffs. However, the NL West is as tough as ever. The Dodgers have reloaded their already star-studded roster with Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the Diamondbacks are fresh off a National League Pennant and the Giants just hired away the Padres\u2019s previous manager and reigning Cy Young award recipient.\n\nGiven all of those offseason changes, here\u2019s the Padres\u2019 projected lineup for Opening Day: \n2B Xander Bogaerts \nRF Fernando Tatis Jr. \n1B Jake Cronenworth \n3B Manny Machado \nSS Ha-Seong Kim \nLF Jurickson Profar \nC Luis Campusano \nDH Tyler Wade \nCF Jackson Merrill \n\nThe Padres did not make a notable addition to replace Soto, but they did add some young talent that may prove themselves as legitimate big-league contributors. Merrill is MLB Pipeline\u2019s No. 12 overall prospect in the minor leagues, as he is a skilled contact hitter from the left side whose insane athleticism should help make the transition to the Show a lot quicker and easier.\n\nSnell, Michael Wacha, Seth Lugo, and Nick Martinez departed in free agency this past offseason, leaving the Padres to remake a rotation that had the tied-best team ERA in 2023. Brito or Matt Waldron seem to be the likeliest candidates to make the rotation as the fifth starter. However, Darvish is 37 and has been a below-average starter in two of the last three seasons; Musgrove threw under 100 innings last season because of injury; King is still new to the organization, and Brito is fairly new to the big-league level. And after the additions of Cease and King to round out the Padres\u2019 corps of starting pitchers, this is the projected rotation for 2024: \nRHP Yu Darvish \nRHP Joe Musgrove \nRHP Dylan Cease \nRHP Michael King \nRHP Jhony Brito \n\nThe Padres also lost closer Josh Hader to free agency. They did, however, make several additions, including those of Woo-Suk Go and Yuki Matsui, both of whom signed as international free agents. The signing of Wandy Peralta should be a huge help in pitching relief as well. With that said, here is the projected bullpen for 2024: \nProjected bullpen: \nCloser: RHP Robert Suarez \nSetup: LHP Yuki Matsui, RHP Enyel De Los Santos \nMiddle: LHP Wandy Peralta, RHP Woo-Suk Go, RHP Tom Cosgrove \nLong: RHP Luis Pati\u00f1o \n\nThe team MVP will most likely be Fernando Tatis Jr. After missing the 2022 season due to a PED suspension, he had a productive \u201823 season, as he is now a certified platinum glove winner, and managed to belt 25 home runs and swipe 29 bags in his return to the team. Tatis expertly handled his transition to the outfield and remained healthy, signaling that he has a strong basis for an even better 2024.\n\nThe team Cy Young will be Cease, who has made his full contingent of starts in each of his four full seasons. The club\u2019s goal this season should be to make the playoffs. Even with Soto and Snell\u2019s departure, there is enough talent that San Diego can insert themselves in the hunt for the NL West or at least a wild-card spot. In order to make the playoffs, though, the Padres will have to develop a stronger in-game mentality. The Friars squeezed out a winning record of 82-80 in 2023, but were particularly ill-fated in one-run (9-23) and extra-inning (2-12) contests, letting many winnable games slip away. The Padres need to capitalize on their opportunities and need to fight back when the season gets tough. With Bogaerts in his second year in San Diego, a healthier Tatis and Machado, a deep rotation and a potential stud prospect waiting in the wings ... the Padres are a sleeper. Now that baseball is back, the Padres have, arguably, never been more back and ready to leave 2023 in the dust.\n```"}

Demonstrators, including students, chanted \u201cFree them all\u201d and called on others to join them in their support of Israel in the war.\n\nSince Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel \u2014 in which they captured roughly 240 hostages and killed about 1,200 people \u2014 the Palestinian Ministry of Health reported that Israel\u2019s war operations have killed 34,000 people in Gaza. Over half of the hostages are still in captivity, according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cTaking time out of your day to just be aware of [the hostages] and speak, it is really important,\u201d said Neev Efrat, a graduate student studying business who participated in the march. \u201cIf you don\u2019t speak [about] it, you don\u2019t take action, [Israel] will not exist,\u201d Efrat said. He reiterated that Israel has existed as a state for over 75 years.\n\nLogan Barth, a senior majoring in law, history and culture, said his January visit to Israeli towns near the Gaza border motivated him to help organize the demonstration.\n\n\u201cWe should be focusing our efforts on bringing the hostages home, protecting civilian lives and protecting life in general,\u201d Barth said. \u201cThat\u2019s a Jewish value, that\u2019s my personal value, life for all. And that\u2019s why we care so much about the hostages.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel\u2019s goal is to achieve \u201ctotal victory\u201d last year and the country is planning a ground invasion in Rafah, a region in southern Gaza with an estimated 1.4 million Palestinians, many of whom have been displaced from their homes by the war, according to the Associated Press.\n\nBarth said that nobody wants the death or destruction that has come with the war when asked about the deaths in Gaza.\n\n\u201cI encourage people to visit Israel [and] talk to Jewish people,\u201d Barth said. \u201cI strongly believe that people will see that Israelis care about life, and death and destruction is the last thing we want.\u201d\n\nPro-Palestinian advocates are calling for an immediate permanent ceasefire and increased aid to Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million inhabitants. A truce was last called to allow for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza on Nov. 24 and ended seven days later.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council passed a resolution yesterday demanding a ceasefire in Gaza for the duration of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, adding momentum to demands for a lasting ceasefire and an immediate and unconditional release of hostages held by Hamas. The resolution passed with 14 countries voting in favor and one country abstaining \u2014 the United States.\n\nIsrael responded to the vote by canceling its national security adviser and other high-level officials\u2019 planned visit to Washington D.C. to discuss alternative strategies to its operation in Rafah, CNN reported.\n\nIt\u2019s the first resolution the Security Council has passed after months of vetoed resolutions, but whether or not the resolutions are legally binding is still being debated.\n\nHagit Arieli-Chai, a Hebrew Language Instructor at Dornsife, said Israel\u2019s actions are driven by a desire to \u201cdefeat terror.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people are suffering because of Hamas,\u201d Arieli-Chai said. \u201cInstead of [the] United Nations seeing the suffering \u2014 where it\u2019s coming [from], where it\u2019s the source \u2014 they\u2019re looking at Israel and saying \u2018Stop.\u2019 When are we going to stop? We\u2019re going to stop when the hostages are back and when the terror is eliminated.\u201d\n\nRabbi Dov Wagner, director of the Chabad Jewish Center at USC, performed the Shema \u2014 a Jewish daily prayer \u2014 with students. He said the march was to both keep the focus on the remaining hostages and to support students.\n\n\u201cWe have a student community here at USC as well as around the world that\u2019s been extremely deeply affected, not only by the events in and around Israel, but also by the rise in antisemitism in and around the world, and especially on college campuses in the United States,\u201d Wagner said. \u201c[I\u2019m] really praying that we finally see true peace in our world and that starts by bringing the hostages home.\u201d\n```"}

These six women wanted to embody the vision of the 22 original founders of Delta Sigma Theta on their campus. 100 years later, the chapter is still actively involved in the USC and Los Angeles community and dedicated to uplifting Black women.\n\nThe six charter members of the Upsilon chapter in 1970.\n(Photo courtesy of Joi Hardy)\n\nThe Centennial Celebration brought together current and past members for an unforgettable weekend. Events ranged from a poignant Rededication Ceremony, and a lively Mix and Mingle to an elegant banquet and, wrapping it all up, a Sunday church service followed by community service at South LA Cafe.\n\n\u201cMy heart is extremely full,\u201d said Jadalyn Polk, a junior at USC and the current Chapter President of Delta Sigma Theta Inc. \u201cNot a lot of people get to experience being a part of an organization that turns 100 years old. So, I\u2019m extremely grateful to be in a position where I can create change in the community and on campus as well.\u201d\n\nThe women of the sorority came together to serve their community, creating grocery boxes at South LA Cafe.\n(Photo courtesy of Brittany Dacoff)\n\nDelta Sigma Theta is known for taking up space and empowering others, from its first public act of service \u2013 participation in the Women\u2019s Suffrage March in 1913 to being the first Black Greek organization at USC to create an endowed scholarship fund. 100 years later and the Upsilon Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta continues to do great things even at a Predominantly White Institution (PWI). The Upsilon Chapter has has many other contributions to the USC campus such as the creation of Sisters in Solidarity (S.I.S), formerly known as Q.U.E.E.N.S, a student support group for Black women on campus, and USC\u2019s Black Graduation celebration for Black students (Black Grad). The Chapter\u2019s Vice President was also the creator of The Cardinal Divas, the first majorette group formed at a PWI.\n\nThe Alumnae of Upsilon have raised $100k for a scholarship endowment fund in the chapter's name.\n(Photo courtesy of Brittany Dacoff)\n\nSade Anderson, a sophomore and a Fall 2023 initiate of the Upsilon chapter was moved when asked how it felt being a part of Delta Sigma Theta at a PWI. \u201cThere is so much beauty in it,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cBeing a part of a group like this is so empowering, and it is thanks to past Sorors who have paved the way for us and USC has been more diverse than it has ever been, and we can see how Upsilon has been instrumental in that growth not only in Greek life but also in the Black lives of students at USC. I think that we should celebrate that.\u201d\n\nNot only was this weekend one of celebration but one of reunion. Many members of the sorority traveled near and far to come to the Centennial Celebration and were greeted with the warm embrace of new members but also seasoned members that they hadn\u2019t seen in years.\n\nFall '23 initiates of the chapter pose with Wilma Pinder, one of the oldest living members of the chapter.\n(Photo courtesy of Brittany Dacoff)\n\n\u201cThe Mix and Mingle event that happened on Saturday was my favorite event because it felt intimate,\u201d said Julia Alexander, a Fall 2023 Initiate. \u201cWe got to connect with [other Sorors] as well as learn more about who they are, their impact on and off campus, their time at [the] University of Southern California and overall just hearing the amazing things that Delta women have done. There was so much laughter and good memories that filled the room. \"\n\nThere was a lot of planning that took place to bring this Centennial Celebration to life. \u201cIt was a very big deal,\u201d Laila Smith, a Fall 2023 initiate, said \u201cFrom reserving a space to planning each detail of the banquet which was our very big event to overall making sure that Sorors have a really amazing time, everything went into consideration.\u201d\n\nAlumni of the Upsilon chapter spoke on how inspired they are by the ambitious charter members of the chapter that were actively contributing to their community and creating an impact on the world. Joi Hardy, USC Class of 1994 said, \u201cThis celebration of 100 years, definitely makes me think about the charter members and what their lives were like in 1924, to be a Black woman on a white campus. I often think about their lives, the lives of Black people at that time, even though it\u2019s Los Angeles, California, it\u2019s still Black people in 1924 and to be bold enough to start a chapter and be a part of an organization.\u201d\n\nHardy continued, \u201cIf they were here today I know they would not even be able to fathom and grasp that their decision to be bold has created something legendary. Seeing how beautiful this weekend went it definitely makes me proud to be in an organization that is tight knit and about public service.\u201d\n\nSpring 1993 initiates of the Upsilon chapter at their graduation in 1994.\n(Photo courtesy of Joi Hardy)\n\nThe weekend celebration closed out with community service at South LA Cafe. The owner of the cafe mentioned that this was the largest group of people he\u2019d seen volunteer, with a number of 87 volunteers ready to help bag, distribute and give away groceries to the community.\n\n\u201cWe are just one organization,\u201d Polk said. \u201cThe words of the owner moved me so deeply and I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to start a partnership with South LA Cafe and I am really looking forward to improving the lives of those in LA and one day the lives of those across the country.\u201d\n\nChapter president Jadalyn Polk makes final remarks after service at the end of the weekend.\n(Photo courtesy of Brittany Dacoff)\n\nIn commemorating a century of existence, the Upsilon Chapter\u2019s Centennial Celebration not only symbolized a remarkable milestone but also served as a testament to the unwavering spirit of sisterhood, scholarship, and service within its members. The events encapsulated the essence of a thriving legacy and demonstrated a collective commitment to the ideals that have defined the chapter for a hundred years. As these remarkable women set sail into the next century, their steadfast dedication persists, driving them to continue shaping a brighter and more impactful future for their community.\n```"}

The event, \u201cBeing a Mayor in the 21st Century: A Conversation with Michael Tubbs and Mayor Karen Bass,\u201d was hosted by the USC Center for the Political Future.\n\nElected in 2022, Bass is the first Black woman to serve as mayor of L.A. She previously represented South L.A. as a congresswoman from 2011 to 2022 and before that acted as speaker of the California State Assembly from 2008 to 2010. As a native Angeleno, she has seen L.A. evolve for better and worse. Particularly, Bass recalled how the homeless crisis was less pressing when she was growing up and only became a major issue beginning in the 80s.\n\nSince then, homelessness has risen to over 46,000 people in the city of Los Angeles as of June 2023, according to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. Bass said her L.A. roots and background in healthcare have fueled her desire to fix this crisis. \u201cI come at this from a different angle due to my medical background. So, to me, what was the most important was to get people off the street,\u201d Bass said.\n\nPrior to her political career, Bass earned her degree as a physician assistant from the USC Keck School of Medicine. Launching the Inside Safe strategy in 2023, Bass attempted to address homelessness from a different standpoint. Rather than just focusing on re-housing, Bass also wanted to assist individuals with the challenges that follow this transition, such as access to healthcare and social workers.\n\n\u201cTo me, the city and the county were not committed to ending homelessness, and I think if that\u2019s not your goal, you end up just managing,\u201d Bass said. \u201cThe policy of just housing first \u2014 and nobody intended this \u2014 but it really resulted in \u2018you stay in a tent until we build a building\u2019 and to me, that was just unacceptable.\u201d\n\nDespite her ambitious goals, the Inside Safe initiative has faced obstacles to permanently house individuals. During the 2023 fiscal year, the city of L.A. spent over $32 million dollars on Inside Safe, yet only 108 individuals, accounting for 8% of clients, in the program were permanently housed. The initiative will become even more costly in the 2024 fiscal year with a projected expenditure of over $177 million dollars.\n\nAn audit at the end of 2023 from the L.A. City Controller Kenneth Meija also noted that LAHSA struggled with keeping data on program participants and following up on data with interim housing providers. Bass noted her discontentment with the current state of the initiative and expressed her hope that it will continue to grow.\n\n\u201cI found along the way, there weren\u2019t set standards. I found out the social worker won\u2019t be there for a week or two ... I know that we\u2019re putting people in these motels who shouldn\u2019t be there,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the near future, Bass said she and her team aim to create safe recreational vehicle parks as additional interim and permanent housing options. She also hopes to regulate and crack down on individuals known as \u201cvanlords\u201d who lease RVs to the homeless.\n\nBass said she plans to continue doing outreach in the communities she serves. She used to host town halls but has more recently focused on going out into the streets and meeting with individuals one-on-one. \u201cMy best days are the days I get to go out into the street ... I really like doing that, going out and talking to the people that are unhoused,\u201d she said.\n\nFor students looking to enter politics, Bass encourages taking initiative and being present with your community. Rather than focusing on the next best thing like re-election, Bass emphasizes working for the betterment of the city and its constituents.\n\n\u201cPoliticians, when in office, they\u2019re focused on what their next office is gonna be. When you do that, you compromise your ability to take risks and make decisions,\u201d Bass said. \u201cJust do your job. Do a good job. Opportunities will present themselves.\u201d```"}

Alex Zhou , the CEO of  Yamibuy , has done just that, turning personal struggles into a successful business model that resonates with many. Yamibuy's logo (Photo courtesy of Yamibuy)  The Genesis of Yamibuy Zhou\u2019s journey began with a simple yet profound need: the desire for easier access to Asian products in the United States. \u201cBack when I was a student, finding our local Asian products was a real challenge. This wasn\u2019t just about food; it was about connecting to our roots,\u201d Zhou recounted.  This sentiment laid the foundation for Yamibuy, born out of Zhou\u2019s frustration and longing for a taste of home while studying in Kansas, where he struggled to find Asian markets. Building a Cultural Bridge Zhou quickly realized that the demand for Asian products went beyond mere convenience. It was about preserving culture, fostering a sense of community, and offering a slice of home to those far from it. \u201cOur products are more than just items on a shelf,\u201d Zhou explained. \u201cThey\u2019re memories, traditions, and a way for people to stay connected to their culture.\u201d. He delved deeper into how Yamibuy\u2019s product range is a reflection of this cultural bridge. From food to beauty products, each category is carefully curated to not only meet the practical needs of Asian Americans but also to celebrate and share the rich tapestry of Asian cultures with a broader audience. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen how our customers\u2019 needs evolve with their life stages,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cFrom students craving instant noodles to families looking for authentic Asian ingredients to cook with at home, our product range grows with them.\u201d Beauty products available on Yamibuy (Photo courtesy of Yamibuy)  Overcoming Challenges with Community Support The path to building Yamibuy was not without its obstacles. Zhou candidly shared the early challenges of limited resources and the daunting task of building a diverse product catalog from scratch. \u201cIn the beginning, we had about two to three hundred products,\u201d Zhou said, reflecting on Yamibuy\u2019s early days. \u201cThe question was, how do we make these few products appeal to a broad audience with such limited resources?\u201d However, the Asian American community\u2019s support played a pivotal role in overcoming these hurdles. \u201cThe community\u2019s embrace of our platform was overwhelming. Their support and trust were crucial in those early days,\u201d Zhou stated. This community support underscored the deep-seated need for a service like Yamibuy and propelled the platform to new heights. Alex Zhou speaks at USC Annenberg (Photo courtesy of Yamibuy)  Cultural Products as a Unifying Force Zhou also emphasized the importance of cultural products in unifying and educating diverse audiences. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a growing interest in Asian beauty products, not just from Asian customers but from all backgrounds,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cThis is a testament to the universal appeal of quality products and the curiosity and openness to different cultures.\u201d He pointed out how cultural products serve as a gateway for people to explore and appreciate different cultures. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about selling products; it\u2019s about sharing stories and experiences,\u201d Zhou added. \u201cWhen someone buys a Japanese tea set or Korean skincare products, they\u2019re getting a piece of that culture.\u201d Yamibuy's in-person event (Photo courtesy of Yamibuy)  Advice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs For those looking to embark on a similar entrepreneurial journey, Zhou had words of encouragement and advice. \u201cFind that intersection between what you\u2019re passionate about, what you\u2019re good at, and what serves a need. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll make the most impact,\u201d he said. Zhou\u2019s own journey is a testament to the power of aligning personal passions with market needs, all while staying true to one\u2019s cultural roots. A graphic used by Yamibuy (Photo courtesy of Yamibuy)  The Future of Yamibuy Looking ahead, Zhou is optimistic about the future of Yamibuy and its role in the cultural and community landscape of America. \u201cOur mission goes beyond commerce. It\u2019s about building bridges, connecting communities, and enriching lives with the diversity of Asian cultures,\u201d Zhou concluded. In a world that\u2019s increasingly connected yet culturally diverse, platforms like Yamibuy play a crucial role in bringing people together, offering comfort through familiar products, and fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of cultural diversity. Alex Zhou\u2019s journey from a student facing personal challenges to the CEO of a thriving business is not just a success story but a narrative of cultural connection, community support, and the unifying power of shared experiences.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode).\n\nBy Hali Mecklin, Keira McNamara and Dylan Luden March 26, 2024 at 6:28 pm PDT\n\nAt 8:30 a.m. Tuesday morning, Bovard Hall was teeming with people anxiously awaiting USC President Carol Folt\u2019s annual State of the University Address. Amid political tensions, a recently announced increase in tuition and the reinstatement of the Academic Achievement Award, Folt\u2019s speech gave the president a chance to address student body concerns that she had been criticized for ignoring in the past. But most of the answers to questions about these issues came during an interview with student journalists in Folt\u2019s office after the actual speech.\n\nOne of these concerns was the Academic Achievement Award (AAA) being revoked and reinstated. On March 8, the university announced that the AAA \u2014 which provided funding for students pursuing multiple degrees to enroll in up to 21 units at the standard full-time tuition rate \u2014 would be discontinued. On March 15, after a petition calling for its reinstatement circulated on campus, the award was brought back for students graduating in spring 2025 or earlier. Yesterday, the university reinstated the award for all students.\n\n\u201cWe just sat down and took a breath and said, \u2018Right, this is one of the more important programs,\u2019\u201d Folt said during an interview after the speech. \u201cI feel really good that we said, \u2018In that case, we\u2019re changing our mind.\u2019 We\u2019re not afraid to change our mind.\u201d\n\nThe original decision faced significant backlash from students who relied on the award to continue their studies.\n\n\u201cMy academic plan was made with AAA. If I want to graduate [now], I have to go more in debt,\u201d said Coby Russo, a sophomore studying public relations and theater in a previous interview with Annenberg Media. \u201cI can\u2019t graduate with my double major in four years without [the AAA scholarship.]\u201d\n\nFolt also addressed the recent 4.9% increase in tuition, which brought the estimated cost of USC attendance close to $100,000 yearly. She said that this choice was made to offset increasing expenses and inflation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still like everyone else recovering from major expenses, not just COVID,\u201d she said after the address. \u201cBut our legacy issues and inflation, and a drive for more financial aid and higher wages. I think those are the main financial pressures.\u201d\n\nThis change is similar to last year\u2019s 5% increase. Folt also cited the school\u2019s free Lyft problem as a motivator for the hike.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to pay back the costs of all these programs, you know, we\u2019ve tripled the amount of mental health [programs] and the Lyft program has skyrocketed,\u201d she said. \u201cSo our costs in many cases have gone up even beyond the cost of inflation. So it\u2019s only through tuition...it covers increasing costs that we have.\u201d\n\nUniversity President Carol Folt speaks during the 2024 State of the University Address on March 26. (Photo by Jason Goode).\n\nSince the fall, Folt has also been criticized for the university\u2019s relative silence regarding the Israel-Hamas war. Her initial statement on the Oct. 7 attacks did not explicitly name Hamas, which was later amended after uproar from the community. Prior to her speech, approximately 10 faculty members protested at Bovard, holding a banner that read \u201cUSC faculty against the genocide in Palestine.\u201d The protestors were standing in a half circle holding images of Palestinians who died in the war.\n\nFolt addressed the protest before her speech and said that she acknowledged the protester\u2019s voices. She also told Annenberg Media about the university\u2019s efforts to combat hate.\n\n\u201cWe have a committee that meets every single morning, eight o\u2019clock in the morning, to try to anticipate what is happening so we can talk to students,\u201d she said after the speech. \u201cTalking to people, or doing events where people have a chance to learn, is really important. Only hate breeds hate. So we try very hard while understanding anger and frustration to have these conversations.\u201d\n\nDuring the speech, Folt spotlighted the university\u2019s successes in the past year. She highlighted USC\u2019s successful admissions tactics, like the community college transfer program and a strong budget. She commended the women\u2019s basketball team for making it to the Sweet 16, and she discussed a new building for the USC School of Dramatic Arts that will have a ribbon cutting soon. She also said the university is working to rebuild its reserve after the effects of the pandemic.\n```"}

Students say the university\u2019s willingness to listen to their feedback is encouraging.\n\nAs Annenberg Media previously reported, AAA is not set to undergo any changes and will continue to provide a tuition benefit for students who wish to \u201cregister for up to 21 units at the standard full-time tuition rate\u201d as long as they meet the required GPA of 3.75, according to USC Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Andrew T. Guzman.\n\n\u201cWe received feedback from the community about sunsetting the programs, including from students affected by this change, and we listened. Supporting our students is a top priority of all of us at USC,\u201d Guzman said in an announcement. \u201cFunding will continue for current students who included this tuition benefit in their academic plans.\u201d\n\nBoth affected and unaffected students were upset about the announcement of AAA\u2019s removal on March 7th. Students turned to social media to voice their anger, starting their own petition and posting it across social media sites, with many commenting on how disappointing the announcement was.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of friends who have been personally affected by it...they were trying really hard for the threshold they needed,\u201d said Jackie Pham, a junior majoring in electrical engineering.

She believes that \u201ca lot of our funds should be redirected to academic programs. For instance, PED, the physical education building, doesn\u2019t even have AC.\u201d\n\nTawana RavalI, a sophomore majoring in business administration, was shocked to see that they overturned the decision. She emphasized the importance of students\u2019 voices in the decision.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t directly see our power being displayed so high up in these big decisions, so even though we weren\u2019t involved in the initial decision, we\u2019re able to be involved in the final decision,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time, they actually thought critically, put into action what the people were saying, and took that time to listen. So, I\u2019m glad that they didn\u2019t completely shut down the door.\u201d\n\nUSC President Carol Folt commented about the program during an interview with Annenberg Media. \u201cThis is one of the more important programs...it\u2019s what\u2019s really promoting students to do multidisciplinary,\u201d she said, adding that the decision to cut AAA was done hastily. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to change our mind. Normally, I think we try to vet it as much as we can before we do it. So you don\u2019t do it very often. But I think that was an important one,\u201d Folt said.\n```"}

A unos cuantos pasos de USC, BMO Stadium se llen\u00f3 con aficionados del reba\u00f1o sagrado y de los rojinegros. Por encima de la rivalidad, hay un amor en com\u00fan que conect\u00f3 a todos los fans, el amor por su querido Jalisco. A pesar de las altas expectativas y una asistencia de 21,110, los dos equipos Jaliscienses quedaron empatados.\n\nLos aficionados esperaban con ansias el regreso de Javier \u201cChicharito\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez a tierras angelinas, pero la ausencia del ahora jugador de Chivas dej\u00f3 a muchos con las ganas. Unos pocos d\u00edas antes del enfrentamiento se anunci\u00f3 que Hern\u00e1ndez no hab\u00eda sido convocado por Fernando Gago, entrenador de las Chivas.\n\nJavier Vel\u00e1zquez Jr. fanatico de Chivas se mostr\u00f3 muy entusiasmado por tener a su equipo en casa. \u201cEs una chulada. No hay tantas veces que vengan aqu\u00ed a jugar. M\u00e1s con mi pap\u00e1, siempre es mi meta ver a las Chivas junto con \u00e9l\u201d, dijo Velazquez Jr. Su pap\u00e1 Javier Velazquez Sr. agreg\u00f3 que era, \u201cuna emoci\u00f3n (muy) grande porque nosotros siempre hemos sido (fan\u00e1ticos de) Chivas\u201d.\n\nA la vez, varios de los jugadores estelares de los dos equipos no estuvieron presentes para este llamativo partido. Roberto Alvarado y Jesus Orozco, por parte de las Chivas, fueron convocados al equipo nacional para enfrentar a USMNT en la final de la CONCACAF Nations League. Al igual tres jugadores del Atlas fueron convocados para sus respectivas selecciones nacionales. El defensa central Anderson Santamaria represent\u00f3 a Per\u00fa y el delantero Jordi Caicedo a Ecuador. El portero estrella del Atlas, Camilo Vargas estuvo con Colombia.\n\nEl partido pintaba para m\u00e1s, con los \u00faltimos cinco enfrentamientos resultando en dos victorias por equipo y un empate. Isa\u00e1c Brizuela, mejor conocido como \u2018El Conejo\u2019 y atacante de las Chivas, es uno de los pocos que ha vestido los dos uniformes de Guadalajara. Al ser parte del Atlas en el 2012 como un pr\u00e9stamo por seis meses, lleg\u00f3 a las Chivas en el 2015. Brizuela expres\u00f3 sus altas expectativas del partido al ser un Cl\u00e1sico y no solamente un amistoso.\u201dMuchos dicen que era un partido amistoso, pero de los dos lados sabemos que en un Cl\u00e1sico no hay amistosos. Los dos salimos a buscar el resultado\u201d, dijo Brizuela. \u201cQuer\u00edamos la victoria, quer\u00edamos obviamente marcar goles pero considero que el equipo el primer tiempo lo trabajamos bien. El segundo hubo muchas interpretaciones\u201d.\n\nCon un inicio en\u00e9rgico, el primer disparo a porter\u00eda fue por parte de las Chivas dentro de los primeros dos minutos de juego. La primera tarjeta amarilla fue otorgada en el minuto 25 a Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez, jugador de las Chivas. Al medio tiempo, el marcador segu\u00eda siendo empatado a cero, lo que dej\u00f3 a los aficionados deseando mucha m\u00e1s acci\u00f3n. Con pocos tiros a la porter\u00eda que se podr\u00edan haber convertido en goles decisivos, el juego se mantuvo en calma por la mayor\u00eda del segundo tiempo.\n\nAlrededor del minuto 80, los aficionados del Atlas comenzaron a aventar bombas de humo a la cancha. En la zona norte, los de Chivas empezaron a tirar luces de bengalas. Por casi 10 minutos seguidos y un partido pausado por precauciones de seguridad, las dos porras continuaron lanzando cohetes. Sin duda la afici\u00f3n de ambos equipos se vive de forma distinta.\n\nFanaticos de Atlas, como Ernesto I\u00f1iguez dijo que, \u201cser fan\u00e1tico rojinegro significa casi todo. Es un amor que pr\u00e1cticamente no es entendible. Es un cl\u00e1sico tapatio que desde ni\u00f1o aprend\u00ed que nuestra prioridad es ganarle a Chivas\u201d. Otros como Antonio Jimenez, fanatico del Atlas por m\u00e1s de 50 a\u00f1os dijo que \u00e9l vive la pasi\u00f3n rojinegra al m\u00e1ximo. \u201cMe toc\u00f3 estar en Jalisco cuando fuimos campeones contra el le\u00f3n y estuvo bien bonito. Es el equipo de mis amores y a mis hijos se lo he inculcado,\u201d, dijo Jimenez.\n\nCon solo tres minutos restando del partido, ning\u00fana jugada clave fue alcanzada por alguno de los dos equipos.

The professors are members of the Palestine Justice Faculty group. They sported academic robes and colorful Keffiyehs. Members gathered outside of Bovard auditorium to protest the University\u2019s response to the Israel-Palestine conflict and commemorate the lives of academics killed in the conflict, holding up signs with their faces and names. According to PBS, more than 800 schools have been bombed since October 7, 2023.\n\nThe Palestine Justice Faculty group aims to educate students about the historical context of the conflict and support Pro-Palestine free speech on campus. Kate Levin associate teaching professor of writing and member of the Palestine Justice Faculty group said that the University has not done enough to support Palestinian students on campus.\n\nLevin: There are students here who have lost dozens of family members in Gaza and have to go through their day and carry on without any obvious signs of public support from their university.\n\nSarah Rebecca Kessler, another member of the organization and an assistant professor of English agreed.\n\nKessler: We just wanted to make our presence known as faculty that oppose this genocide, and to just be visible to show support for Palestinian students, faculty and staff.\n\nLevin believes the University needs to provide more resources for Palestinian students.\n\nLevin: The university needs to listen to the voices of the students most affected really solicit what they feel that they need, and what would they feel would help them thrive here during this devastating time and provide them with that.\n\nDuring the State of the University address, President Carol Folt spoke about the intricacies of the conflict and how is it impacting the University and students.\n\nFolt: And I know it\u2019s for people, very personal, very real. And I can just say how I admire the strength and the courage that our community is showing. And I know that we have more to do in this way.\n\nKessler and other members of the group want to draw more attention to this cause on campus and with administration.\n\nKessler: Our president, our administration is doing everything they can to not speak about what is happening. And you know, we just refuse to be silent about that.\n\nThe vigil started at Bouvard, marched past Wallis Annenberg Hall, and ended at Kaprielian Hall.\n\nCorrection: In a previous version of this story, a quote from President Carol Folt was misattributed.

(Photo by Marcus Heatherly)\n\nBy Jinny Kim and Heather Mimikos\nMarch 26, 2024 at 5:58 pm PDT\n\nTrojans in the Galen Center went wild last night after the USC women\u2019s basketball team reached the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament for the first time in 30 years. Freshman guard Juju Watkins has been a star all season, but the media hype for USC\u2019s women\u2019s basketball hasn\u2019t always existed.\n\nJunior Mikena Moore attended the energy-filled game last night. She noted that women\u2019s basketball has long been overshadowed by men\u2019s basketball. Moore: I think women and especially women in sports have always had to prove themselves. Moore said athletics departments often center the men\u2019s teams. Moore: Everything has always been built around men, and for men.\n\nThis higher standard for women\u2019s teams to gain recognition has historically translated to less media coverage. Thomas Johnson, a junior and sports web editor for Annenberg Media, said there were few reporters covering women\u2019s sports teams at USC in the past. Clearly, that\u2019s changed. Johnson: I was the only one in the postgame press conference. It was just me talking to the two players, just me asking questions. And that would never happen at a men\u2019s game, like professional outlets will cover it.\n\nAnnenberg Media sports managing editor and anchor, senior Will Simonds, noted having similar experiences to Johnson. Simonds said he noticed the increased media attention for last night\u2019s women\u2019s basketball game. Simonds: Comparing that to what we\u2019ve seen this season, and especially last night, where you\u2019ve got a ton of press there, you\u2019ve got Galen Center, you know, with 9000 people, and it\u2019s definitely kind of a stark contrast.\n\nHe said that, in general, there\u2019s a connection between a team\u2019s success and fan interest -- but it\u2019s still imbalanced between men\u2019s and women\u2019s sports. Simonds: The men\u2019s basketball team didn\u2019t perform particularly well this year. But, you know, because of those big names. So, you know, Isaiah Collier, Bronny James, like people are still showing up to that. I don\u2019t think woman sports necessarily quite get that benefit of the doubt.\n\nSimonds said he hopes that the recent increased coverage for women\u2019s basketball will continue. Simonds: I think this is definitely good momentum for this woman\u2019s team, especially because Juju Watkins is only a freshman. So I think this is going to definitely be an upward trend that continues over the next few years.\n\nThe women\u2019s basketball team will hopefully keep the momentum going as they advance to the Sweet 16 in Portland on Saturday -- and it sounds like everyone will be watching.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Jinny Kim.\n```"}

The Instagram account currently has 29 million followers. Approaching their 10th anniversary since The Shade Room\u2019s establishment, Angelica and Judith hope their story serves as a testament to women of color aiming to inform the public within the entrepreneurship realm. Although at times written off as just another tabloid, USC grad student Victoria Makanjuola says The Shade Room is a place for conversation.\n\nVictoria Makanjuola: The Shade Room is a cultural touchstone for not only Black culture, but for Gen-Z culture, for American culture.\n\nAngelica spoke about how she was encouraged to start The Shade Room by her friends and family, but what really gave her that extra push was the frustrating expectation that Black individuals must conform to white standards. USC senior, Taylor Contarino, who helped organize the event said she left the conversation feeling inspired.\n\nTaylor Contarino: I think what they do is awesome. I love they type of news that they put out there and the type of content that they put out there and I love the conversations that they start and I\u2019m grateful that something like that exists.\n\nMakanjuola spoke on the uniqueness of the platform.\n\nMakanjuola: The Shade Room is one of those brands or one of those organizations that you know is just going to give it you real, in the realest way possible. It\u2019s going to be real like a friend talking to you, kind of like spilling the tea basically.\n\nUSC grad student, Veridhi Dcruz, who also attended the event, admired the founders for their authenticity beyond their online presence.\n\nVeridhi Dcruz: I just feel like they were very candid. They were very true to their personality that they show on The Shade Room. I feel like I went to the room thinking of having a good discussion and it was more than good.

Dodgers\u2019 star and his former interpreter\u2019s alleged gambling debt causes skepticism.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani throws during warmups for the team's spring training baseball game against the Los Angeles Angels Monday, March 25, 2024, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)\n\nBy Vishu Reddy and Joseph Domingot March 26, 2024 at 5:52 pm PDT\n\nUSC students and faculty have reservations about the multiple accounts that have come out of the recent controversy with one of baseball\u2019s biggest stars, Shohei Ohtani. The Dodgers fired Ohtani\u2019s interpreter last week for allegedly stealing around $4.5 million from Ohtani\u2019s bank accounts to pay off gambling debt, according to ESPN. Ippei Mizuhara originally claimed that Ohtani knew of and paid off debts in an interview he gave to ESPN with a spokesman for Ohtani present. Just over 24 hours later, these statements would be denied by Ohtani\u2019s team.\n\nDuring a press conference on Monday, the 29-year-old baseball phenom claimed \u2014 via a new interpreter \u2014 that he never engaged in any sports gambling and Mizuhara stole the money from his account. He also said that he has never had someone gamble on his behalf.\n\n\u201cIt smells fishy,\u201d said Rob Parker, a USC sports media professor. \u201cHow does an interpreter get a hold of your account and take that kind of money out and you have no idea? Banks would call you or send you any [message] that there\u2019s some money coming out of your account.\u201d\n\nSome students are skeptical about believing the story from Ohtani and his lawyers. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of suspicious. There\u2019s $4.5 million being wired out of your own bank account, and having so much money like that, you have accountants,\u201d said Justin Huh, a sophomore studying business administration. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not flagging anything like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it sounds pretty fishy and I\u2019m suspicious that the story being told is actually true,\u201d said Alistair Campbell, a graduate student studying non-profit leadership and management.\n\nSome students, although suspicious, remain cautiously optimistic because they like Ohtani. \u201cMaybe Ohtani did some online betting with an illegal bookie in California, but I really hope that\u2019s not the case because he\u2019s the face of baseball right now,\u201d said Ty Kawamura a senior studying economics. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m Japanese, and he\u2019s the pride and joy of Japan right now. I really hope it was the interpreter.\u201d\n\nMizuhara spoke to ESPN last Tuesday regarding suspected gambling activity with a Southern California bookmaker, claiming that Ohtani was willing to pay off Mizuhara\u2019s gambling debts. However, the story would switch after Ohtani\u2019s lawyers claimed that Ohtani had no involvement in the matter and that the former Los Angeles Angel was a victim of \u201cmassive theft,\u201d according to a statement they issued to ESPN. His team eventually announced they would turn the matter over to authorities.\n\nThe Dodgers subsequently fired Mizuhara while the Dodgers played two games in South Korea. The former interpreter backtracked, claiming that Ohtani never assisted him in his debts and that he previously lied in his interview with ESPN.\n\nDue to the questionable and suspicious timeline of events, the MLB launched an investigation into the matter on Friday. The Dodgers recently acquired Ohtani in December 2023 during the MLB free agency period. After spending six years with the Angels, the Japanese designated hitter and pitcher signed a 10-year contract worth $700 million to stay in Southern California \u2014 the biggest contract in MLB history.\n\n\u201cI think the MLB should definitely investigate it to get to the bottom of it,\u201d Kawamura said. \u201cI just really hope it\u2019s not another Pete Rose situation because I really enjoy Ohtani as a player.\u201d\n\nPete Rose is a former 23-year MLB veteran \u2014 and the all-time leader in total hits \u2014 who was banned for life by the MLB due to betting on baseball games. He is also still ineligible to join the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201c[The MLB] will look at it, but people think that they\u2019re going to go soft on him because he is the biggest star in baseball,\u201d Parker said. \u201cI disagree with that. I don\u2019t think baseball ever wanted to shun Pete Rose, but they had no choice because you can\u2019t play around with the integrity of the game.\u201d\n\nWithin its collective bargaining agreement, the MLB suspends players for one year if they are found guilty of betting on any type of baseball game. However, it could elevate to a permanent suspension if the betting involves games in which the players are involved. MLB players are permitted to place legal bets on sports other than baseball in jurisdictions in which such bets are legal, according to the MLB\u2019s Collective Bargaining Agreement. Sports gambling is prohibited in the state of California.\n\nIf Ohtani is found to be involved in the matter, he could be subject to fines, suspensions and possible prosecution.\n```"}

(Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\nBy Elsa Knoke\nMarch 26, 2024 at  3:41 pm PDT\n\nI was 14 when I first heard the band LANY\u2019s hit \u201cILYSB.\u201d Like any other girl on the verge of teenhood, I was hooked. I remember Paul Klein singing \u201cmy heart hurts so good, I love you so bad\u201d and thinking, \u201cThis is exactly what it feels like to have a crush on the boy next to me in Language Arts.\u201d Since that moment, I\u2019ve remained a dedicated fan of LANY, following their journey from the 2015 debut EP \u201cMake Out\u201d to their latest 2023 studio album, \u201cA Beautiful Blur.\u201d\n\nThe band is in the thick of their 2024 North American tour, playing the Kia Forum in Los Angeles for the second time in their career this past Saturday. A glance through their discography reveals the profound influence Los Angeles has had on their music. They sing about young love on the west coast in \u201cMade in Hollywood,\u201d pay homage to Malibu\u2019s sunsets in \u201cPink Skies\u201d and share how an Oklahoman upbringing interplays with the Californian influence in \u201cCowboy in LA.\u201d The L.A. in LANY remains a consistent thread in their music.\n\nDuring their homecoming concert, the lead singer paused from the music to share his disbelief that the songs he wrote in his tiny apartment in Hollywood could go on to \u201cfill up the Forum.\u201d It was clear that this concert was of special importance to bandmates Paul Klein and Jake Doss.\n\nPaul Klein's piano skills encourages a sea of flashlights in the crowd. (Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\nThe band grew rapidly early in their career, and while they have maintained a loyal fan base \u2014 as evidenced by a nearly sold-out show this weekend \u2014 they have garnered criticism for their recent work, leaving some fans desiring the golden era of \u201cMalibu Nights.\u201d A quick Reddit search will show a whole slew of keyboard warriors who complain about unoriginal lyricism and radio-friendly pop that leaves something to be desired.\n\nWhile there\u2019s a part of me that leans towards the 2018 LANY compared to the 2024 LANY, witnessing \u201cA Beautiful Blur\u201d at the Kia Forum served as a poignant reminder of why I\u2019ve always cherished the band. LANY\u2019s lyrics may not be dissected in future literature classes for their poetic intricacies or deep symbolism, but their songs evoke a sense of familiarity. Not in the sense of recognizing the chords or melodies, but rather in how they capture the exact emotions you experienced at pivotal moments in your life\u2014like the heartbreak at 18, where your world feels like it\u2019s crumbling. Then at 19, in a new city, living with roommates, blasting music while cooking pasta in your tiny kitchen. At 20, when a name on your phone gives you butterflies, and at 21, when that same name ends up blocked.\n\nLANY\u2019s music provides solace for the dichotomy of emotions that accompany growing up. It gets you through the rough days and it helps you celebrate the good ones. In essence, the music feels real, it\u2019s relatable, and ultimately, it makes you feel better.\n\nProjections and lighting enhance the LANY tour experience. (Photo by Marissa Ding)\n\nLANY\u2019s ability to evoke emotions through their music extends seamlessly into their live performances. In the two hour performance, the audience was invited to revisit every era and every emotion we have ever shared with the band. Not only did they successfully accomplish this through their set list, but the execution of the live performance carried a cinematic weight. The  band reportedly worked with movie set designers  to match the lighting and stage design to the feelings that each song conveys. One minute the stage turned dark and phone flash lights went up as the audience cried over Klein sitting alone at the piano playing \u201cAlonica.\u201d Next, the lights turned pink and the crowd danced while the singer crowd surfed to the tune of \u201cOut of my League.\u201d All together, the band\u2019s stage presence, fan engagement and carefully curated set design created an immersive experience, the likes of which I have never experienced at a concert before. It\u2019s so captivating that even if you\u2019ve never heard of the band before, you\u2019d still likely find yourself deeply connected to their music.\n\nWhat people love about LANY\u2014what I love about LANY\u2014 is that they have something for everyone: Songs about falling in love, songs about falling out of love, bops that you can dance to, and ballads you can cry to. It is apparent when shuffling through their albums, yes, but it is an inevitability when you see them in concert.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of USC/Sean Dube)\n\nBy Daniel Park March 26, 2024 at 10:13 am PDT\n\nPresident Carol Folt honored Holocaust survivors and the Shoah Foundation Monday for its outstanding leadership in preserving the testimonies of the Holocaust during a private event at Town and Gown. The Shoah Foundation is an institute based at USC with the mission of telling the stories of Holocaust survivors and witnesses through audio-visual testimonies. The Foundation celebrated its 30-year anniversary Monday.\n\nPresident Folt opened up the afternoon with a speech highlighting the work done by the Shoah Foundation, the perseverance of the Holocaust survivors and the work that still needs to be done to stop the spread of anti-Semitism. \u201cOne survivor told me it\u2019s my duty to speak on the 6 million and I say it\u2019s our duty to ensure your voices are heard by 6 billion,\u201d Folt said.\n\nFolt also acknowledged the rise in American antisemitism after the Hamas attacks on Israel last fall. \u201cWe all know antisemitism is on the rise and frighteningly so, and we feel the searing pain of October 7 and we must fight antisemitism with everything,\u201d Folt said. \u201cThe survivors\u2019 testimonies are the best way to educate those up somewhat ignorant about the Holocaust view as the mission to preserve and protect these eyewitness accounts in perpetuity.\u201d\n\nCelina Biniaz, a Holocaust survivor and recipient of the University Medallion, echoed Folt\u2019s concerns about rising hate. \u201cToday we\u2019re living in a world shaken by tremendous divisions and horrible violence. We are seeing a frightening return of the same kind of antisemitism I experienced both before and after the war in Europe,\u201d Biniaz said. \u201cWe must never give in to the corrosive power of hatred, and we must always remember the power each individual has to transform the lives of others.\u201d\n\nBiniaz, a Jewish person who was saved because her family and her name were added to a list of workers who were to be protected from the Nazis, thanked Steven Spielberg and the Shoah Foundation for allowing her to speak her voice.\n\nAfter Folt\u2019s speech, Spielberg, an Oscar-winning USC alumnus and the founder of the Shoah Foundation, came forward to deliver his remarks. Spielberg, who grew up in a Jewish family, recounted how his grandmother taught English to Hungarian Holocaust survivors and said that he was taught to read numbers that were tattooed on survivors\u2019 arms.\n\nSpielberg also addressed the Israel-Hamas conflict and mentioned how the Shoah Foundation is more important than ever before. \u201cWe can rage against the heinous acts committed by the terrorists of October 7 and also decry the killing of innocent women and children in Gaza,\u201d Spielberg said. \u201cThis makes us a unique force for good in the world and is why we are here today to celebrate the work of the Shoah Foundation, which is more crucial now.\u201d\n\nOnly given three other times in history, the prestigious University Medallion medal was received on stage by Spielberg, Biniaz and Joel Citron, a Shoah Foundation board member. Other Holocaust survivors were in attendance as well.\n\nThe afternoon also included a musical performance of the prayer \u201cAni Ma\u2019amin\u201d by Hebrew Union College student Leslie Goldberg. A Zoom Q&A session with student athlete Rae Anne Serville and Holocaust survivor Shaul Ladany followed the performance.\n\n\u201cI think the event was beautifully done,\u201d said Carol Stulberg, a former interviewer and director of development for the Shoah Foundation who is currently a consultant for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. \u201cIt was a long time coming, and every single survivor who has given their testimony, and even those who haven\u2019t, deserve the accolades and the recognition for their bravery and their survivorship.\u201d```"}

In dominating fashion, the Trojans advanced to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 1994. USC freshman guard JuJu Watkins finished with a double-double, scoring a game-high 28 points and grabbing 11 rebounds. \u201cShe\u2019s an incredible generational talent,\u201d graduate guard McKenzie Forbes said. Forbes scored 20 points, knocking down six threes in the game. The Trojans opened the game with all of the momentum, as Watkins carried the load early. Her crafty ability to get into the paint and shooting ability outside gave the Trojans their first seven points. \u201cWe got stops early, and we came out hot; that helped just give us confidence,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. The Trojans\u2019 fast tempo and ball movement allowed them to get their shooters open. Graduate guard Kayla Padilla\u2019s and Forbes\u2019 contributions from beyond the arc had the Trojans\u2019 offense rolling, knocking down eight threes in the first half alone. In the midst of a hot start for the Trojans, they went on 12-0 to start the second quarter, capped by a Watkins 3-pointer, which rocked the Galen Center and put the Trojans up 15 points. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a blessing to play in front of this crowd,\u201d Forbes said. Defensively, the Trojans\u2019 suffocating man-to-man defense and quick hands proved pivotal in creating 12 first-half turnovers. The mistake-ridden Jayhawks offense kept the team from getting in any rhythm. However, Kansas kept fighting, even after a poor offensive performance in the first half. While USC held a double-digit lead for the majority of the first half, the Jayhawks\u2019 back-to-back buckets in the final seconds allowed them to get within 10, going into halftime at 33-24. After a sluggish start, Kansas came out with newfound energy in the second half, ultimately shifting the game\u2019s tide. The Jayhawks were able to pick up the slack on defense, switching into a zone defense. The new defensive strategy from the Jayhawks rattled Watkins and the Trojans offensive, allowing Kansas to regain some momentum. Getting out in transition off USC\u2019s poor shots and sloppy turnovers allowed the Jayhawks to build six- and nine-point runs in the third quarter. An explosive offensive performance in the quarter allowed Kansas to pull within one at the 1:20 mark. However, the Trojans weathered the storm and got back on track in the fourth quarter, outscoring the Jayhawks 20-9. Kansas resorted back to man-to-man defense in the quarter and paid the price. Facing the man-to-man defense, Watkins delivered nine fourth-quarter points to seal the deal. Down the stretch, USC junior center Clarice Akunwafo provided valuable minutes, utilizing her 6-foot-6 frame to wreak havoc on the Jayhawks\u2019 interior game. Akunwafo allowed nothing inside, blocking a career-high six shots and grabbing three steals. \u201cEvery time she comes into the game, I know that there\u2019s going to be absolutely no drop off,\u201d Watkins said. The USC Trojans continue to dance in March, facing the 5-seed Baylor Bears in a Sweet 16 matchup in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday at 2:30 p.m.\n```"}

Clemson won 77-56. (AP/George Walker IV)\n\nBy Terence Holton March 25, 2024 at 10:09 pm PDT\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d is a column by Terence Holton discussing the latest college basketball headlines. I was tricked, hornswoggled, bamboozled and led astray. Myself, along with much of the country, was convinced that the Mountain West was one of the best college basketball conferences in the country this season. This led me to commit errors when creating my bracket. I put New Mexico into my Elite Eight and believed that Colorado State would defeat Tennessee to advance to the Sweet 16. Both the Rams and Lobos would lose in blowout fashion in the Round of 64, properly crippling my brackets, where I currently rank 15 millionth of all brackets created on the ESPN Tournament Challenge.\n\nThe Mountain West received six bids into the NCAA Tournament, tied for the third-most of any conference. This included more than two Power Six conferences, such as the Big East, which only had three teams make it \u2014 those being No. 1 seed UConn, No. 2 seed Marquette and No. 3 seed Creighton. The six Mountain West teams that made the NCAA Tournament finished with a record of 68-8 outside of conference play and were poised to show that they deserved respect as one of college basketball\u2019s best conferences. That would not prove to be the case.\n\nSan Diego State and Utah State were the only teams to make it out of the first round, with many of the conference\u2019s teams showing almost no signs of life in their first-round matchups. Just to recap how pathetic the Mountain West teams were in the first round: New Mexico lost 77-56 to Clemson and was down by 20 points practically the entire game. Nevada was up 17 on Dayton with nearly seven minutes to play, but then proceeded to implode and lose 63-60. Boise State didn\u2019t even make it out of the First Four, bowing out 60-53 to Colorado. Colorado State did make it out of the First Four, beating Virginia. However, in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the Rams were held to 11 points in the first half and lost 56-44 to Texas. San Diego State squeaked by 12-seeded UAB but is still kicking. The Aztecs easily knocked off Yale in the Round of 32 and will now face top-seeded UConn in the Sweet Sixteen \u2014 a rematch of last season\u2019s championship game. Utah State was the only team who looked formidable in the first round, beating TCU by 16. But against one-seeded Purdue, the Aggies seemed to forget that defense is an important part of the game, losing 106-67.\n\nThis infuriating stretch for the Mountain West has solidified it as decidedly worse than the Power Six conferences. And with the Pac-12 exodus taking place upon this season\u2019s conclusion, there is a vacuum of space where one conference could escalate and become that next Power Six league. This would have been a golden opportunity for the Mountain West to step up and show they belong near the top of college basketball. Clearly, that won\u2019t be happening any time soon, as this complete and utter self-destruction has guaranteed the Mountain West will not be taken seriously in the near future.\n\nWhen it\u2019s all said and done, the selection committee evidently made a major error when allowing this many Mountain West teams into the Big Dance. Like I said earlier, though, they tricked me, too. Had I been on the selection committee, I would have ranked these teams even higher. However, it is now clear that unless there are multiple great teams from the conference, the Mountain West should in no way shape or form deserve more bids than the Big East \u2014 one of, if not the best conference in college basketball. I have no one to blame except myself. I was tricked by the media and my own brain into believing that Mountain West teams were primed to make a deep run into the NCAA tournament. The Mountain West from here on out is on Terence Holton\u2019s bad side.\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

While no actual football is played this month, free agency in the NFL is always a highly anticipated time for fans and general managers. It is an opportunity for every team to improve their roster, all in an effort to hoist the Lombardi trophy next season.\n\nThis year, the league surprised teams before the free agency period opened last week. In late February, the NFL announced a record-breaking salary cap raise, boosting every team\u2019s cap room by $30 million. The new cap in 2024 is $255 million, a 13.6% raise from 2023\u2032s cap of $224.8 million. The salary cap was around $133 million just ten years ago, showcasing the league\u2019s exponential growth over the last decade.\n\nAs the clock struck midnight on Monday, March 11, teams were officially allowed to begin negotiations, and the madness began. Big-name free agents like Kirk Cousins, Christian Wilkins and Patrick Queen didn\u2019t take long to find their new homes. Former Viking quarterback Cousins said goodbye to Skol Nation and headed south on a hefty four-year $180 million deal with the Falcons. Former Dolphins defensive tackle Wilkins chose a big payday with the Las Vegas Raiders, becoming the anchor in the middle for defensive coordinator Patrick Graham. And in a bizarre turn of events, former Ravens linebacker Queen signed with division rival Pittsburgh Steelers on a three-year $41 million deal.\n\nBeyond those three big signings that kicked off free agency, here are three takeaways from the first week of free agency frenzy:\n\nRunning Back Carousel\n\nThe running back position value has fallen off a cliff over the last few seasons as offenses transitioned to more of an air-raid passing system. The decreased position usage has caused teams to value backs less and look for a replacement-level player every two years or so. Last offseason, a handful of talented and proven running backs struggled to negotiate long-term deals. Saquan Barkley and Josh Jacobs took one-year deals to stay with their teams\u2014the Giants and Raiders\u2014while Tony Pollard played under the franchise tag in Dallas. The 2021 rushing leader, Johnathan Taylor, sat out the first four games this season, attempting to work a long-term deal. The consensus around the league is that the position is currently replaceable unless your name is Christian McCaffery.\n\nHowever, the 2024 Free Agency reignited the position\u2019s value, as running backs became a top priority this go-around. The Bears opened the door by signing former Eagles running back D\u2019Andre Swift to a three-year $24 million deal. Swift\u2019s deal ignited other teams to take a stab at the position. After playing under the tag in Dallas last season, Pollard left for a new home and a bigger payday with the Tennessee Titans for three years, $21 million. Veteran running backs Derrick Henry and Aaron Jones also found new homes. Henry landed in the AFC North with the Baltimore Ravens adding to a prolific rushing attack led by two-time MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson. Now-former Green Bay packer Jones decided to take the Brett Farve route, signing with division rival Minnesota Vikings. However, the biggest surprise came with former Giants running back Saquan Barkley joining the Philadelphia Eagles on a three-year $27 million deal. Sure, these deals aren\u2019t record-breaking contracts, but NFL teams made it clear they haven\u2019t given up on the position as a whole.\n\nBears End the Madness\n\nEverybody around the league had been waiting to see what the Bears would do with their former No. 11 overall pick, Justin Fields. Two weeks ago, the Bears finally pulled the trigger, trading the third-year quarterback to the Pittsburgh Steelers in exchange for a 6th-round pick \u2013 changes to 4th round pick depending on playtime next season. The question for Fields heading into free agency wasn\u2019t as much whether he would be traded but when. Poles did  \u201cdo right by Justin,\u201d  as the Bears had four other offers. The Bears listened to the request of Field\u2019s team, sending him to the quarterback\u2019s preferred destination.\n\nWith Fields officially out, the Bears are lined up to take presumptive number one overall pick Caleb Williams out of USC. And in preparation for William\u2019s arrival, the Bears got busy in free agency. In addition to Swift, the Bears signed tight-end Gerald Everett and traded for veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen. Allen, a long-time Chargers receiver, is coming off the best season of his career, recording 108 receptions, 1,243 yards and seven touchdowns. The Bear\u2019s offensive talent around Williams should give fans optimism heading into the 2024 season. However, there will be growing pains for the USC standout, but Williams brings a rare skillset to the quarterback position the Bears haven\u2019t had in a while. Williams can play and in out the pocket, creating many of his money-making plays off the script. He delivers the ball with great accuracy and zip, throwing with anticipation. And inside the pocket, Williams has excellent awareness, eluding to any incoming defenders. By adding Williams to a revamped offense, the Bears are setting themselves up to return to winning ways.\n\nAre the Houston Texans Contenders?\n\nLeading up to the 2023 season, the Houston Texans had very low expectations, with a first-year coach and rookie quarterback leading the charge. However, in preseason, all the experts were clearly wrong about this Texans team. Quarterback C.J. Stroud took the league by storm, leading an explosive Texans offensive to their first playoff berth and 10-win season since 2019. The Texans entered free agency looking to improve the holes in their roster, adding playmakers on both sides of the ball. In a wild last-minute trade, the Bengals traded Joe Mixon to the Texans for a 2024 seventh-rounder. The move gives Stroud a bell cow running back that will massively improve a Texans rushing offense that ranked 28th in YPG last season.\n\nConversely, the Texans have formed a dangerous one-two punch of edge rushers with their reigning Defensive Rookie of the Year Will Anderson and former Vikings defensive end Danielle Hunter. The Texans lured the 29-year-old Hunter with a two-year, $49 million deal. Hunter is coming off a career season in which he finished with 16.5 sacks and 23 tackles for loss. The duo of Anderson and Hunter should wreak havoc across the league. The roster improvements this offseason make the Texans genuine contenders in the AFC alongside the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens.\n\nNotable Free Agents Available\n\nRyan Tannehill, Quarterback, 35 Years Old\nDavid Bakhtirai, Left Tackle, 32 Years Old\nXavien Howard, Cornerback, 30 Years Old\nJamal Adams, Safety, 28 Years Old\n```"}

Instead, Hamas continues to stand in the way of peace.\u201d\n\nRamadan ends on April 9, about two weeks from today. Many countries hope to extend the ceasefire period following this resolution. Even though the United Nations does not have the means to enforce the resolution, USC Professor Laurie Brand stresses it takes more than just calling for a ceasefire. Actual implementation must follow.\n\nLaurie Brand \u201cIt\u2019s only a step. I don\u2019t want to say that it\u2019s only symbolic, but it has to be backed up by other measures that states will take. The ball is really in the U.S.\u2019 court to bring its various forms of leverage to bear on Israel to basically bring a ceasefire.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has vetoed several similar resolutions since the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Recently, the U.S. has become increasingly critical of Israel and more outspoken on the war. Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech earlier this month. She called for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d in the territory.\n\n[Kamala Harris] \u201cThere is a deal on the table and, as we have said, Hamas needs to agree on that deal. Let\u2019s get a ceasefire, let\u2019s reunite the hostages with their families, and let\u2019s provide immediate relief to the people of Gaza.\u201d\n\nLast Friday, the U.S. also proposed a resolution, but the draft was vetoed by China and Russia. Russia\u2019s Ambassador to the UN said the U.S. draft is \u201cmisleading\u201d as it stated an \u201cimperative\u201d rather than demanding a ceasefire. Again, USCs Professor Brand states the importance of wording.\n\nBrand: \u201cIt\u2019s really important to parse the language, because diplomats spent a long time working out exactly how they want to say what they say. So that was seen by a number of states as representing not a real commitment to a ceasefire.\u201d\n\nIn response to the US\u2019s decision to abstain from voting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled his delegation\u2019s planned upcoming visit to Washington D.C. National Security Communications. Advisor John Kirby said the White House is \u201cperplexed\u201d by Netanyahu\u2019s decision, as the U.S. did not change its policy\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Makayla Idelburg.\n```"}

Despite what Trump says is happening behind-the-scenes, here\u2019s what you should know.\n\nThis morning, news has developed in Trump\u2019s civil fraud case, centered on Trump lying about his wealth for years. According to the Los Angeles Times, A New York appeals court agreed to hold off collection of Trump\u2019s $454-million civil fraud judgement - if he puts up $175 million within 10 days.\u201d This is considered a big win for Trump - after all, who wouldn\u2019t want to pay less money?\n\nTrump was thankful himself.

The trial focuses on Trump\u2019s alleged $130,000 payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public about her claims of an affair during the final days of the 2016 presidential election. The delay was given in order to allow Trump\u2019s lawyers to review new evidence concerning key figure Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer who was ordered to pay the money to Daniels.\n\nIn addition to these cases, Trump has the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, the Georgia Election Interference case, and the Federal Election Interference case.

The university released its regular decision undergraduate admissions results for the class of 2028, which revealed around 82,000 prospective students applied, the highest in university history. Last year, the admissions rate was 9.9%, and respectively in 2010, it was 26.3%, according to Crimson Education.\n\nAccording to Kirk Brennan, the director of undergraduate admissions, USC has offered admission to around 9,000 students for the 2024 admissions cycle: 3,000 in early action, 4,600 for the fall, and 1,400 for Spring 2025.\n\nCharlotte Dor\u00e9, a prospective freshman for the class of 2028, said that the lower rates reflect an increasingly obscure and confusing admissions process across all universities. \u201cI think just each school looks for a different type of person,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s so many talented people applying. And sometimes it\u2019s just like throwing darts at a board until you hit a target and find one talented person out of a bunch because you can\u2019t take them all.\u201d\n\nFor many newly admitted students, opening the decision was a particularly nerve-racking process. \u201cI literally convinced my brain that it was going to be a rejection letter,\u201d Dor\u00e9 said. \u201cI was seeing a movie on Friday. And afterwards, I opened my phone and there was like, oh, \u2018update to your USC admissions portal.\u2019 And I\u2019m freaking out.

And it was the most insane moment of my life. My twin sister also applied to the music industry major. And I\u2019m like, \u2018Catherine, I\u2019m sorry, if you don\u2019t get in\u2019 and I opened hers. And she got in too. So we just started crying and screaming together.\u201d\n\nArman Ahmad, an incoming freshman admitted early action, said that he didn\u2019t believe it when he saw the acceptance letter. \u201cI was like, \u2018What the hell?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it at all.\u201d\n\nNate Quezada, a senior studying computer science, said that the lower admissions rates speak to the growing popularity of USC, both for its location and quality of education. \u201cSo many people from everywhere want to go to school in California and USC is one of the better schools that people want to go to,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it makes a lot of sense that a lot of people apply. When it\u2019s so popular, you can only accept so many.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the record-high application numbers and record-low admissions rates, USC is looking to make adjustments to the Trojan Transfer program, which had previously been offered to legacy students who were not admitted. This year, all students not offered admission will be given the opportunity to sign up for a Trojan Transfer Information Session during the summer, which Brennan said are intended to assist students in coursework planning so that they may become strong transfer candidates in the future.\n\nUSC will host an open house for newly admitted students April 7.\n```"}

(AP/Kyusung Gong)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner March 25, 2024 at 5:03 pm PDT\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 To no avail, the Ducks had the highest odds of winning the 2023 draft lottery and selecting sensational Canadian center Connor Bedard after finishing the season with the worst record in the NHL. Instead, Anaheim selected breakout Swedish center Leo Carlsson with the No. 2 pick, who has shown signs of stardom.\n\nUnlike some other top-five selections in 2023 like center Will Smith or defenseman David Reinbacher, Carlsson was immediately NHL-ready. He scored in his NHL debut in just the Ducks\u2019 third regular season game, posting two shots while also achieving a plus-two rating.\n\nSince his entrance to the league, Carlsson has displayed flashes of his offensive prowess despite dealing with injuries and scratches that have kept him sidelined for a number of games. The Swede has tallied 24 points through 44 games, placing him 13th on the rookie ladder, two spots behind Anaheim\u2019s highly touted defenseman Pavel Mintyukov.\n\nHis raw stats are admittedly nowhere near worthy of the Calder Memorial Trophy, but playing in fewer games than other rookies due to nagging injuries and a development plan have inhibited his potential. Minnesota\u2019s star blueliner Brock Faber, for context, is second among newcomers with 40 points in 71 games, averaging 0.56 points per game; Carlsson, while tallying fewer total points, averages a competitive 0.55 per outing.\n\nBefore making his way to Orange County, Carlsson played two seasons in the Swedish Hockey League, where he caught draft scouts\u2019 eyes. Last season with Orebro HK, he posted near-identical numbers to this year\u2019s campaign, with 25 points in 44 games. But the playoffs were where he really shined. Carlsson tallied an impressive 9 points in 13 games during Orebro\u2019s run through the postseason.\n\nHe also ranked third on Team Sweden with six points in seven games during the 2023 World Juniors and even occasionally manned the top line. Carlsson uses his 6-foot-3, 194-pound frame to physically dominate weaker defenders and create offensive chances. With precise vision and soft hands, the 19-year-old is a pure playmaker; he efficiently tatters defenses and punishes weaker opponents with his strength to find open lanes in the offensive zone.\n\nCarlsson isn\u2019t afraid to forecheck and can act as a two-way enforcer when needed. He\u2019s confident, stout and intelligent with the puck and can be a threat from anywhere on the ice. He uses his quickness and puck-hungry mindset to battle on the boards for chances. When he\u2019s not handling the puck, he\u2019s finding ways to create space and make himself available to receive a pass.\n\nHis stickhandling and evasiveness have translated to the NHL and while his point production has cooled slightly since his electric entrance, he still plays with a savviness years ahead of other skaters his age.\n\nAmong Carlsson\u2019s brightest flashes this season was a hat-trick against the Philadelphia Flyers on Nov. 10 and clear comfortability playing on the top lines in a number of games.\n\nSince going from the SHL to the NHL right away can be a stark adjustment, Carlsson has been a healthy scratch from time to time, but not because of subpar play\u2014just as a developmental tool. The Ducks know that Carlsson is going to be a cornerstone piece of the team for years to come, so allowing him to see ice time in moderation amid a period where he could still be physically growing will allow him to develop at a natural rate.\n\nHis cautious developmental plan unfortunately hasn\u2019t prevented him from facing injuries this season. March has been a rough month for the young forward; he\u2019s suffered upper-body wounds, a concussion and a knee injury, but hopes to finish the season\u2019s final stretch healthy.\n\nFortunately, his development track hasn\u2019t limited his leadership capacity, as he\u2019s seen lengthy ice time and offensive confidence in the middle when available while working simultaneously to build toward the future.\n\nOn a team with a stacked prospect pipeline, Carlsson will not be expected to be a depth piece on the future core, but rather a superstar commander of the top lines. Carlsson will only continue to enhance his mechanics and physical ability in future seasons.\n\nThis upcoming offseason will not only offer him a needed rest period, but also a time to get stronger and brace himself for a bigger role next season. Bedard and Faber might be headlining this season\u2019s rookie class, but Anaheim\u2019s general manager Pat Verbeek and Carlsson know that with time, the Swedish standout will break out and be a franchise catalyst well worth the No. 2 pick.\n```"}

Ward used a hip-drop tackle, landing on Pollard's left leg. Pollard sustained a fractured fibula and high ankle sprain. (AP/Scot Tucker)\n\nBy Sullivan Maley March 25, 2024 at 4:48 pm PDT\n\nORLANDO \u2014 The NFL\u2019s competition committee voted unanimously at Monday\u2019s Annual League Meeting to ban the controversial \u201chip-drop\u201d tackling style that has gained traction across the league in recent years. A hip-drop tackle involves a tackler wrapping their arms around a ball carrier from behind and leaving their feet to allow their body weight to pull the ball carrier to the ground, trapping the ball carrier\u2019s feet or legs under the tackler\u2019s body in the process. This style of tackling\u2014popularized in rugby\u2014can often lead to knee, ankle or other lower body injuries, as it places a ball carrier\u2019s legs in a compromised position by applying significant weight at an unnatural angle.\n\nThe official rule reads: ARTICLE 18. HIP-DROP TACKLE. It is a foul if a player uses the following technique to bring a runner to the ground: (a) grabs the runner with both hands or wraps the runner with both arms; and (b) unweights himself by swiveling and dropping his hips and/or lower body, landing on and trapping the runner\u2019s leg(s) at or below the knee. Penalty: For a Hip-Drop Tackle: Loss of 15 yards and an automatic first down.\n\nThe movement to ban the technique picked up steam after a Nov. 16 matchup between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Baltimore Ravens, when Bengals linebacker Logan Wilson took down Ravens tight end Mark Andrews with a hip-drop tackle. Andrews was subsequently placed on injured reserve with a cracked fibula and ankle ligament damage. Other notable players injured in similar plays include Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill, Cowboys running back Tony Pollard and Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson.\n\nWhile a sizable cadre of fans felt Andrews\u2019 injury was avoidable, the Oklahoma product does not blame Wilson for the injury. \u201cIt kind of was just an unfortunate event,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cI don\u2019t blame the guy. He was just playing hard.\u201d\n\nWhile the vote was unanimous among the NFL\u2019s Competition Committee, the decision drew criticism from the NFLPA. \u201cThe players oppose any attempt by the NFL to implement a rule prohibiting a \u2018swivel hip-drop\u2019 tackle,\u201d said the NFLPA in a statement prior to the decision. \u201cWhile the NFLPA remains committed to improvements to our game with health and safety in mind, we cannot support a rule change that causes confusion for us as players, for coaches, for officials, and especially, for fans. We call on the NFL, again, to reconsider implementing this rule.\u201d\n\nA number of defenders took to social media Monday to criticize the decision, with many alleging the committee favors offenses in crafting and implementing rule changes. Steelers linebacker Patrick Queen, a former teammate of Andrews in Baltimore, sees the change as a step in the wrong direction. 2 hand touch gone be next lmao \u2014 (@Patrickqueen_) March 25, 2024\n\nPatriots linebacker Ja\u2019Whaun Bentley listed the decision as one in a series of changes he believes favor NFL offenses. *No HorseCollar *No Ducking the Head *No Hip Drop *No Slamming *No Big Hits on Defenseless Receiver Y\u2019all must not have had to tackle these dudes before \u2014 JB (@NVBentley33) March 25, 2024\n\nAccording to ESPN, NFL executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent \u201cstrongly implied\u201d the rule will usually be enforced like the \u201cuse of helmet\u201d rule via warnings and fines assessed after a game instead of flags during play. Competition committee chairman Rich McKay told reporters Monday that the rule would be enforced via flags, but only if three specific requirements are met: I asked competition committee chair Rich McKay how they\u2019ll train officials on penalty they admit is hard to discern. The message: This is a penalty. Call it. But call it only if you see the defender: 1) Grab opponent and get control 2) Swivel him 3) Unweight him Need all 3.\n```"}

(Graphic by Nova Blanco-Rico)\n\nBy Beverly Martinez-Castillo March 25, 2024 at 4:34 pm PDT\n\nMany University of Southern California students yearn for a space to feel supported and resourced when attending, which is what undocumented students have been petitioning for since 2021. However, no space has been planned on site. The student-run organization, Improving Dreams, Equality, Access, and Success (IDEAS) has been attempting to create a center exclusively for undocumented students to provide multiple resources. Though the idea was approved by the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) last semester, administrators have yet to say when the creation will occur.\n\n\u201cUndocumented students experience higher levels of anxiety than the average student due to concerns about their finances, worries about immigration enforcement, anxieties about being accepted on college campuses, and fears of not qualifying for a job,\u201d said the UndocuTrojan Resource Center Proposal from IDEAS. \u201cThe limited academic, financial, and career resources causing depression and anxiety for undocumented students is leading to two in three Dreamers meeting the clinical cutoff for anxiety and depression.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, the Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California had the Supreme Court rule that DACA could not be completely void and would still protect those under the program following multiple groups of plaintiffs that sued the DHS; more significantly, the members of the governing body of the University of California. Gould School of Law professor and co-director of the Immigration Clinic at USC, Jean Reisz states that DACA is no longer the protective measure she recommends to immigrants she consults and represents, though most of her clients don\u2019t rely on DACA.\n\n\u201cWith DACA, they are no longer accepting applications but students who are currently under DACA are still entitled to renew it,\u201d Reisz said. \u201cWe represent asylum seekers from Russia, Honduras, and Nicaragua.\u201d\n\nFrom the concerns of IDEAS to other student-run organizations, USC is not accordingly protecting their undocumented students and ensuring that their studies will be of service to their careers. It is not just students who hold this belief. Professor Reisz believes, \u201cUSC can do more,\u201d for its undocumented students.\n\nThe Director of Internal Outreach at IDEAS, Alexa Hernandez Diaz feels that the negligence of undocumented students, once admitted, has social ramifications. \u201cFinancial aid and lack of social security can affect undocumented individuals\u2019 education and their mental health,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cNot knowing whether a degree will help you because of lack of status and work permits it affects the potential that got them into USC.\u201d\n\nThe concern Diaz brings up is echoed by Kevyn Calleja, president of IDEAS, who believes the attitude toward him has changed as an undocumented student. As to those who wonder why he chose USC despite its problems he states, \u201cYeah, I chose this university because I felt welcomed but not anymore.\u201d\n\nUSG member and IDEAS advocacy liaison, Heydy Vasquez, used the open forum of a senate meeting last month to vocalize her concerns over the undergraduate government\u2019s support for a dream center. \u201cWith over 60 members in the legislative branch and over 200 members in USG, I care to know why only 5 members of this organization actively support the creation of a dream center,\u201d said Vasquez.\n\nDuring the duration of their protest, they have not gotten a response from Carol Folt or other directors of Student Equity and Inclusion programs in creating a space or working towards this space. As of right now, due to the lack of response, IDEAS is petitioning to become recognized as a USG Student Assembly to gain more resources.

{"key": "/2024/03/25/navigating-post-grad-employment-in-the-media-industry/", "response": "```\nNavigating post-grad employment in the media industry\n\nAs the 2024 commencement ceremony looms, a familiar question hangs in the air: \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019 \n\nFor media students just two months shy of their diplomas, the future holds a vibrant, yet often bewildering, media marketplace. While compelling narratives or shaping public discourse is exciting, navigating the ever-evolving media landscape and landing the right job can feel like deciphering a code. It is crucial to explore various niches within the industry to identify areas that align with your interests and skills. Company websites, job listing sites and professional associations can offer information to help better understand specific job titles, required skill sets and average salaries. This knowledge allows you to tailor your resume and portfolio to target specific opportunities.\n\nAssistant Dean of Student Affairs and Director of Career Development at USC Annenberg Suzanne Alcantara says it\u2019s normal for students to feel stressed in a process that can feel new and in turn, overwhelming. With perseverance and a strategy, the process of finding a job becomes easier. The first step in hunting for a job is understanding the diverse terrain. Alcantara emphasized setting short-term goals. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to take an assessment of the skills and interests you have in the present moment and set some goals for six months to a year [from now],\u201d Alcantara said.\n\nThe media industry encompasses a vast array of specialties, from a fast-paced role like social media management to more in-depth, analysis-heavy roles like data journalism. Platforms like LinkedIn Learning and Google offer free courses to help hone your expertise. Resumes and cover letters are the elementary aspects to master as a part of the job hunt. Error-free resumes and cover letters that explain how the job specifically interests you and matches your unique skill set always stand out in the hiring process. USC Career Services offer support to students through advising, resume reviews and mock interview practice.\n\nCreating a niche\nIt can be difficult to figure out which skills are marketable, but identifying a niche is a good first step to streamline the job hunting process. Alcantara stressed the importance of researching which abilities are increasing in relevance as the media landscape evolves, align with one\u2019s interests and can help make a stronger case for employment. The niche for international students could be their native language and the cultural fluency that a company needs to bridge diversity within both their business and outside expanding markets.\n\nNetworking\nThe media world thrives on networking. According to Alcantara, networking is crucial in a very competitive media landscape. \u201cI don\u2019t want students to stress themselves out but it really comes down to relationships and visibility,\u201d she said. Engage in professional discussions online and offline to demonstrate your knowledge and passion. Attend industry events \u2013 like conferences, workshops, lectures \u2013 to connect with professionals and learn about potential job openings. Job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn are also good starting points. Explore the career sections of media companies you\u2019d love to work for and network with alumni from your journalism or communications program.\n\nMapping your path to a \u201cdream job\u201d\nOne piece of advice Alcantara often gives students is to ensure they understand the path professionals typically must follow before meeting career goals. \u201cOne of the things that we naturally do is we look at companies of which we are consumers, particularly journalism students [and] media students,\u201d she said. When looking to land one\u2019s \u201cdream job,\u201d which can often be at a reputed media conglomerate, it is important to map the trajectory of others who have pursued it \u2014 the skillsets, certificates and previous experience. Freshly entering the job market, this map not only helps one understand the areas to improve in but also the jobs needed that give a headstart to enter a larger, more reputable company. This process also helps uncover smaller organizations where new employees can grow their skill set and begin to climb the corporate ladder.\n\nThe media landscape is constantly evolving. Freelance opportunities and part-time roles act as a great alternative if the traditional route seems daunting. Pitching story ideas to publications or offering social media expertise to local businesses could be the first step in exploring alternative options. Freelancing also allows one to build a portfolio while gaining valuable experience and establishing connections.\n\nBenefits and negotiations\nIn some states like California and New York, salary transparency helps answer monetary concerns of job seekers. However, Alcantara mentioned that as an entry level employee, there isn\u2019t much leverage to negotiate the actual salary and benefits, reiterating the need for \u201ca certain level of experience to really be in a place to have a meaningful salary negotiation.\u201d While benefits like insurance, retirement and time off are good to be aware of, Alcantara highlighted the importance of researching future colleagues, from supervisors to peers. Researching the role you would fill, a supervisor you would answer to and the orbit of people you will work with provides a better insight into the work culture. Understanding your potential workplace increases the chances of finding a mentor, whether formal or informal. Alcantara explained mentors in career paths provide an environment for growth by supporting professional development, opening doors and offering feedback. A good mentor in a career path can help you move up the ladder effectively.\n\nThe interview\nAll the preparatory work will likely lead to a crucial part of hiring - the interview. The \u2018homework,\u2019 includes researching the media outlet beforehand, understanding their target audience and content style to provide your assessment of what is expected within the role. A better knowledge of their notable work, case studies, board members and sister organizations can elevate your understanding of the workspace. Presentation and articulation goes a long way in interviews. According to Alcantara, the ideal time to start looking for opportunities is eight to ten weeks before graduation \u2013 the time frame job recruiters give themselves to fill a role. For those still waiting to start their job hunt, the right time is now.\n```"}

Haley went on to win the county, but failed to win her home state. (Photo by Nick Charles Currie)\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie\nMarch 25, 2024 at 3:10 pm PDT\n\nIRMO, S.C. \u2014 The South Carolina Republican primary made clear that much of the GOP voter base is not swayed by the criminal charges or any of the other issues plaguing former President Donald Trump. He\u2019s been attacked by the Democrats and even within his own party, but his standing remained strong as former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley promised to keep up her quixotic battle to become the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nRepublicans defended Trump again and again in interviews across the state the week before Saturday\u2019s primary, which he won with nearly 60% of the votes. \u201cLook, what they\u2019re doing to Trump because he is an outsider, all these lawsuits are just crazy,\u201d said Greg Cline, a veteran who voted a week before the election at the early voting station in Lexington, in support of Trump. \u201cNever happened in history before that they\u2019d attack the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re overplaying their hand,\u201d Ed Cheek, attending Haley\u2019s Feb. 17 rally at a public park here, said of the charges against the former president. \u201cEven people who hate Trump are turning to Trump, and they say they\u2019re gonna vote for him because they\u2019re piling on.\u201d Cheek, a 78-year-old who spent time after the rally passing out small booklets lionizing former president Ronald Reagan, said he does not doubt that Trump is guilty of some wrongdoing, but what the former president currently faces, he said, is excessive.\n\nThis February day, Cheek was far from the only voter skeptical of Trump\u2019s legal troubles, which only increased the following month. Trump\u2019s continued perception as an outsider, even after four years as president, plays a major role in his ability to throw off attacks. Having cultivated a strong distrust of longtime politicians, Trump has set himself apart from the rest of the biggest names in politics.\n\n\u201cLook at the Bidens, the Nancy Pelosis, the Chuck Schumers ... Mitch McConnell. These people need to get out. These people are ruining our country,\u201d Cline said. \u201cThere\u2019s a deep state, there\u2019s an underlying evil force in Washington. These people are power-hungry... and they want to control us. I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d\n\nMany of these claims are directly downstream of Trump\u2019s frequent anti-establishment rhetoric. Cline wasn\u2019t the only voter vocally afraid of the \u201cdeep state\u201d Trump often references. For most people, the deep state is a collection of powerful governmental actors, both elected and unelected, who run the country according to their own desires rather than the desires of the American people.\n\n\u201cI mean, the first time I heard that Trump was going to run, I thought \u2018I am not voting for him,\u2019\u201d Alexandra Dickinson, an 81-year-old Trump voter with short, white hair and a white puffer jacket, said after submitting her early ballot in Lexington. \u201cBut the more I got to know, the more I understood what was going on, I mean we\u2019re combatting a very, very big and very, very old atheistic cabal and... they\u2019re finally letting us know about it.\u201d\n\nDickinson is one of many Republican voters who said they do not believe that Joe Biden won the 2020 election. She said she holds significant doubts about the legitimacy of early and absentee voting, noting that she used to live in Georgia\u2019s Fulton County \u2014 one of the counties she believes had suspicious results. Nonetheless, she showed up to vote early.\n\nWhy? \u201cI think Trump wanted us to early vote,\u201d she said. \u201cProbably because so many people are going to be voting for him.\u201d The former president began posting videos encouraging early voting last summer. \u201cCommit to voting early,\u201d Trump said in one such video. \u201cWe must defeat the far left at their own game, or our country will never recover from this disastrous, crooked Biden administration.\u201d\n\nAlthough many voters are unconcerned about Trump\u2019s actions and rhetoric, that is not true of the whole party. The former president\u2019s penchant for belittling members of the military, most recently mocking Haley\u2019s deployed husband\u2019s absence from the campaign trail, has rubbed some Republicans the wrong way.\n\n\u201cAs the wife of a Vietnam veteran, I am appalled that Donald Trump denigrates the military,\u201d Katherine Frankstone, a South Carolina native, said after Haley\u2019s Irmo rally. \u201cI am honored to be married to a veteran and respect his and every other military serviceperson\u2019s service and I support [Haley] particularly because of her stance on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe disrespected my grandfather in World War I, he disrespected my father, who was on the second wave at Omaha Beach,\u201d added her husband, Manning Frankstone. \u201cAnd he disrespected you.\u201d \u201cAnd he disrespected me,\u201d he finished sadly.\n\nThe Frankstones\u2019 fear of Trump was not limited to what they see as the former president\u2019s lack of respect for the military. \u201cNikki\u2019s word \u2018unhinged\u2019 is accurate. He is out of touch with reality, he is a liar and a cheat, he is a misogynist. I can\u2019t think of a good thing to say about him and to have him as the leader of the free world scares the sh*t out of me,\u201d Katherine Frankstone said.\n\nThose concerns about Trump\u2019s character didn\u2019t play a part in others\u2019 decisions, however. \u201cNone of us like his personality, but you\u2019ve got to be able to separate the personality from the policies,\u201d Cheek said. \u201cJust because you hate his personality, you can\u2019t assume everything he does is bad for the country.\u201d\n\nThe Frankstones are in the minority of their party, but they are not alone in fearing a second Trump presidency. \u201cThis election will determine whether or not \u2014 I\u2019m convinced of this \u2014 whether or not we continue our pursuit of a more perfect union or whether or not we will drift into an autocracy,\u201d said Rep. James Clyburn, the only Democratic member of the South Carolina congressional delegation.\n\nClyburn spoke to Annenberg Media in his office the day after he stepped down from the party\u2019s house leadership to have more time to share his fears of America\u2019s future with voters. \u201cPeople are substituting style for substance,\u201d he added, attributing Biden\u2019s struggle for popularity and Trump\u2019s devoted base to each candidate\u2019s style.\n\nWill Trump\u2019s style of politics keep its hold on the party once he is no longer at the forefront? Even his supporters had doubts. \u201cI think he\u2019s one of a kind and he\u2019s the only one who\u2019s really strong enough to deal with the foreign difficulties that we have. I don\u2019t think Nikki could handle that,\u201d Dickinson said. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t think it should be a woman considering how bad things really are.\u201d\n\nStout defenses against a barrage of attacks are nothing new for the Palmetto State \u2014 in fact, such a defense contributed to that nickname for South Carolina. The week before the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, British troops attempted to take Charleston. They were held back by an incomplete fort, filled in with palmetto logs and sand which were soft enough to absorb most cannon shots\u2019 impacts. Now, a battle is being waged with similar results \u2014 whatever anyone throws at Trump just bounces right off \u2014 at least, that\u2019s how his supporters see it.\n```"}

They started the season undefeated with one win and three draws, one point better than LAFC.\n\nSaturday\u2019s match against Nashville proved to be the igniting force for the team. A convincing 5-nil win, where the team could have scored more, has helped bring back vintage LAFC. Fans were worried that the team\u2019s identity was fading with all the new names, but their worries were soon forgotten.\n\n\u201cIt was a small step tonight. Some things went really well, and some things we still need to improve on, and we will address that this week,\u201d were head coach Steve Cherundolo\u2019s reaction to the team\u2019s progress.\n\nLast season\u2019s MLS top goal scorer Denis Bouanga scored twice with an assist, his first goals of the season. The Gabon international had rumors of leaving the club during the offseason but elected to stay with LAFC. After hitting the post seven times this season, he finally found the back of the net in front of the Black and Gold faithful.\n\n\u201cDenis needs to stay in our structure, and he did that and he was fantastic. When everybody buys into one idea and not eleven different ideas, everyone looks stronger,\u201d Cherundolo said about Bouanga\u2019s recent performances.\n\nIn addition, Bouanga looks to improve from last year\u2019s historical form. Having taken control of the team from the missing Carlos Vela, his creativity, power and scoring abilities were all showcased against Nashville SC.\n\n\u201cI always want to do better than the previous season, so that is the objective: to be better. Although we are playing in less competitions, the objective is to bring back the golden boot,\u201d Bouanga said.\n\nNo news about former captain Vela has led to transfer rumors of World Cup winning Olivier Giroud signing with the team as the new striker. Currently, the experiment with midfielder Mateuz Bogusz hasn\u2019t proven successful. The team had only scored two goals all season before the thrashing, both in their home opener win. A different tactic from the free flowing offense LA usually plays with.\n\n\u201cAny player of that caliber will help any team. A true nine, certainly a position we\u2019re looking for,\u201d Cherundolo said.\n\nFullback Ryan Hollingshead was proud of the team\u2019s ability to get a clean sheet. With the help of Nashville\u2019s goalkeeper getting a red card in the 62nd minute along with having \u201cworld-class\u201d goalkeeper Hugo Lloris leading the defense, Hollingshead was able to lead the backline helping his team holistically.\n\n\u201cThis guy has so much experience. He\u2019s come from a top league in the world, playing at the highest level. I hear him talking to me during the whole game, which is so good as a defender,\u201d Hollingshead said to the media.\n\nThe Black and Gold continue their season on Saturday, March 30 against the Colorado Rapids in Denver, a vital matchup for a playoff spot.\n```"}

UCLA took a 6-3 victory on Sunday following a 90-minute rain delay that began during the bottom of the seventh inning, giving the Bruins the series win. The rubber-match loss gave USC (8-15, 4-5 Pac-12) its first series loss since playing Arizona (10-12, 4-5) earlier in March, and its first series loss to UCLA (9-12, 4-5) since 2021.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 bats came alive to start the rivalry series against the Bruins, posting season highs in runs and hits en route to a 15-2 blowout win Friday night. A convincing comeback fell short in the teams\u2019 second meeting and in the third, USC\u2019s offense could never find a true spark.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, USC\u2019s starting pitching had mixed results at Jackie Robinson Stadium across the weekend. Junior pitcher Caden Aoki, who started the season with a 0-3 record but finally earned a win against Stanford (9-11, 3-3) on March 15, pitched a gem Friday night. Aoki dealt four innings of scoreless ball and only surrendered one run on five hits. The righty appears to have found his rhythm after a handful of dismal starts to begin the season.\n\nSenior Tyler Stromsborg and graduate Jared Feikes wished they could\u2019ve had the same success as Aoki against the bitter rivals, but UCLA\u2019s offense bested the veteran pitchers. Stromsborg was credited with his fifth loss of the campaign and still remains winless with a 7.20 ERA, while Feikes moved to 1-1 with a 4.50 ERA. In games two and three, Stromsborg and Feikes each allowed four and five runs, respectively.\n\nThe USC bullpen was a bit more consistent than its starters. In games one and three, Trojan relievers only allowed one run. However, on Saturday, the bullpen allowed the Bruins to cushion their lead in the sixth inning, turning their one-run advantage into three, making USC\u2019s comeback effort that much tougher.\n\nSophomore outfielder Austin Overn was riding a nine-game hitting streak heading into the series, but only managed to tally a hit on Saturday, a third-inning single. Sophomore catcher Jacob Galloway continued his tear, raising his hitting streak to 22 games and his batting average to .370. Despite his team falling short on the scoreboard on two occasions, the backstop still came up huge for the Trojans in the series.\n\nIn game one, he opened up scoring with a towering home run to right field and contributed four RBIs total in the game. In the second game, he helped USC\u2019s ninth-inning rally with an RBI double, and in the third matchup, while not driving in any runs, he set the tone for the Trojan offense with the first hit of the game.\n\nSenior infielder Ryan Jackson drove in five runs on five hits in the series. In addition to the Trojans\u2019 usual sluggers making impacts, other players in need of a hot streak also stepped up this weekend: sophomore infielder Ethan Hedges and senior outfielder Carson Wells tallied five knocks, and Wells went deep in the final game.\n\nThe Bruins\u2019 shut-down pitching in games two and three certainly didn\u2019t help ease USC\u2019s inconsistencies at the plate. In each of UCLA\u2019s two wins, sophomore pitcher Cody Delvecchio combined for just one earned run and two hits, bringing him to a stout 2.38 ERA on the season.\n\nUCLA\u2019s redshirt junior infielder AJ Salgado went hitless in the first contest, but contributed immensely the rest of the series. In game two, he helped bolster the Bruins\u2019 lead with an RBI single, and in the rubber match, he hit the game-tying RBI single in the third inning and later tripled to extend UCLA\u2019s advantage.\n\nUSC\u2019s next test will be a bout with the Mountain West-leading Fresno State Bulldogs (16-7, 6-3 Mountain West) before a three-game series against the Pac-12-leading Oregon State Beavers (21-2, 5-1 Pac-12). The Trojans will face the Bulldogs on Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. at Great Park in Irvine.\n```"}

(Photo by Eric Park)\n\nBy Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier March 24, 2024 at 5:14 pm PDT\n\nLess than two weeks after USC men\u2019s basketball finished a disappointing season with a 70-49 loss to Arizona in the Pac-12 Tournament quarterfinals and missed the opportunity to play in the NCAA Tournament, three players have decided to leave the Trojans and enter the transfer portal.\n\nSophomore forward Kijani Wright was the first Trojan to leave, entering the portal on March 18. In two seasons with USC, Wright only averaged 10.8 minutes per game. Despite fellow big men Joshua Morgan and Vincent Iwuchukwu missing time with illnesses and injuries, Wright was never able to solidify a bigger role for himself. Despite increasing his rebounds per game from 1.8 last year to 2.6 this year, he only averaged 0.3 blocked shots per game this year compared to 0.5 last season. Wright leaves the Trojans looking to see more playing time at a new school where he can improve his game with his final two years of eligibility.\n\nSophomore guard Oziyah Sellers entered the transfer portal on March 19 after two seasons with the Trojans. Despite only averaging 14.3 minutes per game, Sellers made the most of his opportunities, shooting 46.7% from the field with a 3-point percentage of 42.6%, up 11.2% and 16.6%, respectively, from last year. This was most notable when he got the chance to start in six games in place of guards Boogie Ellis and Isaiah Collier when they were dealing with injuries during the early and middle stretches of the season. Sellers moves on after proving to be a go-to, yet underutilized weapon for USC offensively. He\u2019ll try to find a new home where he can get more looks as a dangerous shooting option.\n\nJunior guard Kobe Johnson, who has been with USC for the last three seasons, entered the transfer portal on Friday after starting 28 of the 31 games he appeared in this season. His offensive game regressed this season, as he shot 40.4% from the field and 31.3% from the 3-point line this season, both statistics lower than his sophomore season shooting numbers. Despite doubling his blocks per game from 0.4 to 0.8, his steals per game remained at 2.2, while his rebounds per game dropped from 5.0 to 4.6. Due to his strong defensive play for most of the season, Johnson was named to the All-Pac-12 Defensive Team. In addition to entering the portal, Johnson has also declared for the NBA Draft. However, he has opted against hiring an agent in order to maintain his college eligibility as he looks for a fresh start after a tough third year with USC.\n\nWith Wright, Sellers and Johnson all moving on, head coach Andy Enfield will have to replace more than just his outgoing seniors in Morgan, Ellis and DJ Rodman. In addition, Collier, who just finished his freshman year with USC, is expected to declare for the draft, while freshman guard Bronny James is still deciding whether to try and join his father LeBron in the NBA. USC will likely be replacing more than half the roster as the team prepares for its first season in the Big Ten next winter.\n```"}

The Jayhawks needed overtime to come out ahead against the Michigan Wolverines (20-14) to win 81-72, while the Trojans handled No. 16-seeded Texas A&M-Corpus Christi (23-8) with ease, taking a 87-55 blowout victory.\n\nTakeaways from Kansas vs. Michigan\nKansas against No. 9 seed Michigan was a thrilling nailbiter. Down double digits in the fourth quarter, the Jayhawks inched their way back and found themselves down three heading into a timeout with under 20 seconds to go. With 12 seconds left in regulation, Kansas\u2019 fifth-year guard Zakiyah Franklin pulled the trigger from deep to tie the game, upon an eruption from the Jayhawk faithful that made the trip. In overtime, Kansas held the Wolverines to just five points and capped off its electric comeback.\n\nFreshman guard S\u2019Mya Nichols, appearing in her first NCAA tournament game, posted six points in the extra period, including some clutch free throws. Erasing a fourth-quarter deficit further proved the Jayhawks\u2019 ability to overcome adversity. Placing seventh in the Big 12, Kansas had to face a gauntlet of stout opponents such as Texas (31-4), Oklahoma (23-9) and Kansas State (26-7) all season \u2014 all three being top-five seeds in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nOn top of her clutch 3-point prayer, Franklin nearly doubled her season scoring average (11.7 points), tallying 22 on 56% shooting against Michigan. In a game that saw the Jayhawks\u2019 offense start out slow and appear stagnant at times, they rose to the occasion when it mattered. On the defensive side of the ball, Kansas often struggled to stop Wolverines senior forward Cameron Williams and junior guard Laila Phelia, who constantly penetrated the Jayhawks inside the key. But, both combined for just five points in the fourth quarter and didn\u2019t score in overtime, as Kansas\u2019 defense managed to do its job.\n\nJayhawk senior guard Wyvette Mayberry, fifth-year senior center Taiyanna Jackson and Nichols all scored at least 14 points each, displaying Kansas\u2019 spread-out talent. Jackson, who\u2019s been a star for the Jayhawks throughout the season, struggled early on in the game, but she picked up her play and converted important shots down the stretch to turn things around.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to be a real program and one that can advance in the NCAA tournament and hopefully one day, compete for Big 12 titles,\u201d head coach Brandon Schneider said. Victor of the 2023 WNIT, Kansas is looking to make its first Sweet 16 appearance since 2013.\n\nTakeaways from USC vs. Texas A&M-Corpus Christi\nFrom the jump, USC took aggressive control of its matchup with the Islanders in front of its home fans. Only one No. 16 seed has ever beaten a No. 1 seed in women\u2019s college basketball, and with that in mind, the Trojans made sure to not be on the wrong side of history. The duo of freshman guard JuJu Watkins and graduate guard McKenzie Forbes each tallied 23 points en route to USC\u2019s first NCAA Tournament win since 2006.\n\nCorpus Christi only mustered 20 points by halftime, and the Trojans led for all but 59 seconds of the game. USC\u2019s defense, which has been one of its many strong suits this season, blocked a whopping 14 shots and pickpocketed the Islanders 14 times. Corpus Christi only shot 33%, while the Trojans dominated from all three levels and posted a 52% field goal percentage. USC forced a total of 19 turnovers thanks to its size advantage and defensive prowess.\n\nOne of its main anchors of the defensive front, junior center Rayah Marshall, recorded a double-double with 10 points and 11 rebounds. After facing some peaks and valleys to begin the season, Marshall has been on fire as of late; the 6-foot-4 Los Angeles native has grabbed double-digit rebounds in each of her last six games and has been a force to be reckoned with down on the block.\n\nForbes\u2019 run of impressive performances has been indicative of her grit and will to improve. Since shooting 2-for-10 against Arizona State, Forbes hasn\u2019t finished a game below 40% and has sufficiently complemented Watkins in the backcourt.\n\n\u201cI try to be as active as I can defensively,\u201d Forbes said after Saturday\u2019s game. \u201cWhen we\u2019re running out in transition, I think that\u2019s when we\u2019re playing our best.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s performance against the Islanders was light work, but as March Madness continues, its games are only going to get tougher.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just important to have confidence. I have a lot of confidence in this team,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot on the line. At the end of the day, I trust that my teammates and I are going to get the job done because we put in so much work.\u201d\n\nKeys to USC vs. Kansas\nThe Trojans will not only benefit from playing in front of their home fans again, but also from a rest standpoint after Kansas\u2019 stressful overtime contest. With that noted, the Jayhawks still shouldn\u2019t be counted out. They\u2019ll enter the second round hot with momentum and an extra pep in their steps.\n\nThe matchup of Marshall and Jackson down low will be a must-watch. Both are defensive-minded and aggressive, which will make for a gritty battle in the key. Kansas, like all of USC\u2019s previous opponents, will try to throw every defensive scheme possible at Watkins. For the Trojans, they\u2019ll have to use screens and swing the ball when necessary to create opportunities for perimeter sharpshooters like graduate guard Kayla Padilla.\n\nUSC will be heavily favored entering the Round of 32, as it should be, but the Trojans must not get complacent against a hungry Kansas squad. The 2006 Boston College Eagles are the only No. 8 seed to make the Sweet 16, so the Jayhawks will try to make history of their own.\n\nUSC will face Kansas on Monday at Galen Center, with tipoff scheduled for 7 p.m.\n```"}

The 10-episode series premiered on March 14 and follows four women journalists with vastly different reporting styles on the campaign trail covering a fictional presidential election. The title is an ode to Timothy Crouse\u2019s classic 1973 book on campaign-trail journalists, \u201cThe Boys on the Bus,\u201d but with a fem-centric twist.\n\nThe focus of the show is on Sadie McCarthy (Melissa Benoist), an optimistic reporter for the New York Sentinel\u2014 a likely parallel to the New York Times. McCarthy\u2019s reputation took a hit in the previous campaign cycle when her tears at the loss of the woman candidate went viral, symbolizing her subjective reporting. She returns to the campaign trail to report on the woman front-runner candidate after convincing her editor Bruce Turner (Griffin Dunne) that she\u2019s learned from her mistakes. Turner\u2019s character influenced by New York Times columnist David Carr, who guided executive producer Amy Chozick in finding her voice to write her 2018 book \u201cChasing Hillary: Ten Years, Two Presidential Campaigns and One Intact Glass Ceiling,\u201d which also served as inspiration for the series.\n\n\u201cI love journalism, but I think when I wrote my book, I was able to write more in my own voice,\u201d Chozick said. \u201cMy mentor at the New York Times, my late mentor, David Carr would say you have to go to a magical place where writers live. You have to put that journalism language out of your head and I think I liked that magical place.\u201d\n\nThis was Benoist\u2019s second time acting as a journalist, first playing Kara Danvers on the CW\u2019s \u201cSupergirl\u201d for six years. Benoist said she \u201cbarely skimmed the surface\u201d of what journalism entails while playing Danvers because her character\u2019s superhero escapades always interrupted her reporting.\n\n\u201cI just digest my news differently than I ever have,\u201d Benoist said. \u201cI take so much more consideration into who\u2019s bringing me my news, and I have so much more respect for it. I think I romanticize it now, the way that Sadie does because it is a front-row seat to history, and we should be paying attention to the truth.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy reunites with her best friend Grace from the last campaign cycle, a veteran reporter with a reputation for breaking captivating stories in the rival paper the Washington Union, a stand-in for the Washington Post. The liberal-leaning pair look down on a Republican broadcast reporter Kimberlyn (Christina Elmore) who works for Fox-esque Liberty News. Grace takes a particular dislike for campaign trail newcomer Lola (Natasha Behnam), a Gen-Z influencer who uses TikTok to support an AOC-like socialist candidate (Tala Ahe). In fact, most of the candidates on the campaign trail aren\u2019t named and are instead announced in a manner similar to \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d contestants as archetypes \u2014 The Geriatric, The Freshman, The Hot White Guy, etc. The fictional candidates bear a resemblance to real politicians \u2014 Fake Pete Buttigieg (Scott Foley), Fake Arnold Schwarzenegger (Mark Consuelos), Fake Joe Biden (Richard Bekins) and Fake Hillary Clinton (Hettienne Park).\n\nWhile the journalists don\u2019t see eye to eye on their political views or the candidates they support, as the show progresses they begin to rely on each other for advice and favors. \u201cWhen people talk about how different all the characters are, and that they still find friendship. I think it\u2019s because of the bus they were forced together,\u201d Chozick said.\n\nThe cast has seen a similar bond form between them as Gugino and Elmore recall filming on the \u201csmelly\u201d bus for up to 14 hours at a time wasn\u2019t the glamorous Hollywood experience, but it brought them together nonetheless.\n\nThe lively and inspiring political landscape depicted in \u201cThe Girls on the Bus\u201d contrasts the upcoming contentious, albeit one of the most significant, presidential election years in recent history. While mostly lighthearted, the show throws in serious topics like abortion and sexist inequities in media while referring to the current state of electoral politics. However, it leaves out references to the massive media layoffs and increasing distrust in the media impacting this election cycle.\n\nCritics see the show as an alternate reality that misses the mark on what campaign reporting is really like, but others appreciate that it offers a much-needed distraction from the current political sphere. In terms of accuracy to life on the campaign trail, the cast heavily relied on Chozick\u2019s background as a political journalist.\n\n\u201cEvery single one of these four actors here were kind of obsessed with \u2018wait a minute, is this what I would actually do or not?\u2019 and we and we had the resource to go to, so it was a lot on Amy\u2019s shoulders,\u201d Gugino said.\n\nThe show undoubtedly glamorizes the reporting experience. While interviews play a significant role in news gathering, much of the process involves sending emails, making phone calls and doing research\u2014 all things that if portrayed on screen could be visually monotonous and make audiences change the channel. Focusing on the excitement of breaking a story and working with secret sources makes sense as it translates better on screen. While it may not entirely capture the authentic reporting experience on the campaign trail, it\u2019s important to remember that the show is a dramedy, not a docuseries.\n\nInterested viewers can hop aboard the soapy ride on Max with one new episode weekly through May 9.\n```"}

(Photo by Malcolm Caminero)\n\nBy Charlotte Calm\u00e8s March 24, 2024 at 12:18 pm PDT\n\nFresh off her Grammy victory and the release of her hit single \u201cGoddess,\u201d jazz-classical artist Laufey has seamlessly traversed musical boundaries, enchanting audiences worldwide with her unique fusion of traditional and contemporary sounds. \u201cI really can\u2019t be boxed into one thing,\u201d Laufey said, reflecting on her boundary-pushing artistry.\n\nJust days following her return from a successful tour of the UK and Europe, the musician visited Bovard Auditorium on Thursday night for a panel and performance, jointly hosted by the USG International Student Assembly (ISA) and the USC Speakers Committee. The artist gave insights on navigating and balancing multiple cultural backgrounds and identities, while also offering personal anecdotes and reflections on her own musical evolution and journey.\n\nThe Icelandic-Chinese singer-songwriter and record producer rose to mainstream fame in the United States around 2020, captivating listeners with her distinctive blend of jazz, classical and pop influences. Laufey\u2019s debut album, \u201cEverything I Know About Love,\u201d released in 2022, hit the charts in both Iceland and the United States. Building on this success, the artist\u2019s sophomore album, \u201cBewitched,\u201d released in 2023, became the biggest jazz debut in Spotify history. Celebrated for breathing new life into jazz and classical genres, \u201cBewitched\u201d received this year\u2019s Grammy award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album \u2014 a title previously claimed by musicians including Frank Sinatra, Joni Mitchell and Michael Bubl\u00e9.\n\nEarlier this month, Laufey released her latest single \u201cGoddess,\u201d her self-proclaimed \u201cmost honest song yet,\u201d slated to appear on the musician\u2019s highly-anticipated third studio album.\n\nAt 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, students began camping outside of Bovard Auditorium, over nine hours before the jazz-classical artist was set to arrive. Tucked beneath umbrellas to block out the blazing sun, fans donned Laufey t-shirts and bows in their hair \u2014 the signature \u201cLauver\u201d ensemble \u2014 patiently awaiting the artist\u2019s arrival after hours of anticipation.\n\nStudents form a line stretching past Taper Hall, waiting to enter Bovard Auditorium for the conversation and performance. (Photo by Malcolm Caminero)\n\nAbigail Lambert, a freshman and fan of nearly three years, sat at the front of the line. Lambert had arrived at 11:30 a.m., saying the wait to see the artist was \u201cfor sure\u201d worth it as she maintained her spot in line. \u201cI feel like you don\u2019t get a lot of contemporary jazz artists, especially with the following she has,\u201d Lambert said, \u201cso it\u2019s kind of cool.\u201d\n\nThe freshman was just one of 1,200 students who filled all three tiers of the auditorium for the event, which kicked off with a conversation between the artist and student moderators Luisa Luo and Morgan Ma, two members of ISA.\n\nAttendees packed all three tiers of Bovard Auditorium for the event, with the venue almost reaching its maximum 1,235-person capacity. (Photo by Malcolm Caminero)\n\nThe Q&A began with a conversation surrounding Laufey\u2019s personal experiences living between Iceland and the United States as a half-Chinese and half-Icelandic individual during her formative childhood and young adult years. \u201cGrowing up in Iceland, I sometimes felt a bit like a foreigner, and I felt like the community didn\u2019t entirely accept me,\u201d Laufey said. \u201cEven though I\u2019m born and raised there [...] I kind of felt like I wasn\u2019t that confident in being an Icelander. And now, when I return, I think just because I\u2019ve grown more confident as a person as well, I kind of claim a little more ownership over it now.\u201d\n\nInternational Student Assembly (ISA) members Luisa Luo (center) and Morgan Ma (right) lead an interview with the artist. (Photo by Malcolm Caminero)\n\nA graduate of the Berklee College of Music, the 24-year-old artist also described the exhilarating and challenging aspects of adapting to American college life as an international student. Beyond generating laughter from the audience on several occasions with her relatable college anecdotes, the musician offered her insights and advice on living as an expat. \u201cI think it\u2019s all about finding a community,\u201d the musician said. \u201cI really do find that my closest friends and the people I get along with the best are people who understand that experience of growing up in one place, and being born in another place, or holding passports for a different place, and going to school in another place. And I think finding a community of people who share those experiences has been really, really important.\u201d\n\nAfter years of adjusting to culture shocks and language barriers that left her feeling \u201cvery lost and alone in so many ways,\u201d living in Los Angeles has provided the artist with \u201cmuch more opportunity\u201d and freedom to \u201cbreak out of [her] classical box,\u201d both as a musical artist and as a person. \u201cI definitely had to learn to adapt, and it was really difficult [...] I think that\u2019s one of the reasons I really do like being in a place like Los Angeles because it is such a melting pot,\u201d Laufey explained. \u201cSo I don\u2019t feel that foreign here.\u201d\n\nLaufey shared comical anecdotes throughout the conversation, generating laughter from the crowd. (Photo by Malcolm Caminero)\n\nGrowing up between different locations and cultures, music remained a constant in the artist\u2019s life. With a mother who is a classical violinist and a grandfather who was a violin teacher, the art form and classical genre were \u201calways in [her] nature.\u201d However, while the musician fell in love with the art form at an early age, the artist said she lacked artists to look up to who shared her similar background, experiences and unique blend of jazz, classical and pop styles. \u201cThe things that I\u2019ve done as a singer have come so much from what I felt was missing when I was younger,\u201d Laufey said. \u201cSo I kind of made it a point to become that.\u201d\n\nThe musician said she has used her multicultural background and blend of genres as a bridge to connect with fans of all ages, musical tastes and identities, creating music that serves as a \u201cgateway\u201d to the classical genre for Gen Z\u2019s \u201cversatile\u201d listeners. By experimenting with different styles and disregarding strict genre norms and expectations, Laufey explained that she seeks to create art that will withstand the test of time.\n\nThe artist\u2019s musical performance embodied this musical variety. Accompanied by just a single guitar, amp and microphone, Laufey set the stage with \u201cValentine,\u201d a slow, jazz-inspired track about the complexities of experiencing a first relationship. The song was followed up by a performance of \u201cFrom the Start,\u201d a comparatively pop-influenced, upbeat track about unrequited love, and the artist\u2019s most-streamed track, with 280 million listens on Spotify alone.\n\nLaufey performed acoustic versions of \u201cValentine\u201d and \u201cFrom the Start,\u201d two of her highest-streamed tracks, to conclude the event. (Photo by Malcolm Caminero).\n\nThe audience remained silent for the duration of the two-song set, captivated by the artist\u2019s intimate performance, with the auditorium only erupting into applause at each ending note. As soon as the artist waved goodbye to the crowd, some audience members hurried towards the exit in hopes of meeting the artist, while others lingered in their seats in the hope of another song.\n\nLaufey will return to Los Angeles with the LA Philharmonic on August 7 for the last stop on her upcoming \u201cBewitched: The Goddess Tour\u201d set to begin next month, which will feature shows across North America and Europe.\n```"}

Head coach Lincoln Riley believes there was a noticeable increase in the players\u2019 energy. \u201cWe did a little bit more team and competitive drills today, and so you kind of felt the juice of it coming out,\u201d Riley said.\n\nAfter cross-country scouting in January, the defensive staff finally came together for the first time in early February. It\u2019s a new dynamic for the team with the addition of defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn. \u201c[Lynn] is one of the most experienced linebacker coaches I\u2019ve had around the game of football, so I\u2019m really excited about him,\u201d redshirt senior linebacker Mason Cobb said.\n\nLynn\u2019s extensive coaching experience in the NFL and at UCLA gave Riley the confidence that the new hire is fully capable of taking over this new era of the Trojan defense. With the preseason underway, Lynn understands the importance of gradual improvement. \u201cToday was better than the first practice, so we\u2019re going to keep on getting better and better each day,\u201d Lynn said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s a new scheme, so there\u2019s definitely some stuff we\u2019ve had to correct, but it\u2019s been good stuff, and it\u2019s good to get the kinks out early.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a season of adjustment for the Trojans after losing several starters, like junior quarterback Caleb Williams to the NFL draft and freshman linebacker Tackett Curtis to the transfer portal. New additions include UNLV redshirt freshman quarterback transfer Jayden Maiava and UCLA redshirt freshman defensive back Kamari Ramsey.\n\nHowever, fresh talent isn\u2019t the only important addition to the program. Riley shared on Monday\u2019s episode of \u201c Trojans Live \u201d that USC\u2019s defensive line players have collectively gained 340 pounds since January. While the Trojans are taking their transfer to the Big Ten quite literally, there is a method to the madness. \u201cIt\u2019s a change philosophically within the program first,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a big push, especially on the defensive front, to get better. The results are there \u2014 we are noticeably bigger.\u201d\n\nIn order to allow USC\u2019s offense, which had the third-best scoring average in the country last season, to capitalize on its success, Riley\u2019s been stressing the defense\u2019s responsibility to get physically stronger. He believes this will be a crucial component in improving last year\u2019s defensive line, which allowed more rushing yards on defense than 115 other teams in the country, averaging 186.5 per game.\n\nIn an attempt to stop the bleeding, the program eventually fired then-defensive coordinator Alex Grinch last November in an unsalvageable season. Sophomore defensive end Braylan Shelby has seen personal results after gaining 20 pounds in the offseason. \u201cI feel a lot stronger, I can move the same, create more power, especially coming off that edge,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cI found fun in gaining weight and seeing my number on that scale go up, seeing myself getting stronger in the weight room.\u201d\n\nCobb has also reaped the benefits of the program\u2019s new philosophy, gaining 10 pounds of pure muscle since last season. \u201cI feel really healthy,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cThey made meals mandatory, so that\u2019s one of the things I think pushed it over \u2014 guys had to eat.\u201d Cobb shared how the players\u2019 group weight gains are posted in the weight room for motivation, which has aided in players reaching their individual and team goals.\n\nThe extra muscle will undoubtedly help the Trojans battle some of the nation\u2019s best teams, including Michigan, which went undefeated last season on its way to a national title. There are many unknowns about transferring to a new conference amidst all the player and staff changes within the program, but Riley and his staff remain focused on preparation. \u201cIf you had to sum it up, it really all center[s] around one word for me, which was development,\u201d Riley said on \u201cTrojans Live\u201d on Monday. \u201cDevelopment of the defense as a whole, the development of our schemes, development of our players individually at the different positions.\u201d```"}

Here\u2019s what to expect.\n\nMcLaren's Callum Ilott (No. 6) attacks turn 14 off the three-mile track at The Thermal Club. (Photo by Nick Charles Currie)\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie\nMarch 24, 2024 at 9:11 am PDT\n\nEver wonder if the Clash at the Coliseum was a success? IndyCar certainly thinks so. The open-wheel series is running its own exhibition race in Southern California this weekend. Like with the Clash, heat races will determine which members of the grid participate in the battle for one million dollars (kind of). That\u2019s about where the similarities end.\n\nThe Clash was in a major metropolitan area, designed to put NASCAR in front of an audience it normally wouldn\u2019t reach. IndyCar is at The Thermal Club near Coachella, a housing development built around a race track in much the same way many country clubs are built around golf courses. Although no points will be awarded, there\u2019s still much to look out for in IndyCar\u2019s first exhibition race since a 2008 event in Surfers Paradise.\n\nStrategy? IndyCar is a strategic battlefield \u2014 the decision between a two-stop race and a three-stop race is often a very difficult one to make. Today, teams won\u2019t stop at all \u2014 the only tire changes they are permitted to make are to the tires they used in qualifying, and even then only due to damage. Strategy will still be key, however. Teams expect high tire degradation. With a guaranteed caution halfway through the main race, lap times may plummet in the second half if drivers opt to focus intently on preserving their tire life early. A driver at the back of the field could run ten seconds per lap slower than the leader in the first half without being lapped at the midpoint. Their tires would be significantly fresher than any others in the field. Will anyone take that route? Will everyone take that route? And if someone does, will they be able to go from last to first in those last ten laps?\n\nWind. Wind? Yes, wind. On Saturday, gusts reached well over 20 mph, the same is projected for race time Sunday. Cars generate much of their downforce aerodynamically \u2014 through the movement of air around the car. Strong wind therefore changes how the air moves around the car. An inopportune gust can easily send a driver into a spin. Normally, that\u2019s the only major impact wind has \u2014 on the car itself. Thermal, however, is in a desert. When the wind picks up, so does the sand, which will strip a track of the rubber laid down over the course of the weekend, robbing drivers of a substantial amount of grip. With drivers set to refuel without changing tires for the first time in most of their careers, the wind will provide yet another challenge to anyone looking to maintain control of their racecar.\n\nHow much will drivers risk? In every race since 2009, drivers have competed for points. This week, they compete only for cash. The winner of the One Million Dollar Challenge will earn ... half a million dollars \u2014 another $500,000 go to a member of The Thermal Club, a selection of whom were involved in a random draw to be represented in the race by a driver. Although it\u2019s not as much money as the name may imply, it\u2019s still a significant boon \u2014 only one non-Indy 500 race in the sport\u2019s history has had this large a pot. Add that money to drivers\u2019 hallmark competitiveness and the absence of anything to lose in the championship standings, some drivers have said they\u2019re even more willing than usual to risk a front wing in the pursuit of first place.\n\nPredictions:\nHeat race 1: Scott McLaughlin (No. 3)\nMcLaughlin is always a threat to win. The New Zealander who spent most of his career in Australian Supercars is the only driver in the first two rows of his heat to drive for one of the four biggest teams. His pace and Team Penske\u2019s unending competence should put him in a great spot to take home the first heat.\n\nHeat race 2: Alex Palou (No. 10)\nThis may be a boring pick, but what else can you say when the reigning series champion is one of the fastest drivers all weekend and then converts that speed into pole position? Palou is an outstanding driver with some of the best racecraft in the field. In an unusual weekend, he\u2019s a very strong contender.\n\nMain race: Callum Ilott (No. 6)\nIlott has been rapid all weekend, topping the time sheets in Saturday\u2019s first test session, which began at 9 a.m. Not only has he already shown strong pace in the morning, but Ilott has more to race for than most other drivers. The 25-year-old Brit is filling in for David Malukas after being dropped from Juncos Hollinger late last year. Without a full-time ride in IndyCar, half a million dollars and a win on his resume would be greatly beneficial to his efforts in finding a seat for next season. He was unfortunate in qualifying, dropping down the order after a spin from Marcus Ericsson (No. 28) gave any others a chance to improve, but Ilott should have every ability to transfer to and win the main race.\n```"}

Facing a red-hot Tampa Bay Lightning team on a five-game winning streak, Los Angeles rose to the challenge down the stretch to take a 4-3 overtime win on Saturday.\n\nThe matchup was a battle between the Kings\u2019 stout penalty kill and the Lightning\u2019s electric power play unit. Tampa Bay dominated special teams, going two for three on the power play. It also scored the late equalizer on a six-on-five play with its netminder pulled, displaying its offensive prowess with the extra attacker.\n\nWorking with 11 forwards and seven defensemen once again, it was LA\u2019s blueliners who stepped up when it mattered most. The Kings got too comfortable in the third period and blew a 3-1 lead, but defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov answered the call in the extra frame to send fans home happy.\n\n\u201cWe did a good job on the PK, that wasn\u2019t really the issue,\u201d said interim head coach Jim Hiller. \u201c[The Lightning] executed when they had a chance, and they buried.\u201d\n\nGoaltender Cam Talbot made 22 saves for LA. He benefited from the Bolts\u2019 offensive stagnancy to begin the game, but as the match progressed, Tampa Bay beat him on three different occasions.\n\nWinger Adrian Kempe set the tone for Los Angeles in the first period as he planted himself in goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy\u2019s crease, received a perfect pass from center An\u017ee Kopitar and knocked in the Kings\u2019 first goal of the game.\n\nKempe has been aggressive and dynamic since returning from an upper-body injury he suffered in February. He\u2019s scored in all but two games in March and is now riding a three-game multi-point streak. The 27-year-old has been eager to make an impact, charging loose pucks and using his physicality to his advantage.\n\n\u201c[Kempe] is so fast, when he\u2019s physical, he\u2019s on people,\u201d said Hiller. \u201cHe\u2019s moving his feet. He\u2019s engaged in the game and he\u2019s been scoring goals lately too.\u201d\n\nThe Kings almost headed into the first intermission with the lead until center Brayden Point notched his 41st goal of the season with just six seconds left in the period. Scoring on the power play, the Lightning\u2019s top-heavy extra-man unit caught Los Angeles\u2019 penalty kill off guard.\n\nThe even score didn\u2019t last too long, though. Early in the second period, with Vasilevskiy out of position, winger Trevor Moore tapped in the go-ahead goal for the Kings. Center Pierre-Luc Dubois had the helper, his sixth point in the last five games.\n\nAbout a minute through the third period, LA found itself with a two-on-one chance with blueliner Mikey Anderson and winger Kevin Fiala leading the rush. While the Kings have often struggled with odd-man opportunities this year, Anderson decided to not pass to his forward and took the wrist shot himself, burying the puck in the net to give Los Angeles a two-goal cushion. It was Anderson\u2019s second goal of the season and his first since October 27.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was going to be a fight,\u201d said Anderson. \u201cBoth teams defended pretty good.\u201d\n\nTampa Bay wasn\u2019t going to go down without a fight. Bolts winger Steven Stamkos stole the show late in the third period, notching goals 28 and 29 on the season to send the game to overtime. The first one\u2014late on the power play with four and a half minutes left in the period\u2014was a snipe from the slot. The second came on a wrister with Vasilevskiy on the bench and just 46 seconds left in regulation.\n\nHeading into extra time, the Lightning held all of the momentum, but the Kings knew they had to respond to avoid blowing the game. Los Angeles only needed 25 seconds of overtime to put the nail in the coffin; on a defensive meltdown for the Bolts, Gavrikov found a wide-open lane, flew down the ice and wristed a shot for the victory.\n\nThis was a huge win for the Kings, as they still narrowly lead Vegas for third place in the Pacific Division after the Golden Knights defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets 4-2 Saturday. Just three points behind the Edmonton Oilers for second, LA\u2019s upcoming meetings with the Vancouver Canucks, Oilers, Calgary Flames and Winnipeg Jets will all be critical. The road trip could make or break the Kings\u2019 Pacific standing and momentum heading into the final stretch of regular season bouts.\n\n\u201cA lot of teams are battling for big points down the stretch,\u201d said winger Quinton Byfield. \u201cIt was a good matchup for us, and I think we came to the test, but it\u2019s a really big road trip for us.\u201d\n\nWith eight wins in their last 12 games, the Kings might have just found a spark with only a dozen games remaining before the Stanley Cup Playoffs. In a season full of ups and downs, injuries and a coaching switch, Los Angeles has overcome plenty of adversity, and hopes for a deep playoff run.\n\nThe Kings will face the Western Conference\u2019s best, the Vancouver Canucks, on Monday at 6 p.m. at Rogers Arena.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Gregory Bull, AP)\n\nBy Mia Nu\u00f1ez March 23, 2024 at 9:00 pm PDT\n\n\u201cGameChangeHERS\u201d is a column by Mia Nu\u00f1ez highlighting women\u2019s accomplishments in sports. Many NWSL team owners have been selling their teams and making huge profits. Most recently, San Diego Wave owner Ron Burke just sold the team for a record-breaking $113 million after originally paying a $2 million expansion fee in 2021. The $113 million sale is a two-part deal with Levine Leichtman Capital Partners. They\u2019re paying $35 million now for 35% of the team, then they\u2019ll buy the other 65% for $78 million after the 2024 season.\n\nBurke isn\u2019t the only one cashing out on his investments. The Portland Thorns also recently sold for $63 million earlier this year, which was the highest until the Wave. These sales are in no way an indication that the league is doing poorly. It only proves how the NWSL is on the rise and is here to stay. Owners are selling because their investments are paying off and people are quick to buy because they can see the future of the league is bright.\n\nSince 2020, out of the NWSL\u2019s 14 teams, 13 of them are either expansion teams or have new owners. Two new teams are being added to the league this season, Bay FC and Utah Royals. The league has announced that it\u2019s going to add another team in Boston by 2026. Boston Unity Soccer Partners paid a $53 million expansion fee, which is a massive increase from the most recent expansion fee of $5 million. The growth of the NWSL is shown through the jump from a $2 million to a $53 million expansion fee in under three years.\n\nWith the increase in attendance, viewership and valuation, the NWSL wants to continue growing the game. It has been overlooked for years, so it\u2019s exciting that the league is finally getting the flowers it deserves.\n\nKansas City Current owners Chris and Angie Long, and investors such as Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany, saw the future of the NWSL in 2021 when it was announced that the KC Current was getting its own stadium. The $120 million stadium is the first built specifically for a women\u2019s pro sports team. The Current played their first game of the season in their new stadium on March 16 in an electrifying 5-4 win against the Portland Thorns.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the stadium has received some criticism from fans because the stadium is relatively small, with a capacity of 11,000. However, the stadium is designed to increase capacity over the years. Additionally, all 9,500 of their season tickets are sold out. The first game the Current ever played was in a high school football stadium, so it is exciting to see how far the team, and by extension, the league, has come.\n\nThis is a thrilling time for not just the Current of the NWSL, but for women\u2019s sports. The new stadium will push owners who own women\u2019s teams to build their own stadiums \u2013 not only in the NWSL, but in other leagues like the WNBA. I have no doubt that women\u2019s sports are going to continue to thrive and they\u2019ll all have their own stadiums soon. Women\u2019s sports are the future, get hyped!\n\n\u201cGameChangeHERS\u201d runs every other Thursday.\n```"}

(Photo by Shantala Muruganujan)\n\nBy Will Camardella March 23, 2024 at 7:05 pm PDT\n\nIt was a different kind of Saturday at Galen Center; the building was hosting NCAA Tournament games for the first time in its 18-year history. For the USC women\u2019s basketball team, this game was simply business as usual. The top-seeded Trojans easily handled 16th-seeded Texas A&M-Corpus Christi on their home floor by a score of 87-55 in the opening round of the tournament. In doing so, they kept their dream season, as well as the hopes of the program\u2019s first national championship since 1984, alive.\n\nUSC\u2019s game was not the first one Galen Center was scheduled to host on Saturday. In fact, the expected 1:30 tipoff time was pushed back when a back-and-forth game between eighth-seeded Kansas and ninth-seeded Michigan needed overtime to declare a winner. Once the Jayhawks had finally secured the victory, thousands of fans donning cardinal and gold began to file into the lower bowl of the arena all at once. Shortly after, the Trojans took the court for warmups, and those just-arriving fans erupted into cheers for the Pac-12 champions.\n\nThirty minutes before the game even began, USC had established the home-court advantage it had worked so hard to earn. \u201cOnce that ball goes up, I\u2019m enamored by the crowd,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cWe never take it for granted how this community has come out for us, for this team. The change that\u2019s happened so rapidly, it\u2019s so amazing. The feeling of the building puts me at ease, \u2018cause then it\u2019s just our team playing a game. You get into the moment.\u201d\n\nOnce the ball was tipped \u2014 approximately 15 minutes after it was supposed to \u2014 the Trojans rode that momentum to a red-hot first quarter. In the opening frame, the Islanders scored exactly twice: on their very first and very last possession. Between those two baskets, Corpus Christi missed 19 consecutive shot attempts, as the Trojans rallied from a 2-0 deficit to rip off a 21-0 run.\n\nEarly on, USC established its dominance most clearly in the paint. Offensively, the Islanders were trying to score down low, but the Trojans were too long and too locked in on the defensive side for that strategy to bear any fruit. Of Corpus Christi\u2019s 22 first-quarter shot attempts, 10 were blocked. Freshman guard JuJu Watkins and graduate forward Kaitlyn Davis each sent back three Islander shots, while junior centers Rayah Marshall and Clarise Akunwafo each rejected a pair.\n\nUSC used its height to its advantage both inside and out of the paint on the defensive side. Outside, the Trojans hustled, jumped and anticipated to deflect several passes and force turnovers, often doing so before the Islanders could even cross the halfcourt line. USC finished with 14 steals and 20 points off of turnovers.\n\n\u201cYeah, obviously JuJu is a great shot-blocker,\u201d graduate guard McKenzie Forbes said. \u201cI try to be as active as I can defensively \u2018cause when we\u2019re running out in transition, I think that\u2019s when we\u2019re playing our best.\u201d\n\nOffensively, the Trojans had a very balanced scoring output. Watkins and Forbes tied for the team lead with 23 points each, but 10 different players got on the scoresheet, with four in double figures. USC found its scoring production early in the low block, but the team\u2019s range expanded as the game progressed. After a slow start from beyond the arc, the Trojans drained five of 10 3-point shots in the third quarter.\n\nWhen the offense and defense were clicking at the same time, Corpus Christi had no answers for USC. During one sequence in the third quarter, graduate guard Kayla Padilla nailed a 3-pointer to beat the shot-clock buzzer, Forbes leaped in the air to knock down a full-court pass and force a steal, and then drained a triple of her own to balloon the Trojan lead to 26 points.\n\nSaturday was not Watkins\u2019 top scoring performance; she scored below her season average and shot 1-of-6 from beyond the arc. Still, her 23 points were enough to surpass Cheryl Miller\u2019s record for the most points scored in a single season in USC history.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t even aware that happened,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cI\u2019m just grateful, honestly. Coach has so much trust in me. I\u2019m just grateful to be in that mention and to be part of the Trojan legacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be crazy if you didn\u2019t call her [a generational talent],\u201d Gottlieb added. \u201cI haven\u2019t been afraid to talk about how good we think JuJu is, especially with what\u2019s going on in real-time here. When you guys said she broke the single-season scoring record, that\u2019s crazy for any freshman. I just think we\u2019re watching something really spectacular happen with JuJu ... she makes others around her better.\u201d\n\nWatkins\u2019 day came to an end with about three and a half minutes remaining in the contest, with the lead clearly insurmountable. As Gottlieb began to substitute, fans behind the Trojan bench began to clamor for graduate guard India Otto, who had not appeared in a game since December. Shortly after chants began to break out, Gottlieb signaled Otto to get ready to check in, prompting the fourth-loudest cheers of the afternoon from the Galen Center crowd.\n\nThe third-loudest cheers came at the next stoppage of play, when Otto was able to enter the game for the first time. About 50 seconds of game time later, she banked in a layup for her second made shot of the season, leading to the second-loudest cheers of the day from the fans, while her teammates on the bench jumped up and down in excitement. Just to put icing on the cake, she hit a 3-pointer one possession later for the final basket of the game \u2014 of course, answered by a massive roar from the home fans.\n\nAt that point, all Gottlieb could do on the sidelines was smile.\n\n\u201cThose are the best points I\u2019ve seen all season,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cI was more excited for her than the win.\u201d After clarifying that she was joking, Watkins added on a more serious note, \u201cShe deserves it. We see her score every day in practice, so to see her come out and just, she lit up the crowd tonight.\u201d\n\nWith the win, the Trojans will advance to the Round of 32 for the first time since 2006. They will square off with the No. 8 seed Kansas Jayhawks at Galen Center at 7 p.m. on Monday.\n```"}

Going into the matchup, the teams were fairly even with similar records. In Michigan\u2019s last game, the Wolverines lost to Caitlin Clark and Iowa in the Big Ten Tournament semifinals. Michigan made its 12th all-time appearance in the NCAA tournament, and this is the first time in the program\u2019s history that it had six consecutive bids to the tournament. This is Kansas\u2019 first appearance in the tournament since 2022, and 15th all-time. Before 2022, the Jayhawks had not been in it since 2013.\n\nMichigan came out with more firepower than the Jayhawks, but the score consistently remained within 10 points. Both teams had a slow start, with many possession changes, but not much scoring. Michigan led only 11-10 after the first quarter. In the second quarter, both teams started to light up on offense, making almost double the amount of shots they made in the first quarter, with Michigan making 7-of-13 shots and Kansas draining 7-of-15. At halftime, the Wolverines led 32-29.\n\nMichigan led by nine after the third quarter, and in the fourth quarter, the Wolverines had a 10-point lead. \u201cI give Michigan a lot of credit,\u201d Kansas head coach Brandon Schneider said. \u201cI thought they were by far the best team for three quarters. [Senior forward Cameron] Williams, in particular, did some things to us that typically players don\u2019t have success with, and that\u2019s being very aggressive and attacking [Kansas junior center Taiyanna] Jackson.\u201d\n\nThe Jayhawks responded and came back quickly, making lots of shots and accumulating 23 points to Michigan\u2019s 14 for the quarter. Junior guard Zakiyah Franklin scored a 3-pointer to tie the game with 12 seconds remaining. The Jayhawks then got a stop on the other end to force overtime, tied at 67. \u201cI\u2019m thinking, OK, I shot the ball from there, it hit the rim a couple times, so I\u2019m like \u2018It has to go in,\u2019\u201d Franklin said about what was going through her mind. \u201cWe lived with the results, and we survived and we advance.\u201d\n\nFranklin led the team in points, with 22, and minutes on the court, with 44. \u201cThe kid\u2019s a winner, and that\u2019s why we recruited her,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cOur program came from the very bottom of the Power Five, and we needed a kid like that, that was used to winning.\u201d\n\nSchneider shared what he told his team going into overtime. \u201cJust keep getting stops, number one,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what really got us back in the game. Then, we were in the bonus, so [I] challenged everyone to just don\u2019t leave the offensive end without a paint touch and an opportunity to get to the free-throw line.\u201d\n\nThe Jayhawks dominated in overtime, scoring the first five points on their first two possessions. Michigan\u2019s head coach Kim Barnes Arico commented on how the Jayhawks\u2019 free throw shooting allowed them to come back. \u201cThe number of times they went to the free-throw line in the fourth quarter was probably more than we went for the game,\u201d Barnes Arico said.\n\nKansas won by nine points. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be prouder of our team\u2019s resilience,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cThey never fragmented. They just stayed the course and obviously made some really, really big plays offensively that were preceded by key stop after key stop.\u201d\n\nKansas will move on to play USC in the second round of the NCAA Tournament on Monday at 7 p.m. at Galen Center.\n```"}

The ongoing season of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d (season 28), starring previous Bachelorette contestant  Joey Graziadei , has been particularly popular and riveting, garnering viewers who have never seen the show before. Perhaps, this can be attributed to the show\u2019s popularity on  TikTok  or Joey being a fan-favorite during his time on \u201cThe Bachelorette.\u201d Either way, as this season that has everyone on their toes comes to a culmination on Monday, here is everything you need to know about the remaining women ahead of the finale.\n\nDaisy Kent Daisy is from Becker, Minnesota and one of the two finalists this season. She  entered  the Bachelor Mansion with a christmas tree to commemorate her upbringing on a christmas tree farm. Throughout the show, she has been open about her battle with Lyme Disease and hearing loss. She often speaks about her experiences with her cochlear implant and has written a children\u2019s book about hearing loss. Her time on the Bachelor has been relatively unproblematic, not having any altercations with the women. She received the first one-on-one date (a date with just her and Joey) of the season and has been a  fan favorite  ever since. Now, many fans are thinking that she will go on to win the finale.\n\nKelsey Anderson Kelsey Anderson is a junior project manager living in New Orleans, Louisiana and is the other finalist of this season. She received her first one-on-one date in Spain and has consistently been a favorite for both Joey and fans. She has not been involved in drama either and has received increasing screen time through her time on the show. Fans seem to be torn between her and Daisy for who they think will be the winner of this season.\n\nMaria Georgas America fell in love with Maria Georgas the moment she stepped foot into the Bachelor Mansion. Maria\u2019s iconic outfits and witty comebacks instantly made her a fan favorite. She is an executive assistant from Ontario, Canada and was sent home during \u201cHometowns\u201d\u2014the episode where the Bachelor meets the contestants\u2019 family. But Maria still made her mark, and now Bachelor Nation is  hoping  that she will be the next Bachelorette. While she experienced  animosity  from some women on the show, she eventually came out of top after being asked to stay after a two-on-one date (a few episodes before she was sent home) with Joey and her arch nemesis during the show, Sydney Gordon. During the \u201c Women Tell All \u201d episode last week (an episode before the finale where the women discuss their time on the show in front of a live audience), Maria and Sydney seemingly made up with the episode ending with hugs being exchanged.\n\nWhat to expect The season finale of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d will premiere on  Monday, March 25th at 8pm PST  on ABC. For those without cable, the show can also be viewed on Hulu the next day. The episode will be approximately three hours long until 11:00 p.m. There will also be an \u201cAfter the Final Rose\u201d segment during which the next Bachelorette could be revealed.\n```"}

If a space like this is what you\u2019re looking for, LATINAFest is the perfect place for you. This Sunday, the festivities will begin at 11 a.m. with a panel by The Trend Talk hosts, followed by sessions on financial literacy, dance lessons, and a plethora of small business owners. Stickers, household items like mugs, makeup and so much more will be available to buy throughout the event. However, the things available for purchase won\u2019t be limited to physical things, last year limpias and palm readings were also available. All this and more is included in LATINAFest\u2019s $10 general admission ticket, and being Latina is not a requirement to attend.\n\nFounded by Bel Hernandez and Naibe Reynoso in 2018, the event aims to capture and celebrate all of the complexities of being Latina. It\u2019s not about picking one part of our identity over the other, but rather celebrating our intricacies while investing in our community. That\u2019s why this year\u2019s theme is inspiration through movement, with a special emphasis placed on celebrating creatives and entrepreneurs. We\u2019re so often discouraged from pursuing these careers by our communities that we fail to aspire to our fullest potential. They\u2019re seen as careers that aren\u2019t a guarantee and therefore our creativity is cast aside not due to a lack of talent, but a lack of systems to support us.\n\nPast fashion show exhibition of vendor's work at LATINAFest\n\nLATINAFest aims to change this, not only by showcasing small business owners but by literally putting them on full display. Most of the clothing sold at the festival will be modeled during a fashion show towards the end of the event where business owners will have an opportunity to talk about what drives them to create and what being a Latina entrepreneur means to them. Additionally, LATINAFest and Z.A. Lawyers have partnered together to select 10 Latina entrepreneurs to attend a luncheon to learn, network, and expand their businesses. This intimate connection between Latinas and business owners is incredibly important because despite being in a city with one of the highest Latine populations, it\u2019s easy to feel alone. It\u2019s combated in all parts of LATINAFest, whether it\u2019s making friends in line at the food trucks, talking with others at the sip and paint if you\u2019re of age, or even at the kid\u2019s zone if you have younger siblings or children.\n\nDolores Huerta, Bel Hernandez Castillo and Naibe Reynoso at last years LATINAFest\n\nI had the privilege of attending the festival last year and it was one of the most empowering moments of my life. I was in the midst of applying to colleges and the idea of being far from my family, likely surrounded by others with very different lived experiences was intimidating as a first-generation student. I doubted myself and my abilities heavily.  At LATINAFest, I had the opportunity to connect with women who\u2019d gone through exactly what I was going through, with women who started their businesses from the ground up and were able to make their dreams a reality. Although I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to connect with everyone, I felt as though I was surrounded by a community that wouldn\u2019t waste a single second in supporting me and guiding me.\n\nThe event will take place this Sunday, March 24th from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. and  tickets  will be available until the day of. Parking is available near  LA Plaza de Culturas y Artes  and it\u2019s easily accessible by Metro. For your accessibility  here  is a map of the event.\n```"}

It is among the five new sports that will take on the most prestigious stage in the athletic world four years from now. The sport has come a long way since World War II, when it first started out as a means of recreation for American soldiers. Now, players have a chance to represent their countries and compete for an Olympic gold.\n\nAnnenberg Media spoke with USC redshirt sophomore quarterback Miller Moss and redshirt sophomore wide receiver Kyron Hudson about their thoughts on the matter. Many football players started out playing flag football during elementary and middle school recess and in their family backyard.\n\n\u201cMy first football memories ever come from flag football. [It is a] special foundation to teach young kids the game of football in a way that doesn\u2019t involve as much risk,\u201d Moss said as he recalled his past experience with flag football. \u201cIt provided an opportunity for me to just learn how to really compete. So, I have a ton of love for flag football.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what his initial reaction to the news was, Hudson also mentioned that he grew up playing flag football. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a good opportunity for everyone to go out, support and just have fun, watch something that is new in this Olympics,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NFL has welcomed the idea of bringing flag football into the Games. Flag football has experienced a recent rise in popularity, both domestically and internationally, thanks to the league\u2019s serious promotional efforts. This February marked the second consecutive time that the NFL included flag football in its Pro Bowl event. Prior to that, the league had hosted the International NFL Flag Championships as well, a contest featuring participants from 12 countries.\n\nOn the significance of this decision, both Hudson and Moss shed light on how it will positively impact the global influence of American football and potentially bring more inclusivity to the sport. Hudson pointed out that the decision will benefit \u201cpeople having the interest but not having the opportunity to showcase their talent in other countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully, this will have a great impact on spreading our game across the world. I know the NFL has started to put more of an emphasis on having international games, so I know that we\u2019re trying to make the game more global. And, hopefully, this can aid in doing that,\u201d Moss added.\n\nFor years, numbers have shown positive signs for a potentially large audience for flag football. The new flag football format at the 2023 NFL Pro Bowl drew 6.28 million viewers. Even though the L.A. Games are still four years from now, Moss and Hudson both expressed optimism about the viewership of flag football\u2019s Olympic debut.\n\n\u201cJust because it is so new, people will be curious about what it is,\u201d Moss said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that obviously is so popular within the United States, and we\u2019re getting to share it with the rest of the world. So, I think people will be really excited to see what format it takes on the Olympic stage. Hopefully, [it will] get a ton of viewership, so they continue to do it.\u201d\n\nSo far, some high-profile NFL players have demonstrated strong interest in returning to flag football in LA28 and going for an Olympic gold. Patrick Mahomes, the star quarterback who just led the Kansas City Chiefs to a second consecutive Super Bowl title this year, has stated that he is \u201cdefinitely\u201d interested in representing the United States in 2028. Other potential players include Miami Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill.\n\nMoss commented on if the decision will affect his career. \u201cIf they asked me to play, I would definitely think about it. But as of now, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll have a huge impact,\u201d Moss said. He also went on to explain why including flag football in LA28 is important for the city: \u201cL.A. obviously loves competitions and teams that do well. So, hopefully, America can do pretty well and we\u2019ll support that because L.A. loves a winner.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/22/from-776-bc-to-2024-the-olympic-games/", "response": "```\nThe Olympic Games are a celebration revolving around athletic talent, recognized all around the world. The games date back to 776 BC in Olympia, Greece. They began as a tribute to the gods, specifically Zeus \u2014 King of the Gods and the Greek god of thunder and lightning. The games grew in popularity, attracting athletes from all over Greece. Leaders from differing city-states agreed to an \u201cOlympic truce,\u201d allowing spectators and athletes to attend the games without the threat of war during travel. From farmers to royals, anyone and everyone \u2014 besides women \u2014 could compete in the Olympics. As the years passed, the Greeks began to also honor Hera, Zeus\u2019s wife, and women were finally allowed to compete. Events included anything from foot races to javelin throwing to chariot races. Athletes competed naked and slathered in oil. Professional musicians played a large role in the games, adding to the fanfare of the competition. Ancient Olympic winners were awarded wreaths made from olive leaves, following the myth of Herakles when he ran during the first races at Olympia. This year\u2019s Olympians will be awarded medals featuring the Greek goddess of victory, Nike, as well as the Eiffel Tower and the Acropolis of Athens, symbolizing the origin of the games.\n\nThe games evolved into what we know today with the first modern Olympic Games taking place during 1896 in Athens, Greece. While events and regulations have adapted to cater to modern society\u2019s expectations, athletes continue to be held to a specific standard. The 2024 Paris Olympics will see 905 women and 905 men competing. Athletes are able to qualify with \u201c50% of qualification places based on achieving the entry standard for an event within the qualification period, and the other 50% based on the World Athletics Ranking within the ranking period,\u201d according to the Olympics. Athletes aim to compete in the games and win the honor of becoming an Olympic champion. To be an Olympian is to be one of the \u2013 if not the greatest \u2013 athletes in that category and generation.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a gold medal Olympian, that\u2019s one of the greatest, craziest sports cultures on the planet,\u201d USC sophomore football player Roman Marchetti said. \u201cI\u2019d say they\u2019re definitely a standard for most of their sports.\u201d\n\nThis summer\u2019s Olympic games are expected to host about 10 million spectators for more than 750 events. During the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games, 3.05 billion people worldwide viewed event coverage from streaming platforms. In the U.S. alone, 15.6 million people watched. People thrive off competition, whether they themselves are the ones competing, or whether they are spectators. It\u2019s human nature to want to be the best. However, it\u2019s possible the Olympic Games are more than just a sporting event. People are drawn to sports because of the allure of competition. Whether the person is an athlete competing or a fan spectating, people thrive off rivalry. It\u2019s human nature to want to be the best, to come out on top.\n\n\u201cIf people can\u2019t express that [competitive drive] through athletic competition themselves, they look for other outlets to do so,\u201d USC sports editor Thomas Johnson said. \u201cWatching other people compete in athletics is the primary outlet people of all demographics go to [because] it\u2019s a way for people to project what they can\u2019t do themselves.\u201d\n\nToday, sports play an extensive role in the daily lives of most Americans. Fans insert themselves into the games through various forms, ranging from attending games to hosting watch parties to playing in fantasy leagues. A large majority of popular sports \u2014 football, basketball, hockey, etc. \u2014 are all team-based, while Olympians are primarily judged based on individual performance.\n\n\u201c[As an Olympian], you\u2019re representing your country. If you\u2019re winning the Superbowl, you\u2019re representing the team and the fan base,\u201d Marchetti said. Despite the differences, both athletic cultures are held to specific standards and placed under pressure to perform. The athletic ideal is one that has fluctuated throughout the years yet remained the same at its core. Athletes are placed on pedestals as people look up to them and even idolize them. They are expected to perform above and beyond, and if they fail to do so, they have the ability to disappoint thousands, even millions, of fans. Athletes have to be the best because they are an inspiration to others. Some fans see the possibility of infinite potential. Others use athletes to create connections with fellow fans.\n\nUSC journalism professor Alan Abrahamson has covered every Olympics, both in the winter and summer, since the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. He has met some of the greats, including Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt and Katie Ledecky, and those less noticed by the media, including two boys from Liberia at the 2010 Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.\n\n\u201cThe Olympic Games are about dreams and hope,\u201d he said. \u201cHope that we can all live together in a peaceful world and that we can all be the best version of ourselves.\u201d\n\nTo date, the Olympics continue to hold a remarkable presence in society. They are a testament to athleticism and greatness, but they are also a recognition of peace and unity between people from all different parts of the world.\n\n\u201cAs human beings, we need water, maybe food ... but we need hope. Without water to sustain us, and hope, there\u2019s no reason to go on,\u201d Abrahamson said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I love the games \u2014 the aspirational ideal of them in our fragile and broken world.\u201d```"}

(AP/Michael Wyke)\n\nBy Joseph Domingot\nMarch 22, 2024 at 3:11 pm PDT\n\n\u201cFight on, Dribble on\u201d is a weekly column by Joseph Domingot about how Trojans are performing in the NBA. In the last two weeks of NBA hoops, a handful of Trojans have put on stellar performances with less than four weeks remaining in the regular season: DeMar DeRozan dropped a season-high 46 points against the Indiana Pacers on March 13. DeRozan has also accumulated the most total minutes of any NBA player this season. Chimezie Metu signed a deal with the Detroit Pistons after being waived by the Phoenix Suns. Metu scored eight points and collected three rebounds on Wednesday against the Pacers in his debut. Onyeka Okongwu returned to action this week after missing time with a toe injury since February 12 \u2014 scoring double digits in consecutive games against the Los Angeles Lakers and the Phoenix Suns. However, this week we\u2019ll focus on two other former Trojans currently experiencing some of the best spells of their professional careers.\n\nJordan McLaughlin\nIn 2023-2024, Jordan McLaughlin is shooting 45.3% from 3-point range, well above the league average figure of around 36% for point guards. It is also the most efficient 3-point shooting season in his five-year NBA career. The Pasadena native has mainly sat behind Mike Conley and Anthony Edwards in the Timberwolves\u2019 depth chart this season, but he still plays an important rotational role for the Western Conference contender. He is averaging 18 minutes a game in a five-game stretch dating back to March 10. On March 16 against the Jazz, McLaughlin logged 16 minutes and a plus-minus of nine \u2014 a stat measuring how well a team performs with a specific player on the court. The five-year guard shot 50% from three on two attempts and dished out four assists in a 19-point win. Two nights later \u2014 again in Utah \u2014 McLaughlin was hyper-efficient with his shooting. The former first-team All-Pac-12 member went 100% from the field, from beyond the arc and from the charity stripe. He scored 11 points in 21 minutes of play to help the Timberwolves sweep the Jazz in the season series. The former Trojan scored all of his 11 points in either the second or fourth quarter, showing how well he closed out the two halves. It would be a different story for McLaughlin in a back-to-back against the Denver Nuggets. Despite Minnesota missing multiple frontcourt players due to injury, the 27-year-old only recorded two points and three rebounds in 18 minutes of basketball against the defending champions. Yet it would not be enough as Denver beat out Minnesota despite a close effort in the second half. The Timberwolves will meet the Nuggets two more times this season as McLaughlin and Minnesota hope to jump their division rival in the Western Conference standings.\n\nNikola Vucevic\nNikola Vucevic has been loading up the stat sheets this season. In 64 games \u2014 and 62 starts \u2014 the Chicago Bull has scored double-digit points 59 times, including in all of his last 15 games. In this span, Vucevic has averaged a double-double of 20.6 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. The two-time All-Star began the 20th week of the season on fire against the measly Washington Wizards. The Bulls held a 13-point advantage heading into the second quarter, mostly thanks to the team\u2019s starting center. Vucevic scored 16 points and gathered five early rebounds, going 3-for-3 from downtown and 6-for-6 overall from the field. The Wizards were not able to keep up, as the Bulls blew out Washington by 29 points. Against the Portland Trail Blazers two nights later, Vucevic started the game in fine form. In the first quarter of play, the 33-year-old went 4-for-5 from the field and 100% from behind the arc for nine points. Despite Portland\u2019s late comeback effort, Vucevic helped the Bulls stay on course, notching 22 points and nine rebounds in a 110-107 victory. In his and the Bulls\u2019 final game of the past week, Chicago traveled down to Houston to take on the Rockets, who were coming off a six-game winning streak, despite their otherwise indifferent form this season. Vucevic started this game more slowly than his previous two games, going 1-for-5 from the field. Vucevic would eventually amass 16 points and 14 rebounds, but Houston\u2019s streak extended to seven straight wins after another former Trojan in DeRozan was ejected in the third quarter. The big man from Montenegro currently has 40 double-doubles in 2023-2024 with 12 regular season games remaining. He will hope to surpass last season\u2019s total of 51 if he keeps his form until game 82 as the Bulls push for a playoff berth.\n\n\u201cFight on, Dribble on\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Dylan Luden March 22, 2024 at 1:42 pm PDT\n\nIt seems USC baseball may finally be hitting its stride \u2014 perfect timing for an upcoming weekend series against UCLA. After winning four out of their last six games and winning their first Pac-12 series of the season against Stanford on the road, the Trojans will head to Jackie Robinson Stadium, and it couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for USC.\n\nThe Trojans have had UCLA\u2019s number, as USC has won the season series against the Bruins in back-to-back years and has not lost a series to UCLA since 2019. Both teams have had similar outcomes thus far with USC sporting a 7-13 record compared to UCLA\u2019s 7-11, but these two teams\u2019 seasons have been completely opposite.\n\nTravel has been the biggest story for USC in the early part of the season. With the reconstruction of Dedeaux Field taking place, the Trojans traveled to Arizona, Irvine and Texas to begin its season, going 2-9 early on. Since then, the Trojans have gone 5-4 and look like they\u2019re finally settling into a new routine away from their typical home field.\n\nSophomore catcher Jacob Galloway has been USC\u2019s most consistent player this season by far, catching fire right out of the gate and not looking back. Galloway is hitting .355/.446/.539 with three home runs and 18 RBIs on the year, leading the Trojans in numerous categories: batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS and hits. Plus, he\u2019s riding a 19-game hitting streak; his only game of the season without a hit was Opening Day against BYU.\n\nNumerous Trojans are starting to heat up and help out Galloway, including sophomore outfielder Austin Overn. The sophomore put together a monster season last year, breaking USC\u2019s single-season triples record with 14. He was expected to be the Trojans\u2019 table-setter again after being listed as the No. 64 prospect for the 2024 MLB Draft by MLB Pipeline. Instead, he uncharacteristically struggled during USC\u2019s first nine games, going just 6-for-38. But when the Trojans took down Cal State Fullerton on March 5, something clicked for Overn. He is currently on a nine-game hitting streak since then, going 15-for-37 with three home runs. Overn has displayed his top-end speed and glove in the outfield all season, but he\u2019s now piecing it together at the plate. He\u2019s already matched his home run total from last year with four.\n\nOvern was also a Bruin killer last season, totaling nine hits in five games against them, including a triple and home run in the Trojans\u2019 win against UCLA in the Pac-12 Tournament.\n\nFreshmen utility Kevin Takeuchi and outfielder Brayden Dowd have also stood out for USC. Takeuchi has played in 16 of USC\u2019s 20 games, boasting a .855 OPS plus two home runs. Meanwhile, Dowd was just plugged into the lineup more recently. After starting the second game of the Stanford series on March 16 and logging a hit, Dowd went 3-for-3 with a triple in the rubber match against the Cardinal and 2-for-4 in the Trojans\u2019 win over Long Beach State on Tuesday.\n\nThe pitching is starting to come along as well. Junior Caden Aoki had his best start of the season last outing after he went six innings and allowed one run. The bullpen has also stepped up as of late, with the Trojans boasting six arms that have ERAs under 3.50.\n\nMeanwhile, in Westwood, UCLA had big expectations coming into the year. It was ranked No. 22 by D1Baseball.com to start the season and had the top incoming freshman class, according to Perfect Game. The Bruins had an excellent start to its season, sweeping Gonzaga in their opening series. Since then, they\u2019ve gone 4-11, losing all of their games to TCU and Cal. UCLA secured its first Pac-12 series win last weekend by taking down Washington State.\n\nFrom that standout freshman class, infielder Roman Martin has impressed the most. He\u2019s batting .391 on the year and is coming off his best game against Washington State, tallying three hits and five RBIs.\n\nThe middle-infield duo of junior shortstop Cody Schrier and junior second baseman Duce Gourson was expected to be one of the best double-play pairings in the nation, as both were ranked as top-100 draft prospects heading into the season. Schrier came out scorching hot, going 16-for-40 in the Bruins\u2019 first 10 games. Since then, he\u2019s been ice cold, registering three hits in his last eight games. Gourson has been steady all season, tying the team-high with four home runs and carrying a .926 OPS heading into the weekend series against USC.\n\nThe Bruins\u2019 pitching has been better so far this season than USC\u2019s, with staff compiling a team ERA of 4.96 compared to the Trojans\u2019 5.40. Freshman Luke Rodriguez and sophomores Cody Delvecchio and Finn McIlroy have impressed on the mound, all boasting ERAs under 2.50.\n\nWith both teams coming off victories in their last Pac-12 series, USC-UCLA will be one to watch, as they play their final series in the conference before moving to the Big Ten next season. Friday\u2019s game is scheduled for 7 p.m., with Saturday and Sunday both starting at 2 p.m.\n```"}

Tickets for the lower bowl of Galen Center are already sold out, with very few seats still available in the nosebleed sections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a blessing to play in front of our home crowd, so we\u2019re just gonna take their energy and run with it as we have been doing all season,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a blessing to have that crowd behind us, and we know it\u2019s gonna be big this Saturday, so we\u2019re gonna try to keep it going.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans open the tournament against No. 16 seed Texas A&M-Corpus Christi (23-8) on Saturday. Texas A&M-CC has a record of 23-8 and beat Lamar in the Southland Conference Tournament final to secure the conference\u2019s automatic bid after finishing second in the regular-season standings. Despite the Islanders\u2019 low seed, Gottlieb knows that USC needs to come ready to play.\n\n\u201c[They] know how to win, and everybody\u2019s good that comes here. They\u2019re very veteran. I know [head] coach [Royce] Chadwick has been at Marshall and has done good things there \u2014 a lot of different things to make your life difficult on the defensive end.\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI had to learn about Corpus Christi\u2019s players. I haven\u2019t seen them on TV a ton, but the film has taught me a lot. They\u2019re a very, very solid basketball team.\u201d\n\nWith a win over the Islanders, the Trojans will take on the winner of No. 8 Kansas (19-12) and No. 9 Michigan (20-13) on Monday. The Jayhawks and Wolverines tip off against each other on Saturday at 11 a.m.\n\nHaving been a part of USC\u2019s team last year when the Trojans lost to South Dakota State in the first round of the tournament, senior guard Kayla Williams is leaning on that experience to help lead her teammates as they go dancing.\n\n\u201cThis year looks a lot different from last year, but just the experience that we have, and obviously, we have a lot of vets on this team, so that helps us going forward,\u201d Williams said. \u201cJust sticking with each other and knowing that we can use each other to get us through everything.\u201d\n\nWhile many fans are looking ahead to seeing USC head up to Portland for the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight, Gottlieb has the Trojans focused only on winning this weekend at home before shifting their focus.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t take any games for granted in this tournament, so if we win that first one, we\u2019ll be excited about that and we\u2019ll think about the second one,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nThe Trojans begin their March Madness run on Saturday at 1:30 p.m. against Texas A&M-CC, which they hope will be the first step to winning the 2024 national championship.\n```"}

Here\u2019s a recap of every one of them.\n\n(9) Michigan State over (8) Mississippi State, 69-51\n\nAfter ranking as No. 4 in the AP\u2019s Preseason Poll, the Michigan State Spartans lost three of their first six games and did not rank in the Top-25 from December onwards. However, like many of head coach Tom Izzo\u2019s past Spartans squads, Michigan State overcame a disappointing regular season and won their round of 64 matchup, this year against the Mississippi State Bulldogs.\n\nMississippi State made less than 25% of their 3-pointers, and all five of their leading scorers on the season scored less than their yearly averages. 5-foot-10 star freshman guard Josh Hubbard tried single-handedly to keep the Bulldogs in the game with 18 field goal attempts, but he never found his rhythm and finished with only six made shots.\n\nMichigan State\u2019s defense was the story of the game, but their star senior guard Tyson Walker led a formidable offensive performance with 19 points on an efficient 58.3% shooting. The Spartans never trailed in this wire-to-wire victory.\n\nOn Saturday, they will look to build off this momentum against the No. 1 seed North Carolina Tar Heels.\n\n(11) Duquesne over (6) BYU, 71-67\n\nIn the first big upset of 2024 March Madness, the Duquesne Dukes spoiled the BYU Cougars\u2019 first NCAA Tournament appearance in three years, when they also lost in the first round to a No. 11 seed (UCLA).\n\nDuquesne controlled the first half behind an aggressive defensive game plan that forced BYU to drive to the rim. BYU\u2019s starting big men, Aly Khalifa and Noah Waterman, finished the game shooting a combined 1 for 9 from the field, including numerous missed point-blank layups that could have swayed the game in BYU\u2019s favor.\n\nIn the second half, the Cougars clawed their way back into the game. With 44 seconds remaining, Duquesne\u2019s lead had been cut down to three points, but the Dukes made their late-game free throws to secure the upset victory.\n\nTheir leading scorer, Dae Dae Grant, made four foul shots in the game\u2019s final minute, which added to his team-high 19 points on the day.\n\nOn Saturday, Duquesne will see if the Cinderella slipper still fits against the No. 3 seed Illinois Fighting Illinis.\n\n(3) Creighton over (14) Akron, 77-60\n\nThe Creighton Bluejays are a trendy Final Four pick, and they looked the part in a dominant win against the Akron Zips.\n\nOnly five players scored for the Bluejays, but each of them had at least ten points, including a 23-point effort from their star 7-footer, Ryan Kalkbrenner.\n\nAs a team, Creighton made over 58% of their 3-point attempts while holding the Zips offense to an atrocious 21.8% from beyond the arc.\n\nAkron senior Enrique Freeman stuffed the stat sheet with 21 points and 14 rebounds, but only one of his teammates scored in double figures.\n\nUltimately, the Zips did not have enough firepower to compete with Creighton\u2019s more talented squad.\n\nCreighton will face another double-digit seed, the No. 11-seeded Oregon Ducks, on Saturday.\n\n(2) Arizona over (15) Long Beach State, 85-65\n\nLast season, the Arizona Wildcats were eliminated in the first round of the NCAA Tournament in a shocking upset loss to the No. 15-seeded Princeton Tigers.\n\nOn Thursday, their halftime lead over the Long Beach State Beach was only six points, prompting thoughts of another potential early exit.\n\nHowever, the Wildcats looked more energized in the second half, outsourcing the Beach by 14 points en route to a 20-point victory.\n\nArizona\u2019s star senior transfer guard Caleb Love scored 18 points, but sophomore Kylan Boswell led the way with 20 points and four 3-pointers.\n\nThe Beach had five double-digit scorers, but Arizona\u2019s talent carried them to an ultimately easy victory.\n\nOn Saturday, they will face the No. 7 seed Dayton Flyers.\n\n(1) North Carolina over (16) Wagner, 90-62\n\nOn Tuesday night, the Wagner Seahawks achieved their first-ever NCAA Tournament victory in the First Four play-in round against the Howard Bisons, 71-68.\n\nJust two days later, they faced off against the West Region\u2019s top-seeded North Carolina Tar Heels.\n\nWithout a true center, the Seahawks struggled to contain North Carolina\u2019s bigs, especially senior Armando Bacot, who finished the game with a 20 and 10 double-double.\n\nThe Tar Heels\u2019 other star, guard RJ Davis, scored a game-high 22 points and hit four 3-pointers in the process.\n\nUltimately, Wagner was overwhelmed by a bigger, more athletic North Carolina attack.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s next opponent, the No. 9 Michigan State Spartans, will offer more physicality in their matchup on Saturday.\n\n(3) Illinois over (14) Morehead State, 85-69\n\nThe Illinois Fighting Illinis built off their momentous Big Ten Conference Championship victory run with a convincing win against the Morehead State Eagles.\n\nAt halftime, Illinois led by only one point, but their second half saw a dominant 46-point scoring output that quickly made the contest less competitive.\n\nThe Fighting Illinis\u2019 offense was dictated by the team\u2019s leading scorer, Terrence Shannon, who recorded 26 points and four assists.\n\nMore surprising were the 21 points from junior Dain Dainja.\n\nThe forward entered the game averaging less than six points and eleven minutes per game, but his perfect 9-9 field goal shooting earned him 23 minutes off the bench in this contest.\n\nThe Eagles also had two 20+ point scorers (Riley Minix and Jordan Lathon), but the rest of the team combined for just 19 points, whereas Illinois\u2019 other scorers contributed 37 points.\n\nIf Dainja goes without a missed shot on Saturday, Illinois\u2019s opponent, the Duquesne Dukes, will have a hard time defending the Fighting Illinis.\n\n(11) Oregon over (6) South Carolina, 87-73\n\nThe Oregon Ducks were the second 11-seed to beat a 6-seed on Thursday, but it was hardly an upset considering that they entered as betting favorites over the South Carolina Gamecocks.\n\nThe Ducks would not have gotten to participate in March Madness if not for an unlikely Pac-12 Conference Tournament Championship victory, which was achieved in large part due to Oregon\u2019s starting shooting guard, Jermaine Couisnard.\n\nThe senior scored 20 points in the Pac-12 semifinals against the conference\u2019s regular season champions, Arizona, and in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament, he exploded for 40 points to help the Ducks advance.\n\nUnlike Oregon, South Carolina\u2019s conference tournament performance was lackluster, including a 31-point loss to the Auburn Tigers.\n\nThey lacked physicality then, and the Gamecocks were out-physical all game long against the Ducks: Oregon grabbed nine more rebounds and scored 12 more points in the paint than South Carolina.\n\nOregon will look to win their sixth straight game on Saturday against the Creighton Bluejays.\n\n(7) Dayton over (10) Nevada, 63-60\n\nWith 7 minutes and 36 seconds remaining in the second half of their matchup against the Dayton Flyers, head coach Steve Alford\u2019s Nevada Wolf Pack squad had a comfortable 56-39 lead.\n\nCoach Alford was in a similar situation on March 17, 2006 during his tenure as head coach of the Iowa Hawkeyes.\n\nIn the first round of the 2006 NCAA Tournament against the No. 14-seeded Northwestern State Demons, Alford\u2019s Hawkeyes led 54-37 with just over eight minutes left to play.\n\nFor the rest of the game, Iowa was outscored 27-9, including a last-second 3-pointer that secured a Hawkeyes loss.\n\nOn Thursday, Alford was unable to break that pattern, as Nevada was outscored by 20 in just over seven minutes to close the game.\n\nIn that stretch, the Wolf Pack recorded four turnovers and missed seven shots with just two made buckets.\n\nIn that span, Dayton\u2019s two-headed monster, forward DaRon Holmes II and Koby Brea, each made more field goals than Nevada\u2019s entire team with three apiece.\n\nDayton made eight of their 19 3-point attempts and made ten more free throws than Nevada.\n\nOnce their shots started falling, Nevada had no answer for their attack, and the Flyers looked like a dominant team.\n\nWill they look as lethal against the No. 2 seed Arizona Wildcats? We\u2019ll find out on Saturday.\n\n(7) Texas over (10) Colorado State, 56-44\n\nAfter an impressive 29-9 record last season, the Texas Longhorns took a step back in 2024, entering March Madness at 20-12 following a loss to Kansas State in their first game of the Big 12 Conference Tournament.\n\nTheir deterioration is largely on the defensive side of the ball: they enter the tournament ranked 60th on Kenpom\u2019s defensive efficiency metric compared to 15th last year.\n\nHowever, they held the Colorado State Rams, a team that scores over 76 points per game this season, to their season low, 44 points.\n\nExcluding 3-pointers, Colorado State was held to 26 points, whereas the Longhorns scored 53 points from 2-pointers and free throws.\n\nConsidering that Colorado State shot only 25% from beyond the arc, their ability to produce offense was limited by Texas\u2019s brute physicality.\n\nWithout threes, the Rams had no way to score.\n\nTexas\u2019s 56 points weren\u2019t a showcase of offensive prowess either, but sophomore guard Chendall Weaver\u2019s 11 points on just seven shot attempts off the bench was the efficiency boost the Longhorns needed to outscore the Rams\u2019 weak effort.\n\nTexas draws the No. 2 seeded Tennessee Volunteers on Saturday.\n\n(14) Oakland over (3) Kentucky, 80-76\n\nIn the best game of Thursday\u2019s action, the Oakland Golden Grizzlies pulled off the biggest upset of the day against the Kentucky Wildcats.\n\nThe hero of the tournament so far is Oakland\u2019s Jack Gohlke, a senior guard who started in less than half of the Golden Grizzlies\u2019 games this year and averages just over 12 points per game.\n\nHe has been lethal from behind the arc this season: he makes approximately 37% of his 9.6 attempts per game.\n\nOn February 17, Gohlke made ten of his 15 3-point attempts against the IUPUI Jaguars, but the Jaguars finished the season 6-26 and are a far cry from the talent Gohlke and Oakland faced against Kentucky.\n\nEven so, Gohlke repeated his efforts and again made 10 threes, which is tied for the second-most made 3-pointers in an NCAA Tournament Game.\n\nKentucky\u2019s senior star, Antonio Reeves, recorded 27 points and five 3-pointers, but the rest of his teammates crumbled under the pressure of the tournament, shooting a combined 4-of-19 from three.\n\nWithout production from the supporting cast, Kentucky was unable to outscore Oakland\u2019s unstoppable 3-point barrage.\n\nNow, the South Region is missing a top-3 seed, which makes the path to the Final Four easier for No. 1 seed Houston and No. 2 seed Marquette.\n\nAs a No. 14 seed, Oakland seems like they could be this year\u2019s Cinderella, but Jack Gohlke doesn\u2019t see things that way.\n\nAfter the game, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re not a Cinderella.\u201d\n\nHe and the Golden Grizzlies will have a chance to prove that they are more than a fluke against the No. 11 seed NC State Wolfpack.\n\n(2) Iowa State over (15) South Dakota State, 82-65\n\nThe Iowa State Cyclones had a dominant run to win the Big 12 Conference Tournament Championship, including a shocking 69-41 blowout against Houston in the final.\n\nTherefore, they have high expectations coming into March Madness.\n\nOn Thursday, against the South Dakota State Jackrabbits, they delivered on their pre-tourney hype with an impressive blowout win.\n\nThe story of the game was the Cyclones\u2019 ball protection.\n\nIowa State had six fewer turnovers than the Jackrabbits, and they scored 17 fast break points compared with South Dakota State\u2019s three.\n\nIn the halfcourt offense, the Cyclones had a balanced scoring attack, with five scorers in double figures, two of which came off the bench.\n\nTheir leading scorer on the season, guard Keshon Gilbert, finished the game with 15 points on nine attempts and five assists.\n\nIowa State will face off against the No. 7 seed Washington State Cougars.\n\n(5) Gonzaga over (12) McNeese State, 86-65\n\nEven in a down year, the Gonzaga Bulldogs entered the NCAA Tournament as a No. 5 seed with a 26-6 record.\n\nDespite this, the McNeese State Cowboys were a popular upset pick based on their 38.8% shooting from three and an impressive 30-3 record.\n\nThe Bulldogs gave the Cowboys their fourth loss, and it was never in doubt.\n\nAfter their first offensive possession, Gonzaga led for the entire contest.\n\nThe Bulldogs had five double-digit scorers, including 16 points from the team\u2019s leading scorer, junior forward Graham Ike, who shot a perfect 8-for-8 from the floor and added eight rebounds to his box score.\n\nOn Saturday, Gonzaga plays the No. 4 Kansas Jayhawks.\n\n(2) Tennessee over (15) Saint Peter\u2019s, 83-49\n\nThe Tennessee Volunteers had all but secured a No. 1 seed for the NCAA Tournament before dropping their final two games against Kentucky and Mississippi State, respectively.\n\nAfter their disappointing finish and their fall to the 2-seed line, public consensus on the Volunteers went cold.\n\nDespite this, Tennessee recorded the most dominant win of Thursday\u2019s action in a 34-point blowout against the No. 15 Saint Peter\u2019s Peacocks.\n\nThe Volunteers were led by the versatile scorer in the country, senior forward Dalton Knecht, who scored 23 points and hit half of his eight 3-point attempts.\n\nSaint Peter\u2019s could not recapture their Cinderella magic from the 2021 tournament, as Tennessee led for the entire game.\n\nOn Saturday, Tennessee will match up with the No. 7 seed Texas Longhorns.\n\n(11) NC State over (6) Texas Tech, 80-67\n\nStraight off the heels of winning five games in five days to win the ACC Conference Tournament Championship, the NC State Wolfpack was the third No. 11 seed to win on Thursday, this time against the No. 6 seed Texas Tech Red Raiders.\n\nThe Wolfpack led for the entire second half and had control throughout the game in large part due to the play of sixth man Ben Middlebrooks.\n\nThe junior big man entered the day with a career high of 14 points but surpassed it in a 21-point effort along with two blocks against the Red Raiders.\n\nTexas Tech struggled to make shots throughout the game: they made less than 40% of their field goal attempts and less than 25% of their threes.\n\nWith uncharacteristically high-scoring performances from NC State\u2019s bench and an inability to convert on open looks, the Red Raiders did not have a clear path to victory.\n\nIn the most unlikely matchup of Saturday\u2019s round of 32 slate, the Wolfpack will battle against another double-digit seed, the No. 14 seed Oakland Golden Grizzlies.\n\n(7) Washington State over (10) Drake, 66-61\n\nAfter winning the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament Championship, the Drake Bulldogs entered the March Madness field for the second consecutive season.\n\nLast year, they fell to the Miami Hurricanes in a tight seven-point contest after only making 29.2% of their threes.\n\nAgainst the Washington State Cougars this year, Drake shot slightly better from three at 33.3%, but they had a similar late-game collapse that led to a disappointing loss.\n\nWith six minutes and 34 seconds left, Drake led 54-46.\n\nFrom then on, the Bulldogs scored only seven points to the Cougars\u2019 20.\n\nWashington State\u2019s comeback was led by their leading scorer this year, senior Isaac Jones, who finished the night with a team-high 20 points.\n\nThis is the Cougars\u2019 first NCAA Tournament win since 2008, when future NBA talent Kyle Weaver and Aron Baynes led Washington State to the Sweet Sixteen.\n\nIf they want to advance that far this season, they\u2019ll have to defeat the No. 2 seed Iowa State Cyclones on Saturday.\n\n(4) Kansas over (13) Samford, 93-89\n\nThe Kansas Jayhawks have advanced to the round of 32 in every NCAA Tournament since 2006, but it took some late-game heroics this season against the 29-win Samford Bulldogs.\n\nKansas led 63-41 with just over 16 minutes left in the game, but over the next seven minutes, the Bulldogs clawed their way back into the game, outscoring Kansas by 21 points and cutting the Jayhawk lead to just one point.\n\nFor the next five minutes, both squads traded buckets, culminating in a Jaden Campbell 3-pointer for Samford, his fifth of the game.\n\nKansas then led 90-89 with 20 seconds remaining and possession of the basketball.\n\nSamford attempted a full-court press without fouling the Jayhawks, but Kansas senior transfer guard Nicolas Timberlake got free, passed every Samford defender, and received the ball with a clear lane to the hoop.\n\nIn the most controversial call of the day, A.J. Staton-McCray chased Timberlake down and appeared to block Timberlake at the rim, but he was called for a foul that would give Timberlake two made free throws and Kansas a three-point lead.\n\nIn the final possession of his senior season, Samford\u2019s Jermaine Marshall missed a 3-pointer, and Kansas narrowly escaped the first round with a four-point victory.\n\nOn Saturday, they will see if their luck continues against the No. 5 Gonzaga Bulldogs.\n```"}

(AP/Matt York)\n\nBy Matt Kim March 21, 2024 at 4:57 pm PDT\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 The MLB season has officially kicked off as the Dodgers defeated the Padres in the Seoul Series opener 5-2. Except, after the Seoul Series, the Dodgers will return to the states and play the Angels in their final spring training games. The Angels have cooled off from an impressive start to Cactus League play, their record currently sitting at 11-12.\n\nAs the Halos continue to ramp things up ahead of the regular season, new manager Ron Washington has named LHP Patrick Sandoval as the Opening Day starter. However, Sandoval has struggled mightily this spring. In 11.1 innings, he\u2019s allowed 16 hits and 9 earned runs to the tune of a 7.15 ERA. Sandoval is coming off of a down 2023 season in which he posted a 4.11 ERA, but isn\u2019t far removed from a stellar 2022 in which he threw 148.2 innings for a 2.91 ERA.\n\nThe southpaw will look towards this upcoming series with the Dodgers as an opportunity to fine tune his mechanics and return to form. Sticking with the rotation, RHP Victor Mederos has made a case to become the fifth starter. Although he\u2019s only thrown three innings at the MLB level, he\u2019s caught many by surprise as through 8.2 innings this spring, he\u2019s tallied 12 strikeouts while only surrendering three earned runs.\n\nIf skipper Ron Washington decides to go with the more experienced arm, then the Angels will turn to LHP Jose Suarez to fill out the rotation, but these last few games of Spring Training might be the difference between Mederos making the big leagues and starting in Triple-A.\n\nThe Angels also have a decision to make when it comes to veterans OF Jake Marisnick and LHP Drew Pomeranz. By Friday, 1 p.m. central, the Angels have to either add them to their active roster or give both the option to opt out of their contracts and sign with new teams.\n\nMarisnick has arguably been one of the Angels\u2019 best hitters this spring, as he\u2019s slugged three home runs and posted a .990 OPS. Marisnick has long been valued for his strong defense, but this strong offensive showing might prove he\u2019s more than just a fourth outfielder.\n\nPomeranz has struggled in his brief time with the Angels, having allowed 5 earned runs in 6.2 innings. The former starter was on a downward spiral before a midseason trade to the Giants in 2019 saw him move to the bullpen. He followed that up with two solid seasons out of the Brewers bullpen but also dealt with a series of injuries. He hasn\u2019t thrown a major league inning since 2021, but the Angels still believe in his ability to be a high-leverage reliever for a unit that has been bottom-ten in baseball.\n\nNewly-signed RHP Robert Stephenson has also been dealing with shoulder discomfort and may not be ready for Opening Day. Should he miss time, it paves the way for some of the arms the Angels signed in the offseason to minor league deals, including RHP Luis Garcia and RHP Carson Fulmer.\n\nGarcia, who most recently pitched for the Padres in 2023, can bring it upwards of 100 MPH, but has dealt with inconsistency and injuries throughout his career. Fulmer was a former first-round pick in 2015 and many thought he would be an MLB-ready arm out of Vanderbilt. However, he never found his footing with the White Sox and has bounced around MLB on minor league deals.\n\nAlbeit a small sample size, Fulmer has thrown three innings of scoreless baseball and a strong finish to spring training might thrust him into a bullpen role with the Angels.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many expectations for the Angels heading into the 2024 season, but that might prove to be a better situation for many of the players on this roster. The younger guys on the roster won\u2019t be pressured to immediately perform as compared to last season, when the Angels were desperately making a push for the postseason in Ohtani\u2019s last season in Anaheim.\n\nIn the worst case scenario, some of the veteran talent might pan out and the Angels can deal them away to replenish their weak farm system, but if this roster is firing on all cylinders, they may surprise the baseball world.\n```"}

(Photo by Eric Park)\n\nBy Lily Coleman March 21, 2024 at 12:12 pm PDT\n\nSixteen USC NFL draft prospects showed off their skills Wednesday at USC\u2019s Pro Day at Allyson Felix Field, where scouts from each NFL team were in attendance. The Trojan prospects included:\n\nDefensive lineman Kyon Barrs\nDefensive back Calen Bullock\nDefensive lineman Solomon Byrd\nLong snapper Jac Casasante\nOffensive lineman Justin Dedich\nRunning back Austin Jones\nOffensive lineman Jarrett Kingston\nLinebacker Shane Lee\nRunning back MarShawn Lloyd\nWide receiver Brenden Rice\nDefensive back Christian Roland-Wallace\nPunter Aadyn Sleep-Dalton\nDefensive lineman Tyrone Taleni\nWide receiver Tahj Washington\nDefensive back Max Williams\nQuarterback Caleb Williams\n\nOf these 16 players, only eight were invited to the 2024 NFL Scouting Combine that was held in Indianapolis from February 29 to March 3. Former USC wide receiver John Jackson III, as well as offensive linemen Joe Bryson and Brett Neilon \u2014 all players on the Trojans\u2019 2022 roster \u2014 were also in the prospect field.\n\nMarShawn Lloyd spoke about his skills beyond rushing that he anticipates bringing to a future NFL team. \u201cBeing able to catch the ball and make defenders miss, I feel like I bring that a lot to the table,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cMy ability to catch the ball, run up in the slot, run in receiver routes is something that I really worked on throughout this process.\u201d\n\nLloyd is a top running back prospect for the upcoming draft. He transferred to USC after three seasons with South Carolina, and during this past season at USC, he had nine touchdowns and averaged 7.1 yards per carry.\n\nWide receiver Brenden Rice \u2014 son of NFL great Jerry Rice \u2014 said he is continuing to improve his game. \u201cI would have to say I\u2019m working on route creativity as well as consistency in my routes,\u201d Rice said. \u201cI feel as though I can run the routes you guys saw today, in and out of the breaks, and go up and make any type of catch. It\u2019s just the ability to consistently do it down and out.\u201d\n\nHe recently had a visit with the Los Angeles Chargers and said that it would be \u201camazing\u201d to be drafted by them. \u201cI love the coaching staff, I love who they are,\u201d Rice said. \u201cJim Harbaugh used to recruit me out of high school, and I feel as though I would be great within that system.\u201d\n\nOffensive lineman Justin Dedich talked about performing at Pro Day after not being invited to the combine earlier in the month. \u201cI probably wasn\u2019t ready during the combine to do some events. Obviously, I always wanted to go, you know, that\u2019s a childhood dream,\u201d Dedich said. \u201cBut, I\u2019m super grateful that I got a little more time to focus and just kind of get those extra reps before I get tested.\u201d\n\nBut the headliner was obvious. Projected No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams had all eyes on him. \u201cI wanted to come out here and put on a show,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI think it went well.\u201d\n\nAlthough he didn\u2019t play at all at the NFL Combine or complete medical testing or measurements, he did throw at Pro Day. Given that he is the expected top pick in the NFL Draft, the media has focused heavily on analyzing him. \u201cPeople are gonna say what they\u2019re gonna say, he\u2019s just got to stay true to himself, which he always does,\u201d Dedich said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great athlete ... so I think just showing what he can do out here is what he does on film, which he always has.\u201d\n\nThe Chicago Bears hold the No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft and sent a team of coaching personnel to USC on Wednesday. Bears general manager Ryan Poles, head coach Matt Eberflus and offensive coordinator Shane Waldron all stood in the end zone of the field. Former Los Angeles Charger and incoming Bears wide receiver Keenan Allen was also on the sideline after a recent trade sent him to Chicago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Keenan for probably a year now, hung out with him a few times, so for me to possibly be going to the same team as him is exciting,\u201d Williams said. When asked about the new players coming to the Bears, Allen said, \u201cFire.\u201d\n\nWilliams recently met with the Bears and shared his growing relationship with the team. Pro Day was an opportunity to strengthen that connection. \u201cIt was great,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really need to learn much. Just building a relationship.\u201d\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft takes place from April 25-27 in Detroit, Michigan.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/21/the-silver-shield-vol-16-predatory-instinct/", "response": "```\nThe prowling Predators\n\nComing off a disappointing 2022-23 season, the Nashville Predators are eager to return to the Stanley Cup Playoffs. In a stacked Central Division, the Preds are very likely out of contention for the division title, but they\u2019re still in the thick of the Western Conference\u2019s highly anticipated Wild Card race with 84 points. Nashville is 13-0-2 in its last 15 bouts and hasn\u2019t lost a game in regulation since February 15. If the season were to end today, the Predators would face the Pacific-leading Vancouver Canucks in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nWinger Filip Forsberg is on track to have the best season of his career. He leads Nashville with 74 points on 36 goals and 38 assists. Forsberg hasn\u2019t suited up for a full 82 games since the Predators\u2019 Stanley Cup-losing season in 2016-17 \u2014 but he\u2019s played in all of Nashville\u2019s games thus far this season \u2014 and has avoided major injuries. The Swede is utterly clutch; he\u2019s tallied a career-high nine game-winning goals this year and has helped the Preds win games they weren\u2019t necessarily favored in. Forsberg scores when it matters most and is currently riding a four-game point streak, posting at least one in all but one game in March so far.\n\nBlueliner Roman Josi may be a 13-year NHL vet, but, like Forsberg, he\u2019s having a career year. Josi started the season off slow but has been on a tear as of late. He leads Nashville with 52 helpers and is making his case as one of the league\u2019s top defensemen this year. Not only has Josi been one of the Predators\u2019 main offensive catalysts, but he\u2019s been dominant in the defensive end as well. Skating in a whopping 24:27 per game, Josi is resilient and highly skilled.\n\nWinger Gustav Nyquist is another Nashville skater having a retro season. A bit of a journeyman, the 34-year-old joined the Predators in the offseason and already has tied his career-high in points, with 60 on the season. Nyquist has also avoided the penalty box and has used his speed and stickhandling to create chances.\n\nGoaltender Juuse Saros was a popular name around the trade deadline, but Nashville decided to keep him for the ride. Playing in 55 games so far, he\u2019s carried a heavier load than the average netminder, which likely explains his more modest numbers. But Saros is a winner; his 30-21-4 record is nothing to look down upon, and he\u2019ll be heavily relied upon as the Preds march toward the playoffs. As he\u2019ll be an unrestricted free agent in 2025, Nashville keeping him shows that it has faith in the 29-year-old to take the team on a run.\n\nFirst-line center Ryan O\u2019Reilly has 24 goals. He and Forsberg are the only Predators to have broken the 20-goal plane, but a handful of others are close to the accolade. A top-10 prospect pool and a deep playoff run-hungry squad should be comforting for Nashville fans. With 13 regular-season games left on the calendar, the Predators haven\u2019t quite punched their ticket to the postseason just yet, but their post-All Star break success certainly puts them in a position to contend for the Stanley Cup, which they\u2019ve never hoisted.\n\nThe Preds will play an important game against the Florida Panthers on Thursday at 4:30 p.m. PST in Sunrise, FL.\n\nWhat happened to Detroit?\n\nSince winning six straight and causing drama in the Atlantic Division, the Detroit Red Wings have been flat-out lifeless. Losers of eight of their last 10 games, all in regulation, the Wings must\u2019ve taken notes from the NBA team they share a home arena with, the 12-57 Detroit Pistons. All jokes aside, the Red Wings are now in serious jeopardy of losing their Wild Card spot.\n\nSince the start of the calendar year, winger Alex DeBrincat has not been the goal-scoring machine he once was. While he has lit the lamp 23 times this season, which isn\u2019t bad, he\u2019s only done so six times since January 1. With only two points in March (both assists), he hasn\u2019t helped Detroit get out of its depressing slump.\n\nThe absence of center Dylan Larkin, who\u2019s injured, hasn\u2019t done the Red Wings any favors either. Larkin hasn\u2019t played since March 2 \u2014 but is expected to return soon \u2014 which would be huge for Detroit. At the time of getting hurt, Larkin led the Wings in goals and total points, with 26 and 54, respectively. Without Larkin, the Red Wings have shown that, while they do have a significant amount of depth in their lineup, when missing a key player, they still struggle to fill the void on the top lines. As a result, they look like a completely different team without their captain.\n\nConsistency issues between the pipes and on defense have also been a struggle. During Detroit\u2019s recent seven-game skid, the team gave up at least four goals in every match, with as many as seven against both the Colorado Avalanche and the Buffalo Sabres. Lead goalie Alex Lyon has allowed an average of 3.1 goals per game this season and backup James Reimer isn\u2019t much better at 2.98.\n\nWith a number of problems to fix, the Red Wings still own a playoff spot with 13 games to go. But with the Washington Capitals, New York Islanders and Buffalo Sabres all within five points of Detroit, the Wings will hope for a steady return of Larkin and a smooth rebound heading into the playoffs. The Red Wings haven\u2019t made the postseason since 2016 and haven\u2019t won a playoff series since 2013 when they weren\u2019t even an Eastern Conference team yet.\n\nDetroit will hope to take down the Isles on Thursday at home at 4 p.m. PST in a crucial game with playoff implications.\n```"}

Nickelodeon has been working for years to develop broadcasts that appeal to both younger and older sports fans.\n\nWhen tuning in to CBS\u2019s Super Bowl coverage this year, you were probably expecting the usual, from some incredible plays to an entertaining halftime show. You likely weren\u2019t expecting a crowd full of cartoon fish, commentary from a talking sponge and slime cannons going off in the endzone. These were just a few of the elements that the Nickelodeon Super Bowl broadcast had to offer.\n\n\u201cThis broadcast shows the power of Nick and CBS coming together,\u201d Vice President of Unscripted Nickelodeon Luke Wahl said. \u201cOur zany sensibilities and their mastery of how to put on a football game made for the perfect partnership.\u201d\n\nWhile the partnership between the unlikely duo may come as a surprise to many, it actually has been in the works longer than you think. Viewers got their first glimpse of their potential back at the 2019 Super Bowl in Atlanta, when SpongeBob and friends introduced rapper Travis Scott at the start of the halftime show. The appearance by Nick\u2019s beloved toon was meant as a tribute to the show\u2019s creator Stephen Hillenburg, who had passed away the previous year.\n\nWhat was meant as a touching cameo soon became more, as fans started making petitions online for the famous SpongeBob song \u201cSweet Victory\u201d to be performed at the Super Bowl halftime show. This request would not go unnoticed by the creative heads at Nick. It was eventually fulfilled during this year\u2019s Nick Super Bowl, as animators recreated the iconic sequence in 3D animation to open the broadcast.\n\nDue to the positive feedback from fans following the 2019 Super Bowl, it was no surprise that the NFL and Nickelodeon started exploring the idea of collaborating more. In 2020, the two came to the agreement that Nick would host a playoff game telecast that would be aimed at younger viewers.\n\nAlthough Nickelodeon had experimented with sports-related shows in the past, such as the award show \u201cKids\u2019 Choice Sports\u201d and the animated series \u201cNFL Rush Zone\u201d, this telecast would prove to be a whole new challenge. The telecast aired January 10, 2021, as Nick covered the Wild Card playoff game between the Chicago Bears and New Orleans Saints. The game featured everything from colorful cartoon graphics to even giving out a most valuable player award known as the \u201cNVP.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of connecting with a younger audience is trying your best to meet them on their level,\u201d Wahl said. The broadcast was a success \u2014 drawing in 2 million viewers \u2014 becoming the channel\u2019s most-watched program among total viewers in nearly four years.\n\nBesides ratings, the broadcast was praised by everyone, including former Super Bowl winning quarterback Kurt Warner, for educating kids on the rules of football while being entertaining. With a hit on their hands, the NFL upped their partnership with Nickelodeon and gave them not only another playoff game broadcast for the 2022 season, but a Christmas Day regular season game between the Los Angeles Rams and Denver Broncos. And once again, they struck gold.\n\nThe Christmas Day telecast drew in around 900,000 viewers, making it the highest-rated Christmas Day broadcast since 2016. Nickelodeon seemed to have a winning formula as good as the one for the Krabby Patty.\n\nEntering the 2023-2024 NFL season, the NFL once again gave Nick a Christmas Day telecast, but they were also planning for something bigger. With Nick\u2019s continued success on their NFL telecasts and CBS owning the broadcasting rights for the Super Bowl, all parties felt it was time to tackle the biggest game of them all.\n\nBilled as \u201cSuper Bowl LVIII: Live from Bikini Bottom,\u201d the telecast would be the first of its kind, as there had never been an alternative broadcast for the Super Bowl before. As the team at Nick began to prepare for this new challenge, they all went in with the same goal in mind. The goal was for the telecast to surprise and delight the younger audience, but to have everyday football fans respect the production as well.\n\n\u201cWe wanted the broadcast to stand on its own,\u201d Wahl said. \u201cWhen you strip everything away, it needs to be a well-shot, well-directed and well-produced football game.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of the process, everything started on Nickelodeon\u2019s side of things. The team at Nick spent many hours brainstorming ideas that they felt may be unique and fun, from which iconic Nicktoons to include to coming up with a ton of fish-punned celebrity names. During this time they made sure to keep CBS in the loop and see if they could help them improve or expand their ideas. CBS was completely open-minded and fully embraced the partnership.\n\nWhile brainstorming ideas may have been difficult at times, it was nowhere near as challenging as the technical side of the telecast. In a broadcast with so many moving parts and emerging technology, coordination was going to have to be key if they wanted to succeed.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, it is the most complicated live sports broadcast that has ever existed,\u201d Wahl said. Leading up to the big game, Nickelodeon visited Allegiant Stadium, the site of Super Bowl LVIII, three times in order to conduct tests to make sure the augmented reality technology performed up to par.\n\nWhen it came to designing and producing the graphic elements featured in the broadcast, a lot of the heavy lifting was done by the animation studio Silver Spoon. Nick also had to figure out how to use live-motion capture in its telecast. While announcers Noah Eagle and Nate Burleson got to dress to impress for the broadcast, voice actors Tom Kenny and Bill Fagerbakke were covered from head to toe in motion capture suits in order to bring SpongeBob and Patrick to life.\n\nBoth voice actors were fully game, though, and given pretty much free range to improvise as much as they liked. \u201cWe explained to them we didn\u2019t need them to be football experts, we just needed them to go out there and be SpongeBob and Patrick,\u201d Wahl said.\n\nAfter a total seven months of brainstorming, testing, designing and producing content for the telecast, on February 11, 2024, it was finally time to put everything to the test. The telecast was everything and more you could want from a Nickelodeon sports broadcast. It included all kinds of wackiness and tomfoolery, from a giant robot on the field to a blimp covering the crowd in that signature Nickelodeon slime.\n\nThe game commentary from SpongeBob and Patrick was great, too, as they found the perfect balance of explaining the action on the field to younger viewers and mixing it with silly humor. Some may even say they did a better job at calling the game than CBS announcer Tony Romo.\n\nThe feedback to Nick\u2019s Super Bowl telecast was sensational, with many praising the broadcast for its unhinged humor and unique antics. Before the telecast was even over, clips of it were getting turned into memes and generating thousands of likes all over social media.\n\nThe broadcast averaged about 1.2 million viewers and made history along with the other broadcasts as the most-watched telecast in history, with a total audience delivery of 123.4 million viewers.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot to be able to appeal to people that grew up with the Nick stuff and as a big sports fan,\u201d Wahl said. \u201cFor them to tune in and feel that they got what they wanted in terms of a sports broadcast, but also the joy and nostalgia of Nick is great.\u201d\n\nWith another hit under their belt, Nickelodeon wishes to continue to develop their relationship with the NFL. Based on the general feedback of the Super Bowl broadcast, it is safe to say that the NFL is very open to this as well.\n\nNick\u2019s success at tackling the Super Bowl begs the question, \u201cWill they try to take a stab at other major sporting events?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an appetite for us to look at other places where we can execute this type of thing,\u201d Wahl said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough because when you do the Super Bowl you\u2019re standing on the top of the mountain, but I think there are definitely other places we can do stuff like this.\u201d\n\nNick\u2019s NFL telecasts have made headlines for their impressive graphics and wacky jokes, but the main thing they have done is present a broadcast that sports fans and their kids can enjoy together. Wahl is a prime example of this, as both he and his 7-year-old son watched the Nick Super Bowl together.\n\nThese telecasts allow families to bond with each other as they offer something for both the young and old. The broadcasts have been so successful that competing companies have even taken notice. Last year, Disney released their answer to Nick\u2019s telecasts with \u201cNHL Big City Greens Classic\u201d and \u201cToy Story Funday Football.\u201d\n\nBoth of these broadcasts were animated versions of a NHL and NFL game that featured characters from the Disney Channel animated series \u201cBig City Greens\u201d and the Pixar \u201cToy Story\u201d franchise.\n\nWhile other companies may try to replicate this winning formula, Nickelodeon will always be known for pioneering and perfecting it.\n\n\u201cIn a world with so many streaming sites, there is the ability to host alternative broadcasts,\u201d Wahl said. \u201cI think alternative broadcasts for kids are here to stay.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/21/are-broader-terms-affecting-asian-self-identification/", "response": "```\nAre broader terms affecting Asian self-identification? USC students talk about their relationship with Asian terminology\n\nBy Amrita Sundaresan March 21, 2024 at 10:47 am PDT\n\nFrom \u201cAAPI\u201d (\u201cAsian Pacific Islander\u201d), to \u201cAPIDA\u201d (\u201cAsian Pacific Islander and Desi American\u201d), \u201cAPISA\u201d (\u201cAsian Pacific Islander and South Asian\u201d), and now the Biden presidential campaign put out the acronym \u201cAANHPI\u201d (\u201dAsian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander). The terminology surrounding Asian identification has been in a constant state of change. Having labels put upon any group can lead to a rift in the way that people personally identify themselves and can start to create a struggle between that and what other people want you to be.\n\nStudents at USC had different opinions about this topic and expressed distinct thoughts about how they identify themselves. \u201cI think that all of the changes when it comes to the actual abbreviation just increases the work that\u2019s put on the community itself to educate other people about what is apparently right or what is apparently wrong,\u201d said Sreenidhi Boopathi, a USC senior, who identifies as Tamil under the Indian identity. \u201cThere\u2019s so many different types of Asian and it\u2019s just that up until now I feel like people have just conflicted the Asian identity with the East Asian identity, leading to the additions and adding \u2018PI\u2019 and adding \u2018SA\u2019 and etc.\u201d\n\nThe Asian identity is much more than just one region or one ethnicity. But, it becomes difficult for people to remember that when the term essentially lumps everyone from every Asian country into one small abbreviation. \u201cIn the Asian community, I think we\u2019re all trying to figure out what\u2019s the best way to label things and we don\u2019t even have a consensus, so when someone else that\u2019s not even part of the community is just trying to say \u2018oh well no, we can just say this or say this,\u2019 and then its constantly changing, you just never know what to think,\u201d said Midori Jenkins, a USC graduate student, who identifies as both Japanese and Black.\n\n\u201cI think it makes the conversation really difficult because it\u2019s always going to be an outward label.\u201d With all the different versions of these terms and the constant change in the abbreviations, it\u2019s hard to really know if these terms are encompassing of all our identities. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to be inclusive, but at the same time you\u2019re trying to be inclusive, you\u2019re being exclusive,\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cI just feel almost conflicted about what can be considered inclusive versus exclusive and how do we even define these terms in a respectful way.\u201d\n\nThe broader terminology, in a way, may help us create a sort of sense of community or unity amongst all Asian identities. But, at the same time, it makes self-identification more vague for ourselves and may even create a rift between each other. \u201cIf anything I think that the broader the terminology, the more it actually creates a divide between people of Asian identities themselves,\u201d said Boopathi. \u201cI would see all these different kinds, different variations and I would just register them all as one thing,\u201d added Avana Wang, a USC junior, who identifies as Chinese. \u201cIt just feels more vague to me because I feel like it doesn\u2019t encapsulate a lot of different regions and people.\u201d\n\nThe struggles that have continued to arise from these broad labels may all go back to the fact that many of them were not originally introduced by the community that they were made to serve. The term \u201cAsian American\u201d can be traced back to a grassroots movement in 1968 where two University of California Berkeley graduate students were trying to find a name for their new student activist organization. \u201cAsian American\u201d and then later \u201cAsian and Pacific Islander,\u201d were terms that were introduced to be used in the U.S. Census to better group individuals through these \u201cgovernment classifications.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that we are almost kind of viewing the Asian identity through a white lens by using the terms that have been prescribed upon us by these majority peoples or like majority groups,\u201d said Boopathi. \u201cAnd I think that has led to a lack of solidarity within the Asian identities themselves.\u201d Jenkins echoes her agreement to Boopathi\u2019s opinion on Asian identity being viewed through a white perspective. \u201cI 100% do feel like labels do almost come from a white perspective of like we need to group people in order to better understand them,\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cTrying to group people culturally or racially makes it easier for people to I guess figure out the similarities.\u201d\n\nWang furthers this opinion by adding on her concerns for categorizing and grouping Asian identities. \u201cIn a way, just the way that you\u2019re asked to categorize yourself, given these things that organizations or the government comes up with is, I guess in itself could be seen as categorized through a white lens,\u201d says Wang. \u201cThe way that race and ethnicity is such a prominent thing in America, it\u2019s made a thing through these categorizations.\u201d\n\nThese categorizations lead people to believe that they\u2019re stuck in the ways they represent themselves. So, how can this be changed? \u201cI honestly really love the idea of just identifying people from where they come from because I think there\u2019s something really special about each individual culture,\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cI would definitely honor a specific person\u2019s preference,\u201d said Boopathi.\u201dBut if I was in charge of labeling the entire thing, I would just say Asian and then it\u2019s up to other people to realize that it\u2019s not speaking to one specific identity.\u201d Wang agrees as she encourages people to abandon the broader terms and stick to the specifics. \u201cIt allows people to identify more specifically and maybe identify as something that they feel more like themselves if it\u2019s more specific rather than this whole big terminology,\u201d said Wang.\n\nThis is an issue that goes well beyond having to check off boxes on a form. As tough as it may be, it\u2019s one that goes back to how you personally feel and identify. \u201cBe sure to not change what you truly identify as in your head because you don\u2019t fit in the boxes,\u201d said Wang. \u201cBecause they are either just not thoroughly made or thought through for everyone. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t fit, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s not there yet.\u201d \u201cI think just being willing to share that experience and attaching that as part of your identity and not letting that outward label define you,\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cYou have to really advocate and be the person to define yourself and you don\u2019t necessarily have to tell everyone, but being kind of secure in that and knowing that people who care about you will respect your identity and when you meet people just be very forthcoming.\u201d```"}

In a perfect world, everyone would have the time to watch each game and keep up with their (hopefully perfect) brackets, but with 32 games over the next two days, that isn\u2019t very plausible. Thankfully, I\u2019ve hand-picked four first-round games that are most likely to go down as March Madness classics!\n\n(8) Mississippi State vs. (9) Michigan State, Thursday 9:15 am PDT\n\nThe Michigan State Spartans opened the AP\u2019s preseason poll as the No. 4 ranked team in the country before losing three of their first six games, including an overtime loss to the mid-major James Madison Dukes in their home opener. Afterwards, the Spartans never found their way back into the Top 25 and disappointed in Big Ten conference play, finishing the regular season with a 10-10 Big Ten record and losses in four of their last five contests. Despite this, Michigan State has elite metrics: Kenpom ranks them as the No. 19 team, which is the highest out of nine seeds and would be the highest out of seven and eight seeds, as well. This is because of head coach Tom Izzo\u2019s elite defensive personnel. The Spartans aggressively blitz ball handlers on pick-and-rolls and consistently thwart transition offenses based on incredible physicality.\n\nThe Mississippi State Bulldogs dealt with tough, athletic defenses all season in the SEC and beat numerous teams in the tournament field, including Washington State, Northwestern, and Tennessee. Was their strength of schedule enough to prepare them for this first-round duel? The Bulldogs had more success than Michigan State in the regular season, but the analytics suggest that Coach Izzo\u2019s reputation of leading the Spartans to outperform their expectations in the postseason may continue. It will be a tight battle, and the winner will likely face off against North Carolina in the round of 32. Could the Spartans or Bulldogs compete with the top-seeded Tar Heels? First, they\u2019ll have to get through each other.\n\n(7) Washington State vs. (10) Drake, Thursday 7:05 pm PDT\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the seed disparity between the Washington State Cougars and the Drake Bulldogs. Drake is currently the odds-on favorite to win this matchup, and for good reason. The Bulldogs stole Indiana State\u2019s bid to the NCAA Tournament in the Missouri Valley Conference Championship Game, but they might have made the field regardless based on an impressive at-large resume. Drake beat Akron and Nevada, two other teams in the field, early in the regular season, and they head into the tournament with a 28-6 record, including a five-game winning streak. Drake makes over 35% of their 3-pointers, a number that may haunt the Cougars, who run drop coverage on over half of opposing offensive pick-and-rolls. In other words, Drake will have opportunities for open threes all night long. If they are hitting them, Washington State is vulnerable to be \u201cupset.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, if Drake has an off night, it will be due to their lackluster transition defense. Washington State converts on transition scoring attempts at an elite rate, which would make potential Drake missed 3-pointers costly for the Bulldogs. Ultimately, this battle will be dictated by shooting. Look for Drake\u2019s star junior forward Tucker DeVries to dictate the result of the game. He has made 84 threes this season, and the Bulldogs will lean on him for success in the first round and beyond.\n\n(6) Clemson vs. (11) New Mexico, Friday 12:10 pm PDT\n\nHere\u2019s another game where the \u201cunderdog\u201d (based on their seed) is favored by betting markets. On Selection Sunday, analysts were shocked that the New Mexico Lobos were slotted in as an 11-seed. They are ranked as the 22nd-most efficient team on Kenpom, which is higher than every 7, 8, and 10-seed, and all but one 9-seed (see Michigan State above). The Lobos started the season 18-3 before a disappointing 4-6 regular season finish, but their Mountain West Conference Championship victory run included three straight wins against teams in the field, which suggests they are back on track.\n\nClemson also finished the regular season weaker than they started. The Tigers started at 9-0 but are since just one game above .500. Unlike New Mexico, Clemson\u2019s conference tournament appearance was brief and uninspired, a 21-point loss to an 18-14 Boston College team that had not beaten an NCAA Tournament team up to that point. However, Clemson matches up well schematically with New Mexico. The Tigers\u2019 defensive system, which leaves 3-point shooters open around the perimeter, is unlikely to hurt them, as the Lobos rarely shoot threes and do not make them at a high clip. Conversely, while New Mexico\u2019s defense swarms 3-point shooters, a high number of Clemson\u2019s baskets will come at the rim, which has worked for the Tigers this year.\n\nNew Mexico appears to be the more energized team, but they may have problems with Clemson\u2019s style of play. This makes for the best kind of first-round matchup in which either result would feel like an upset.\n\n(5) Wisconsin vs. (12) James Madison, Friday 6:40 pm PDT\n\nEvery year, there is a 12-seed vs. 5-seed upset that everyone filling out a bracket seems to like, and the James Madison Dukes appear to be the people\u2019s first-round \u201cCinderella\u201d this season. How likely are they to upset the Wisconsin Badgers? In James Madison\u2019s first game this season, they upset a different Big Ten opponent, Michigan State, on the road. Since then, the Dukes are 30-3, with the nation\u2019s longest active win streak at 13 games (and counting). However, besides their opener, strength of schedule is a major concern, as they only faced two other teams in this year\u2019s field (Howard and Akron), one of whom is a 16-seed.\n\nWisconsin has ten more losses than James Madison, but they also have wins over Marquette, Northwestern, and Purdue along with twice as many wins than the Dukes against Michigan State. Theoretically, they should be prepared for a mid-major opponent. However, much like Drake in their first-round matchup, James Madison lives and dies at the 3-point line, and Wisconsin tends to give opponents lots of open looks. The Dukes have five different players with more than 40 made 3-pointers, and each of them make at least 35% of their attempts. Therefore, if one of them has an off night, it\u2019s likely that one of the others will have a hot hand.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/20/tot-pro-day-recap-usc/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 NFL scouts, general managers and coaches flocked to Allyson Felix Field Wednesday morning to watch USC\u2019s Pro Day, with all eyes on presumptive No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams. Among the personnel in attendance were Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Poles, head coach Matt Eberflus and newly acquired wide receiver Keenan Allen. All three had an opportunity to chat with Williams before his workout started. The Bears have the opportunity to make Williams the franchise\u2019s first overall pick since halfback Bob Fenimore in 1947.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 Pro Day showcased 16 draft prospects, eight of whom also participated in last month\u2019s NFL Combine. Other prospects, like running back Austin Jones, center Justin Dedich, defensive linemen Kyron Barrs, linebacker Shane Lee, defensive lineman Tyrone Taleni, defensive back Max Willaims, long snapper Jac Casasante and punter Aadyn Sleep-Dalton showcased their talents to NFL scouts for the first time ahead of the draft in April.\n\nBefore the sun shined high, a layer of morning fog settled over Felix Field to begin the Trojans\u2019 day. Prospects started their routines with the 40-yard dash, three-cone drill and 20-yard shuttle. While almost every prospect participated in the events, Williams took his time getting to the field, showing up halfway through the 40-yard dash in tennis shoes. Williams did not participate in any of the opening drills.\n\nOffensive and defensive linemen began the individual skill exercises. Veteran center Justin Dedich, who has put on 12 pounds since January, showed off his lateral agility, utilizing his quick feet and high-motor athleticism in pad drills. At 6-foot-2, Dedich models his game after NFL centers of similar size, naming Baltimore Ravens Tyler Linderbaum and future Hall of Famer Jason Kelce as two of his favorites. He admires their grit and aggression in every play.\n\n\u201cWorking on run blocking is something I have been trying to focus on,\u201d Dedich said. \u201cIf I could get that fixed, I could have a great opportunity at the next level.\u201d\n\nAs the sun started peering out from behind the clouds, the defensive backs, including All-American safety Calen Bullock, took the field. Bullock led the defensive backs through various change-of-direction drills, testing prospects\u2019 hip fluidity and foot quickness. Bullock shined every rep, displaying clean hip motion and a strong burst in both short and long areas. A known ballhawk with nine career interceptions, Bullock showcased his strong hands and tracking ability through every drill.\n\nIn the final drill of the day, Bullock showed scouts his range as a safety, quickly darting down the field with his eyes tracking the ball for the duration of the rep. At the next level, Bullock is willing to move from safety to cornerback, feeling comfortable in both positions. Either way, he\u2019s grateful to have contributed to the rich history of elite safeties at USC.\n\n\u201cFeels good to be a part of that safety group, especially knowing the guys and the work they put in here,\u201d Bullock said, being part of a rich history of USC safeties.\n\nWith the sun now shining brightly over Felix Field, it was time for the 2022 Heisman winner to put on a show. Surrounded by scouts, general managers and coaches, the buzz around the field was fiery, with everybody trying to get their best look at No.13.\n\nWilliams\u2019 rotation of pass catchers consisted of Brendan Rice, Tahj Washington, Marshawn Llyod, Austin Jones and former Trojan wideout John Jackson III. The group began light, working in the short area with five-yard flats, slants and check-downs for the running backs. Rice impressed the most out of the bunch, showcasing his large catch radius and tracking ability. Rice was a prototypical X-receiver at USC, serving as Williams\u2019 go-to jump-ball target for the past two seasons. During this session, however, Rice showed the depth of his game, displaying fluid hips and solid change of direction in his routes.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the unit started to stretch the field, showcasing Williams\u2019s pin-point accuracy in the intermediate game and letting the receivers get more creative with their routes. Similar to his tape, Williams consistently threw with anticipation, delivering great zip on the ball in all areas of the field. The play of the day came on Williams\u2019s final pass, as he effortlessly heaved a 70-yard bomb to Rice in the endzone to finish off an impressive throwing script. Williams\u2019s pass was met with immense applause from the crowd of NFL personnel and media.\n\nThe next stop for Williams and his teammates is next month\u2019s NFL Draft. For many former Trojans, hearing their name called on the big stage will be the culmination of a childhood dream.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/20/rookie-report-cason-wallace/", "response": "```\nThe Talk of Troy Rookie report: Cason Wallace\n\nThunder GM Sam Presti\u2019s most recent first-round pick has a promising future, despite his limited role.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder guard Cason Wallace (22) drives against Utah Jazz guard Johnny Juzang (33) during the first half of an NBA basketball game Wednesday, March 20, 2024, in Oklahoma City. (AP/Kyle Phillips)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan March 20, 2024 at 9:55 pm PDT\n\nThis week, the Oklahoma City Thunder have become the first team in this series to boast two rookies worthy of columns. Cason Wallace doesn\u2019t have the same media attention or size role as Chet Holmgren, but he\u2019s nonetheless played a notable part in the Thunder\u2019s success. The stats don\u2019t show it in the immediacy, but Wallace has maybe the highest ceiling of any guard selected in the 2023 NBA Draft. He just so happens to play on a team with an MVP candidate at point guard in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, limiting Wallace\u2019s ability to be more ball-dominant than if another team had drafted him.\n\nThe former Kentucky Wildcat, who spent just one season playing college ball, showed flashes of being a go-to scorer under John Calipari\u2019s tutelage, but ultimately his game-to-game inconsistency may have scared NBA teams off of selecting him higher than 10th. In fact, the Thunder weren\u2019t even the NBA team that technically picked Wallace. The Dallas Mavericks selected him on OKC\u2019s behalf, dumping D\u0101vis Bert\u0101ns\u2019 contract in the process to receive No. 12 overall Dereck Lively II. It proved a shrewd move for the Thunder, who managed to flip Bert\u0101ns with some other assets to acquire Gordon Hayward, some much-needed veteran experience.\n\nThis is just what Thunder general manager Sam Presti does. Whenever he sees an opportunity to turn a questionable asset into a promising young player he can develop in Oklahoma City, he takes it. He took Paul George\u2019s presumable unwillingness to stay on the Thunder in free agency and extracted SGA and a battalion of picks from the Clippers. The No. 12 pick became not just Cason Wallace, but Hayward\u2014again, Presti created more from seemingly less.\n\nNow Wallace has the privilege of being Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s understudy. Two guards, both former Kentucky players, selected in almost identical spots in their respective drafts (SGA went at No. 11 to Walace\u2019s 10). That\u2019s not to say the pair are similar players. Just in terms of their shot diets, over 50% of Wallace\u2019s attempts come from beyond the three-point line, whereas Gilgeous-Alexander has just one season in his six-year career over 30%. And even in the long term, once his rookie overeagerness dissipates, Wallace will likely be more of a black hole than SGA.\n\nWallace has an 8.7% assist percentage\u2014the per-possession rate at which a player assists a teammate\u2019s field goal\u2014compared to Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s 17.8% figure when he was a rookie on the Clippers, which has only risen to 30.3% in 2023-24. Of course, the frequency with which a player has the ball in his hands is a huge factor in the rate at which he can dish assists, so that number will hopefully grow for Wallace when he becomes a starter, either in OKC or elsewhere.\n\nI say \u201cor elsewhere\u201d because head coach Mark Daigneault may need to find a way to keep SGA and Wallace on the floor together for 30-plus minutes per night starting as soon as next season. And if he can\u2019t find a way to do that, Presti may fetch another king\u2019s ransom for Wallace.\n\nAdmittedly, I\u2019m being speculative here. Wallace currently averages 5.2 field goal attempts per game, 2.2 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 0.8 steals on 20.5 minutes per outing\u2014nothing to write home about yet. But once or twice a month, he has a scoring burst where you can see it. He recently scored a career-high 22 points against the Memphis Grizzlies, going 4-6 from distance and tallying four assists.\n\nLet\u2019s break down some tape from that game, in which Wallace\u2019s spatial awareness shined: When a defense lapses against Wallace, he strikes. In the clip above, Gordon Hayward\u2019s drive into the paint forces Jaren Jackson Jr. closer to the rim to protect it, leaving Wallace unguarded. Seeing this sequence of events as it happens, the young guard drifts out the perimeter, where he receives the kick out from Hayward and sinks the three with ease, even as Jackson Jr. leaps out with his enormous frame to attempt a late shot contest.\n\nA similar thing happens here, where the Grizzlies defense just completely loses sight of Wallace. Here, Wallace is Grizzlies forward Jake LaRavia\u2019s assignment. Lu Dort brings the ball up the court and passes to Josh Giddey on the left wing, shifting the Grizzlies defense slightly in that direction. Wallace, the Thunder\u2019s furthest player to the right, realizes that LaRavia has glanced away from his man as Giddey receives the ball, with no Grizzlies defender outside of Wallace. Seeing the space ahead of him and LaRavia\u2019s momentary look-away, Wallace starts sprinting into the paint, Giddey fires a cross-court pass to him and Wallace has an easy lay-up attempt.\n\nThese two sequences show Wallace\u2019s awareness of the whole court and ability to take advantage of opposing team\u2019s putting weaker defenders on him or leaving him in space. As an off-the-bench piece for now, Wallace needs to continue in these situations, especially when he\u2019s on the floor with multiple other threats in SGA and Holmgren. If he does, the coaching staff will surely notice his progress and increase his playing time, at which he\u2019ll be an absolute flamethrower from deep.\n\nSpeaking of, Wallace leads all rookies in three-point percentage. Yep, you read that correctly. He\u2019s above Brandon Miller, Brandin Podziemski and Jordan Hawkins, among others. At 41.9% in shots from distance, Wallace is almost three percentage points above second-place Holmgren. Now, he takes fewer attempts from beyond the arc than those other guys, but he also plays fewer minutes than them. When he\u2019s on the floor, Wallace is flat-out efficient.\n\nCase in point: And this: Plus, three consecutive deep-hit highlights here: And I would be remiss not to mention Wallace\u2019s burst to the rim\u2014he\u2019s not just a three-point merchant. In this clip below from a game against the Warriors, Wallace takes advantage of a late close-out from Podziemski to pump-fake and then shift around the Warriors\u2019 man to reach the rim, finishing through contact.\n\nOn top of all these offensive skills, Wallace holds his own defensively. At 6-foot-4 in shoes with a 6-foot-8.5 wingspan, Wallace can stand up to basically any one or two in the NBA with the mobility to stay in front of them. Watch him pick James Harden\u2019s pocket here and score a transition dunk. Or leaping out for a steal right in front of Victor Wembanyama:\n\nWallace has all the tools to be an All-Star guard: shooting, shiftiness and court vision. Plus, his solid man defense is the cherry on top. He has the benefit of playing for a winning team and learning from current and future All-Stars. Now, it\u2019s time to sit back and watch him do more of it.\n```"}

(Photo by Lyla Bhalla-Ladd)\n\nBy Lyla Bhalla-Ladd March 20, 2024 at 3:54 pm PDT\n\nWhen I arrived at \u201cAt The Edge of the Sun,\u201d knowing it would encapsulate 12 different Angelenos\u2019 stories of Los Angeles, I expected to be unfamiliar with the material. I expected to be unaware of the local parks, small museums, iconic billboards and other community signals. I expected to be the alien among the gallery goers not just because it was my first time at Jeffrey Deitch, but rather because I still feel that I have yet to meet Los Angeles.\n\nTucked away in the 1-mile square radius of South Central, or University Park, it\u2019s challenging for USC students to explore outside our campus grounds and housing sprawl for many reasons. But whatever the deterrent, cost or lack of transportation, avoidance to explore new areas, or even bias against certain neighborhoods, it all summates to a general separation of University and State. Despite USC\u2019s central location, I still feel separate from most of the city. I wonder what this distance is doing to our art.\n\nAt Jeffrey Deitch\u2019s \u201cAt the Edge of the Sun,\u201d this question seems to be answered. The exhibit features the work of 12 local L.A. artists who self-organized a show of their own works all relating to their living and artistic experiences in L.A. Jeffery Deitch, the Los Angeles hub of the famed art dealer, curator and author, is known for its \u201cthematic exhibitions\u201d like this one. These artists have been friends for a decade, and chose to present this exhibition as a collaboration.\n\nAccording to their website, the show highlights \u201cunderground economies, California landscapes, nightlife, local histories, systemic architecture, surveillance, youth culture, public transportation, backyard kickbacks and more.\u201d In the contemporary exhibition, pieces range from a collage stone fountain to a 3-panel acrylic landscape to two life-size billboards to an interactive trailer chapel. Each artist\u2019s installations express themes of local, shared memory, especially since childhood.\n\nIn Michael Alvarez\u2019s landscapes of Hollenbeck Park and El Sereno Park, he depicts specific community events like the Local Rippers Film Festival as well as a combination of intimate, personal, solitary moments in a piece that reflects Alvarez\u2019s many mornings in the skate park. In the same tone, his materials coexist and at times actually overlap. From dried paint flakes from his palette to actual collected trash, the artist interlays discarded scraps of material in displaying his all-too-often overlooked scenes of Angeleno culture.\n\nIn the Hollenbeck Park piece, he utilizes blurring and multi-media layering on his canvas to draw focus on different vignettes of moments within his scenes. One vignette depicts a personal memory of a child carrying a stack of pizza boxes, another commemorates a traditional photo for quinceaneras by the lake. In comparison, in his El Sereno Park piece, Alvarez discussed \u201cdifferent iterations of the skate park\u201d at his exhibition walk-through. This piece depicts a combination of many memories over time rather than the priority of one moment present in the previously mentioned Hollenbeck Park.\n\nIn the far-left panel, a small figure in the background stands out as one of the most significant details of Alvarez\u2019s story. He paints a young boy waiting for school, sticking out from the blended landscape only by his bright blue hoodie. The distinct early morning fog places us all in the time and place, and we recognize this figure somehow. Alvarez conveys a special, intimate story about the connection we share with those whom we share space with, even when our paths don\u2019t cross. This young man may not be aware of his presence in the massive 3-panel landscape, and yet his depiction, the young, skatepark-student in East L.A., likely resonates with the new generation inhabiting the park and keeping these memories alive.\n\nMichael Alvarez\u2019s landscapes of Hollenbeck Park and El Sereno Park showcased a collection of memories. (Photo by Lyla Bhalla-Ladd)\n\nIn Alfonso Gonzalez Jr.\u2018s billboard series, iconic lawyer signage is reimagined as a local cultural symbol of what L.A. has become. In the unmistakable fashion and style of real signs, the billboards feel plucked right out of La Puente and nailed down in the studio. Gonzalez did not attend art school, but rather received his training in commercial sign painting. His medium is obviously mastered from his professional background, but also calls on his experience with graffiti. He refers to his own work as \u201ccontemporary palimpsests\u201d which reflect the social interaction through graffiti tags and fire extinguisher markings that he saw overlay his original commercial ads.\n\nIn Alfonso Gonzalez Jr. 's billboard series, he reflects on the current cultural state of Los Angeles. (Photo by Lyla Bhalla-Ladd)\n\nIn Gonzalez\u2019s L.A., these signs popping out of every corner reflect the more relevant cultural state. \u201cL.A. used to be Hollywood! Now it\u2019s just people suing each other,\u201d Gonzalez said during an exhibition walk-through. His work reflects this shift in the visual L.A. skyline while prioritizing audience interaction and street life in a living piece. What is especially thoughtful in curation and placement is having the two billboards by both Gonzalez and Mario Ayala face each other within the same gallery room, in physical and cultural conversation. Gonzalez\u2019s realism across from Ayala\u2019s cheeky reimagining.\n\nIn Maria Maea\u2019s sculpture, the artist calls on her time in visiting female detention centers and our local relationship to water and housing. In these concepts, she\u2019s constructed an operating mosaic fountain that recycles and filters its own water (one of the key elements of this filtering being a particularly sentimental white t-shirt). Just in front of the fountain, often stepped over by gallery-goers, sits a headless female form covered in cactus-like spikes and thorns and draped in a palm tree leaf cape. She sits with her hand held out for change.\n\nMaria Maea\u2019s sculpture explores the two different \"wishing spaces.\" (Photo by Lyla Bhalla-Ladd)\n\nIn poignant awareness and purpose, Maea declares that they, the two works, are \u201cboth wishing spaces.\u201d She finds people to be more inclined to give a penny to a wishing well than to an unhoused person asking. She depicts these two separately, and yet, they are indeed, the same thing, with different subjects. At one you wish, and at the other, one wishes of you. The headless, prickly woman, unable to gaze at passersby, still receives less in her hand than the sparkling bottom of the mosaic-tiled stone fountain, boasting a fiery female visage atop the spouts.\n\nLeaving Deitch\u2019s \u201c anti-Frieze \u201d showing, I felt the distance from my corner of L.A. and the weight of all the missing parts I had just briefly glimpsed. I passed by an \u201calternative daycare\u201d down the street and decided to walk an extra block around the gallery. When I do get the chance to be in the West Hollywood/Fairfax neighborhood, I am reminded of Los Angeles\u2019 charm and appeal. This is the city with space! Families and young people here live in spacious, residential, central, walkable, urban neighborhoods 30 minutes from the beach. As an East Coast native, these qualities almost never co-exist, and yet after living in L.A. for two years, I am still a stranger to this lifestyle. Down in University Park, it\u2019s not the same.\n\nMy pilgrimage to Jeffrey Deitch took me on a tour of L.A. in and around the gallery. According to these 12 Angelenos, I haven\u2019t met nearly enough of L.A. yet. I am reminded, again, of my ignorance to this sprawling city and all its enclaves. I am reminded, again, of how much there is to learn, and how integral local art is in doing so.\n```"}

Following its  loss to the Stars  on March 9, Los Angeles rebounded against the playoff-hungry New York Islanders, who were then riding high on a six-game winning streak. Thanks to an elite performance from the Kings\u2019 penalty kill, Los Angeles won with ease. Winger Adrian Kempe, who has been on a tear since returning from injury, logged his first goal in nearly a month. Kempe used a hesitation move and then fired a shot from the nearside circle to give LA the lead, which it never surrendered. When it was all said and done, goalie David Rittich shut out the Isles in a 3-0 result.\n\nBoth teams went a combined 0-8 on the power play; the Kings\u2019 penalty kill unit successfully did its job five times. \u201cI thought, actually, our penalty kill got better as the game wore on,\u201d interim head coach Jim Hiller said. \u201cIn the crunch time at the end we were outstanding, we shared the puck, we won big face-offs.\u201d\n\nNext, embarking on a road trip, Los Angeles experienced a near opposite result against the St. Louis Blues. Kempe scored once again but his was the Kings\u2019 only goal of the game. LA surrendered three scores, one in each period and couldn\u2019t convert offensive chances despite outshooting St. Louis 41-30. The Blues won 3-1. \u201cIn order for us to win from now on, we have to play a full 60 minutes,\u201d said defenseman Jordan Spence. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t score today, but at the end of the day, we can learn from this game and forget about it.\u201d\n\nThe Kings certainly did forget about the offensive woes when they headed to Chicago to face the Blackhawks two days later. Blanking Chicago 5-0, six LA skaters tallied multiple points in the blowout. The Kings scored four times in the first period in an electric start to the game, with center An\u017ee Kopitar notching two of them. Center Pierre-Luc Dubois\u2014whose two-point performance began an ongoing three-game point streak\u2014sparked the Kings\u2019 scoring on the power play in his 500th career game. Dubois capitalized on a rebound from Spence\u2019s shot to give LA the early lead and the team never looked back.\n\nSpence also logged his first goal of the season in the victory, becoming the 22nd different King to tally a goal in 2023-24. Netminder Cam Talbot made 28 saves as well. \u201cTwo points in October are the same as two points in March,\u201d said Dubois. \u201cYou can see that race developing ... You want to peak when the playoffs start.\u201d\n\nHowever, Los Angeles couldn\u2019t carry over its momentum against a team that\u2019s given it trouble all season. The Stars completed the regular-season sweep of the Kings in a 4-1 finish. Dallas\u2019 goaltender Scott Wedgewood, who also led the Stars to a 4-1 victory against the Kings last time around, held LA scoreless for the first two periods and only allowed one goal, scored by winger Kevin Fiala in the third period. The first period was ugly for the Kings, as they allowed three even strength goals and couldn\u2019t ever recover. In their three bouts against Dallas, the Kings were outscored 13-3, which is concerning considering Los Angeles could possibly face the Stars in the first round of the playoffs. Rittich struggled between the pipes, despite entering the game with a career-best 2.19 goals-against average. \u201cThey\u2019re a good team. We needed to play a cleaner game, but we didn\u2019t,\u201d Hiller said.\n\nOn the bright side, Los Angeles headed home to face the Blackhawks again, and earned yet another blowout victory, ending 6-2. Even at one goal apiece at first intermission, the Kings scored three times in the second frame. Blueliner Vladislav Gavrikov opened up the period giving LA the go-ahead score. Kopitar, who logged an assist on Gavrikov\u2019s goal, scored the next two for his second three-point game of the season. Talbot made 22 saves, and the win gave the Kings a two-point advantage over Vegas in the Pacific.\n\n\u201cWe knew that they were gonna come out harder,\u201d said Kempe. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play some better teams here at the end of the stretch, and we can\u2019t give a period away.\u201d\n\nIf the season were to end today, the Kings would face the Edmonton Oilers in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the third consecutive year. If this were to be the case, Los Angeles would need to become more consistent to finally break its playoff slump against Edmonton. Right now, LA is struggling to carry over momentum from its wins, which could be detrimental down the line. Looking ahead, the Kings\u2019 next four opponents\u2014the Wild, Lightning, Canucks and Jets\u2014are all pushing towards the postseason. This week will be a critical test for LA, to say the least. The Kings will host Minnesota at Crypto.com Arena on Wednesday at 7 p.m.\n```"}

It has been shaky\u2014to say the least\u2014for Los Angeles since the All-Star break, as the Clippers have just six wins in 14 games post-All-Star weekend. Luckily for the Clippers, their next two games are against the Portland Trail Blazers, who currently hold the 14th seed in the western conference and have been one of the NBA\u2019s worst teams in 2023-24.\n\nHeading into Wednesday night\u2019s matchup against the Blazers, the Clippers have recently lost to the New Orleans Pelicans and the Atlanta Hawks. Losing to New Orleans is nothing to be ashamed of this season, as the Pelicans are now in position to overtake Los Angeles as the West\u2019s fourth seed, just one game back from the Clippers in the loss column. However, the Atlanta loss should disappoint Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue. The Hawks are 10th in the eastern conference and were missing All-Star guard Trae Young, holding just a 4-6 record in their last 10 games.\n\nIf Los Angeles is going to pick up what should be considered two straightforward victories against Portland on Wednesday and Friday, the Clippers need to step it up offensively. This season, the Clippers have averaged 116.5 points per game, but in their two recent losses, they scored an average 98.5 points per game. Expand that to their past five, and the Clippers are just 1-4 and have only been scoring 108 points per game. Luckily for the Clippers, scoring points against the Trailblazers has been easy for many teams this year. Portland ranks just 22nd in defensive rating 116.7. The Blazers, who have just 19 wins on the season, have also dropped four out of their last five games in that span, surrendering 112.8 points per game.\n\nIf the Clippers are going to realign their offense before the postseason, it has to start in this two-game series against Portland. The Clippers will also need to lock in defensively, because despite Portland\u2019s record, the Trailblazers have very capable scorers who can catch fire at any point in time. In his sixth season with Portland, shooting guard Anfernee Simons is averaging 23.2 points per game and 5.6 assists per game. Simons has also played well against the Clippers this year, posting an average 28 points per game in Portland\u2019s two matchups against Los Angeles so far.\n\nLos Angeles will also have to hone in on center DeAndre Ayton, who has been on a tear in his last 10 outings. Ayton has averaged a healthy double-double at 26.8 points and 15 rebounds per game in that span and even though it has not led to much winning, Ayton has shown glimpses of why the Phoenix Suns selected him with the first overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft.\n\nDespite their recent struggles, there are still some things that should have Clippers fans optimistic heading into this series against Portland and for the regular season\u2019s final stretch. Los Angeles still has a top five offensive rating at 118.7 and the league\u2019s third best three-point shooting percentage at 38.7%. Additionally, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George have only missed six games each this season. Health was a big concern for Los Angeles\u2019 older stars heading into the season and the Clippers have been able to keep Leonard, George and James Harden on the court throughout the season.\n\nIf the Clippers can soar into the postseason, it will have to start against Portland. The Clippers\u2019s first matchup against the Trailblazers starts at 7 p.m. Wednesday night, with Friday\u2019s matchup also set for a 7 p.m. tip off.\n```"}

Renowned for their eclectic mix of poetic lyricism, intense emotional expression, and dynamic stage presence, the group has solidified its reputation through impactful performances and a compelling discography. Their work, characterized by a blend of aggression and introspection, reflects the band\u2019s deep roots in the rich cultural milieu of Kunming, a city in the southwest part of China.\n\nIn March, Mayuan Poet is on tour in North America, performing in cities including Austin, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, New York City, and Boston. Mayuan Poet performed live at the Moroccan Lounge in L.A. this past Sunday.\n\nThe Audience\n\nRebecca Zhang, a USC alumna and currently a college advisor living in Los Angeles, shared her excitement about the band\u2019s visit. Zhang, who became acquainted with Mayuan Poet during her graduate studies in L.A., expressed her admiration for their music, particularly their hit song \u201c\u6cf8\u6cbd\u6e56 Lugu Lake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a fan since I first heard \u2018Lugu Lake,\u2019 and learning more about them over time only increased my interest,\u201d Zhang said. Surprised by the band\u2019s decision to tour in the U.S., she added, \u201cI never really expected them to come here since they\u2019re not as mainstream as some other bands, so it\u2019s a pleasant surprise.\u201d Zhang hopes the band enjoys the warm reception from their fans in L.A., a rare stop for them. She also mentioned her intention to introduce Mayuan Poet\u2019s music to her American colleagues, saying, \u201cI often talk about different bands with my coworkers, and I definitely plan to recommend Mayuan Poet to them.\u201d\n\nLiam McConnell, a Kansas native who moved to Los Angeles for a career in manufacturing, also shared his enthusiasm for Mayuan Poet\u2019s recent performance at the Moroccan Lounge. McConnell, who has been a fan of the band for about a year, said, \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed their music, and when I saw they were coming to town, I just had to be here.\u201d An admirer of rock music, McConnell finds Mayuan Poet\u2019s tunes particularly resonant, noting that their songs have helped him through difficult times. \u201cTheir music just makes you happy,\u201d McConnell added.\n\nDespite being one of the few non-Chinese speakers in the audience and attending the concert alone, McConnell\u2019s appreciation for the band\u2019s music transcends language barriers. He expressed a keen interest in recommending Mayuan Poet to his friends, highlighting the universal appeal of their music.\n\nKalinga Lou, an enthusiastic fan, shared her unique experience attending the band\u2019s live performance. Originally from China, Lou has been following the indie music scene closely since her university days in 2018. \u201cI first got into live music with COM\u2019Z \u5eb7\u59c6\u58eb, and it completely changed my perspective. I\u2019ve been chasing live house performances ever since,\u201d Lou recounted.\n\nLou was pleasantly surprised when Mayuan Poet announced their North American tour. \u201cI\u2019ve been leaving comments on every band\u2019s social media, urging them to tour in North America, especially L.A. I can\u2019t believe they actually came!\u201d she exclaimed. However, she noted the challenges foreign bands face, such as visa issues and high costs, which sometimes lead to cancellations or financial losses.\n\nLead singer Ku Guo (\u82e6\u679c)\u2019s reflects on performance\n\nKu Guo (\u82e6\u679c), the lead singer of Mayuan Poet, expressed in an interview with Annenberg Media the various challenges the band faced on tour. \u201cOur team underwent significant changes due to language barriers, and we had to quickly adapt by bringing in temporary staff both from China and locally in the U.S.,\u201d he said, highlighting the logistical hurdles of international touring.\n\nDespite the rocky journey Mayuan Poet has faced, they have resolutely decided to complete this trip, filled with fighting spirit. \u201cPerforming new songs usually takes over half a year to feel completely comfortable with, so this was a significant challenge for us,\u201d he explained. Despite the physical and mental fatigue, Ku Guo found inspiration in the U.S., particularly during a visit to Hollywood\u2019s Walk of Fame.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a place where hard work can turn you into many people\u2019s idol, a culture and soil that encourages achievement in any field,\u201d he remarked, drawing parallels between this realization and the band\u2019s aspirations. Ku Guo also acknowledged the Chinese diaspora in the U.S., expressing solidarity and hope that Mayuan Poet\u2019s music offers comfort and connection to their homeland.\n\n\u201cFor those living far from home, our music is a reminder of their roots, offering strength and solace,\u201d he said, emphasizing the band\u2019s desire to support their compatriots abroad. As Mayuan Poet continues their tour, Ku Guo looks forward to more opportunities to connect with international audiences and share the band\u2019s unique blend of poetry and rock music.\n\nFriends from the East\n\nCheiZak Li (\u674e\u5b8f\u6770), founder of \u201cFriends from the East,\u201d an organization instrumental in coordinating Mayuan Poet\u2019s concert tour in North America, spoke about the initiative\u2019s objectives and challenges. Established in November last year in the United States, the festival and tour series aims to introduce more Eastern musicians to the Western audience.\n\n\u201cOur main goal was to give young people in the North American market the opportunity to experience more music from Eastern artists,\u201d Li explained. The choice of name for the series, \u201cFriends from the East,\u201d was deliberate, reflecting the mission to use music as a bridge of friendship between cultures.\n\nWhile the series primarily featured Chinese bands, Li emphasized its inclusivity, noting the diverse lineup in their recent event in Austin, Texas, which featured artists from Japan, Australia, and the United States, and was hailed as one of the best live performances at the SXSW festival.\n\nLi candidly addressed the financial aspect of bringing artists from East Asia to North America. \u201cThe primary intent of this initiative is not profit. There are many other projects one could pursue that. It\u2019s about the passion for music and bridging cultural gaps,\u201d he said. Despite logistical hurdles like visa procurement and the high costs associated with international tours, Li remains committed to the project.\n\nHe hopes to attract a broader audience, including non-Chinese speakers, as the series evolves to include artists from other Asian countries, enriching the cultural tapestry of North America\u2019s music scene.\n```"}

The Trojans adding UNLV redshirt freshman quarterback transfer Jayden Maiava made headlines in the offseason, considering redshirt sophomore quarterback Miller Moss\u2019s astounding six touchdown performance in the Holiday Bowl.\n\nHead coach Lincoln Riley discussed how the two highly talented quarterbacks will both get reps to see who earns the coveted QB1 spot. \u201cYou got to let these things evolve, we\u2019re gonna rep those two and Jake Jensen, all three of those guys will take every rep here throughout the spring, and we\u2019ll see how it evolves,\u201d Riley said.\n\nRiley also emphasized how excited he is about Maiava transferring in, and how talented the quarterback position is because of it. As a redshirt freshman for the UNLV Rebels, Maiava won Mountain West Freshman of the Year, and threw for 3,085 yards and 17 touchdowns.\n\nAfter the Trojans finished 7-5 in regular season play, Riley spoke about what he learned from this season and how it will help the team going forward. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant climb, every group is unique, every team is unique, this team has a very different dynamic in so many ways,\u201d Riley said. \u201cYou just keep building, you take those experiences, you bank them, you know at times when they come up pre-game, and how you\u2019re going to handle it. I need to do that, our other staff needs to do that, our players need to do that, and that\u2019s how you build.\u201d\n\nFreshman wide receiver Zachariah Branch chose to play both football and run track for the Trojans during the spring; however, he talked about what he plans to focus on football-wise this offseason. \u201cOverall, just get better at my football knowledge, really reading the schemes of defenses,\u201d Branch said. \u201cLast year, I got a good understanding of our scheme on offense, so really just trying to dissect the defense.\u201d\n\nWhile Branch is looking to possibly be the Trojans\u2019 top wide receiver next season, he and his fellow receivers agreed on one thing: their confidence in Miller Moss. Branch spoke of how Moss has grown as a leader, saying, \u201cHis talent has always been there. When I first got here, he had a good arm, great confidence and he could read the schemes of the defense well, but his leadership definitely has grown for the team as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s carried out that [leader] mentality, just realizing that he does what he wants for the team, and putting the team first is what he wants the most,\u201d freshman wide receiver Ja\u2019Kobi Lane said. \u201cMiller is amazing, off and on the field, and I am excited to have him as one of our QB\u2019s,\u201d freshman wide receiver Makai Lemon continued.\n\nLemon and Lane were two of the many players who broke out during the Holiday Bowl, a game where Lemon chalked up a season-best 75 receiving yards, which he said he will remember forever. \u201cIt felt good to be out there with the team, make plays. I\u2019ve always been wanting to do that, so to really come out together and do that, it\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nThe player who shined like no other during the Holiday Bowl, however, was Miller Moss, who discussed the future of Trojan football with him possibly at the helm. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see what the team really looks like when I put my DNA on it,\u201d Moss said. \u201cTrying to grow in that leadership role, learn different things each and every day, talking with Lincoln [Riley] and just trying to lead the team best I can. Excited to see what we become.\u201d\n\nWith 372 passing yards and six touchdowns in the Holiday Bowl, Moss rightfully earned himself the admiration from the team and he is not backing down from any adversity. Whether it will be Moss or Maiava, the commander of the Trojans\u2019 offense has some big shoes to fill for the departing Caleb Williams. Spring practice should give fans a look into what the Trojans have in store for their first year in the Big Ten.\n```"}

But the machine doesn\u2019t sell Sprite, Doritos or Coca-Cola. Instead, as a partnership between USC Pharmacies and Student Health, the newly operating vending machine is stocked with pharmacy items like Tylenol and contraception products. It also sells Narcan \u2014 an emergency life-saving nasal spray that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.\n\nThe vending machine is just one of several new methods at USC meant to address the opioid epidemic. In addition, students have taken matters into their own hands to prevent fentanyl overdose deaths through peer education. One organization doing this is Team Awareness Combating Overdose (TACO) Inc., a non-profit educational organization founded by five USC students after three students died from accidental fentanyl overdoses on campus in 2019.\n\nThe USC chapter of TACO hands out free fentanyl test strips every Tuesday and Friday on campus and Greek Row, redistributes research-backed data on drug use and holds Narcan training sessions.

Fentanyl is about 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nDaryl L. Davies, a professor of clinical pharmacy and the associate dean for undergraduate education at the USC Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, said college party settings \u2014 where fentanyl-laced drugs may be present \u2014 underscore the importance of having Narcan on hand.\n\n\u201cIf a novice comes in, such as someone at college or at Coachella,\u201d Davies said, \u201cand friends are passing some things around, and no one\u2019s even thinking about it. They get hit with this dose of fentanyl \u2014 and whammy. If there\u2019s Narcan, their life might be saved. If not, they\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\nIn case of such situations, Covell said she hopes for the proper use of Narcan, also known as naloxone, to be widely taught. \u201cSomething that people don\u2019t normally know about Narcan is that it\u2019s a temporary fix,\u201d said Covell, a certified Narcan trainer through TACO Inc. Opioids can stay in the body even past the 30 to 90-minute window that Narcan is effective, so seeking emergency medical services afterward is vital, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nIn addition to Narcan being sold in the new pharmacy vending machine, it is also available to students for free through the NaloxoneSC program. The program initially required completion of a quiz on Narcan administration to receive a naloxone kit, but has shifted to an open \u201cfishbowl\u201d distribution for students to freely grab at the Student Health Centers.\n\nA third-year pharmacy student at USC Mann, Shannon De Leon, oversees NaloxoneSC as the president of USC\u2019s chapter of the American Association of Psychiatric Pharmacists. \u201cWe distribute naloxone so that students can willingly walk into the Student Health Centers without the stigma and without the cost,\u201d De Leon said. \u201cWhen one student does it, another student may follow suit, and I think that\u2019s where peer-to-peer education is the most important.\u201d\n\nAccording to Melissa Durham, an associate professor of clinical pharmacy at USC Mann and a clinical pharmacist at the USC Pain Center, the social environment of college campuses makes it a valuable location to spread prevention education. \u201cWhether it\u2019s in the classroom or whether it\u2019s in social clubs or in the Greek system ... really getting that word out on a peer basis, I think, is really effective,\u201d Durham said.\n\nDurham also pointed out that the risk of overdose increases when opioids are combined with other substances commonly present at parties. Harm reduction, one of the key facets of TACO Inc., spreads resources that minimize the negative consequences associated with drug use. Covell emphasized the value of being a peer-to-peer resource that serves as a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d between peers who may promote drug use and parents who may push for complete abstinence.\n\n\u201cWe neither encourage or discourage,\u201d Covell said. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen. So we might as well keep people safe.\u201d```"}

(AP Photo/Martin Meissner)\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie March 19, 2024 at 12:48 pm PDT\n\nEvery time I\u2019ve told someone about the Eurovision Song Contest, I\u2019ve had to explain Israel\u2019s participation. \u201cIt\u2019s a competition between European countries,\u201d they argue. \u201cWhat\u2019s Israel doing there?\u201d Before October, I merely retorted that Australia competes too, a response that avoids a long conversation about the intricacies of the European Broadcasting Union. Since October, Israel\u2019s presence and the ability to explain it away has gotten much trickier, both for Eurovision and me.\n\nSince the Israel-Hamas War began, many have called for Eurovision to exclude the country from the 2024 contest. Russia was banned over its invasion of Ukraine. This, they argue, is not a sufficiently different conflict to justify a different treatment. In December, Eurovision announced Israel would be allowed to compete, citing other international contests that allow Israeli competitors; more crucially, Eurovision cited the Song Contest\u2019s status as a \u201cnon-political event, [which unites] the world through music.\u201d That statement does not cut it.\n\nEurovision cannot continue to pretend to be a safe space where politics do not tread. The rubber of that argument does not meet the road. The decision to ban Russia was the right one and largely uncontroversial. Russia could not compete while attempting to conquer a neighboring country. Even before the ban, Russia and Ukraine did not shy away from politics at the competition.\n\nIn 2015, Russian singer Polina Gagarina nearly won Eurovision with an anti-war song. Two years later, she served as a proxy for Vladimir Putin. Amid Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine, she is once again a Putin proxy. In 2016, two years after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula, Ukrainian singer Jamala won Eurovision. Her song, \u201c1944,\u201d depicted the forced deportation of Crimean Tatars, a minority ethnic group in the region, under Josef Stalin. Leaving proved deadly for many, including one of Jamala\u2019s great-grandmother\u2019s children. When the song was chosen to represent Ukraine, the BBC referred to it as \u201caimed at Russia.\u201d Members of the Russian government complained, but the song was deemed to \u201ccontain no political speech.\u201d\n\nCan a song about such a loaded moment in history with clear through-lines to the present be apolitical? Ukraine\u2019s most recent song, \u201cHeart of Steel,\u201d finished sixth in 2023. It includes the lyrics \u201csometimes you just gotta know when to stick your middle finger up in the air\u201d and a chorus of \u201cDon\u2019t care what you say, Don\u2019t care how you feel, Get out of my way, \u2018Cause I got a heart of steel.\u201d While these lyrics aren\u2019t inherently political, they cannot be removed from the context of fighting off an invasion.\n\nThe competition to represent Ukraine at Eurovision was held 90 meters underground due to safety concerns. That environment is going to result in political songs, and it did. Claiming otherwise removes the context which led to the song\u2019s creation. If anything, that does a disservice to the artists. War isn\u2019t the only issue the countries address. Russia\u2019s entry in 2021 was a feminist song, with a chorus proclaiming \u201cevery Russian woman needs to know: you\u2019re strong enough, you\u2019re gonna break the wall.\u201d Under Putin, Russia\u2019s domestic violence laws have drastically weakened. That oft-occurring lyric, like many others in the song, does not hide the fact that it refers to an ongoing political issue.\n\nA member of Russia\u2019s lower parliament, in response to the song, said it was \u201cnecessary to refuse Russia\u2019s participation as a state in this event.\u201d Russia and Ukraine are also hardly the only countries to submit political entries. In 2023, Switzerland submitted an anti-war song, the Czech Republic submitted a feminist song and Croatia submitted a song which solely existed to make fun of Putin and Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko.\n\nThe 2022 Eurovision featured a flamboyantly gay Israeli entry (many Eurovision countries still do not allow same-sex marriage) and a Latvian entry about how going vegan to fight climate change makes you sexy. Other recent highly political songs have included Italy\u2019s 2017 entry with the lines (in Italian) \u201cthere are no pacifist bombs\u201d and \u201cbecause everything goes beyond your useless wars,\u201d Denmark\u2019s 2018 sea shanty-inspired entry about the benefits of surrender and peaceful negotiations and the 2021 Dutch entry, which included lyrics in Sranan Tongo \u2014 a Surinamese language developed by slaves while Suriname was a Dutch colony. Jeangu Macrooy, the singer, told a Dutch radio station the song\u2019s lyrics were partially inspired by the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020.\n\nIsrael itself won in 1998 with the competition\u2019s first transgender winner, which sparked anger internationally and within Israel. Similar anger erupted in 2014, when Austria\u2019s Conchita Wurst \u2014 a drag queen \u2014 won the competition.\n\nI generally agree with Eurovision\u2019s decisions on who is allowed to compete. In recent years, they have largely landed on the right side of history. Opposing war, advocating for equality and advancing women\u2019s and LGBTQ+ rights are all admirable goals. In today\u2019s world, unfortunately, those goals are far from apolitical.\n\nRussia is not the only country to be banned from Eurovision. Belarus was banned in 2021 for entering a song too laudatory of Lukashenko which some worried would legitimize violent put-downs of protests. Georgia pulled out of the competition in 2009 after their song was deemed too critical of Putin.\n\nIsrael, therefore, would not be in uncharted territory. Israel\u2019s participation has resulted in consternation before. Lebanon intended to join the Eurovision Song Contest in 2005, but pulled out when they were told they would have to broadcast the whole show, including Israel\u2019s song which would likely have fallen afoul of the country\u2019s laws. Jordan was reprimanded in 1979, when the country did not show Israel\u2019s winning entry or the winner\u2019s announcement, later announcing that second-place Belgium won.\n\nEven the scoring is political. Points are awarded, in part, by representatives from competing countries. Those scores often have clear political overtones \u2014 Cyprus and Greece almost always score each other in first place. This is far from a new phenomenon \u2014 a master\u2019s student at Duke University found that \u201cEurovision voting is a meaningful reflection of Europe,\u201d which \u201ccan confirm opinions on intra-regional relations\u201d. Neighboring companies which get along tend to favor each other in the scoring column.\n\nEurovision seems willing to acknowledge and allow some political scoring. It advertises songs about some hot button issues, but not all. It recognizes that participation is itself political. So far, no country has pulled out of the competition in response to Israel\u2019s inclusion. Contestants, however, have not been so silent.\n\nMultiple Finnish hopefuls came out against Israel\u2019s participation, with UMK winner and Finnish entry Windows95Man taking time to decide if competing in Eurovision would compromise his morals because of Israel\u2019s presence. United Kingdom entry Olly Alexander was criticized for signing a letter accusing Israel of genocide and being an apartheid state. Iceland left the door open as to whether or not they will compete before finally deciding to remain in the competition in March. Ireland\u2019s Bambie Thug went on the record to say they do not believe Israel should participate.\n\nAfter the song\u2019s submission, the EBU mandated that Israel\u2019s entry, \u201cOctober Rain,\u201d was too political to compete without changes. The title alone left little doubt as to the subject matter of the song. After initially strongly rejecting the notion that they would alter the song, the country has since accommodated the EBU\u2019s request. The replacement song, \u201cHurricane,\u201d was approved Thursday. The song\u2019s music video was posted by the Eurovision Song Contest YouTube channel. There is now no doubt: Israel will compete.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, this debate was predictable. After the events of October 7, there was no chance the song would be apolitical. Eurovision cannot continue to ride the fence. Now set to include Israel, the EBU must find an explanation, any explanation, which does not hinge on the thin veneer of apolitics.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Marc Nozell.)\n\nBy Kiara Timo March 19, 2024 at 12:41 pm PDT\n\nFeminism ruled the internet the day the 2024 Oscar Nominations came out. The debate focused on the director of \u201cBarbie,\u201d Greta Gerwig, and the lead actress and producer, Margot Robbie, not receiving individual Oscar nominations for their ground-breaking work in creating the highest-grossing film of 2023, the 14th highest grossing film of all time, and the biggest opening weekend in history for a movie directed by a woman. The core question at the heart of the debate? How dare the academy deny the film\u2019s leading feminist representation and the woman who brought feminism to the forefront of a major film production not receive the recognition they\u2019re entitled to? Many who blasted the nominations across social media platforms failed to note the film received eight nominations, including Best Supporting Actress for America Ferrera, a proud Latina actress who played Barbie\u2019s humanity until the real-life doll fully discovers her own. Ads boasted the film\u2019s intention to create an inclusive and intersectional representation of womanhood. The story, however, focused on the journey of a white blonde woman, with Ferrera\u2019s character journey being a subplot meant to help the protagonist, Robbie, grow.\n\nThe outrage wasn\u2019t due to the film not being recognized for its accomplishments. It was due to its leading white woman not being celebrated the way we are accustomed. This response shows this era of modern fourth-wave feminism is failing. The failure to support and acknowledge non-white cisgendered women goes well beyond the entertainment industry.\n\nOn January 20, the Women\u2019s March organization hosted its seventh annual national march in cities across the United States. The turnout was dismal. Many people weren\u2019t even aware it was happening. The women\u2019s march failed in the same way as the\u201d Barbie\u201d movie. Its claims of inclusion and diversity were PR talking points; in reality, the Women\u2019s March from day one centered on the acknowledgement of white women and failed to support individuals who didn\u2019t identify as one.\n\nIn 2017, the Women\u2019s March made national news in outlets like NPR, The Washington Post, BBC, CBS News, The New York Times, Vox and Teen Vogue \u2013 all reporting on women all over the country demonstrating an act of resistance and protesting gender discrimination, bias, and assault as an accused predator took his seat in his new temporary home in the White House. The Women\u2019s March packed a lot of steam behind it as the potential to become the most notable act of resistance on American soil in the 21st century. Ironically, America Ferrera made a passionate speech at the first march, which raised the same sense of awakening and call to action for many listeners in the same way as her monologue in \u201cBarbie.\u201d But like the \u201cBarbie\u201d movie, the march centered around the journey and experiences of white women. Women of color and women who didn\u2019t identify as cisgendered white women were relegated to supporting acts there to assist the palatable \u201cfeminist\u201d through her journey in a patriarchal society.\n\nIn 2017, Sherri Williams wrote about the history of various women\u2019s movements intentionally leaving out Black women from the Suffrage Movement. There isn\u2019t trust between the two groups of women and with good reason. The trust isn\u2019t there and with good reason. The magnitude of the on-going disconnect and lack of support by self-identified feminists is even more alarming considering the decrease in women\u2019s rights since January 2017. Women across the United States have lost access to safe reproductive care through the overturning of Roe vs. Wade. They\u2019ve witnessed an accused rapist get a seat on the Supreme Court, watched funding cut for the United Nations Population Fund and endured losses for family planning programs. In the Trump era, they saw protections revoked against sexual harassment, assault and discrimination at the workplace, and much more.\n\nIf the ongoing neglect or outright dismissal of non-white feminists continues, we all will experience the consequences. Outrage when the \u201cpalatable\u201d feminist does not receive what society conditioned them to expect only hinders real progress. The Financial Times recently reported on widening gender gaps in ideology between men and women and not just in the United States. As women become increasingly liberal, and feminism is often included in the liberal ideology, men have become more conservative. The goal of feminism is to end the patriarchy and turn the world into a more equitable system. Feminists must stand up and show up for other women. Without all of us, there is no movement, and there is no march. We will celebrate when a woman makes a huge accomplishment even if she doesn\u2019t look like the woman you pictured in your head. It means speaking up when a non-white woman is mocked for being on the receiving end of domestic violence even if she doesn\u2019t fit your idea of a \u201cperfect victim.\u201d It also means, on Sunday when we watch this year\u2019s Academy Awards, we won\u2019t sit around and pout about the women we decided were owed a nomination. Instead, we stand up and celebrate the women that are nominated, and the women that will win. And, it means taking a second before you type to think about how your action might be belittling to a woman who doesn\u2019t look like you or sound like you and learn to relate to those individuals, just as we have related to you.\n\nConsumers who are infuriated by Margot Robbie and Great Gerwig\u2019s \u201csnub\u201d have centered their revolution on whiteness. Until they make a change, their \u201cfeminism\u201d will never succeed.\n```"}

(AP/Gregory Bull, File)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner March 19, 2024 at 11:15 am PDT\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After recently adding Jorge Soler and Matt Chapman to their lineup, the Giants acquired powerful bats, but their pitching rotation was still missing some much-needed stardom. On Monday, San Francisco got its guy, signing former Padres ace and two-time Cy Young winner Blake Snell. The 31-year-old elected free agency in November of last year and finally found a new home just a few weeks before the start of the regular season.\n\nSnell was rumored to possibly sign with the New York Yankees, Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels, but contract agreements never came to fruition. Instead, he\u2019ll join a San Francisco team coming off two consecutive mediocre seasons and desperate to find the postseason again. Snell will reunite with skipper Bob Melvin, who was with him in San Diego. The one-time All-Star now joins his third team with eight seasons of MLB service under his belt.\n\nBesides Jordan Montgomery, Snell was the last big-name starting pitcher on the free agency market and a client of agent Scott Boras. A number of Boras\u2019 clients, including Chapman and Cody Bellinger, waited for big deals that just never arrived, and instead settled for shorter-term, less lucrative contracts. The southpaw\u2019s two-year, $62 million agreement was no different. While his deal isn\u2019t typical for one of the top pitching names in the majors, he\u2019ll have an opt-out after the 2024 season, so he might be able to revisit contract negotiations then.\n\nSnell is coming off one of his best seasons in 2023 with a 2.25 ERA and a 14-9 record, the second-best numbers of his career, only trailing his incredible 2018 Cy Young campaign. Adding Snell gives the Giants a bonafide star to go alongside National League Cy Young runner-up Logan Webb.\n\nSnell is fastball-dependent and has elite command to generally avoid giving up home runs; his 0.75 HR/9 is among the best in MLB. His 31.5% strikeout rate was earned by his stout four-pitch arsenal, allowing him to post a strong season on a subpar Padres squad. Snell\u2019s biggest concern is his consistency. In 2019, the year after his 21-win, 1.89 ERA campaign, he regressed to a 4.29 ERA with a 6-8 record. It took him until 2023 to get back to a sub-3 ERA. One of his weaknesses is walking batters, as he did so 99 times to lead the majors last season. He has also struggled with pitching into the later innings.\n\nThe Giants\u2019 offseason acquisitions were already solid before picking up Snell. In addition to Soler and Chapman, San Francisco landed Korean slugger Jung Hoo Lee, heat-throwing Jordan Hicks, former American League Cy Young lefty Robbie Ray and depth backstop Tom Murphy. In the NL West, they\u2019ll have to compete with reigning NL champion Arizona Diamondbacks and the star-studded Los Angeles Dodgers, so these signings are vital in bringing the Giants back to relevance. San Francisco appears to be all-in following multiple offseasons of limited acquisitions. Last season, the Giants\u2019 main addition was outfielder Mitch Haniger, who hardly made an impact for the team in 2023 and was traded back to Seattle earlier this offseason. Montgomery, also a Boras client, is now the top free agent left on the market. In the wake of Snell\u2019s signing, more teams will likely look to bring him aboard before Opening Day on March 28.\n```"}

This time, the star was not in WWE or New Japan, but in AEW. Formerly known as Sasha Banks, the superstar debuted with fresh theme music, but the same charisma fans know and love.

In typical fashion, he was flying off the top rope and moving at crazy speeds, delivering sling blades and superkicks. Then PAC joined in with his own impressive offensive \u2014 a dive outside, 450 splash and devastating suplexes. Once Eddie Kingston came back in, it seemed the Elite were fully targeting and triple-teaming him. Nick Jackson from the Young Bucks kicked Kingston with a low blow, which set him up perfectly for Kazuchika Okada to hit his finisher, the rainmaker, for the Elite victory.\n\nJay White vs. Darby Allin (AEW Big Business, March 13)\n\nWith Darby Allin covered in athletic tape due to a recent match, Jay White targeted Allin\u2019s injuries the entire match. Sinister chops to Allin\u2019s chest and back became White\u2019s MO. Both competitors continuously countered each other\u2019s moves as well. When Allin would gain a bit of momentum, White would just go back to a power move that targeted Allin\u2019s back. Toward the end of the match, Allin attempted a coffin drop on White on the side of the ring apron. Unfortunately, White moved out of the way, and Allin bumped his head and landed outside the ring. He beat the 10 count back inside the ring, but White was ready waiting for him. In the closing moments, White hit his finisher blade runner to defeat Allin. Allin was attacked after the match with a steel chair around his ankle and White hitting it with a baseball bat. It was revealed later on that he suffered a broken foot.\n\nIt\u2019s very exciting to see AEW continue to have amazing matches.

(Photo by Larissa Kirkpatrick)\n\nBy Dylan Luden\nMarch 17, 2024 at 8:41 pm PDT\n\nIn its first Pac-12 series on the road this season, USC baseball was put to the test against Stanford. After winning Friday and losing Saturday, the last conference series between two historic programs came down to Sunday\u2019s rubber match where both teams fought it out for nearly four hours as the Trojans muscled by the Cardinal with a 11-8 victory.\n\n\u201cAnytime you travel in the Pac-12, you\u2019re at Stanford, you\u2019ve gotta be resilient,\u201d head coach Andy Stankiewicz said in an interview with USC Athletics. \u201cWe got down early, kinda kicked and crawled our way back in it.\u201d\n\nUSC was finally able to grab its first lead of the game in a wild eighth inning after tying the game previously in the fourth and seventh frames. Freshman infielder Abbrie Covarrubias doubled to left center field to lead off the inning and set up sophomore outfielder Austin Overn to drop down a bunt to try and move Covarrubias over with no outs. Instead, Overn placed the bunt down perfectly in front of sophomore pitcher Kassius Thomas in order to cause chaos with his top-of-the-scale speed. Thomas\u2019 throw to first was wild, sailing all the way past the first base dugout that allowed Covarrubias to score to give the Trojans a 6-5 lead.\n\nAfter Overn stole his second base of the night and senior infielder Ryan Jackson was hit by a pitch, pinch hitter senior outfielder Carson Wells drove in both runners with a triple down the right field line to make it 8-5. Freshman outfielder Brayden Dowd followed up the triple with one of his own to center field that brought home Wells and gave the Trojans a four-run lead. Dowd went 3-for-3 with an RBI and two walks in his second start of the season, providing a massive spark to the bottom of the order with fellow freshman Covarrubias, who garnered three hits as well.\n\nThe Trojans were able to tack on more insurance runs in the ninth thanks to a two-run home run by sophomore catcher Jacob Galloway to extend the lead to 11-5. Those two runs in the ninth proved to be extremely helpful after Stanford began to start a rally in its half of the inning. Two Cardinal pinch hitters hit home runs, with junior catcher Charlie Saum hitting a solo shot and sophomore infielder Gabe Springer crushing a two-run bomb to cut the Trojan lead down to four.\n\nUSC\u2019s junior pitcher Josh Blum was able to settle in after that, finishing his third inning of work to hold on as he was credited with the win.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been one of our areas we\u2019ve been talking about as a coaching staff, we\u2019ve got to weather some storms in nine-inning games,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cI like the fact that we won in the late innings. We haven\u2019t been as good at that as we need to be moving forward... I\u2019m proud of the resilience the fellas showed today.\u201d\n\nAnother one of those high-leverage situations came early on for USC in the third frame when graduate pitcher Jared Feikes came into the game with the bases loaded and one out. Stanford took an early 3-0 lead after a sacrifice fly off Feikes, but he was able to get the next hitter out and stop the bleeding. Feikes would finish with three innings pitched and a strikeout while only allowing one run off the sac fly.\n\nThe tightly contested matchup featured plenty of amazing plays on both sides of the scorecard with Covarrubias making a fantastic diving catch in foul territory in the bottom of the first. With the shift on a left-handed hitter, Covarrubias was the only player on the left side of the diamond. Starting at shortstop, he sprinted all the way towards the third base dugout and contorted his body to make the sliding catch.\n\nStanford had a defensive gem of its own when sophomore outfielder Cort MacDonald dove head first into left field to rob sophomore infielder Ethan Hedges of a game-breaking hit with the bases loaded and two outs in the seventh inning.\n\nUSC will head back down to Southern California, but won\u2019t play any home games this upcoming week. The Trojans will face Long Beach State at the Dirtbags\u2019 Blair Field on Tuesday, followed by a three-game weekend series against UCLA from Friday to Sunday.\n```"}

On Sunday, USC took another important step in its return to the glory days, obtaining a No. 1 seed in the 2024 NCAA Tournament.\n\nFor their opening-round matchup, the Trojans (26-5) drew No. 16 seed Texas A&M-Corpus Christi (23-8), who earned their first-ever tournament bid by winning the Southland Conference tournament. That game will take place at Galen Center on Saturday, March 23.\n\n\u201cMy body was shocked with chills,\u201d junior center Rayah Marshall said. \u201cWe went from last year from being like an eight or nine seed to our dreams coming true this year being a one seed, hosting at home. We\u2019re grateful for it. This is a moment we worked for. To watch that come alive was real for us.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans learned of their No. 1 seed at a Selection Sunday celebration held at Galen Center surrounded by a sea of Trojan supporters. In attendance were their friends and families, as well as the Spirit of Troy. Several USC women\u2019s basketball alumni were also present \u2014 including Miller, who has been a consistent supporter of the Trojan women this season.\n\n\u201cThe love from our alums is like no other,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cI can\u2019t thank them enough for coming out. It means the world to our program.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s pod also includes eighth-seeded Kansas (19-12) and ninth-seeded Michigan (20-13); those teams will compete for a second-round matchup against the Trojans on Monday, March 25, barring a massive first-round upset by the Islanders.\n\nUSC has never played against Texas A&M-Corpus Christi or Kansas in program history. The Trojans have matched up with Michigan twice before, though, with the schools splitting those nonconference contests back in 2007 and 2008.\n\nElsewhere in USC\u2019s Portland Regional, Ohio State claimed the No. 2 seed. The Trojans already took down the Buckeyes in Las Vegas back in November to kick off the season. Fellow Pac-12 program Arizona \u2014 who USC has already defeated three times this year \u2014 joins Regional 3 as a No. 11 seed.\n\nThird-seeded UConn and fourth-seeded Virginia Tech are also hosting first-weekend games in the same quadrant of the NCAA Tournament bracket.\n\n\u201cBring on whoever we\u2019re playing,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nUSC ended up as the only Pac-12 team to claim a top seed this season. However, UCLA and Stanford are both No. 2 seeds in their respective regions; it\u2019s the first time that the Pac-12 has received three top-two seeds in its history, an appropriate sendoff for the conference, which garnered a total of seven bids to the tournament.\n\nIn total, the Trojans played nine other squads out of the 68 total in the NCAA Tournament field. They went a combined 13-4 in those matchups, with all of the losses coming against fellow Pac-12 squads that earned top-five seeds.\n\n\u201cAll those teams that we played coming into March Madness were great preparation for us,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWe played Arizona then UCLA, then Stanford in the [Pac-12 Tournament] championship game. [They are] all really good teams, really good competitive teams. That sets a great tone for our team going into March Madness.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans are coming off of a successful conference tournament run in Las Vegas, where they were crowned Pac-12 tournament champions after defeating Stanford 74-61 last Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely great momentum to go into March on a winning note,\u201d graduate guard McKenzie Forbes said. \u201cIt feels good to feel like we\u2019re playing our best basketball in March.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s tournament will be Forbes\u2019 second appearance on the national stage. Her first appearance was back in 2019 with the California Bears, when she added seven points in their opening-round win over North Carolina.\n\n\u201c[I\u2019m] just trying to be that mature presence for our team and keep us focused on the main thing, which is winning it one game at a time,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cI think with March, it sometimes can get to be overwhelming [with] a lot of media obviously. But, I think to host helps a lot.\u201d\n\nWith three matchups this weekend, Galen Center is set to host the first NCAA Tournament games in its history. When USC last hosted the first weekend, the team played at Lyon Center across campus.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s basketball has the unique opportunity to host, and we\u2019ve wanted to do that all year long,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cTo get back to this community that\u2019s been incredible to us this year, we\u2019re super happy to be able to stay at home and kick off our NCAA tournament here at Galen.\u201d\n\n\u201cHome games are something we\u2019re grateful for,\u201d Marshall added. \u201cWe embrace it. We\u2019re ready to put on a show for our fans.\u201d\n\nLast season, USC earned a No. 8 seed in the 2023 NCAA Tournament, the program\u2019s first bid to the Big Dance since 2014. The Trojans fell 62-57 in overtime to ninth-seeded South Dakota State.\n\nLooking towards this weekend, the Trojans will look to make a much deeper run this time around.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take anything for granted,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have practice tomorrow as if it\u2019s day one. We know that the celebration kind of stops tonight. We\u2019re happy with what we\u2019ve done, but we have a lot more to do.\u201d\n\nGiven USC\u2019s long drought as NCAA Tournament hosts, expect an electric environment in Galen Center Saturday as Trojan fans look to witness a restoration to those aforementioned glory days.\n\n\u201cThe theme of the year [is] just bringing USC and L.A. back on the map,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cThat means a lot to us, and I hope it means a lot to [Miller] and the people who came before us as well.\u201d\n```"}

He and his band delivered a show full of rock and funky synth to welcome the crowd onto their version of \u201cThe Magic School Bus,\u201d the spoofed graphic used to represent the tour.\n\nEyedress quickly entranced the eager audience in the intimate space of the San Francisco venue. After his opening song \u201cCan I See You Tonight?\u201d, he asked the crowd who was from the area, saying that he loves the city. Many locals raised their hands with an onset of cheers before he moved on to the next song of his set \u201cRomantic Lover.\u201d\n\nAn assortment of fluorescent colors lit up the August Hall stage. The eyes of fans adjusted as the room changed between purple, blue, green and pink for each song. Every hue complemented the song Eyedress performed as smoke steamed off the stage. The pink lights dressed the stage in a relaxed tone during his more soothing songs and the green lights spiked a vibrant energy into the audience for his uptempo songs.\n\nAfter the first two or three songs, he was surprised when he discovered that fans were also watching his show from the balcony area above. \u201cHoly shit, there\u2019s people up there too!\u201d Eyedress exclaimed.\n\nTo go with Eyedress\u2019s mellow vocals was his musical prowess during instrumental breaks. He stepped away from the microphone for solos during certain songs and ripped away on his electric guitar. Eyedress wore his signature shades for most of his show which even stayed on as he zealously rocked and bobbed his head.\n\nConcertgoers matched his energy by also rocking and bobbing with a bit of thrashing. The easygoing songs that Eyedress performed in his set fostered a groovy atmosphere in the venue. The audience was spellbound by the notes that flowed through his guitar. This welcomed fans to actively sway along in appreciation of his alternative music.\n\nThis energy with the same sentiment was doubled and even tripled during his songs that picked up the pace. Eyedress picked up the energy more in his song \u201cSomething About You\u201d and told the audience to sing along if they knew it, poking fun at one of his most popular songs. Phones poked out above the sea of fans as they tried to capture the moment of this fan-favorite track.\n\nThe crowd energetically sang and danced along to the groovy and punky song. Eyedress continued the lively wave of energy by performing \u201cTeen Mom,\u201d dedicated to his mom and childhood in the 90s. His passion for the song seeped through his mic and instrument as he lovingly sang about his family and nostalgic childhood.\n\n\u201cI wrote this next song for my mom,\u201d Eyedress said. The crowd\u2019s pulse remained high when Eyedress played \u201cJealous,\u201d another one of his most well-known songs. Caught up in the music\u2019s extremities, the audience caught a glimpse of his eyes when his shades came off for a moment.\n\nAs a classic concert move, the audience was duped into thinking this was his closer when Eyedress and his band returned backstage after the song\u2019s last note. Fans reacted by chanting and rumbling for more. He ultimately stepped back on stage for his final song.\n\nThe fast-paced synths, drum tempo and guitar riffs resumed as Eyedress ended with \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Be Your Friend.\u201d Several fans rushed near the stage to clash into the fairly-sized mosh pit that formed. He stepped off the stage onto the dance floor which ignited fans around him with excitement. This made way for an organized chaos that Eyedress initiated for this song.\n\nFans jumped around and crowded the musician with some heightened fury when he joined them below. They were passionate about participating in the action shown in how many were drawn to go closer to the stage. Quickly after joining fans on the dance floor, Eyedress returned up to the stage to use as a platform to hop back into them for a crowd surf this time.\n\nTheir passion prevailed as they mightily hoisted Eyedress above their heads during his crowd surf. When the surf subdued at the end of the song, Eyedress thanked his fans for the great show. The crowd departed from the stage still buzzing with excitement and on a new high from the laid back and intensely composed show.\n\nEyedress and his band delivered a memorable performance that gave fans an opportunity to see their favorites played live and leave with a fonder appreciation for his discography as a whole.\n```"}

Gaucher, a two-way forward, is looking to join Mintyukov at the NHL level after spending extensive time at the amateur level. Gaucher currently plays for Anaheim\u2019s American Hockey League affiliate, the San Diego Gulls, where he\u2019s tallied 17 points on six goals and 11 assists through 55 games this season.\n\nCrucially, Gaucher has skated in every single game this season and while his AHL numbers aren\u2019t eye-popping, his physical frame and work ethic look promising. He\u2019s only 20 years old and already has plenty of experience under his belt; he was a four-year veteran of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, played in two World Junior Championships and now as an AHL newcomer, he\u2019s eyeing the NHL as his final destination.\n\nAt 6-foot-3 and 209 pounds, there is no question that Gaucher has an NHL-caliber frame. The Quebec native cemented his status as a first-round pick after his third season with the QMJHL\u2019s Quebec Remparts, when he notched 57 points on 26 assists and a whopping 31 goals with an efficient plus-30 rating. In the 2022 World Juniors, his first as an NHL draftee, Gaucher won gold with Team Canada and headed into his final QMJHL season with some steam.\n\nGaucher truly broke out in the 2022-23 season and further established his winning mentality. He was among the Remparts\u2019 top scorers despite playing in only 44 games, posting 46 points on a plus-35 rating with 22 goals and 24 assists. He helped lead Quebec to a QMJHL championship and a Memorial Cup title with 16 points in 18 playoff games. And in 2023, Gaucher won gold with the Canadian juniors again, this time as an alternate captain.\n\nGaucher\u2019s strong build in conjunction with some of his other polished abilities allow him to be versatile and effective up the middle. Gaucher is undoubtedly a two-way center; he\u2019s not afraid to forecheck and he\u2019ll charge the puck by any means, even if it requires making big hits on opponents to win puck battles. Gaucher is also a fast and powerful skater, and can create offensive chances in a variety of ways, whether it be using his size to screen goaltenders or firing a shot from virtually anywhere in the offensive zone.\n\nWhile his physique made him a dominant presence at the junior level, now in the AHL, it\u2019s a different world for Gaucher. With plenty of time to develop, his biggest test will be translating his previous QMJHL success over to the AHL and eventually, the NHL. While he has plenty of upside, his stickhandling ability could use some work. He sometimes struggles with controlling the puck and his hands don\u2019t look fluid, but rather stiff and choppy.\n\nHowever, Gaucher\u2019s ability to play both wing and center will benefit him from trying out multiple lines and roles with the Gulls before a call-up to the Ducks. Next season, when Anaheim has Trevor Zegras back and healthy, Mason McTavish coming off his best season yet and Leo Carlsson destined for a breakout sophomore campaign, the Ducks will likely have their corps of centers largely figured out. However, as shown this season, injuries can trouble any roster and if prospects like Gaucher can make their mark at the minor-league level, an NHL call-up is always possible.\n\nGaucher\u2019s positional flexibility could also help him reach the NHL sooner rather than later. Gaucher has the potential to be a reliable depth piece for Anaheim\u2019s future core. While he\u2019s had his fair share of peaks and valleys, as a rookie in the AHL, he\u2019ll have time to adjust and climb the ladder with time. The Ducks\u2019 prospect pool is deep, but mainly on the blue line, so Gaucher will have the chance to make noise as a forward if he can play up to NHL standards.\n```"}

In an interview with Annenberg Media and the Daily Trojan, Stott provided an update to students left confused following the March 7 news that USC was shuttering the AAA.\n\n\u201cI have heard from a lot of students obviously and I understand, I\u2019m sympathetic,\u201d Stott said. On the Academic Achievement Award, it will only be available through the academic year 2024-2025 for students who plan to graduate in December 2024, May 2025 or August 2025, he said.\n\nThe AAA is a program that provides a tuition benefit for students to \u201cregister for up to 21 units at the standard full-time tuition rate\u201d given that they meet GPA requirements of 3.75, that they are doing a multiple major or minor degree plan and that all the courses fulfill those major, minor or general elective requirements, according to the internet archive of the old AAA application link which now directs students to a mostly blank page.\n\nIn the same AAA announcement, which landed just two days before spring break, USC said new students would also no longer have access to Exceptional Funding under the Presidential and Trustee Scholarship programs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made a commitment to those students so they will be able to access that fund until the time they graduate,\u201d Stott said Friday about the Exceptional Funding Program.\n\nThe Exceptional Funding program, which is used to fund students who take more than 18 units during the respective fall and spring semesters and/or eight units max for summer is applicable to USC Presidential or Trustee Scholarship recipients with a minimum GPA of 3.0 who have taken at least 30 units the previous academic year.\n\n\u201cNo new incoming students with Presidential or Trustee scholarships will be able to access Exceptional Funding moving forward, but current students who have that as part of their admission letter, they can still access it until they graduate,\u201d Stott said.\n\nAs for the AAA, it won\u2019t be available to students who will not graduate within that time frame, even if they would only need to go over the base 12- to 18-unit semesters during the next fall, spring or summer semester.\n\n\u201cThe extension is for students who are graduating in that period... students with a later graduation date, so December \u201825 and onwards, they are no longer eligible [to receive AAA funding],\u201d Stott said.\n\nThe decisions were made in the Office of Academic Programs and discussed with President Carol Folt and the provost, according to Stott.\n\n\u201cThe academic advising community was obviously informed, but we didn\u2019t discuss it with them in advance,\u201d he said.\n\nStudents should expect advisors to reach out if they are still eligible for the program and if the student has communicated their desire to graduate in the aforementioned time frame.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked [advisors] specifically to reach out to any student who is thinking of graduating in December \u201824, May \u201825 or August \u201825, and utilizing [the] Academic Achievement Award and to reach out to them ASAP and let them know that they\u2019re still eligible to apply,\u201d Stott said.\n\nThe application will open in late May.\n\nStott said USC\u2019s change to the AAA policy is based on the idea that \u201c[students] should still be able to meet multiple academic objectives without the Academic Achievement Award.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it is important to know that given the eligibility criteria, given the fact that you have to maintain a very high GPA [and] given the fact that student plans change frequently, the Academic Achievement Award was never a guarantee,\u201d Stott said.\n\nThe discontinuing of the program, in use for over a decade, was a shock and disappointment to students. USG created a feedback form where students could give testimonies related to the AAA scholarship and Exceptional Funding. Over 350 students and alumni across graduating classes responded.\n\nUSG brought these testimonies to Stott\u2019s attention in their meeting with his office on Friday, according to USG Chief of Staff David Martinez.\n\n\u201c[USG] will be providing more information at the USG Senate meeting Tuesday at 7 p.m.,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nBefore his meeting with USG, Stott reiterated that this change would not affect many students.\n\n\u201cI have responded to every message that I have received or which has gone to the president\u2019s office, the provost\u2019s office or the Board of Trustees,\u201d Stott said. \u201cI can tell you that\u2019s not a large number of emails.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, there does seem to be recognized continued growth of the program according to USC\u2019s 2022-2023 Annual Report for Academic Honors and Fellowships.\n\nThe report bragged, \u201cAAA applications continue to grow annually. This year, 830 undergraduates across a variety of disciplines were awarded more than $3.6 million dollars in tuition credit to support their ambitious academic pursuits.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nBy Tiffany Damon March 15, 2024 at 1:21 pm PDT\n\nJimmy Kimmel reprised his role as the host of the 96th Oscars ceremony, a position he had held three times prior. His thoughts on hosting four times? \u201cWhy would I do this four times? It makes no sense. It\u2019s not even a good round number,\u201d he shared with CNN\u2019s Elizabeth Wagmeister. Even with lighthearted dismay, Kimmel was utterly prepared for Hollywood\u2019s biggest night. In an interview with WFAA, Kimmel revealed that he had been writing jokes for months. His biggest fear? Just that people wouldn\u2019t tune in on time. Kimmel quipped to the crowd of nominees, \u201cThe show is starting an hour early this year, but don\u2019t worry it will still end very, very late.\u201d\n\nWith 19.5 million viewers tuning in, Kimmel can breathe a sigh of relief that millions of people did not miss his monologue nor his jabs at Robert Downey Jr., Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, and others. Kimmel recognized Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s achievement in his nomination as Best Supporting Actor for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d while playfully hinting at the actor\u2019s troubled past, gesturing to his nose that this is \u201cone of the highest\u201d points of the actor\u2019s career which RDJ accepted with a laugh. Noting that Bradley Cooper is rarely at awards shows without his mother, Kimmel also joked, \u201cHow many times can one bring his mom as his date before he is actually dating his mom?\u201d\u2014 a very astute observation that no doubt left Cooper blushing in his seat, right beside his mother.\n\nKimmel also provided the audience with a stunning statistic about Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster\u2019s longevity in the industry\u2014they were both nominated 48 years ago for \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and were both nominated again Sunday night\u2014before stating that Foster is now 20 years too old to be his girlfriend. Robert De Niro nodded his head in agreement, the good old sport that he is.\n\nIf the 2023 Oscars gave us any indication of what could\u2019ve been in store for us this past Sunday night, it\u2019s fair to say that while a parachute entrance onto the stage was out of the question (last year\u2019s crowd-pleaser was a nod to \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d), an equally on-point gimmick must have been in store. Sure enough, while Kimmel did not arrive at the Dolby Theater using a sports car, a speedboat, a rocket ship, a tandem bike, a camper van, and a snowmobile in that order to get to the \u201cstate of Los Angeles\u201d to host the Oscars (a la \u201cBarbie\u201d), we did see a very nearly naked John Cena present the award for Best Costume, successfully eliciting giggles from everyone in the audience. (And what an uncanny resemblance to the Oscars statue behind him!)\n\nOscars night also wouldn\u2019t have been complete without political topics finding their space onstage. Regarding the looming threat of artificial intelligence, Kimmel applauded the efforts made in the SAG-AFTRA and WGA negotiations, praising their progress in protecting their actors and writers from copyright infringement. He assured the audience that \u201cthanks to this historic agreement, actors are now able to go back to worrying about younger, more attractive people replacing them.\u201d Thankfully, the crowd jeered\u2014Kimmel had already played his \u201clet\u2019s get 20 seconds for room tone\u201d card after his Yorgos joke fell somewhat flat. (Kimmel noted that Yorgos Lanthimos and his film editor, Yorgos Mavropsaridis, share the same first name. Given the coincidence of having \u201ctwo Yorgos\u2019 in the house\u201d, Kimmel asked \u201cWill they both win? Yorgos is as good as mine,\u201d a cheesy, cheeky wink-wink.)\n\nAt the conclusion of his monologue, Kimmel aptly expressed that despite how \u201cpretentious and superficial\u201d Hollywood can be, the heart of it is that it\u2019s a union town. He announced that they\u2014presumably SAG-AFTRA and the WGA\u2014would stand with IATSE and all crew/below-the-line worker unions while they begin their own negotiations. Kimmel\u2019s stance was met with a large wave of audience support as tech crew and stage engineers joined him onstage, powerfully displaying a united front of behind-the-scenes individuals who \u201cwear sneakers to the Oscars\u201d and make every production possible.\n\nShockingly, throughout the broadcast, there weren\u2019t any jokes targeting Kimmel\u2019s longtime nemesis, Matt Damon, who was one of the only cast members of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d to not receive a nomination. Thankfully, it is not in typical Kimmel fashion to ignore a chance to make a fool of Damon. The Oscars sophisticatedly ended with a shot of Messi, the dog from the Oscar-nominated film, \u201cAnatomy of a Fall,\u201d taking a leak on Matt Damon\u2019s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Topping us off, the Kimmel-hosted Oscars were concluded in his unapologetic, uncalled-for, yet tastefully on-brand style that has us ready and interested in what he\u2019ll bring to the table if\u2014dare I already suggest\u2014he hosts again next year, for the fifth time.\n```"}

Winners were unveiled earlier this week during  NAACP\u2019s Virtual Awards  ceremony, preceding the live telecast. The awards show is made up of over 90 categories, and the dinner serves as an opportunity for non-televised nominations to receive awards amongst their peers.\n\nSome of Thursday night\u2019s winners included \u201cOrigins\u201d Ava Duvernay, for Outstanding Directing in a Motion Picture, Adrian Holmes for Outstanding Supporting Actor in \u201cBel-Air\u201d, and \u201cThe Sherri Shepherd Show\u201d for Outstanding Host in a Talk / News information (Series or Special).

I\u2019m from Vancouver, Canada, and I\u2019m here with all these beautiful Black people and I\u2019ve watched this show since I was a little boy...

Stick to that; being unwavering and never giving up on yourself is important.\u201d\n\nNAACP Image Award winning comedian, Kevin Fredericks (Kev On Stage) reflected on the joy he felt as a winner for his podcast - \u201cHere\u2019s the Thing\u201d co-hosted with Angel Laketa Moore (That Chick Angel).

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Eniola Adeleke and Nikki Thomas\nMarch 14, 2024 at 10:27 pm PDT\n\nWith its season on the line, No. 9 seed USC men\u2019s basketball battled hard for a win against No. 1-seeded Arizona in the Pac-12 tournament quarterfinals. Despite its efforts, USC came up short to the Wildcats 70-49 before a sea of Arizona fans at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n\nThe two teams met again Thursday in a rematch of last Saturday\u2019s game, when USC handed the 2023-24 Pac-12 regular season champions an unexpected loss at Galen Center, 78-65. This time, the two squads faced off on a much bigger stage with much bigger stakes \u2013 the Pac-12 quarterfinals.\n\nBoth squads raced to a hot start in Vegas, each team fighting to establish their offense early. Arizona senior forward Keshad Johnson opened the scoring with a jumper off a USC turnover. Graduate forward DJ Rodman responded for the Trojans on the next possession, driving to the basket for two.\n\nThe synergy of fast-paced play and exhilarated fans electrified the arena environment. The traveling Wildcat pack chanted \u201cU of A,\u201d to which the small number of Trojan fans in attendance responded with some noise of their own.\n\nThe Trojans kept the game close early on, staying within four points of the Wildcats for the first five minutes of the game. Star fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis, freshman guard Isaiah Collier and Rodman each had early steals, while redshirt senior forward Joshua Morgan had a block of his own, preventing Arizona from taking control of the game and establishing a rhythm.\n\nAlthough the Wildcats have averaged 42.5 points in the first half this season, the Trojans held them to just 28 first-half points. \u201cFirst half, our defense was outstanding,\u201d USC head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201c[We] really made it tough on Arizona.\u201d\n\nBe that as it may, USC\u2019s offense couldn\u2019t capitalize on its defensive success. The Trojans failed to score for the final 5:49 of the first period. \u201cA lot of those shots that went in last Saturday just didn\u2019t fall for us today,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when your leading scorers, especially Boogie, had a tough shooting night. We just didn\u2019t convert when we had open looks.\u201d\n\nEllis had just six points in the first half and was 2-for-10 from the field. He did not score for the remainder of the game and fouled out with 7:25 to play in likely the final game of his college career.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 lackluster offense allowed Arizona to find some comfort offensively and create separation going into the half \u2014 the Wildcats led 28-16 after 20 minutes. \u201cWe were able to get stops, stops, stops and then kind of made a little run at the end of the first half to get a little separation,\u201d Arizona head coach Tommy Lloyd said.\n\nThe Trojans came out swinging in the second half but were burdened by foul trouble early. Overall, the Wildcats had 18 appearances at the free-throw line to USC\u2019s six. On the other end, missed free throws and turnovers prevented USC from closing the scoring gap, while Arizona\u2019s offense started finding more consistent routes to the basket.\n\nEven when shots started to fall for the Trojans, their defense just couldn\u2019t stop the bleeding. Freshman guard KJ Lewis led the Wildcat charge with 15 points and six rebounds. For the Trojans, junior guard Kobe Johnson contributed a team-high 14 points and eight rebounds.\n\nWhen the Trojans faced the Wildcats just five days ago, they limited Arizona star senior guard Caleb Love to a mere two points. The USC defense on display today was less effective against Love, allowing him to score 11. The opposite could be said of Arizona\u2019s defense, which held Rodman to just six points in this quarterfinal matchup. Rodman scored a season-high 19 points against the Wildcats on Saturday.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to think this is crazy, we didn\u2019t do one thing differently,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cWe just did it better. That\u2019s what it came down to. We just did it better.\u201d\n\nArizona has never lost back-to-back games in its three seasons under Lloyd\u2019s leadership. The result of Thursday\u2019s quarterfinal game put an end to a tumultuous, injury-riddled season for USC, barring a bid to the NIT or CBI tournaments.\n\nReflecting on the season as a whole, Enfield expressed pride in the resilience of his players, who missed a combined 58 games throughout the season due to injury. \u201cThis team has improved dramatically from the beginning of the season, especially with guys in and out of the lineup all season,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for them to stick together and really compete the last month, they\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d\n\nRodman echoed his coach\u2019s sentiments about the team\u2019s health this season, noting, \u201cThe most frustrating part is just not being healthy the majority of this season. Not necessarily not winning, because if we\u2019re healthy, we win.\u201d\n\nWith this win, Arizona advances to the semifinals and will play the No. 4-seeded Oregon Ducks tomorrow at 5 p.m.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/14/the-silver-shield-vol-15-lone-ranger-rempe/", "response": "```\nColumn The Silver Shield, Vol. 15: Lone Ranger Rempe\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner March 14, 2024 at 5:51 pm PDT\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d is a column by Kasey Kazliner about the National Hockey League.\n\nAn ambitious, scrappy rookie Connor Bedard and Brock Faber might be the headlining newcomers in the NHL this season, but a recent sensation has arisen in New York: Rangers forward Matt Rempe. In 10 games played, Rempe has two points, a goal and an assist, on an average of about five and a half minutes of ice time. While these stats aren\u2019t very impressive, the young forward brings a retro style of hockey to a star-studded Rangers team \u2014 an intense desire to fight.\n\nRempe\u2019s NHL debut wasn\u2019t conventional by any means. He was called up from the American Hockey League just a few days before the Blueshirts\u2019 Stadium Series bout with the rival New York Islanders, an outdoor match at MetLife Stadium in front of nearly 80,000 fans. On his first shift, 21-year-old Rempe fought 34-year-old Isles winger Matt Martin, providing a preview of Rempe\u2019s passion to drop the gloves.\n\nBefore he was called up, Rempe spent time with the AHL\u2019s Hartford Wolf Pack and posted just 12 points in 43 games this season. However, his 96 penalty minutes stood out on his statsheet. New York called him up in place of the injured Blake Wheeler, and he\u2019s been a fan favorite ever since.\n\nNot only is his game unique, but so is his physique; a lanky 6-foot-7 and 241 pounds, plus two black eyes. If 96 penalty minutes in 43 AHL games seemed outrageous, try 54 in just 10 NHL games. Rempe racked up 17 sin bin minutes in just 13 seconds of action in his third career game against the New Jersey Devils, as he laid down a big hit on forward Nathan Bastain, then proceeded to fight blueliner Jonas Siegenthaler.\n\nRempe tallied five more penalty minutes against the Philadelphia Flyers the very next game, when he scored his first NHL goal while screening netminder Samuel Ersson. This was the game-winning goal in the Rangers\u2019 narrow 2-1 victory.\n\nRempe and Siegenthaler\u2019s tension extended beyond the February 22 matchup, however. On March 11, Rempe elbowed Siegenthaler in the head in a neutral-zone play. Rempe received a five-minute major plus a misconduct and was ejected from the game toward the end of the second period, while Siegenthaler left the game to be evaluated.\n\nThe elbow check led to a four-game suspension enforced by the NHL Department of Player Safety on March 12. The absence will cost Rempe around $17,000, and he\u2019ll miss some crucial divisional matchups, too.\n\nWhether or not you\u2019re a fan of the Calgary native, his grit and scrappiness is second to none. His total ice time (56:28) and penalty minutes (54) are nearly equal in length, but on a stout New York squad destined for a deep run, his ability to physically stick up for his teammates as a rookie is unique and respectable.\n\nRempe still has a lot to learn. The hit on Siegenthaler is an example of something he\u2019ll need to avoid if he wants to have a successful career without frequent suspensions. With his pro play just beginning, the novelty of his game is striking, but he\u2019ll need points to back it up.\n\nOne-hit wonders come and go all the time in New York City; just ask Giants quarterback Tommy DeVito or former Knicks guard Jeremy Lin. But, once Rempe gets back from his suspension \u2014 if he can post valuable minutes on the fourth line \u2014 maybe head coach Peter Laviolette will take notice, move him up in the lineup and give him a real chance.\n\nAtlanta, take three? Salt Lake City and Houston have recently put their names in the running to host future NHL franchises, whether it be through relocation or expansion. But, recently, another city has flirted with the idea; enter Atlanta.\n\nThe Alpharetta Sports & Entertainment Group, led by former NHL journeyman Anson Carter, formally requested the expansion process to begin in Atlanta. The ATL has seen two previous NHL teams come and go north. The Flames, who now play in Calgary, resided in Atlanta from 1972-80. Attendance issues sparked the team\u2019s eventual move, leaving the city without a team for close to two decades, until the Thrashers were born in 1999.\n\nDwindling fan interest and a poor on-ice product, including zero playoff wins in 11 seasons didn\u2019t give Atlanta residents many reasons to see games, so the team was eventually sold and relocated to Winnipeg, becoming the Jets. The Thrashers played at then-Phillips Arena, also home to the NBA\u2019s Hawks. Combine heavy road traffic during game days and a losing team, and you have low attendance numbers.\n\nCarter hopes to combat this issue by building a new arena in Alpharetta, 30 minutes away from the Thrashers\u2019 former home. But, why give Atlanta a chance again? It\u2019s a valid question \u2014 losing two franchises in the same sport is alarming. However, Carter has a vision to build a more accessible arena in conjunction with putting a winning product on the ice to appease hockey fans in the area.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning and Carolina Hurricanes play somewhat nearby, but Atlanta, a city with a team in every other major sports league, feels deserving of another chance. Atlanta has also changed significantly since the dawn of the Thrashers, from demographics to business interests. Atlanta is home to the ECHL\u2019s Gladiators, who have yielded about 4,000 fans per game this season.\n\nThe NHL appears to be content at 32 teams, but if expansion were to come in the future, Atlanta will aim to bring the sport back for the third time.\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

Current Associate Vice President and Title IX Coordinator, Linda Hoos, Spear\u2019s number two, will be taking over as the new EEOTIX vice president.\n\n\u201cThese are capstone opportunities for these two amazing women,\u201d said Felicia A. Washington, the Senior Vice President of Human Resources at USC, in an interview with Annenberg Media.\n\nThe UCOP manages the 10 campuses, five medical centers and three affiliated national laboratories within the UC system. The Inaugural Office of Civil Rights will combine the existing Systemwide Title IX Office, a new Systemwide Anti-Discrimination Office, and a new Systemwide Disability Rights Office, all to be housed under the leadership of Catherine Spear.\n\n\u201cHiring Catherine is one of a series of steps we are taking to provide centralized oversight for these campus functions and a more consistent approach to how the University responds to allegations of discrimination and harassment,\u201d said UC President Michael V. Drake in a statement to the UC community.\n\nSpear was recruited to USC in August of 2020 after her time at Stanford and UVA, where she held similar roles coordinating Title IX and equity. Over Spear\u2019s tenure, the Office of EEOTIX has expanded and restructured to prioritize victim care and cross-campus collaboration for incident resolution. Under her leadership EEOTIX has launched their Intake, Outreach, and Support Team, including \u201cDedicated Care Managers\u2019' who handle initial reports and provide care as well as academic or workplace accommodations.\n\nShe has also spearheaded the Initial Assessment Triage Team (IATT), which invokes the collaboration of multiple campus partners to recognize the multi-faceted needs of students and other USC community members.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that we likely have the most comprehensive approach to this [EEOTIX] work at USC,\u201d said Washington.\n\nWashington recruited Spear and Hoos and will now oversee the transition as Spear prepares to exit her post.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply grateful to Catherine for her impact in helping to transform USC\u2019s efforts to foster a community free from discrimination and harassment,\u201d wrote Washington in a letter to the Trojan Community Thursday.\n\nDuring her time at USC, Spear\u2019s office fielded the fallout of the Varsity Blues scandal, the George Tyndall lawsuit years and the Sigma Nu sexual assault allegations. Spear was no stranger to these national limelight EEOTIX cases, after leaving Stanford\u2019s Title IX Office following the Brock Turner rape case, a sexual harassment investigation at Sigma Alpha Epsilon and the travel ban on the Stanford marching band.\n\nMore recently their office has faced multiple complaints regarding heightened tensions due to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAccording to Spear, the greatest lesson she learned from conducting investigations over her career has been to maintain \u201ccontinuous improvement mode.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work is hard. You need to be mindful of the feedback that you\u2019re receiving in real time and look at the areas where you have discretion to implement policy or staffing or structures in a way that tries to be human focused,\u201d she said.\n\nMore logistically, Spear said the most effective change she has seen and made has been in separating and clarifying the roles of different players within EEOTIX, such as investigators, care managers, and resolution teams, a structure she took from her time at UVA.\n\nIn clearly defining roles, Spear said the office can operate smoothly and more effectively for victims and those who need resources.\n\nHoos said her priorities for stepping into this role are to continue building trust with students through the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) and other student groups as well as collaborating with Student Health on the Student Well-being Index Survey (SWIS).\n\nAnother area of improvement is the timeliness of investigations and resolution implementation.\n\nOne of the most eagerly anticipated items on the EEOTIX docket, according to Hoos, is the forthcoming announcement and implementation of the Biden Administration\u2019s Title IX Regulation. Initially slated for release last May, this regulation has faced delays but is expected to be issued this summer.\n\n\u201cWe will absolutely be jumping on the regulation as soon as it is issued so that we can fully understand it and make sure that we\u2019re implementing it correctly,\u201d Hoos said. \u201cWe can continue being an office that promotes care, and responsiveness.\u201d```"}

Although Washington shot almost 70% from three in the first half, USC escaped with a 80-74 victory to extend its season-high win streak to four games and advance to the tournament quarterfinals.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough game,\u201d USC head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cI give our players a lot of credit. They battled the entire second half when they were down numerous times and found a way to win. So, [I\u2019m] very proud of our team and we\u2019ll move on.\u201d\n\nThe two squads met during the regular season just 11 days ago, where the underdog Trojans stole a 82-75 victory on the Huskies\u2019 home floor. Thanks to Washington\u2019s early sharpshooting, the Trojans struggled to find their footing in the first half Wednesday. In the first 4:11 of play, Washington converted four of their five 3-point attempts.\n\n\u201cOur first half was probably one of the best first halves that we\u2019ve played this season offensively,\u201d said Huskies\u2019 head coach Mike Hopkins. We shared the ball, moved the ball, making nine 3s. That was pretty big.\u201d\n\nAnd big it was. Graduate forward Moses Wood sealed the Huskies\u2019 first half offensive masterpiece with a buzzer beater from just beyond the arc to quench USC\u2019s attempt at a comeback and put the Huskies up 42-37 going into halftime.\n\nDespite Washington\u2019s electric shooting, USC had sporadic bursts of momentum led by sophomore forward Vincent Iwuchukwu\u2019s aggressiveness in the paint and lockdown defense from freshman guard Bronny James and junior guard Kobe Johnson. James\u2019 and Johnson\u2019s combined nine first-half rebounds and Johnson\u2019s three steals were instrumental in helping the Trojans close gaps and take the lead.\n\nYet each time the Trojans attempted to climb into the driver\u2019s seat and take control of this must-win game, they were rejected by a frenzy of Washington triples. USC\u2019s largest first-half lead was just four points.\n\nEnfield\u2019s squad came out swinging in the second half, as an 8-2 run propelled the Trojans to a 45-44 lead. But it would prove to be a game of runs, with neither team able to generate consistent offense. The Trojans\u2019 shooting woes continued, especially from deep. For most of the half, it seemed as if USC wouldn\u2019t be able to capitalize on Washington\u2019s scoreless stretches.\n\nBut USC\u2019s offense heated up eventually. A dunk from redshirt senior forward Joshua Morgan handed the Trojans a 61-59 lead with 6:24 left to play, and the slam seemed to shift their momentum. The two teams battled and tied at 65 points apiece, but USC started to create separation soon after.\n\nThree clutch free throws from James helped to turn the tide; USC had only shot 7-for-12 from the stripe until that point. A defensive stop on the other end led to a 3-pointer from fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis, and suddenly the Trojans were up six. And though they\u2019d struggled with free throws all game, USC went 8-for-9 from the line in the final 3:30 to help secure the victory.\n\n\u201cBronny did a great job with making five straight free throws,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cAnd [freshman guard Isaiah Collier] made two big free throws with about a minute and a half.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the Trojan offense that picked up: the team locked into a defensive rhythm in the second half, holding the Huskies to 35% shooting from the floor and just 18% from beyond the arc. USC also found ways to limit the Pac-12\u2032s leading scorer, Keion Brooks Jr. The graduate forward, who averages 21.3 points per game for Washington, notched only 13 points in the loss.\n\nThe late-game push was spearheaded by Ellis, who scored 15 of his game-high 25 points in the second half. But in some ways, USC\u2019s victory was symbolic, representing what the team could have looked like without so many regular season injuries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of our guys,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThis is a much better basketball team than we started the season [with]. They\u2019ve improved dramatically on both sides of the ball.\u201d\n\nWhile USC is certainly beginning to see better days, it cannot afford a sluggish start in its next matchup against the No. 1 seed Arizona Wildcats if the Trojans have any hope of making a deep run in this tournament and following in the footsteps of USC women\u2019s basketball, who won its own Pac-12 tournament this past weekend in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cTomorrow, we can\u2019t come out like that. We\u2019ve got to come out with a lot more energy,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nThe Trojans will face off against the Wildcats at T-Mobile Arena in the Pac-12 quarterfinals on Thursday at noon.\n```"}

(AP/Amanda Loman)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner and Sullivan Maley\nMarch 12, 2024 at 8:20 pm PDT\n\nThe Talk of Troy\u2019s 2024 Pro Day tour kicked off Tuesday in Eugene at the University of Oregon. TOT\u2019s Ben Papp, Kasey Kazliner and Sullivan Maley analyzed all of the event\u2019s drills. All measurables and times are courtesy of University of Oregon Athletics.\n\nEUGENE, Ore. \u2014 Highly touted draft prospects Bo Nix, Troy Franklin and Bucky Irving headlined the Ducks\u2019 2024 Pro Day events at the University of Oregon\u2019s Moshofsky Center on Tuesday, but 12 other players also participated in the events to show NFL teams what they\u2019re made of. It was a jam-packed morning consisting of vertical and broad jump tests, 40-yard dashes, shuttle drills and more.\n\nProspects Popo Aumavae, Mase Funa, Jamal Hill, Steven Jones, Camden Lewis, Casey Rogers, Steve Stephens IV and Sam Taimani weren\u2019t invited to the Combine, but had a chance to showcase their skills to NFL teams for the first time. Hill (linebacker) and Lewis (placekicker) especially caught the attention of scouts in attendance with standout performances to surely aid their draft stock come April.\n\nOregon linebacker Jamal Hill impressed with a 4.41-second forty-yard dash and solid field drills. (AP/Amanda Loman)\n\nJamal Hill took advantage of his moment in front of the scouts, running an impressive 4.41-second 40-yard dash, faster than any linebacker that participated in the Combine. He also recorded an impressive broad jump at 10-foot-1, and showed good footwork and coverage skills in field drills. The highlight of his drills came on an impressive high point catch during a flat coverage drill that surely left NFL teams impressed with his potential to play either outside linebacker or safety.\n\nLewis went 10-for-10 on an ambitious lineup of kicks ranging in distance from 33 to 60 yards. While a few of Lewis\u2019 kicks brushed the posts, they were mostly accurate with many sailing far over the crossbar, suggesting his ability to hit from even further. Lewis certainly benefited from a strong Pro Day after a shaky season that included a crucial miss against Washington from 43 yards that kept the game from entering overtime, handing the Ducks their first loss of the season.\n\nNix had a chance to practice with some of his other offensive weapons for the final time, including Terrance Ferguson and Tez Johnson. He also connected with fellow draft prospects Franklin and Irving on numerous passes. His throwing script consisted of short game, deep balls, play-action and off-platform throws. Nix threw from a number of drops and rollouts, and the drill occasionally included simulated pressure. Nix\u2019s throws were mostly accurate with some struggles on out-breaking routes. His deep balls were more impressive than in Indianapolis, including a beautiful wheel route to Irving that displayed elite touch and timing.\n\nFranklin, who struggled at the NFL Combine, needed a stellar Pro Day to further cement his spot in the first round given the stacked class of receivers. While he showed flashes of his speed on deep balls and some clean short game work, his overall performance wasn\u2019t striking or consistent enough to silence the questions raised by his performance in Indianapolis. Franklin ran a 4.41-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine, the 10th fastest among participating receivers. The time placed him behind prospects like Xavier Legette, Anthony Gould and Brian Thomas Jr., a lackluster mark for a receiver whose main upside is said to be athleticism.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had to put that much work into the 40,\u201d said Franklin.\n\nFranklin\u2019s gauntlet drill was widely regarded as one of the worst at the NFL Combine, veering multiple steps off his line on most catches. He was especially outshined by other receivers like Xavier Worthy, Ladd McConkey and Brian Thomas Jr. who raised their stock with impressive Combine performances.\n\nOregon wide receiver Troy Franklin catches a pass from quarterback Bo Nix (AP/Amanda Loman)\n\nUndersized at 183 lbs, NFL teams would expect him to display strong route-running to justify using a first-round pick on him. Franklin\u2019s routes on Tuesday, while solid, didn\u2019t display the elite fluidity and crisp cuts likely necessary to fully recover his definite first-round pick status.\n\nFull Pro Day Results (alphabetical order)\n\n(^) NFL Combine invitee\n(*) NFL Combine measurement\nDNP = did not participate\n\nDL Popo Aumavae\u20146\u20323 1\u20442\u2014296 lbs\n10 1\u20448\u201d Hand, 32 7\u20448\u201d Arm, 77 5\u20448\u201d Wingspan\n40-yard dash: 5.16\nVertical: 29 1\u20442\nBroad: 9-foot\nThree-cone drill: 8.03\nBench press: 17 reps\n\nDL Brandon Dorlus^\u20146\u20323\u2014286 lbs\n9 1\u20442\u201d Hand, 32 7\u20448\u201d Arm, 79 3\u20444\u201d Wingspan\nDid not participate in measurable drills.\n\nWR Troy Franklin^\u20146\u20322 1\u20442\u2014183 lbs\n8 5\u20448\u201d Hand, 31 3\u20444\u201d Arm, 77 1\u20442\u201d Wingspan\nDid not participate in measurable drills.\n\nEDGE Mase Funa\u20146\u20322 1\u20448\u2014254 lbs\n10\u2032\u2032 Hand, 32 3\u20448\u201d Arm, 77 1\u20444\u201d Wingspan\n40-yard dash: 4.88\nVertical: 30\nBroad: 9-foot-2\nThree-cone drill: 7.57\nBench press: 18 reps\n\nLB/SAF Jamal Hill\u20146\u20320\u2014216 lbs\n8 3\u20444\u201d Hand, 32 3\u20448\u201d Arm, 78 3\u20444\u201d Wingspan\n40-yard dash: 4.41\nVertical: 33\nBroad: 10-foot-1\nThree-cone drill: 7.16\nBench press: 17 reps\n\nRB Bucky Irving^\u20145\u20329 1\u20444\u2014195 lbs\n9 5\u20448\u201d Hand, 29 1\u20442\u201d Arm, 69 3\u20448\u201d Wingspan\n40-yard dash: DNP\nVertical: 31 1\u20442\nBroad: DNP\nThree-cone drill: DNP\nBench press: 15 reps\n\nCB Khyree Jackson^\u20146\u20323 7\u20448\u2014203 lbs\n9 1\u20448\u201d Hand, 32 3\u20444\u201d Arm, 77 3\u20448\u201d Wingspan\n40-yard dash: DNP\nVertical: 32.5\nBroad: DNP\nThree-cone drill: DNP\nBench press: 11 reps\n\nOL Steven Jones\u20146\u20325 1\u20444\u2014342 lbs\n10 3\u20444\u201d Hand, 34 5\u20448\u201d Arm, 84 1\u20448\u201d Wingspan\n40-yard dash: 5.43\nVertical: 21\nBroad: 7-foot-9\nThree-cone drill: DNP\nBench press: 23 reps\n\nPK Camden Lewis\u20145\u203211 1\u20442\u2014206 lbs.\n8 3\u20444\u201d Hand, 28 5\u20448\u201d Arm, 69 3\u20444\u201d Wingspan\nDid not participate in measurable drills.\n\nQB Bo Nix^\u20146\u20322 1\u20448*\u2014 217 lbs.\n10 1\u20448\u201d* Hand, 30 7\u20448\u201d* Arm, 74 1\u20444\u201d* Wingspan\nDid not participate in measurable drills.\n\nOL Jackson Powers-Johnson^\u20146\u20323 1\u20444\u2014326 lbs.\n9 3\u20444\u201d Hand, 32 5\u20448\u201d Arm, 78 5\u20448\u201d Wingspan\nDid not participate in measurable drills.\n\nDL Casey Rogers\u20146\u20324 3\u20448\u2014294 lbs.\n9\u2032\u2032 Hand, 32\u2032\u2032 Arm, 78 1\u20442\u201d Wingspan\n40-yard dash: 4.82\nVertical: 35\nBroad: 9-foot-8\nThree-cone drill: 7.45\nBench press: 27 reps\n\nSAF Steve Stephens IV\u20145\u203211 7\u20448\u2014194 lbs\n10 1\u20448\u201d Hand, 31\u2032\u2032 Arm, 75\u2032\u2032 Wingspan\n40-yard dash: 4.59\nVertical: 36\nBroad: 9-foot-10\nThree-cone drill: 7.21\nBench press: 12 reps\n\nDL Sam Taimani\u20146\u20321 1\u20442\u2014309 lbs\n10 3\u20444\u201d Hand, 31 7\u20448\u201d Arm, 77 1\u20442\u201d Wingspan\n40-yard dash: 5.33\nVertical: 25\nBroad: 8-foot-6\nThree-cone drill: 7.95\nBench press: 19 reps\n\nSAF Evan Williams^\u20145\u203211 3\u20444\u2014206 lbs\n9 7\u20448\u201d Hand, 30\u2032\u2032 Arm, 73 3\u20444\u201d Wingspan\n40-yard dash: 4.56\nVertical: DNP\nBroad: DNP\nThree-cone drill: 7.10\nBench press: 18 reps\n```"}

The film fest aims to bring students and alumni together to highlight Asian cinema and filmmakers from USC. Proceeds of the event went to the Jon M. Chu APAA Cinematic Arts Scholarship Fund for undergraduate students committed to telling Asian and Pacific Islander (API) stories on-screen. The afternoon\u2019s screening included 10 short films, chosen out of 38 submissions. The fest highlights films produced, written, directed, and/or starring API Trojans or addresses topics of interest to the API community.\n\nTrojan filmmakers who participated in the 7th Annual Asian Pacific Film Festival (Photo by Mika Panahon)\n\nActor Derek Mio hosted the event and fellow Trojans APAA president Mary Tee and APCA Festival Committee Leaders Allie Merchant and Jazmyne Aquino joined him in sharing opening remarks. Actor Justin Chien also joined via video message just before the main event. Prior to the screening, the audience was treated to a conversation moderated by incoming APAA president Sky Kogachi with the fest\u2019s honorary jury, Wenda Fong and Kevin Tsujihara. Both noted that they did not major in anything entertainment-related during their time at USC, but encouraged students to pursue and innovate the industry. Tsujihara, former Warner Bros. CEO, urged API students to break the cultural stereotype of demurity and speak their voice. Fong, a veteran TV producer, echoed the sentiment and added that ambition can carry students to places they\u2019ve dreamed of: \u201cYou just need to be the best you.\u201d\n\nSky Kogachi '95 moderated a conversation with honorary jury members Wenda Fong '75 and Kevin Tsujihara '86 before the screening.

Alumna Boncato serves as the director and animator of this piece, as well as the song\u2019s producer in collaboration with Daniel Oldham, a fellow Trojan. The music video presents a dark background covered in gritty sunbaked ink with soap textures that resemble Filipino whitening soap, often used to bleach and lighten skin. The lyrics hold a life of its own, even incorporating Tagalog in a verse, and encourage listeners - and Boncato\u2019s fellow Filipino community- to embrace brown skin.\n\n\u201cMother\u2019s Love\u201d\n\n\"Mother's Love\" (Photo courtesy of APFF)\n\nJackson Van Horn, a current Film and TV Production student, tugs at the heartstrings with \u201cMother\u2019s Love,\u201d as he writes and directs this ode to mothers and their unconditional love. With the backdrop of a young son struggling with addiction, the film comes to life with moving performances by leads Patricia Burgos & Colin Munsell. Van Horn said of \u201cMother\u2019s Love,\u201d \u201cEveryone in this room either knows someone who\u2019s dealt with mental health issues and addiction or have been through it themselves, so this is really for the people who are there and support you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSound in Motion\u201d\n\n\"Sound in Motion\" (Photo courtesy of APFF)\n\nWriter/director Josey Cuthrell-Tuttleman brings viewers on a visual and aural journey through the world of dance.

It\u2019s something I do not see and have not seen until now, and I want to keep pushing that envelope.\u201d The film includes sound design that immerses the audience in the world of a deaf dancer who is given a coveted solo and must defy both peers\u2019 and her own doubts to deliver the performance of a lifetime.\n\n\u201cBitter Melon\u201d\n\n\"Bitter Melon\" (Photo courtesy of APFF)\n\nThis comedy-drama short was actually the last episode of the web series \u201cBitter Melon.\u201d Fans of \u201cFleabag\u201d will appreciate \u201cBitter Melon\u2019s\u201d fourth wall nod, especially in this episode directed by student Kayla Wong. The episode proves to be a sufficient stand-alone that closes the main character Bitter\u2019s arc as a young Chinese American woman who is recovering from a break-up with her white boyfriend. The finale shows Bitter hesitant to share the news with her family during a Lunar New Year celebration.

I think a lot of us can relate to that feeling when parents push an agenda or a career path on their children, so I just wanted to advocate against that and to show that we can push through our own dreams.\u201d \u201cFili\u201d marks the first Pacific Islander film for USC\u2019s Asian Pacific Film Festival.\n\n\u201cWelcome to ESL\u201d\n\n\"Welcome to ESL\" (Photo courtesy of APFF)\n\n\u201cWelcome to ESL\u2019s\u201d comical story was quick to charm the attendees of the film fest, evidenced by its win of the Audience Award at the festival.

The short grabs its title from rapper China Mac, who proclaims in the documentary \u201cI\u2019m just being a man of our people, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m not an activist.\u201d It is a sentiment displayed throughout the film, which Chen echoes, saying \u201c[Dragon Combat Club is] doing something in their community and I figured why not help give them a voice to articulate their action and their anger and their solution, however short-term or imperfect or productive.

Pivotal moments from the short are inspired by Sura\u2019s father and own childhood moments: \u201cMy brother stole a hundred rupees, which was like 2 bucks, and the only thing he said was \u2018Don\u2019t tell Dad.\u2019 And the first thing that I did was go tell Dad.

Writer and director Yoo Lee, a recent MFA graduate, shares that this was her thesis film at USC and was inspired by the flies that would enter the garage where she did stop-motion work. Lee admits that she changed her career and \u201cwent back to school at the tender young age of 46\u2032\u2032 to pursue animation and digital design.

The Kings won 4-3. (AP/Kyusung Gong)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nMarch 11, 2024 at 7:10 pm PDT\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Vegas Golden Knights\u2019 recent struggles have allowed the Kings to move into the Pacific Division\u2019s top-three, but Vegas made a statement by acquiring multiple impact players at the deadline. The Kings, on the other hand, did not. Injury setbacks and a lack of bona fide starpower weren\u2019t enough to nudge general manager Rob Blake to make any calls.\n\nCurrently, Los Angeles is even with the Knights at 75 points and six points ahead of the Minnesota Wild, the best non-playoff squad in the Western Conference. While making the playoffs isn\u2019t a sure thing yet for the Kings, their main focus is to edge out Vegas and avoid a potentially dreadful Wild Card series.\n\nThis past week, the Kings went 2-1-1\u2014not bad, but not great\u2014and saw immense success from winger Kevin Fiala. During the four-game stretch, the 27-year-old logged five points and now has 10 in his last six.\n\nGoaltender Cam Talbot has started in each of Los Angeles\u2019 last six games. After speculation surrounding LA\u2019s possible desire for another netminder never came to fruition, Talbot must continue to stay resilient between the pipes. The 36-year-old has started in 39 games thus far, and has had to play nearly perfect just to put the Kings in the position they are now.\n\nThe absence of blueliner Mikey Anderson, who\u2019s still injured, hasn\u2019t done Talbot any favors either. LA returned home to face the New Jersey Devils in an electric game for center Phillip Danault. Danault posted his second-career hat-trick on just four shots en route to a massive 5-1 Kings victory.\n\nLos Angeles was outshot 31-23, but Talbot answered the call and helped secure the win. The Kings scored five unanswered goals after allowing one from Timo Meier just 15 seconds into the game. Fiala also notched three points on a goal and two assists.\n\n\u201cOnce you get a win to snowball a little bit, the confidence comes,\u201d said Talbot. \u201cThe guys in front of me have been playing some pretty good hockey as well, so it\u2019s easy to read off them.\u201d\n\nOn March 5, LA had a chance to take down the Pacific-leading Vancouver Canucks for the second time in less than a week. Winger Trevor Moore put the Kings in front in the first frame from point-blank range, but Los Angeles\u2019 offense failed to find that spark again. Canucks center Elias Pettersson tied the game a period later, and both teams\u2019 defenses forced overtime. Vancouver\u2019s J.T. Miller\u2019s lethal slap shot put the nail in the coffin a minute and a half into extra time, winning the divisional bout 2-1.\n\nIn what could be a potential playoff matchup, the Kings will face Vancouver twice more in the regular season. \u201cWe don\u2019t hang our heads on that one,\u201d said interim head coach Jim Hiller. \u201cIt was a hard game to look good in.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles also needed overtime in its following game. Against the Ottawa Senators, the Kings trailed 2-1 entering the third period, but center Pierre-Luc Dubois evened the contest midway through and blueliner Jacob Moverare gave LA its first lead of the night just a minute after. Moverare\u2019s goal was the first of his NHL career after spending time with the American Hockey League\u2019s Ontario Reign for a good portion of the past few seasons.\n\n\u201cIt was huge to get the boys the lead,\u201d said Moverare. \u201cIt felt awesome.\u201d\n\nOttawa wasn\u2019t going to go down without a fight, though. The Sens found the back of the net with just over four minutes remaining in the game, sending the game to an extra frame. Needing the crucial two points against a subpar team ... enter Fiala to save the day. The Swiss star beat goalie and former King Joonas Korpisalo on an acrobatic play in which Fiala turned a full 360 degrees before tapping in the puck, giving LA the 4-3 victory.\n\nLos Angeles couldn\u2019t keep the momentum going against a team that has had its number for quite some time, however. Against the Dallas Stars on Saturday night, Fiala got things started right away, scoring 26 seconds through the first period, but the Kings couldn\u2019t capitalize on offense the rest of the way. LA went a lackluster 0-4 on power play opportunities and allowed a pair of Dallas goals, both 18 seconds apart in the second period to lose the lead. The Stars won 4-1 and now possess two victories over Los Angeles this season.\n\nThe Kings will conclude their homestand on Monday against another playoff-hungry team, the New York Islanders. Then, LA will hit the road to the Midwest for bouts with the struggling St. Louis Blues and league-worst Chicago Blackhawks.\n\n\u201c[The Islanders] are fighting for the playoffs, so we\u2019re going to see their best and they better see our best,\u201d said Hiller. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a playoff-style game and we should be just as desperate as they are.\u201d\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t an ideal week, the Kings are still\u2014through all of the adversity\u2014right in the middle of the playoff mix. With less than 20 games left until the postseason, Los Angeles must stay consistent to make a strong push.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert of ANNENBERG MEDIA)\n\nBy Lindsay Augustine March 11, 2024 at 10:12 am PDT\n\nAs polling places across California closed at the designated time of 8 p.m., the results of the race for California senator were starting to become clear. The senate seat had three players by election day: Rep. Adam Schiff, former Major League Baseball player Steve Garvey and Rep. Katie Porter. At Porter\u2019s election party, there was a strong hope that she could pull ahead in the contentious race for second that she and Garvey were engaged in.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s had some tough campaigns,\u201d said a volunteer with the campaign, Carrie Crevel. \u201cWe flipped the 47th, the 45th... We did it the last two cycles. I think we can do it again.\u201d\n\nBut an hour and a half later, Schiff and Garvey were declared to have advanced, leaving Porter\u2019s progressive supporters blaming Schiff\u2019s attempt to elevate Garvey \u2013 and knee-cap Porter. Throughout the night, supporters were full of compliments for her, hopeful that she would flip this election.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the smartest woman in Washington,\u201d said Sharon Mul\u00e9, Porter advocate and Implementation Specialist for the Institute on Community Integration. Marvel Harrison, a community advocate for a sewer crisis in Tijuana, agreed with this assessment of Porter\u2019s leadership style. \u201cPorter has a smart way of going about getting things done and she has a moral compass that will stay in the right direction,\u201d Harrison said.\n\nPorter\u2019s focus on small community issues also earned her the respect of Ron Nelson, who has volunteered with her campaign before. \u201cShe makes the system work better for regular, ordinary people,\u201d Nelson said. Many people loved that Porter didn\u2019t take money from corporations and political action committees (PACs). \u201cI really like how she wants to stop all of the extra money and the financial incentives. I think she wants to try to restrict some of the unlimited funds in politics,\u201d Anne Engel, a supporter, said.\n\nBut what many saw as her strength, may have been her downfall. Particularly as her opponents didn\u2019t have the same reservations about PAC donations. The hopefulness for her win earlier in the night became anger directed at Schiff. Her supporters saw him, as Mul\u00e9 described it, as \u201ca political cannibal eating his own.\u201d One voter, Gene Erman, stated Porter\u2019s loss was, in part, due to \u201cmoney used [by Schiff] to promote Steve Garvey so Porter didn\u2019t hold the second place.\u201d\n\nPorter herself stated that her opponents had spent over 20 million dollars to \u201cdefeat someone who will dilute their influence and disrupt the status quo.\u201d \u201cIf you watch TV, you saw all the ads, essentially giving Garvey unlimited press,\u201d Mul\u00e9 said.\n\nBut Porter\u2019s fans were full of energy despite their anger and loss. Her supporters were cheering her name as she walked onto the event stage - she promptly corrected them to cheer the name of her introductory spokesperson, her daughter, instead: \u201cBetsy, Betsy, Betsy!\u201d\n\n\u201cI love the way she inspires countless people, even if it means sometimes that she won\u2019t stop telling me how much they love her. But most importantly, I see she is always doing the right thing to help people,\u201d Betsy Porter said in her introduction of Porter.\n\nAfter Betsy Porter finished her speech, Porter hugged her, mouthing, \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d a response to Besty Porter\u2019s earlier compliment of the same nature. Porter\u2019s speech had a prolific message; citing the corruption of major corporations, the destruction of the establishment, and the importance of the working class; but simple at the same time.\n\n\u201cWhat our success over the last six years has shown is that Californians and Americans are hungry for leaders who break the mold... You deserve a choice between the way things are now and the way they could be,\u201d Porter said.\n\nCalifornians will have to choose either Garvey or Schiff to take over either or both of the Senate positions open - a partial and a full six-year term. Some Porter fans saw the necessity of voting for Schiff despite his gambit to knee-cap Porter. \u201cYou may not wanna vote for either of the candidates because you don\u2019t feel strongly about either of them,\u201d said Jackson Sutherlin, a fourth-year USC Psychology student who voted for Porter. \u201cBut you still have to participate in voting because it has such an impact on your life. Personally, I\u2019m probably going to vote for Adam Schiff because I want a Democrat in a position of leadership in our state. I hope other people will do the same.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s yet to be seen whether more progressive voters are willing to compromise. For many, Porter was the representation of a belief in a better future, a way to \u201cShake Up the Senate.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a shame for this country to lose her. She\u2019s always giving me a little bit of hope,\u201d Mul\u00e9 said.\n```"}

(AP/Wade Payne)\n\nBy Tripp Carrington March 11, 2024 at 1:03 am PDT\n\nOf the last seven national champions, six of them won either a share of their conference\u2019s regular season title or their conference tournament championship. With just a week remaining until Selection Sunday, let\u2019s check in with the regular season champions from each conference and see how they\u2019ve performed lately.\n\nBig East\u2014Connecticut\nThe only team in the last seven years not to win their conference regular season title or conference tournament and still win a national championship came from the Big East last season: the Connecticut Huskies. This year, if they become the first team to win back-to-back NCAA Tournaments in 17 years, they will not be an exception to the same pattern, as they clinched an outright Big East regular season title last Sunday in a blowout win against the Seton Hall Pirates, 91-61.\n\nThe Huskies were led by their lone freshman starter, Stephon Castle, who scored 21 points and recorded more rebounds (4) than missed field goal attempts (3). Castle is averaging just over eleven points per game this season, but has surpassed 20 points on three occasions, an impressive number for a rookie in a major conference. Teams who rely on freshman guards do not typically perform well in later rounds of March Madness, but Castle is only a complimentary piece for Connecticut who has proven himself to be a consistent option for the Huskies if their more experienced leaders aren\u2019t performing at their best.\n\nAgainst the Pirates, everyone on Connecticut\u2019s offense was involved, as the Huskies took a 15-point lead into halftime and doubled it by the final buzzer. With Connecticut having already clinched the Big East regular season title, fans may have wondered if the Huskies would rest their starters for the last two regular season games to prepare for the Big East Tournament. However, head coach Dan Hurley said, \u201cWe\u2019re playing for big, big things... in terms of seeding... for the NCAA Tournament.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday night against the No. 8 Marquette Golden Eagles on the road, Connecticut players proved that they took Hurley\u2019s sentiment seriously. They forced Marquette to miss 54.5% of their 2-point attempts, and they left Fiserv Forum with a 74-67 win, their first win against a ranked opponent on the road since January 16, 2014, a season in which the Huskies won the national championship. On Saturday, the Huskies finished the regular season with a 74-60 win on the road against the Providence Friars. All five Connecticut starters scored in double figures, and the Friars never held a lead in the game\u2019s final 26 minutes.\n\nThis Thursday, the Huskies will play in the quarterfinals of the Big East Tournament against the winner of Xavier-Butler.\n\nBig Ten- Purdue\nOn Tuesday night, the Purdue Boilermakers clinched their second straight outright Big Ten regular season title in a tight road contest against No. 12 Illinois. Despite entering the day with a 15-3 conference record and a three-game win streak, Purdue only had a two-game lead on Illinois in the Big Ten standings. Before Tuesday\u2019s contest, the Fighting Illinis sported a 15-2 record at State Farm Center. However, they hadn\u2019t faced Purdue there yet, and the Boilermakers are arguably the best team in the country.\n\nPurdue is the only team to have been ranked in the AP Poll top four every week this season, and they are likely to earn the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament bracket. With just over three minutes left in the game, Illinois led by two points, but Purdue guard Fletcher Loyer went on a personal 7-0 scoring run to take the lead, which the Boilermakers held onto for the duration of the contest. Loyer finished with 16 points, but Zach Edey, the overwhelming favorite to repeat as Naismith Men\u2019s College Player of the Year, led the Boilermakers with 28 points on 56.5% shooting.\n\nOn March 15, Purdue will play in their first game of the Big Ten Tournament, which they hope will be the first of many win-or-go-home games for them this March.\n\nSEC\u2014Tennessee\nThe last time the Tennessee Volunteers earned an outright SEC conference title was in 2008, when George W. Bush was finishing his second term as U.S. President. On Wednesday night, they did it again with a win in enemy territory against the No. 17 South Carolina Gamecocks, 66-59.\n\nDuring their recent seven-game win streak, Tennessee star Dalton Knecht averaged 22.1 points per game while making over 40% of his three-point attempts. Knecht has a realistic claim for most versatile scorer in the country, and he is likely to end the season as the SEC Player of the Year. However, Knecht is still looking ahead to the rest of March. After Wednesday\u2019s win, he said, \u201cThe job\u2019s not done,\u201d noting that the Volunteers want \u201cthe big one,\u201d an NCAA Championship.\n\nPerhaps Knecht and company looked too far ahead, for they dropped their final regular season game on Saturday at home against the Kentucky Wildcats, 85-81. Despite Knecht\u2019s career-high 40 points, the Volunteers offense only made 37.8% of their field goal attempts and were unable to stop Kentucky\u2019s lethal offensive attack.\n\nWith this loss, Tennessee\u2019s path to a No. 1 seed may require an SEC Conference Tournament Championship victory and uncharacteristically weak performances from other top teams (North Carolina, Arizona) in their own conference tournaments. Top-seeded teams account for seven of the last ten championships, whereas only a single No. 2 seed has cut down the nets in the last decade. If the Volunteers were to earn a No. 1 seed in this year\u2019s tournament, it would be their first in program history.\n\nBig 12\u2014Houston\nUnlike the last three conferences we\u2019ve covered, the Big 12\u2032s regular season title had yet to be fully decided until the last day of the Big 12\u2032s regular season. Entering Saturday, the Houston Cougars had a one-game lead on the Iowa State Cyclones in the conference standings, and each team had one more game to play.\n\nHouston hasn\u2019t lost a game since February 3rd, when the Kansas Jayhawks bested them at Allen Fieldhouse. On Saturday, with an outright Big 12 regular season title on the line, Houston had a chance to avenge their loss on their own home floor against the same Kansas team. However, it would have taken a loss to Kansas and an Iowa State victory on the road against the Kansas State Wildcats for Houston not to clinch the title.\n\nAnd by halftime of Houston\u2019s game, not only were they up on the Jayhawks by 19 points, but Iowa State had already lost to Kansas State, which gave Houston an outright regular season title in their first year as a member of the Big 12. On Saturday, Houston got their revenge on No. 14 Kansas, got their Big 12 title, and made a statement before the postseason via a 30-point victory against a top-25 conference opponent.\n\nThis Thursday, Houston will open their play in the Big 12 Tournament against the winner of Oklahoma-TCU.\n\nACC\u2014North Carolina, Duke\nOn Saturday, the ACC regular season title was determined by the result of the latest chapter in the best rivalry in sports: the North Carolina Tar Heels vs the Duke Blue Devils at Cameron Indoor Stadium. Duke entered the week one game behind North Carolina in the ACC standings.\n\nOn Monday night, they faced off against a middle-of-the-pack NC State Wolfpack and won comfortably, 79-64. The next night, with only a half-game lead over Duke, North Carolina needed to extend its four-game win streak to five to ensure they would earn a share of the ACC title regardless of how the rest of the season played out.\n\nThankfully for the Tar Heels, their opponent, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, did not put up much of a fight, and North Carolina battled their way to a blowout, 84-51. Then, their lead over Duke was back to one game, and their one game left in the regular season was a matchup against the Blue Devils themselves.\n\nIn his final career game in Cameron Indoor Stadium, Tar Heel senior guard Cormac Ryan scored a career-high 31 points on just 12 shots. His offensive effort combined with a weak Blue Devils shooting night gave North Carolina just enough to steal a road win, 84-79.\n\nThis season is the first time since 2021 that North Carolina has swept their season series against Duke and their first outright ACC regular season title since 2017. Given a strong showing in the ACC Tournament, the Tar Heels are likely to earn the fourth No. 1 seed for the NCAA Tournament, along with Purdue, Houston and Connecticut.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/11/dodgers-la-opens-spring-training-hot/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Someone clearly forgot to tell the Los Angeles Dodgers that it is only Spring Training. The games may not count yet, but the Dodgers have certainly been playing like they do. In the team\u2019s first two weeks of exhibition action, Los Angeles has come out red hot, jumping out to a 10-3 record thanks to impressive performances from several of its stars.\n\nObviously, the main focus of the spring has been newly acquired two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani. While Ohtani will not pitch in 2024, it hasn\u2019t taken him long to impress at the plate. In his first five exhibition games in Dodger blue, the Japanese sensation has gone 7-for-12 with six RBIs, a home run, a triple and three walks. Oh, and to top it off, he also got married.\n\nShohei Ohtani just made this announcement on Instagram: \u201cNot only have I began a new chapter in my career with the Dodgers but I also have began a new life with someone from my Native country of Japan who is very special to me and I wanted everyone to know I am now married.\n\nBut Ohtani is not the only new Dodger to impress in Spring Training so far. Through his first 4.2 innings of exhibition action, newly-acquired starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow has allowed just one run on four hits with six strikeouts. Glasnow will be one of the aces of a pitching staff that also includes high-profile Japanese signing Yoshinobu Yamamoto, rising stars Bobby Miller and Emmet Sheehan and veteran James Paxton.\n\nLos Angeles will also get two-time All-Star Walker Buehler and three-time Cy Young-winner Clayton Kershaw back from injuries at some point during the season. The Dodgers have built a rotation so deep that they should be able to withstand Tony Gonsolin and Dustin May both likely missing the entire 2024 season due to Tommy John surgery.\n\nMeanwhile, at the plate, last year\u2019s National League MVP runner-up Mookie Betts has picked up right where he left off. In nine Spring Training appearances, Betts is batting 9-for-22 with two doubles and a home run. He has also added five walks and three RBIs.\n\nWith three former MVPs at the top of their lineup in Betts, Ohtani and Freddie Freeman, the Dodgers are certainly a force to be reckoned with. However, the power has not stopped there. James Outman and Max Muncy have each been out to hot starts of their own, with both players batting over .350 and having hit multiple home runs already.\n\nObviously, it is only March. But if the early signs are any indicator, Los Angeles very much looks like the juggernaut that it is capable of becoming. The rest of the league better watch out.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/03/11/clippers-two-must-watch-games-for-the-rest-of-the-season/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 The Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 last five games have been quite a rollercoaster. In their final game of February, the Clippers blew a 21-point lead in the fourth and final Battle of L.A. Four days later, they traveled to Minnesota and took down the first-seed Timberwolves in a game where both teams had an off-night, with neither shooting above 40% from the field. Then, the Clippers traveled to play the Houston Rockets and came from 20-down to earn a solid road victory, the second time they had done so this season. Given their recent stretch of games, the Clippers seem to be searching for their identity. Earlier this season, Kawhi Leonard shared that he was concerned the team was relying too heavily on its talent\u2014when the Clippers\u2019 talent doesn\u2019t perform, the results don\u2019t tend to fall in the Clippers\u2019 favor. However, the Clippers still have plenty of time to showcase who they are against some quality opponents. \n\nThese are the two games that Clippers fans should mark on their calendars. \n\nCrescent City contest \u2014 Mar. 15\n\nThere\u2019s one team that\u2019s been flying under everyone\u2019s radar this season: the New Orleans Pelicans. The Clippers are 1-2 against the Pelicans so far this year, winning on the road and losing both home games. Now that the Pelicans are fully healthy again, this mid-March battle will be another marquee matchup for L.A. Zion Williamson, who\u2019s averaged 21.7 points per game against the Clippers this year, and Brandon Ingram will be the players LA need to keep their eyes on and account for in their defensive scheme. The Clippers\u2019 win against New Orleans back in early January featured contributions from all areas of the floor, but L.A. was led by George\u2019s 24 points as he shot 6-10 from beyond the arc. The Clippers led by as much as 31 in this game, and held the Pelicans to less than 100 points on the night. In the losses against the Pelicans, it\u2019s the same trend: one or more of the Clippers\u2019 star players struggled. James Harden, whose offensive contribution has been inconsistent as of late despite averaging over 17 points per contest this year, had eight points as the Clippers fell to the Pelicans during the in-season tournament in November. Then, in February\u2019s matchup, Paul George couldn\u2019t seem to find the basket from behind the perimeter, missing every 3-point attempt he put up, as the Clippers lost by single digits. The most intriguing part of this matchup is that the Pelicans currently sit in fifth place in the Western Conference, right behind the Clippers. This means the two teams would face each other in the first round if the playoffs were to start today. There are also significant playoff implications at stake, especially with who will have home-court advantage come April.\n\nJoker and co. come to Crypto.com Arena \u2014 Apr. 4\n\nNikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets are scheduled to play against the Clippers in early April, the first of a three-game home stretch with games against the Cleveland Cavaliers and Utah Jazz as well. Similar to the Pelicans, the Nuggets are up 2-1 in their season series with the Clippers, with the Clippers dropping the first two matchups and taking the most recent game in December. The Nuggets, who sit third in the Western Conference, are the team to beat after winning last year\u2019s NBA Championship. The Clippers will be tested defensively, especially on the interior against Jokic, but also on the perimeter against Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. The Clippers and the Nuggets are also in the top half of the league defensively, which will make out for a gritty, lower-scoring battle.\n```"}
