The Lakers need to make a move to affirm their playoff chances.\n\nAtlanta Hawks guard Dejounte Murray (5) scores in the half of an NBA basketball game against the Los Angeles Lakers Tuesday, Jan. 30, 2024, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/John Bazemore)\n\nBy Dylan Luden February 02, 2024 at  2:56 pm PST\n\nAfter losing back-to-back games and falling deeper behind the rest of the Western Conference, the Los Angeles Lakers need to make a change or two in order to salvage this season. It would be an embarrassment to not make the playoffs after going all the way to the Conference Finals last season. With the trade deadline just around the corner\u2014on Thursday, Feb. 8 at 12 p.m.\u2014the Lakers have been the central focus of all rumors with guard D\u2019Angelo Russell being the subject of many conversations around who should be shifted for a star and even rumors that LeBron James might be on the trading block.\n\nIt seems as if the Lakers have three kinds of players that they could look at to improve: a three-and-D player, a lengthy wing or a speedster to push the tempo. Since they are the Lakers, after all, they can try and go after a bigger name on the market that has multiple of those qualities. Last year, general manager Rob Pelinka pulled off the fleece of the year by discarding Russell Westbrook in favor of the other Russell and Jarred Vanderbilt. Both players helped the Lakers down the stretch immensely during the regular season and the playoffs. That\u2019s exactly the kind of big swing the Lakers should take again, especially with the way the former No. 2 overall pick Russell has been playing. He\u2019s averaging almost 24 points per game in January on an absurd 50% from the field and 47% from deep. His current run puts Pelinka in a tricky position.\n\nEven though Russell only scored nine points in 27 minutes in the Lakers\u2019 loss to the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday, he\u2019s been on fire and helped the Lakers to a 6-2 record before the back-to-back road trip losses. With that being said, let\u2019s go over some of the players rumored to be heading to the purple and gold:\n\nThe Obvious Targets: Dejonte Murray Murray has been heavily rumored to be on the move after he and Russell went head-to-head during Tuesday night\u2019s matchup. Murray would be a great fit for what the Lakers need: he can shoot well from the field (47%), from deep (39%) and he\u2019s a great defender\u2014 a much more athletic player to throw at the opponent than Russell or Austin Reaves. As such, Russell would probably be the main piece in a trade for Murray. But now that Russell has been playing out of his mind recently, it may be unpopular for Pelinka to fire the trigger on a trade involving him. The dream would be to acquire Murray in a deal that could be centered around Reaves. Let\u2019s face it, Murray is entering his prime and arguably has a higher ceiling than Reaves due to his athleticism. It would be interesting to see if that\u2019s where the Lakers pivot if they don\u2019t want to involve Russell in a deal.\n\nBruce Brown Brown played a villain role in helping knock out the Lakers in the playoffs last year when he was a Denver Nugget. Now, they should look to trade for him. Brown can guard multiple positions, which the Lakers desperately need right now. The 2023 champion can offer defensive cover for Russell and can help him out in the backcourt. Brown can also finish at the rim and knock down shots from behind the arc when needed. After the Indiana Pacers traded Brown to the Toronto Raptors in a deal for Pascal Siakam, it became clear Brown would be flipped for younger, more rebuild-friendly pieces as the Raptors look to change direction. Obtaining Brown would be a great complimentary piece.\n\nAlex Caruso After becoming a fan favorite in Los Angeles, Caruso made the move to go to the Windy City after the Lakers didn\u2019t match the contract the Chicago Bulls offered to him. After Caruso stated that he still thinks of  \u201cwhat could\u2019ve been\u201d  if he stayed with the Lakers, it\u2019s time for Pelinka to bring him back. Lakers fans know how Caruso would elevate this team. He\u2019s another excellent on-ball defender that can spark the offense in transition. If the price is right for the Lakers, this trade would definitely provide a boost not just to the team, but to the fanbase as well.\n\nTyus Jones If you haven\u2019t been paying close attention to what Jones is doing on the Washington Wizards this year\u2014I probably wouldn\u2019t either, it\u2019s the Wizards\u2014he\u2019s actually having a career year in his age-27 season. Jones is averaging his highest ever points per game (12.4), field goal percentage (50%), 3-point percentage (41%) rebounds per game (2.9) and steals per game (1.2). He might provide the most bang for the Lakers\u2019 buck in terms of value on offense and defense. Plus, he\u2019s a natural point guard and the Lakers have been missing that off the bench all season due to Gabe Vincent\u2019s injury.\n\nFinal Verdict: Since Murray is the best player on this list by a good margin, he\u2019ll cost the most. The Lakers have to think about this: is Murray really that much of an upgrade considering the way Russell\u2019s playing right now? Russell\u2019s been the Lakers best three-point shooter this season by a good margin (42%), so losing him may hurt the Lakers\u2019 offense. It would be best for the Lakers to trade for someone who can assist not just Russell on offense and defense, but service the whole team. If Brown is too expensive, the Lakers should make the trade for either Caruso and Jones, possibly even both. The Lakers need all the guard help they can get, especially with Gabe Vincent barely playing this year and Cam Reddish battling minor injuries. Reddish is a great defender, but not an excellent shooter from deep. Acquiring Caruso and/or Jones seems like the more realistic option for the Lakers considering their limited first round draft picks. Plus, these moves would feel similar to what they did at last season\u2019s deadline that helped them advance deep into the playoffs.\n```"}

Welcome to the first edition of \u201cFight on, Dribble On,\u201d a weekly series showcasing NBA performances from former USC Trojans. Out of the 10 former Trojans who hold NBA roster spots this year, seven earned minutes on NBA floors since January 26: DeMar DeRozan: Chicago Bulls\nOnyeka Okongwu: Atlanta Hawks\nNikola Vucevic: Chicago Bulls\nChimezie Metu: Phoenix Suns\nDe\u2019Anthony Melton: Philadelphia 76ers\nJordan McLaughlin: Minnesota Timberwolves\nTaj Gibson: New York Knicks\n\nIn today\u2019s edition, I will be highlighting two Trojans who have been both collegiate and pro teammates. Let\u2019s take a look at how they played in the last week of January and overall this season.\n\nDeMar DeRozan\nPerhaps the current poster boy for USC men\u2019s basketball in the pros, DeRozan has been doing his thing as of late, firing mid-range shots and swishing tough, contested heaves. In 2023-24, DeRozan has started 47 times for the Bulls. The six-time NBA All-Star has only scored fewer than 10 points once this season and currently has seven games in a row with 15-plus points. In DeRozan\u2019s last three games, he\u2019s averaged 20 points a night.\n\nThe Bulls faced the Portland Trail Blazers on January 28. DeRozan put up 20 points, dished out six assists and grabbed seven rebounds in a 104-96 victory away from home. More importantly, he had an efficient night, making 57.1% of his shots. DeRozan went 100% from the charity stripe and sank 50% of his 3-pointers.\n\nTwo nights later, DeRozan and the Bulls played his former team, the Toronto Raptors, for whom he played the most games in franchise history. DeRozan\u2019s best scoring night of this three-game period ended in a loss, however, despite him notching 25 points and five assists in a game when he played nearly 42 minutes.\n\nIn the second night of a back-to-back, the Bulls traveled to Charlotte to take on the Hornets. And despite only taking 10 shots on the night, DeRozan tallied 15 points to snatch a crucial win to keep the team\u2019s season alive.\n\nDespite recent results, the Bulls have been wavering in the play-in hunt. DeRozan is helping to steer the course after a slow start to the season.\n\nNikola Vucevic\nBesides DeRozan, Vucevic has been another bright spot for this Chicago Bulls team ever since he arrived in 2021 after spending his first nine seasons with the Orlando Magic. This season, Vucevic ranks eighth in the NBA for total rebounds per game despite standing at 6-foot-10, a bit undersized for an NBA big. The two-time All-Star has recorded 25 double-doubles this season, which ranks sixth among centers.\n\nAgainst the Trail Blazers and the Raptors, Vucevic had identical stats in terms of points (14) and free throw percentage (100%). In Portland, Vucevic cleaned the glass only seven times compared to nine times against the Raptors.\n\nIn his and the Bulls\u2019 most recent game against the Hornets, Vucevic collected his 25th double-double of the season, as he dropped 22 points and collected 12 boards in a seven-point victory in Charlotte.\n\nDeRozan and Vucevic will look to fight on and claim a playoff spot as the Bulls host the Sacramento Kings and the Minnesota Timberwolves before closing out the week away against the Memphis Grizzlies on February 8.\n\n\u201cFight on, Dribble on\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

The Los Angeles Kings fired coach Todd McLellan on Friday, Feb. 2, 2024. and named Jim Hiller the interim coach for the rest of the season. (AP Photo/Jayne-Kamin-Oncea, File)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner February 02, 2024 at 1:46 pm PST\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 A 3-7-5 record for the Kings in January was enough for general manager Rob Blake to announce a big change: relieving head coach Todd McLellan of his duties. The Kings announced that former assistant coach Jim Hiller would serve as interim head coach for the remainder of the season.\n\nMcLellan spent almost five seasons behind the Kings\u2019 bench and while the team found its way back to Stanley Cup Playoffs in McLellan\u2019s third season, it couldn\u2019t make it past the first round. It was the exact same story the following year too, and this season, Los Angeles\u2019 recent fall from early-season dominance has put a big question mark on the team\u2019s playoff chances. Ultimately, the downward trend cost McLellan his job.\n\n\u201cWe want to thank Todd for his hard work and dedication to the organization,\u201d said Blake in a team statement. \u201cHe has done a tremendous job in moving us forward and making a positive impact on our group and in our community. This was not an easy decision, but we felt the change was necessary at this time.\u201d\n\nRight out of the gate, the Kings had a flying offense and were winning games. LA was in a tightly contested race for the Pacific Division with the Vegas Golden Knights and Vancouver Canucks and setting records as a dominant road team winning 11 away games in a row at one point. All of the pieces were coming together: veterans were thriving, younger players were adjusting at the NHL level accordingly and the goaltending tandem of Cam Talbot and Pheonix Copley looked nearly unstoppable.\n\nHowever, things came crashing down in mid-December. Copley tore his ACL in practice, sidelining him indefinitely. This put overwhelming pressure on Talbot\u2019s shoulders to perform at an All-Star level night-in and night-out, which proved too much for the 36-year-old. McLellan\u2019s team suffered an eight-game losing streak that spanned from the end of December to mid-January and it severely affected the Kings\u2019 playoff position. The once-electric squad became lifeless and questions began to arise around the coaching staff.\n\nHiller will attempt to turn the team around while the playoffs are still in sight. While the Kings stand in the first Wild Card spot in the Western Conference, they are hanging on by a thread. Firing McLellan was not the most conventional choice but makes sense in the long-run. If there was a time to do so, it was now, and LA will have a chance to regroup during the All-Star Break to return to its true form.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/01/usc-mens-basketballs-losing-streak-extends-to-six-games-with-loss-to-to-oregon/", "response": "```\nThe losing streak continues for USC men\u2019s basketball (8-13, 2-8 Pac-12), as Thursday night\u2019s 78-69 loss to Oregon (15-6, 7-3) at Galen Center is the Trojans\u2019 sixth straight loss. The last time the Trojans won a game was back on January 6 versus Stanford. Oregon freshman guard Jackson Shelstad scored a game-high 20 points. Shelstad was on fire right away, making his first six straight shots to begin the game. USC fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis scored a team-high 17 points, and sophomore guard Oziyah Sellers added 12. Sellers has had the hot hand lately, hitting double-digit points in four out of the last five games. \u201cWith guys out, I had to step up. And that\u2019s what I am trying to do,\u201d Sellers said. The Ducks began the game by putting on a shooting clinic, starting 6-for-9 from three. Shelstad was causing problems for the Trojans from beyond the arc, hitting jumper after jumper. However, the Trojans\u2019 defensive intensity picked up halfway through the first half, forcing more challenging outside shots for the Ducks. After a hot start, the Ducks missed seven straight attempts, closing the half by shooting 7-of-17 from deep. The Trojans found much of their first-half offensive success by carefully moving the ball. The Trojans focused more on getting shooters open than playing isolation ball, creating 13 assists in the first half. The game plan helped USC stay afloat early on, shooting 50% from the field. Yet, in the first half, the Trojans constantly fought an uphill battle. The Ducks created an early presence in the paint, grabbing 21 rebounds, and that interior presence allowed for 13 second-chance points. USC\u2019s frontcourt had no answers of any kind. \u201cOur four bigs aren\u2019t very good defensive rebounders; in fact, they are poor,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep playing 15, 20, 25 minutes a game and have zero or one defensive rebound.\u201d Enfield pointed to older centers he coached at USC that played with toughness and a desire to rebound, which he feels many players lack on this team. \u201cThese bigs [in the past] that we have had in this program could all rebound, and they got better,\u201d Enfield said. Going into halftime, the Ducks led 46-39. After the poor shooting from three to end the half for the Ducks, they got back on track in the second half. Oregon converted on its first four attempts from range, helping to build a 16-point lead. The second half continued to be a problem for the Trojans, who, yet again, found themselves down double digits for most of the half. The Trojans couldn\u2019t get into any rhythm as the ball movement from the first half disappeared. Junior forward Kobe Johnson scored zero points in the second half, going 0-for-5 from the field. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to be focused and do your job, you\u2019re just going to come out,\u201d Enfield said. While Oregon\u2019s hot shooting fizzled out midway through the half, their double-digit lead provided a cushion for them. The Trojans tried to make a last-ditch push, even cutting the difference to seven points in the final minute. However, it was a little too late for the Trojans. \u201c[Oregon\u2019s] aggressiveness on the rebounding end was a factor tonight, because we fouled them a few times, and they got in the bonus,\u201d Enfield said. The Trojans are back in action at Galen Center on Saturday against Oregon State (11-10, 3-7) at 4 p.m.\n```"}

(AP/Julio Cortez)\n\nBy Sullivan Maley\nFebruary 01, 2024 at 11:33 pm PST\n\nFRISCO, Texas \u2014 After a long week of practice and schooling under a variety of NFL Coaches, players got the chance to put their hard work on display Thursday at the 99th Annual East-West Shrine Bowl. The West team took home a 26-11 victory in what was certainly a lopsided affair, but a number of prospects on both teams improved their draft stock nonetheless. Let\u2019s take a look at the game\u2019s most notable performances.\n\nFrank Gore Jr., RB, Southern Miss\nThe son of future Hall of Fame running back Frank Gore did not disappoint, taking home the game\u2019s offensive MVP after an impressive first-half performance. Gore Jr\u2019s 49-yard touchdown run was the first score of the game, along with a number of other runs that showcased his elusiveness, patience and explosiveness to take advantage of what he\u2019s given as a runner.\n\nMason McCormick, G, South Dakota State\nSaid 49-yard run was due in no small part to a crucial duo block by McCormick (No. 60), who had a solid outing as a member of the West squad\u2019s starting offensive line. McCormick played at left guard alongside fellow Jackrabbit Garret Greenfield, and the two\u2019s chemistry was obvious, executing successfully together in zone and double teams. I was impressed with McCormick\u2019s physicality as he displayed the power to contend with Power 5 competition. He\u2019s a strong enforcer at guard who plays with intensity every down, and projects well for a run-first, gap-blocking scheme.\n\nTaulia Tagovailoa, QB, Maryland\nFar and away the most impressive passer on the field, Tagovailoa displayed a number of crucial traits in his Shrine Bowl performance that will surely elevate his draft stock in the coming weeks. Busted coverage aside, he displayed solid deep accuracy on a 52-yard completion on his first drive. Taulia capped off the drive with a touchdown run, finding his way back to the pylon for the score after evading a number of defenders in the pocket.\n\nTagovailoa showed solid technique and strong decision-making skills in his throws, always finding the open man in coverage and delivering quality throws despite pressure. On one RPO play in particular, Tagovailoa delivered a dart of a throw with multiple rushers in the pocket, showing the poise and quick release necessary to get the ball out quick without sacrificing the integrity of the play. His timing on in-breaking routes could use a bit of work, but overall, Tagovailoa did a good job of finding open receivers and hitting them in stride.\n\nBut what was most notable about Tagovailoa\u2019s performance was his ability to avoid sacks. The former Terrapin found himself in several sticky situations in and out of the pocket, but showed the awareness to avoid incoming defenders and the quickness and fluidity to avoid nearly every defender that found their way into the backfield. Time and time again when the pocket broke down and a sack seemed imminent, Tagovailoa had my jaw on the floor with his ability to slip out of near-tackles to keep making plays. Staying upright is difficult in the NFL, and a skill that GMs value in a quarterback they\u2019re considering spending a draft pick on \u2014 this performance will surely elevate Tagovailoa\u2019s stock in the eyes of plenty of QB-needy teams.\n\nQwan\u2019tez Stiggers, CB, Toronto Argonauts\nWhile Tulane\u2019s Jarius Monroe had the game\u2019s only interception and was named defensive MVP, Qwan\u2019tez Stiggers quietly locked down just about every receiver he covered while also contributing on special teams. Stiggers had the game\u2019s very first tackle with a solid stop on the opening kickoff, followed up by helping to force fourth down with a pass-break up on the game\u2019s opening drive. For the rest of the night, Stiggers had a somewhat quiet game in the best way a defensive back can: the ball rarely came his way. On the plays where I did make a point of watching Stiggers, I saw receivers blanketed all the way down the field. Stiggers is an athletic corner with great ball skills and the confidence in his play to line up across from just about anyone. The CFL rookie-of-the-year, who skipped college football following the death of his father, has the chance to make NFL Draft history as just the third player drafted without college experience.\n\nHonorable Mentions\nOregon State wideout Anthony Gould took back a punt for the East squad\u2019s lone touchdown in the contest. Gould averaged 16.3 yards per return on 26 fielded punts in 2023 at Oregon State and will likely justify a Day 3 pick for a special teams-challenged organization on his return ability alone.\n\nI was impressed with Troy EDGE Richard Jubinor\u2019s constant presence in the backfield. He showed the mental processing, strength and athleticism necessary to cause trouble on both rushing and passing downs.\n\nColorado State tight end Dallin Holker had a few impressive catches (despite a crucial drop early), including a toe-tap sideline grab through contact that was arguably the game\u2019s most impressive catch.\n\nLouisiana State running back Jacob Kibodi impressed me with his aggressive running style and willingness to play through contact. Kibodi took a number of big hits on some of his longer runs, but his low pad level and physical, downfield running kept him going to gain more yards through contact.\n```"}

Heading into the All-Star Break, the Kings have a 3-5-2 record in their last 10 games. Nonetheless, they have a chance to turn things around in their upcoming time off and firm up their playoff chances.\n\nThe Kings\u2019 three opponents this week were all Central Division teams: the Colorado Avalanche, St. Louis Blues and Nashville Predators. Los Angeles went 1-1-1, falling to the Avalanche in a rout, taking the Blues to overtime and losing, and picking up an important victory against the Predators.\n\nRight from puck drop, spectators could tell the Avalanche would dominate. Colorado lit the lamp three times in the first period and Los Angeles hardly had an answer the rest of the way. Left winger Kevin Fiala mustered Los Angeles\u2019 only goal in the second period, a one-timer to the top left corner of the net from an Alex Laferriere pass to the top of the circle. But it was nowhere near enough. Forward Logan O\u2019Connor recorded back-to-back goals and the Avalanche grabbed an easy 5-1 win.\n\nThe Kings\u2019 next task was the Blues, in what proved to be an evenly matched game. The two teams traded goals back-and-forth in the first two periods, before netminders David Rittich and Joel Hofer held down the fort in the third, sending the game to overtime. With just under four minutes left in the additional period, though, LA had trouble transitioning to the defensive zone and Blues center Brayden Schenn wristed in the game winner, off the right post. Los Angeles grabbed a point in the loss, but conceded its fourth straight defeat, allowing St. Louis to cover ground in the Wild Card race.\n\nHeading into the Kings\u2019 Wednesday night bout with the Predators, both teams sat level at 54 points, making their contest especially huge considering the upcoming break. Right winger Carl Grundstrom scored LA\u2019s first goal of the game, notching his eighth of the season in transition to put the Kings up one in the first. The Kings doubled their lead with an early second period goal from a particularly special source: 2019 first-round draftee, center Alex Turcotte. The 22-year-old scored his first career NHL goal off a dish from winger Trevor Moore, sending the puck past goaltender Juuse Saros from a tough angle.\n\nAfter a goal from the Preds\u2019 Filip Forsberg, center Trevor Lewis restored LA\u2019s two-goal lead in the third, with Turcotte recording his first career assist as well. Nashville scored again, but Fiala put the game out of reach by scoring on the empty net, closing the game out 4-2 in the Kings\u2019 favor. Fiala reached 43 points this season, now tied with winger Adrian Kempe for the team lead.\n\nThe Kings will enjoy some time off before their next game. In the meantime, though, goaltender Cam Talbot will represent Los Angeles in the 2024 All-Star Game in Toronto. It will be Talbot\u2019s second career All-Star nod and the Kings\u2019 seventh different All-Star representative in the last 11 seasons.\n\nWhile this week wasn\u2019t all gravy, the Kings still possess the Western Conference\u2019s top Wild Card spot. Upon finishing their mini-break, Los Angeles will take on the Edmonton Oilers in a highly anticipated matchup and try to make progress in the division. Edmonton has won its last 16 games, but only leads the Kings for third in the Pacific by three points due to their slow start to the season. If they hope to slow down the red-hot Oilers, Los Angeles must continue to improve its defensive game. Allowing five goals against the Avalanche, especially with All-Star Talbot between the pipes, was unacceptable.\n\nThe NHL All-Star game will take Saturday at 3 p.m. at Scotiabank Arena. The Kings will resume play one week later at home against Edmonton.\n```"}

As a man, she loved road tripping across America, stopping at truck stops and dive bars, monster truck rallies and sporting events, but after coming out as a trans woman, she realized that part of her life would no longer be the same. Being a woman means you are far more vulnerable being by yourself on the road, but being trans presents an even higher risk of ostracization or, worse, physical danger.\n\nTo help move through this new stage of life, Ferrell and Steele band together to revisit some of Harper\u2019s favorite road-side attractions \u2014 with the privilege of a beloved celebrity by her side to act as a buffer and support. (The two acknowledge this is an advantage not typically offered as part of the trans experience.)\n\nThe film, directed by Josh Greenbaum (of \u201cBarb and Star Go To Vista Del Mar\u201d), beautifully and candidly addresses the confusion and discomfort that can come with the changing dynamics of friendship when one comes out. But there\u2019s enough effortless humor in the story that will have you laughing even while you cry throughout.\n\nThere is plenty to say about the film\u2019s notes on relationships, its exploration of transness, and even its all-star collection of cameos, but what struck me was how little I knew about how to really master the art of the road trip. Harper Steele knows what she is doing. She spent her life hitchhiking, drinking her favorite beer (the polarizing Natty Lights), and enjoying the freedom of the open road.\n\nThe two met while working for Saturday Night Live, when Steele connected with Ferrell\u2019s unique sense of humor and understood how to write sketches that would play to his strengths. Greenbaum makes use of the SNL connections by incorporating some familiar faces into the film (Tina Fey, Tim Meadows, Kristen Wiig), while also making time to center Steele\u2019s story by introducing us to her family and her childhood home.\n\nHarper Steele and Will Ferrell at Sundance 2024. Photo courtesy of Sundance Institute.\n\n\u201cWill and Harper\u201d is much more than a comedic road movie. It is a pilgrimage through the emotional complexities of coming out and exemplifies the power of listening to learn. There was a side to Harper that had always been hidden from her closest friends and family, and making the film provided her the opportunity to try relating her experiences out loud for the first time.\n\nIn one heartbreaking admission in the film, she unpacks her self-hate, explaining that it is difficult not to view her new self as a \u201cfreak\u201d after so many years of harboring that level of judgment toward herself and those like her.\n\nThere are plenty of honest moments where their naivety gets the better of them, or the two face hostility from strangers that sours an evening, but more often than not the film manages to inject hope and joyfulness into its 114-minute runtime \u2013 falling on the lengthier side of the average documentary.\n\nIt is paced exceptionally well and Will and Harper are both charming and eccentric.

She says the goal of the fair is to make the job search more accessible for Black students at USC.\n\nCandace House: We really need a space for Black students to get to meet Black recruiters, as opposed to going to the everyday fairs and only getting to meet recruiters for a second. And they can actually get to learn what\u2019s it like being Black at a certain company, and possibly, hopefully get a job and a mentor.\n\nThe other co-founder of the fair, Ire Omitowoju, is a senior majoring in Arts, Technology, and the Business of Innovation. She adds that the goal of the fair is to create genuine connections with companies and make the recruitment process less daunting.\n\nIre Omitowoju: Being at a predominantly white institution, regular career fairs can be very scary. Black students can feel really lost in the crowd, and so being able to create a space where they\u2019re seen, they\u2019re valued and people are coming to see them, I think was just super important to us.\n\nLast year, the Black Career Fair hosted 17 companies. This year, House says, it has grown to 25 companies, with recruiters from more varied kinds of jobs.\n\nHouse: I feel like this event wouldn\u2019t have needed to be created if we had more representation in the career events that exist at USC. We\u2019re not a monolith. We have so many different interests.\n\nEvents like the Black Career Fair help students to be their genuine selves in professional environments, says gerontology student Jordan Roberson.\n\nJordyn Roberson: I think it\u2019s difficult for some black people to navigate the workspace because they feel like they can\u2019t be their authentic selves or they have to put on, you know, a different type of demeanor to see, seem digestible to people. So I. I also see myself just changing the workforce and providing more ideas and, diversity and just bringing creative thoughts to that space.\n\nAlthough the co-founders of USC\u2019s Black Career Fair will graduate this semester, they hope to leave a legacy. House wants to inspire other students to grow the Black Career Fair even bigger at USC and beyond.\n\nCandace House: Definitely in general we need to see more people of color and hopefully Black people in general. And I think once people get up to the top, they can start bringing people up the ladder themselves. And I feel like that\u2019s why this event is so important, because people can learn about the struggles that representatives have faced in the workforce and be able to learn how to navigate those spaces themselves.\n\nOmitowoju acknowledges that USC provides resources for Black students like the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, but said there is still room for improvement.\n\nOmitowoju: We think that the universities should just continue to provide resources, put in money, put in support into these entities that already exist on campus, allowing us to just grow stronger, grow even bigger, and again, allow our students to continue to feel seen.\n\nYou have until 9 pm tonight to feel seen at USC\u2019s Black Career Fair.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Alia Noll.\n```"}

Artists whose songs have been removed from TikTok include the likes of Taylor Swift and Drake. This fallout between the social media platform and the music industry giant began over contract renewal disputes.\n\nA statement by Universal Music Group to TikTok read \u201cIn our contract renewal discussions, we have been pressing them on three critical issues--- appropriate compensation for our artists and song writers, protecting human artists from the harmful effects of AI, and online safety for TikTok\u2019s users.\u201d\n\nDylan Miller is a sophomore studying cinematic arts who has accumulated over half a million followers on TikTok. Dylan is frustrated but believes users will be able to still make content.\n\nDylan Miller: I think what really sucks about, like not being able to use certain songs by UMG artists is, UMG really covers like one third of the music industry. So I think it\u2019s got to be definitely be very hard to adapt to the restrictions, but I still feel very confident in the fact that. People, especially on TikTok, get very creative and out of the box, especially like with songs in general. And Miller expects that to continue.\n\nMiller: I think it\u2019s definitely going to be an adjustment as far as against so many like major artists Beyonce and Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish all are under UMG. So, like losing their music is definitely going to be a huge loss for TikTok.\n\nThis change could also affect less well-known artists says Lia Haberman. She\u2019s in digital media marketing.\n\nLia Haberman: It\u2019s going to hurt smaller musicians who are on the Universal Music Group label, because everybody getting pulled. You know, will no longer get that exposure. It\u2019s possible that independent artists actually are able to move in and kind of fill that void, because there\u2019s less music on there. Maybe people are going to be more willing to take a chance on, you know, emerging artists who are not on a label, for example. There\u2019s a fairness to wanting their artists to be paid or compensated, you know, appropriately. So, I understand why they\u2019re doing it, and I\u2019m not necessarily opposed to it. I just think that, yes, it\u2019s going to hurt creators. It\u2019s going to hurt, you know, artists.\n\nThe director of outreach for social media club, USC Reach, is Jack Murphy. He says influencers might leave TikTok and move to other platforms if they can\u2019t put in TikTok videos any music from Universal Media Group artists.\n\nJack Murphy: So, if TikTok doesn\u2019t agree to what UMG wants, I think you could start seeing either. A TikTok based in like on popular audios and then more getting into the space of longform content for creators and then or just people moving to YouTube shorts. If a new platform gains popularity, it could also change who joins USC Reach.\n\nMurphy says... Murphy: People might shy away from using the TikTok platform and try pursuing like UGC on Instagram or something like that. Murphy: Most of them are TikTok creators. Like, personally, for myself, I\u2019m bigger on TikTok. I\u2019m about like I\u2019m reaching like 20,000 followers right now on TikTok, but on my Instagram, I\u2019m like reaching 5K right now.\n\nTikTok continues to have licensing deals with other music companies, but the power of Universal\u2019s artists can\u2019t be denied and if enough creators stop using their music, Universal and TikTok could be all but forced to return to negotiating.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Nathan Silva.\n```"}

It was like, I\u2019m a fast walker, so usually it takes me 20 minutes and then took me 40 because I there was really deep puddles and I live near row and there was this one.

April Elliott is a California Highway Patrol Officer.\n\nApril Elliott: With inclement weather, we do get a lot of calls. You can expect delays in traffic on your commute times and everything.\n\nOfficer Elliott shares some advice.\n\nElliott: So, it\u2019s really important if you are driving on the freeways, to try to stay out of those first, that the far-left lane in the far-right lane. Those are the lanes that often flood near the roadway edges, especially on an elevated roadway with walls on both sides.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get down to the details. What really is this atmospheric river or more specifically the pineapple express? The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website says atmospheric rivers are long, narrow regions in the atmosphere that transport most of the water vapor outside the tropics. When these rivers make landfall, they often will release this water vapor in the form of rain or snow.\n\nThe name Pineapple Express more specifically refers to an atmospheric river that is capable of bringing moisture from the tropics near Hawaii over to the U.S. West Coast.\n\nDue to the expected rain continuing into the weekend, Officer Elliot shares more tips for anyone riding the Pineapple Express.\n\nElliott: If you know you do have to drive, just make sure you plan to leave with enough time to get to your destination, maybe even a little bit earlier. Allow for extra time. Never drive through standing water because we don\u2019t again, we don\u2019t know how deep that is. And something may be underneath that water. I like to make sure all my everything is in working order as far as my car. So, make sure you have a full tank of gas, make sure your windshield wipers are working, and that\u2019s that\u2019d be especially helpful this weekend.\n\nThe storm is expected to continue into early next week.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Pickle Coleman.\n```"}

The asterisk in their logo commemorates all those perspectives that were still left out of this inclusion, including women of color, trans women and queer people. Their mission statement echoes the idea that \u201cThe 19th Amendment remains unfinished business\u201d and that suffrage is still very much a work in progress.\n\nThe documentary itself chronicles the efforts of the female and nonbinary journalists who founded The 19th and their journey to create a journalism \u201cstartup\u201d based in Austin, TX. The founders decided to narrow their coverage to focus on those various perspectives historically left out of mainstream media.\n\nThe stories of their coverage of issues such as the Breonna Taylor case, the riots at the U.S. Capitol, and the overturning of Roe v. Wade are just a few of the ones that the film chose to highlight. The newsroom even got an exclusive interview with Vice President Kamala Harris after she noticed their top-level coverage.\n\nDuring the panel moderated by Bellantoni, Haines offered her perspective on the film. \u201cHaving seen the film several times, I still get emotional when I watch it \u2013 mainly because we were living this story,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were building this newsroom over these three years that you all see in the film. We didn\u2019t have time to be reflective or thoughtful about this journey.\u201d\n\nCEO Ramshaw provided some invaluable advice to the student journalists in attendance, specifically in regards to the fears that they might not find a job suitable to their passions. \u201cI think what was so special for The 19th is that we decided collectively that this industry hadn\u2019t worked for us, and we were going to try to do it in a completely different way,\u201d Ramshaw said. \u201cFor those of you who are embarking on journalism careers,\u2019 I think you may find yourself being the start of something completely brand new from the ground floor.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t come easy for The 19th and their founders though. They were forced to navigate the difficult world of Covid, and still come out the other end successful. According to the founders, they were able to eventually raise more than $50 million in funding, have great benefits for their employees, and have been fortunate enough to not lay anybody off.\n\nHaines stressed though that the work is still not done. \u201cWe need you,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease know that there is a tremendous opportunity. It is an existential time for so many of our fellow citizens, for your friends, family, and neighbors, who are living so many of the stories that we are covering. \"\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Joy Kennelly licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 DEED)\n\nBy Anthony Bottino, Tolu Okegbenro and Evan Estevez Rodrigues\nFebruary 01, 2024 at 5:58 pm PST\n\nFans of Taylor Swift, Drake, Bad Bunny and many other world-renowned artists woke up on Thursday to some disappointing news from Universal Music Group: they will no longer be able to lip-sync or dance to their favorite artists on TikTok. UMG\u2019s contract with TikTok expired Wednesday, and this morning the company publicly announced that it has no intention of renewing the licensing agreement that allowed the songs on the popular social media platform.\n\nAs of Thursday, none of the videos featuring music by UMG artists were removed from the app, but the audio is no longer available. Going forward, there will no longer be music by UMG artists officially available on the app. This not only affects artists signed directly under UMG but also UMG subsidiaries, including Republic Records, Interscope Records and Capitol Music Group, which include artists like Nicki Minaj, Olivia Rodrigo and Troye Sivan \u2014 all of whom have utilized the platform ahead of their recent album releases.\n\nDespite many artists using TikTok to promote their music, UMG said it has the artists\u2019 best interest in mind. In the renewal discussions, UMG was prioritizing artists and songwriter compensation, protecting artists from AI, and TikTok user safety.\n\n\u201cTikTok\u2019s tactics are obvious: use its platform power to hurt vulnerable artists and try to intimidate us into conceding to a bad deal that undervalues music and shortchanges artists and songwriters as well as their fans,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nTikTok did not take kindly to the criticism and issued its own statement, accusing UMG of putting \u201cgreed above the interests of their artists and songwriters.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite Universal\u2019s false narrative and rhetoric, the fact is they have chosen to walk away from the powerful support of a platform with well over a billion users that serves as a free promotional and discovery vehicle for their talent,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cTikTok has been able to reach \u2018artist-first\u2019 agreements with every other label and publisher. Clearly, Universal\u2019s self-serving actions are not in the best interests of artists, songwriters and fans.\u201d\n\nThe main issue UMG wanted was more restrictions on AI usage, including AI-generated songs and sounds using its artists\u2019 voices. As TikTok filled with AI content, UMG saw this as artists being replaced by AI while the app still benefited from the likeness of the real artists, as well as TikTok doing nothing to stop it.\n\nEntertainment lawyer Jane Davidson explained that UMG was attempting to get more out of TikTok since without its music and content, TikTok can\u2019t operate, which she said has become common among tech and entertainment companies.\n\n\u201cUMG is really trying to highlight the fact of how valuable the music is to the platform and trying to get more royalties,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be in a position where they\u2019ve not taken advantage of a potential revenue source.\u201d\n\nWhile some fans have expressed their disappointment at UMG\u2019s actions, others said they are staying positive, choosing to see this as an opportunity for new, independent artists. With major artists no longer allowed on the platform, some believe that new, smaller artists will begin popping up on TikTok.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to see how much TikTok has helped artists,\u201d Dylan Miller, a user with 500k followers, said. \u201cTikTok helped elevate Tate McRae\u2019s \u2018Exes\u2019 and \u2018Greedy\u2019 to her first number one song.\u201d\n\nBut without the long list of hit songs and artists to choose from, TikTok creators will have to take their content in a new direction, opening the door to more opportunities for new artists and content creators to think outside trending audio.\n\n\u201cPeople, especially on TikTok, get very creative and out of the box, especially with songs in general,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSo I think people will get really creative with what they can do.\u201d\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\n\nBy Connor Castro\nFebruary 01, 2024 at 5:19 pm PST\n\nAngel City FC is preparing for the 2024 NWSL season. They will start play by hosting Bay FC, the San Jose-based expansion team, at BMO stadium on March 16. This will be head coach Bekci Tweed\u2019s first full season in charge, after taking over midway through last season. She also led ACFC to a first-round exit in the playoffs after claiming her role, making it to the playoffs in the team\u2019s short two-year history.\n\nTransfers: There will be some new faces playing for ACFC this season. With outgoing forward Scarlett Camberos to Bay FC and World Cup-winning defender Julie Ertz\u2019s retirement, reinforcements were needed. New coming forward Casey Phair, the youngest to ever play in a World Cup, midfielder Rocky Rodriguez, and forward Messiah Bright, will have big shoes to fill. Goalkeeper Hannah Stambaugh, former U-20 World Cup winner with Japan, will hope to become ACFC\u2019s starting goalie, at just 25. Along with trades, the NWSL draft led to the selection of Felicia Knox, Jessica Garziano, and Madison Curry. Another exciting addition is ACFC star Alyssa Thompson\u2019s sister Gisele Thompson.\n\nWhat the season will bring: Expectations for the season should be exciting ones. It is a young team led by veterans such as captain Ali Riley, World Cup winners Sydney Leroux and Christen Press, and long-time NWSL midfielder Rodriguez. There is a lot of talent on this team and a lot of young players who will continue to develop. Thompson will enter her second full professional season, turning into a star in the league while already getting World Cup call-ups to the USWNT. The goalkeeper battle between current 25-year-old starter Angelina Anderson and new signing Stambaugh will be interesting to see who will become ACFC goalkeeper for years to come. Head coach Tweed has never had a head coaching job before ACFC, but she is already showing her leadership skills as the team has only lost twice under her in the NWSL. With the mix of prospects and veterans right now, an exciting season that should end with a playoff run is in order.\n\nPlayers to watch for: Alyssa Thompson: ACFC\u2019s star girl, the $450,000 ACFC sent to two teams to acquire the former number one overall draft pick is paying off. A future for the USWNT, she scored 4 goals in 21 appearances at 19. Fast and flashy, she\u2019s on pace to become a legend for the team. Ali Riley: ACFC and New Zealand captain will continue to command the team and defense for the upcoming season. A veteran and a leader, her experience will be instrumental in developing the new draft prospects, particularly Gisele Thompson who plays the same position. Rocky Rodriguez: Midfield was an issue for ACFC last season, so signing one of the better-attacking midfielders in the league will help the team. The Costa Rican international scored Costa Rica\u2019s first-ever goal in the World Cup over the Summer. ACFC will hope more good form continues.\n```"}

Fernandez is currently serving as a USG senator, where he said he is able to \u201ccollaborate and work with various individuals to promote our goals and visions on how to build a better USC through advocacy and projects.\u201d Sanchez is currently the Wellness Chair for USG, a position she said allows her to see the ins and outs of the legislative branch.\n\nSanchez, a legal studies major with a minor in forensics and criminology, said that ensuring the legislative process runs smoothly was something that motivated her to \u201cpursue the vice president role.\u201d\n\nAnother major component of their campaign is to bring in the right cabinet. \u201cJust setting a solid foundation of what we envision USG to be is going to be crucial,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to start with.\u201d\n\nThe pair said they also hope to place an emphasis on testing accessibility for sexually transmitted infections [STIs] in order to enhance student well-being across campus. Testing for STIs is something that Sanchez said she has been looking to make quick and easy for a while now.\n\n\u201cWe already have a current collaboration with [Graduate Student Government (GSG)], and they really want to make sure that this continues to be something that GSG and USG can contribute to,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cFor our students to have a free month of testing every semester.\u201d\n\nOne last aspect of the Trojan community Sanchez and Fernandez said they hope to change is the format of the town hall meetings held on campus. Fernandez homed in on the idea that the meetings need to be more inviting and comfortable for students to attend.\n\n\u201cThe way these talks are currently set up is that students sign up for them,\u201d he said. \u201cStudents are going to these talks, and that may be intimidating.\u201d\n\nFernandez said the overall uncertainty before the meeting, whether it be toward the administrators leading the meeting or the topic of the discussion, is something that needs to change. Campus directors should be working side by side with students for the meetings, rather than students having to climb to them in order to reach their ultimate goals, Fernandez said.\n\nUltimately, Fernandez and Sanchez said they want to see a USC campus that is focused on wellness, transparency, affordability and open communication.\n```"}

One of these recruits is none other than Marquis Gallegos, a four-star safety from Chatsworth, California. He is the second safety this recruiting cycle alongside Jarvis Boatwright from Clearwater, Florida.\n\nIn June 2023, before his senior season had even started, Marquis already saw where he\u2019d be for the next four years. He committed to USC, turning down 26 other offers including Notre Dame, Michigan, Oregon, Texas A&M and Oklahoma; choosing to stay and play for his hometown favorite. His commitment to USC came after numerous visits to campus and a connection with the coaching staff. Gallegos was recruited under former USC defensive coordinators Alex Grinch and Dont\u00e9 Williams per  247sports.com\n\nGallegos is no stranger to performing at the highest levels having played in the biggest competitions in the state. He\u2019s ranked as the No. 22 safety in the country and the No. 20 player in California according to  ESPN . The 6-foot-1 and 180-pound defensive back spent three years playing for Chaminade High School before spending his senior year at Sierra Canyon High School.\n\nDuring his junior season at Chaminade, he was named to almost  every honors football team in California  including the 2022 CalHi Sports All-State First Team, the 2022 MaxPreps California All-State, and the 2022 Prep RedZone All-Southern California Jr. Team. A quick breakdown of his junior and sophomore Hudl films and highlights will leave you with one thought - \u2018wow, this kid has something special. His great athleticism and ball skills combined with his seemingly unbreakable confidence and his vision of the defensive line shines through every minute of his time on the field will back that up.\n\nOne thing about Marquis - he\u2019s going to look for every possible opportunity to bait the opposing QB and offense. Plus he is a pretty solid tackler, something USC hasn\u2019t been the strongest at in recent months. There\u2019s always room for improvement, but given his high school accolades and clear work ethic, coupled with changes to SC\u2019s defensive coaching staff, the college freshman will have the motivation and support he needs to grow.\n\nBesides being under the spotlight for his undeniable skill on the pitch, Gallegos has eyes on him for something else; his pride for his culture. Marquis Gallegos and his family have never shied away from showing their Mexican pride. Marquis took the opportunity to rep la Bandera on all of his college visits, posing for a picture with the Mexican flag on the fields.\n\nNot only is this a baller move, but it also allows him to be a part of an even cooler thing - Latinos in football. Gallegos\u2019 older brother Issac who plays for New Mexico State also repped his Mexican and Salvadorian roots during his recruiting process. Only 3.1% of FBS football players and 3.6% of FCS players identified as Hispanic or Latino in 2022, according to the  NCAA demographic database , In a time where most people only associate Latinos with f\u00fatbol instead of the NFL, it\u2019s empowering to see young players break the stereotypes and be the representation of new generations of athletes across sports.\n\nNuestra gente tiene tanto talento y potencial that\u2019s gone under appreciated so it\u2019s nice to know that progress is being made at USC with Marquis and opening up the gates for more Latino athletes to break through and get their flowers. Playing at USC also means that Gallegos will have the support of L.A. Mexicans who make up about  75% of Hispanics  in Los Angeles and the nearly  5 million Hispanics  in the county, something that he considered when deciding where he\u2019d go.\n\n\u201cJust kind of having such a big Latino community in L.A., me and my family take that into consideration for support in me as well,\u201d Marquis Gallegos said in a  recent interview . \u201cIf I\u2019m there I have a big opportunity for NIL and a bigger support with so many Latinos,\u201d added Gallegos.\n\nWhen he suits up next season, Marquis will add his name to the growing list of  USC athletes with Mexican or Latinx heritage . This list includes trailblazers and stars such as football legend Anthony M\u00fanoz (Class of \u201880), soccer star Amy Rodriguez (Class of \u201808), Chris Steele (Class of \u201822), and current freshman soccer breakout talents  Marbiel Flores  and  Alyssa Gonzalez .\n\nWill he be able to contribute to the improvement of the sub-par and struggling defense that has followed the Trojans over the past two seasons? I think so. Although it\u2019s too early to predict the future of SC this season, I\u2019d say Gallegos\u2019 signing alongside the other new defensive recruits and coaching staff including new defensive coordinator  D\u2019Anton Lynn  may give USC a fighting shot at bringing the Trojan legacy to the Midwest. And no matter how many minutes he gets, you can be sure La Raza is going to show up and out to support him.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Sean Potvin)\n\nBy Krystle Ehara, Stephen Knobel and Makenzi Johnson\nFebruary 01, 2024 at 1:52 pm PST\n\nTuesday night, Taper Hall. USC\u2019s Make-A-Wish Club hosted its first meeting of the semester amidst a deck of Uno cards, bags of Cheetos, Hawaiian shirts and one very special guest. Tess, a 13-year-old from Whittier, California, was diagnosed with a critical illness. A few days ago, her mother, Lisa Partida, was contacted by the L.A. chapter of the Make-A-Wish foundation with the news that a group at USC had a surprise for her daughter. The surprise in question was her wish come true: a family trip to Hawaii.\n\nBut for Tess and her family, it didn\u2019t click until they walked into the room full of Hawaiian decor. With Tess\u2019 favorite games and snacks ready for her, her favorite colors strewn around the room, and her favorite artist, Billie Eilish, playing, the whole evening was dedicated to her.\n\nThis wish is special because it is the first one the club has granted since the pandemic, and the first celebrated in-person in three years. Club president Sean Potvin, a former Make-a-Wish recipient, was especially motivated to fulfill Tess\u2019 dreams.\n\n\u201cIt just has an extra soft spot in my heart, because I went through that myself and now I\u2019m able to give back. But it\u2019s not exactly about me,\u201d Potvin said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about everyone who\u2019s worked hard to be able to put this together.\u201d\n\nTess was in for a big surprise on Tuesday night. (Photo courtesy of Sean Potvin)\n\nIn L.A. County, the average cost of a wish is $10,000. With the goal set of reaching that total, the USC Make-A-Wish Club hosted a number of events throughout the past few semesters: Chipotle partnerships, Krispy Kreme sales, a dodgeball tournament and pies to the face funded Tess\u2019 Hawaii trip.\n\n\u201cIt was almost like a full circle moment,\u201d Potvin said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the more special moments I\u2019ll have within the club.\u201d\n\nPartida was also filled with gratitude for the role the club had in giving Tess her special moment.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really explain the magnitude of how much it means to our family, but we are still, like, really on a high from the whole experience,\u201d Partida said. \u201cI just really, wholeheartedly, want to thank them for their efforts and hope that they continue to do it and that they can make as many kids like Tess happy the way that they made us happy that night.\u201d\n\nMore than just providing her family with the opportunity to go to Hawaii for the first time though, Partida was thankful for the hope the club was able to provide.\n\n\u201cHearing that, you know, these are students who have been through the same journey, giving back, as a parent, I was like, \u2018Oh, like this is hopeful,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t hear those good stories.\u201d\n\nThe party featured Hawaiian decorations, a cake and snacks and games to celebrate Tess' wish coming true. (Photo courtesy of Sean Potvin)\n\nMake-A-Wish\u2019s mission is to give families like Tess\u2019 the spark of light that Partida gained that night. Kate Tidwell, Make-A-Wish special events manager, says clubs like USC\u2019s are particularly important since \u201cit gets the word out to a group of people that normally doesn\u2019t hear about many different non-profits.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also very important to know that many students, whether it\u2019s USC or any other college or university, there\u2019s most likely a wish kid that\u2019s with you in your classes,\u201d she said.\n\nCollege may still be far in the future for Tess, but soon Hawaii won\u2019t be. Donning handmade bracelets from a kit the club gave her, Tess is \u201call hyped up\u201d for the trip with her family and, according to her mom, she\u2019s looking forward to swimming with dolphins and relaxing in the tropics.\n\nTuesday gave Tess two new aspirations: making the most of her time in Hawaii, and becoming a future Trojan. For the teen, one dream is already here, and the other is awaiting.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/02/01/a-recap-of-dry-january-for-usc-students/", "response": "```\nA recap of Dry January for USC students\n\nEliminating alcohol consumption for a month has recently become a trendy New Year\u2019s resolution.\n\nDry January\u2019s origin began as a campaign in 2013 run by the organization, Alcohol Change UK. The organization was created to prevent the harmful effects of alcohol, and its campaign offered an easy way to test the waters of sobriety without long-term commitment. The hope of the campaign was to show participants the benefits of an alcohol-free life.\n\nHowever, for college students, a sober life can be a bit daunting. Alcohol can feel like the center of the college experience and socialization. As a society, we are heavily centered around the consumption of alcohol. From work happy hours to sporting events and concerts, alcohol is almost always present. This can lead to alcohol becoming a crutch for any social activity. Since it lowers inhibitions, it can ease interactions for everyone, no matter what their level of social anxiety. This reliance can also create unhealthy relationships with alcohol.\n\nAlthough they have grown up surrounded by alcohol, more young adults and college students are becoming \u201csober curious.\u201d For Claire Fogarty, a senior studying journalism at USC, every month is Dry January. Before attending USC, she recalls feeling anxious because of the party scene and the pressure of drinking that came with it.\n\n\u201cAt USC, it sometimes feels like it\u2019s all or nothing with drinking,\u201d Fogarty said, \u201cI know there\u2019s a middle ground, but I think it would be hard for me to find it.\u201d As a senior, she said she has been able to not drink while still taking advantage of all the socialization USC has to offer. She enjoys staying out late at parties during the week\u2014without feeling the effects of alcohol the next day.\n\nAlthough her close friends support her decision not to drink, she often feels ostracized by others. \u201cPeople need other people to drink around them in order for their choices to drink to be validated,\u201d Fogarty said. \u201cSometimes they see you as a villain if you don\u2019t drink.\u201d\n\nFogarty loves the idea of Dry January and hopes we can continue to spread awareness about what social life is like without alcohol.\n\nFor Moorea Eldon-Everts, a senior studying business administration at USC, drinking sometimes felt like the center of her world as a member of a sorority on campus. \u201cI found there was a pressure to drink, especially because everyone around me was drinking and would encourage me to have something to drink,\u201d Eldon-Everts said.\n\nThe schedule of a sorority member includes social events with frats from Wednesday to Saturday night. This hefty social schedule can take a toll on one\u2019s body, even on those who frequently drink. For Eldon-Everts, Dry January was a great break. \u201cI didn\u2019t have hangovers that ruined the rest of my day or week. I didn\u2019t make poor decisions that I wasn\u2019t fully aware of,\u201d Eldon-Everts said.\n\nEldon-Everts also leads a healthy lifestyle, and Dry January was in alignment with it. She loved the benefits she felt within her body with more hydrated skin, better sleep, getting sick less often, and better gut health. Alcohol has been shown to disrupt the gut microbiome and metabolic function.\n\n\u201cThink about when you go to the doctor\u2019s office and they\u2019re about to give you a shot. They put alcohol on the place where the shot is going to be. Think of that going into your body\u2019s microbiome and wiping everything out,\u201d Eldon-Everts said.\n\nAngel Chavez, a master\u2019s student studying Data Science at USC, said he had been drinking a lot for some time and thought he might take a break for his health. Dry January was the perfect excuse to do it.\n\n\u201cI drink 2-3 times a week, and a few drinks, but only at social events when I\u2019m hanging out with my homies,\u201d Chavez said. Chavez said it was often challenging trying to socialize without drinking. He explained that it became part of the fun of going out and that he found it difficult to explain to his friends that he was not drinking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would do it again, but overall it was a good experience,\u201d Chavez said.\n\nAs more students participate in Dry January, awareness can be spread about the health benefits of limiting alcohol consumption, while creating a more inclusive environment for students seeking out sober socialization.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)  By   Kasey Kazliner February 01, 2024 at  1:30 pm PST\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d is a column by Kasey Kazliner about the National Hockey League. There\u2019s no stopping Boston While the Boston Bruins\u2019 first-round exit in last year\u2019s playoffs after holding the best regular-season record in NHL history was embarrassing, they are back this season with some extra pep in their step. The Bruins currently sit atop the Eastern Conference and are tied with the Vancouver Canucks for the NHL\u2019s top record ( party like it\u2019s 2011, right? ). Boston is also the only team to not have double-digit regulation losses, and with the exception of a few skids, has been winning at a championship-level rate. Right winger David Pastrnak is making a very strong case to win the Hart Trophy in 2023-24. Pastrnak is in his 10th season donning black and gold at just 27 years old, and his 72 points and 33 goals put him third on the NHL leaderboard for both categories. The Czech star tallied at least one point in all but three contests in January, helping him get selected to his fourth All-Star Game in his career. His well-roundedness in all three zones has expanded his game from year to year, and his hunger for the Cup has only grown after Boston\u2019s playoff woes in recent years. Left winger Brad Marchand may not be having as prolific of a season as Pastrnak, but he\u2019s been a huge force for the Bruins despite his older age. His 47 points can mostly be attributed to his scrappiness and ability to score from difficult angles. Marchand also leads Boston with five game-winning goals. Center Pavel Zacha has also effectively created offensive chances for the Bruins, winning 53.5% of his faceoffs and using his size to create shot opportunities. The Bruins\u2019 goaltending tandem of Jeremy Swayman and Linus Ullmark is one of the best in the NHL. Swayman\u2019s 2.30 goals against average is good for third-best in the league and Ullmark\u2019s 2.78 isn\u2019t too shabby either. Both are also near the top of the league in save percentage, and can thank Boston\u2019s defensive depth that includes Charlie McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm. In their centennial season, the Bruins are destined to hoist their seventh Stanley Cup in franchise history. Another phenomenal regular season has been secured, but if they can\u2019t make any noise come playoff time, they\u2019ll have to live with the shame again. The Bruins\u2019 All-Star Break hibernation period will end when they take on the Calgary Flames next Tuesday.\n\nThere\u2019s a storm coming in the Metropolitan The race for the top spot in the Metropolitan Division is heating up. The leading New York Rangers might\u2019ve started the season as a  top Eastern team , but the second-place Carolina Hurricanes have reigned supreme as of late, and only trail by two points. The \u2018Canes have won division titles in each of their last three seasons and while this year\u2019s campaign has been tough so far, Carolina has stayed resilient. The absence of netminder Frederik Andersen, who has been sidelined with a blood clotting issue since early November, has put extra pressure on Antti Raanta to stay consistent. Center Seth Jarvis has broken out this season and has been reliable on both ends of the ice. Jarvis totalled 40 points in his rookie season and already has 38 through 20 fewer games. His emergence has been huge for Carolina, who has benefited from his risk-taking and energetic play. All-Star Sebastian Aho, though, has been the Hurricanes\u2019 best player by far. As the top-line center, Aho can really do it all. He is elite defensively, forechecking, at winning faceoffs and at creating chances. His 54 points lead Carolina. The Hurricanes are star-studded; Jarvis and Aho are among three other \u2018Canes with 30 or more points. Carolina will have no problem making the playoffs, but winning the Metropolitan will be its main goal. The storm will resume next Tuesday when the Hurricanes host the Western Conference\u2019s best, the Vancouver Canucks.\n\nCanucks and Flames swap pieces If it wasn\u2019t clear that the Vancouver Canucks were all-in, landing Calgary Flames All-Star center Elias Lindholm made it obvious. Vancouver sent draft compensation, forward Andrei Kuzmenko and two prospect defensemen to land the touted Lindholm. Lindholm is a huge pickup for the Canucks. He is a high-scoring, two-way center that can generate points while also being reliable on special teams. Vancouver now has six All-Stars and is set to make it back to the postseason for the first time since 2019-20. This move is not surprising. The stout Canucks are buyers, and the underachieving Flames could likely be big sellers. Lindholm might be a pending unrestricted free agent, but his 32 points thus far made his name look shiny on the market. He could very well win the Selke Trophy and will thrive alongside Vancouver\u2019s other weapons. As for the Flames, acquiring a haul headlined by Kuzmenko isn\u2019t a bad deal. Although the winger has been inconsistent to say the least, a lower-stakes \u201cprove it\u201d situation might be what he needs to turn things around. Adding draft capital and prospects will also be beneficial for Calgary\u2019s future. With Lindholm\u2019s soon-to-be expiring contract on the backburner, the Canucks have their eyes on the prize: the Stanley Cup. Vancouver seeks its first in franchise history after falling short in all three of its past appearances. \u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of the Sundance Institute)\n\nBy Taryn Snyder February 01, 2024 at 10:21 am PST\n\nThis review contains spoilers for \u201cGhostlight\u201d and brief mentions of suicide. \u201cLet us know if you laugh and if you cry,\u201d said writer and co-director, Kelly O\u2019Sullivan, on the Sundance Film Festival\u2019s red carpet of the \u201cGhostlight\u201d premiere. \u201cGotta be both,\u201d added co-director Alex Thompson. Laugh and cry I did. Often, both at the same time.\n\n\u201cGhostlight,\u201d which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January, follows Dan, a construction worker as he joins a community theater production of \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d At first a form of escape, the production becomes increasingly intertwined with his own reality and forces him to face the recent death of his son by suicide.\n\nThe film\u2019s emotional flip-flop is a true testament to its masterful, and impressively fast, editing. In an incredible turnaround, the production wrapped on October 31 and was submitted to Sundance just four days later. The quality of the film and the depth of the emotional journey it takes its audience on is near unbelievable given this timeline.\n\nAt the height of humorous scenes, the film will cut to heart-wrenchingly tender moments. These paradoxical shifts leave both sentiments bubbling under the surface ready to be pulled right back up by another powerful scene. This settles the audience straight into the layered history of this story and the cycle of emotions that are so poignantly part of the human experience.\n\nPerhaps this is due to the fact that the film\u2019s fictitious leads Dan, Sharon and their daughter Daisy are played by the real-life family of Keith Kupferer, Tara Mallen and Katherine Mallen Kupferer, who depict the complexities of hurt and healing within a family dynamic. \u201cI would say there was very little reaching that went to create the character. We pretty much brought what we are and put it on camera,\u201d said Mallen on how their real-life family informed the characters. \u201cBut I also have to say in this case, Kelly wrote a screenplay that fit on us like a glove.\u201d\n\nThe ability to depict the essence of live theater within the film medium was one of the most impressive aspects of the film. The actors seamlessly transitioned between their performances within the play and the rest of the film. Mallen stated the process was like a PhD course in filmmaking and great ensemble theater.\n\nFor co-directors O\u2019Sullivan and Thompson, the mix of mediums didn\u2019t largely change their directorial approach. \u201cYou know, I think there\u2019s sort of this idea that on-camera has to be smaller,\u201d said O\u2019Sullivan. \u201cBut all of the actors we worked with are both great theater actors and on-camera actors. And so it was really just about capturing them.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Sullivan herself comes from a theater background, alongside much of the esteemed cast from the Chicago theater scene of Steppenwolf, Goodman Theatre and Writers Theatre, among others. O\u2019Sullivan likened the environment on set to that of summer camp. \u201cWe got to just delight in their presence and so it was the best. I\u2019m doubtful we will ever have another experience that\u2019s quite so fun,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said.\n\nThis set experience translated on-screen to the fictitious set of amateur actors preparing for their own production of the Shakespearean classic. We see playful Dan attempt to \u201cdance like no one\u2019s watching\u201d and the actors adapt to their middle-aged version of the teen romance. While at first resistant, Dan is quickly enveloped in the family that comes from live-theater ensembles.\n\nO\u2019Sullivan said she hopes people take away that \u201cit\u2019s okay to be silly with a group of people, and that can really help lighten the load of what it means to be alive.\u201d This depiction full of warmth and kindness received esteemed praise from cast member Brad Smith at the post-screening Q&A, who called it the \u201cbest film about theater I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nThroughout the story, the large through line between Dan\u2019s theater and home lives is his experience with grief after the loss of his son to suicide. The Sundance synopsis states, \u201cthe drama onstage starts to mirror his own life.\u201d This is taken to a much more literal extent than anticipated when the \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d depiction of suicide becomes increasingly intertwined with the story of his own son.\n\nThe vague film description provides a shock value as the story slowly reveals just how closely Dan\u2019s life follows that of the production. However, for the audience this vagueness of the film\u2019s description doesn\u2019t adequately prepare them for its content. Sundance screenings are unrated and oftentimes, provide limited information before premiering, but with such sensitive subjects, the audience is owed a content or subject warning.\n\nThe feature was bought by IFC Films and Sapan Studios, proving to be a successful Sundance debut for the dynamic duo of O\u2019Sullivan and Thompson, who found similar success at SXSW with their indie feature \u201cSaint Frances\u201d (2019).\n```"}

Director and co-writer Jack Begert\u2019s first feature film is marked by an experimental departure from traditional film format. For its boundary-pushing work, \u201cLittle Death\u201d was awarded The NEXT Innovator Award presented by Adobe at the Sundance Film Festival in January.\n\nWithin the film we see a merge of two distinct stories, each stylistically differentiated. In the first half, the audience enters the psychosis and dreamscape of Martin Solomon (David Schwimmer), a middle-aged filmmaker who\u2019s hooked on pharmaceutical drugs. To create this psychological re-imagining of reality, the filmmakers utilized AI-generated art, animation, CGI and VFX, or a \u201cbig blender of every trick we could possibly throw at the wall,\u201d as described by Begert during the Q&A following their premiere screening.\n\nMany of these techniques pull from Begert\u2019s music video background where he is known for working with the likes of Dominic Fike, Kendrick Lamar and SZA. While AI is minimally used in the grand scheme of the film, it still begged questions about the future use of the technology within filmmaking.\n\n\u201cI think every filmmaker needs to look at it very, very closely because ultimately, it comes down to stories, and how can these new tools help us tell the stories we want to tell, and how can they help us tell new stories?\u201d said Producer Darren Aronofsky in an interview with Deadline. \u201cBut that\u2019s why I think \u2018Little Death\u2019 is one of the most exciting films right now, is because Jack is really pushing those tools and asking a lot of questions of us.\u201d\n\nAnother Sundance premiere film, \u201cEno\u201d utilizes AI generative technology to create completely unique screenings each time the film is seen. There are 52 ten quintillion (meaning 19 zeros) possible versions of the film, which would take 200 whole years of non-stop watching to get through, explained the film\u2019s director of programming Brendan Dawes.\n\nWhile there are some key scenes that appear in every version, such as the explanation of generative art, everything from the scenes themselves to the order they appear to the music is reorganized. Editors Maya Tippett and Marley McDonald worked to create modules and scenes that could play together and maintain a narrative arc when reorganized.\n\nIn the press release, director Gary Hustwit explained, \u201cI kept asking myself, why does my film have to be the same every time it\u2019s shown?\u201d Through the non-replicable experience of watching a screening of \u201cEno,\u201d the film encapsulates the uniquely communal experience of live events.\n\nThe generative software also proved useful to situate the roughly 500 hours of archival footage on the documentary subject Brian Eno, a pioneer of ambient music and producer for artists from David Bowie to Talking Heads. The team plans to continue inputting more footage over time.\n\nAs the film reflects on the work and life of Eno, the ever-changing nature of the film mirrors that of natural memory \u2013 shifting and changing with new meanings as we look back.\n\nBoth the \u201cEno\u201d and \u201cLittle Death\u201d teams spoke of their AI use as a tool that required an intense amount of manpower and ability to utilize. \u201cWe had a whole super talented team of a lot of people who really put their blood, sweat and tears into this. I want to shout out the whole post [production] team,\u201d Begert said in the Q&A.\n\nIn the press release, Dawes responded to critics\u2019 concerns over AI taking away from the creativity of storytelling, writing, \u201cThe way we tell stories should always be evolving, and generative systems, if they\u2019re used in the spirit of creative advancement, are the next evolution in that journey.\u201d\n\nAlthough the films\u2019 own use of AI doesn\u2019t apply to many of the large concerns brought up during the Hollywood strikes in 2023, it certainly has opened the conversation for where the tool fits within the industry.\n```"}

(AP/Jacob Kupferman)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan February 01, 2024 at 2:20 am PST\n\nWriting about rookies has a perilous downside: it usually requires writing about bad teams. That\u2019s what makes Chet Holmgren (and writing about him) so fun. He has the ability and the opportunity to contribute to winning basketball, while most rookies are either too raw to do so or have the misfortune of being drafted to a rebuilding team. Unfortunately for Brandon Miller, he suffers from the latter affliction.\n\nDespite picking in the lottery for the past seven years and in 12 of the last 13 drafts going back to the Bobcats days, Charlotte has never produced consistent winning basketball. That\u2019s a tough environment for rookies to enter, hence why many Charlotte draftees have busted. Sure, Charlotte\u2019s front office probably hasn\u2019t been home to the league\u2019s best evaluators over the years, but it\u2019s also harder for rookies to develop without a competitive roster around them. Malik Monk, for example, Charlotte\u2019s choice at the No. 11 pick in 2017, has averaged more points per game and a higher field goal percentage in all three seasons since he left the Hornets than the four years he spent with them.\n\nBut with Miller and LaMelo Ball, Charlotte has a chance to buck this trend. They\u2019ll have to do it quickly, though. In the league\u2019s player empowerment era, Ball might not have much more patience for losing basketball, despite just signing his five-year max extension this past summer.\n\nFortunately for the Hornets, Miller entered the league with an NBA-ready playing style, and it has translated as expected. In early big boards for the 2023 draft, many prognosticators had Scoot Henderson ahead of Miller in the No. 2 overall position, but Miller wowed scouts with his rangy defense and shot creation at Alabama. He shot 38.4% from three as a freshman with an estimated seven-foot wingspan, although he didn\u2019t attend the combine for an official measurement.\n\nIn a league dominated by wings like Jayson Tatum and Kawhi Leonard, Miller\u2019s size and skillset screamed All-Star potential. He even idolizes Paul George, a further indication of how much he epitomizes the modern NBA.\n\nMiller sits in third among rookies in points per game with 15.1, behind only Victor Wembanyama and the aforementioned Holmgren, while shooting 43.5% from the field. The Hornets would surely like to see Miller improve his midrange shot in the coming seasons, but his accuracy from distance has been as good as advertised at 37.8%.\n\nLike many rookies before him, Miller\u2019s night-in, night-out performances have been all over the place. He\u2019s had seven single-digit-scoring performances and five games where\u2019s shot under 30%, some of which, unsurprisingly, overlap. But there have been recent signs that Miller is figuring out what it means to be a reliable nightly scorer.\n\nFor the first time this season, Miller scored 20-plus points in four consecutive games in January. Against the Spurs, Sixers, Timberwolves and Pistons, Miller posted 24, 23, 27 and 23 points, respectively. It\u2019s particularly impressive that his highest total in that stretch came against the T\u2019wolves, who own the league\u2019s second-best record (as of Tues., Jan. 30) and rank first in opponent points per game (107.4) ahead of the hard-nosed New York Knicks, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Boston Celtics.\n\nAdmittedly, Miller followed that four-game stretch with a pair of five and 12-point stinkers, but even then he bounced back with another 29 points against the Knicks.\n\nThis scoring stretch has given us some great highlights to analyze, including this sequence from the recent Knicks matchup: Under head coach Tom Thibodeau, the Knicks have been a stout defensive team that relies on physical defense from smaller players, including the 6-foot-5 Quentin Grimes, who faces a mismatch against Miller in this clip. With Miller having the size advantage, Grimes tries to battle Miller physically and make it hard for the Hornet to reach his spot. Despite Grimes\u2019 shoulder-to-shoulder contact, Miller never wavers through his move and still sinks his jumper as he bumps up against Grimes chest, drawing the and-one.\n\nThat ability to finish through contact is crucial for Miller at this stage in his career, considering he\u2019s still pretty thin. Miller can use his shooting threat to play make for others, too. From his Jan. 22 game against the Timberwolves, Miller expertly reads his opponents\u2019 zone defense to take advantage of the space he created. Once Ball passes the ball to Miller to initiate the play, Shake Milton steps up to harass Miller. The Hornets rookie then lightly pump fakes\u2014barely bringing the ball up an inch into his shooting motion\u2014so that Milton jumps, then dribbles towards the hoop. Recognizing Miller\u2019s threat, three-time Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert shifts from the right corner, where he was guarding the Hornets\u2019 JT Thor, to shut down Miller\u2019s chance of going to the rim. Realizing that Milton is chasing him and Gobert has left his man, Miller kicks the ball out to Thor, who nails the corner three.\n\nMiller has averaged an unexceptional 2.3 assists per game this season, but as long as he can leverage his shot to make a timely pass, he doesn\u2019t need to be a LeBron James-level passing forward. The former Alabama star is on an exciting trajectory early in his NBA career, and if he catches fire in the final months of the season, we may see a dark horse campaign Rookie of the Year.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/01/31/dodgers-meet-the-2024-bullpen/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 It\u2019s no secret that the 2024 Los Angeles Dodgers will have plenty of star power. From former MVPs Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman and Shohei Ohtani, to Cy Young candidates Walker Buehler, Tyler Glasnow and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, there will be high-profile names throughout both the team\u2019s lineup and starting rotation. But there is one aspect of the team that will often get overlooked, but could wind up determining whether or not the Dodgers accomplish their 2024 goals: the bullpen.\n\nAfter struggling mightily during the summer months last year, Los Angeles quietly had one of the best bullpens in baseball down the stretch. With the majority of the players from last year\u2019s unit returning, let\u2019s take a look at the key members of the Dodgers 2024 bullpen and the roles that they could play in the upcoming season.\n\nEvan Phillips\nOne of the biggest under-the-radar developments for the Dodgers in 2023 was the rise of Phillips as the team\u2019s closer. After 2022 closer Craig Kimbrel departed in free agency, the 28-year-old Phillips stepped into the role relatively seamlessly. Appearing in 62 games, he recorded 24 saves and had an impressive 2.05 ERA. The Dodgers are hoping that Phillips can carry his impressive form over into 2024 and continue to provide them a steady late-game presence.\n\nBrusdar Graterol\nAfter posting solid numbers his first three years in Los Angeles, Graterol took the next step toward elite status in 2023. Appearing in 68 games, Graterol posted a remarkable 1.20 ERA along with a 0.97 WHIP. Serving as the primary setup man to Phillips, he recorded seven saves and 19 holds. Graterol should once again be one of the Dodgers\u2019 top bullpen options in 2024.\n\nCaleb Ferguson\nAfter a strong 2022 season, Ferguson dropped off a bit in 2023. His ERA increased from 1.82 to 3.43, and he blew five of his eight save opportunities. The Dodgers are hoping that Ferguson can get return to 2022 form and play a key role out of the bullpen again in 2024.\n\nAlex Vesia\nTo say that Vesia\u2019s 2023 season was a roller coaster would be an understatement. After posting horrific numbers during the beginning of the year, he was optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma City, and spent nearly a month in the minors. Upon his return to the big leagues, however, Vesia looked much improved. From August 11 on, he allowed an earned run in just two of his 18 appearances. If he can carry his late-season form over into 2024, Vesia should be primed to play a key role out of the bullpen once again.\n\nJoe Kelly\nA fan favorite during his first stint with the Dodgers from 2019-2021, Kelly returned to Los Angeles at the trade deadline last season and picked up right back where he left off. After posting a 4.97 ERA during his first 31 appearances of the season with the Chicago White Sox, that number dropped to 1.74 with the Dodgers, with Kelly allowing an earned run in just one of his 11 appearances with the team. Kelly will turn 36 years old during the 2024 campaign, but the Dodgers are hoping that he still has another good year or two left in the tank.\n\nRyan Yarbrough\nAcquired at the trade deadline from Kansas City, Yarbrough proved to be a valuable long-relief option for the Dodgers during the stretch run last year. Pitching at least three innings in 10 of his 11 relief appearances, Yarbrough allowed more than two earned runs just twice. He should once again play a key role in Los Angeles\u2019s bullpen this season, and could potentially be available to make some starts as well if needed.\n\nYoung pitchers to watch\nWhile the aforementioned names should be the headliners, keep an eye on these young pitchers with the potential to enjoy breakout campaigns in 2024: After making their MLB debuts in 2023, Emmett Sheehan and Gavin Stone should be key options either in the rotation or out of the bullpen this season. Called up to the big leagues last September, USC baseball alum Kyle Hurt pitched two scoreless innings in his lone MLB appearance. He will compete for a spot on the 26-man roster this spring. Landon Knack, a second-round pick in 2020, should be in line to make his MLB debut at some point during the 2024 season.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Eniola Adeleke January 31, 2024 at 6:35 pm PST\n\nUSC track and field had an eventful weekend at the Razorback Invitational in Fayetteville, Arkansas \u2013 and they\u2019re just getting started. Nicknamed \u201cThe Fastest Indoor Track in the World,\u201d Randal Tyson Track Center welcomed some of the collegiate stage\u2019s fastest athletes over the weekend, 32 of which were Trojans. The two-day meet, hosted by defending NCAA indoor track champion Arkansas, also featured Florida, Oregon, Texas A&M, Georgia, and Kentucky. Fifteen of the 16 participating teams were Power 5 schools.\n\nGraduate student Allie Jones kicked off the weekend by winning the pentathlon with 4528 points, a school record and No. 10 on the all-time collegiate pentathlon list. For the uninitiated, the pentathlon is a five-event competition where each athlete performs a high jump, shot put and long jump in addition to racing in sprint hurdles and the 800m. Jones won three events in the competition: the 60m hurdles with a time of 8.20, the shot put with a personal best of 43-3/13.18m and the 800m with a career best of 2:11.74. Jones set four goals going into the meet: (1) qualify for nationals, (2) achieve a personal record, (3) break the school record and (4) break the meet record. She met three of those goals, missing the pentathlon meet record by 62 points.\n\nFor Jones, this season is personal. Last year, she fell sick soon before the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. In a meet where she was ranked No. 1, she finished fourth. \u201cThis [season] is a bit of a revenge tour,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s my last one. Go big or go home.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 electric performance was reminiscent of this same meet last year, where the men\u2019s 4x400 relay team delivered a standout performance for the Trojans. The squad, which featured Justin Braun, Ashton Allen, William Jones, and Johnnie Blockburger, ran the then-second-fastest time in the world at 3:04.12. The quartet went on to shave nearly a second off this time to place third at the NCAA Indoor Championships, moving up to second place on USC\u2019s all-time indoor list with a season-best of 3:03.16.\n\nOn Saturday, sophomore William Jones picked up where his record-setting teammate left off, winning the 400m dash with a world-leading time of 45.24. \u201cI finished the race and I was just happy. I wasn\u2019t even worried about the time at first,\u201d Jones said. His performance places him at No. 2 in USC history, second to only Olympic champion Michael Norman\u2019s 44.52 from the 2018 season.\n\nFellow sophomore JC Stevenson won the 60m dash with a personal record of 6.61 seconds, tying him at 8th overall in USC history. For the Trojan women, senior Temi Ojora now leads the NCAA with her personal record and winning mark of 45-2.25/13.77m in the triple jump contest. Ojora also shot up in USC\u2019s record books, moving to No. 2 all-time.\n\nTo round out the Trojans\u2019 action-packed weekend, freshman Nathan Cumberbatch set the USC freshman record for the 800m, reminiscent of Christine Mallard who set the equivalent record for the women\u2019s 400m dash at last year\u2019s meet. Cumberbatch finished fifth overall and he wasn\u2019t just fast for a freshman \u2014 he clocked a time of 1:47:78, which was the second-best time ever by a Trojan in the 800m.\n\nGoing into Week 2 of the indoor season, the USC men fell one place to No. 5 in the country while the women\u2019s team remained No. 4 according to the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association. Despite last weekend\u2019s achievements, the Trojans have got their eyes set on the NCAA Indoor Championships on March 8 and 9. \u201cThis is just the beginning. Last year around this time, I wasn\u2019t as fast as I am right now. I just know there\u2019s a lot to come,\u201d William Jones said. \u201cI think all the pieces are coming together well to have a really great showing at nationals,\u201d Allie Jones added.\n\nBut first, USC will head to Boston, Massachusetts, to compete at the Eagle Elite Invitational on Friday, February 9.\n```"}

While both Stack and Shaw have been involved with USG since stepping foot on campus, they believe personal experiences speak to what needs to change on campus.\n\nShaw spent his first year at USC on electronic benefit transfer (EBT), receiving food stamps. One way the Stack Shaw ticket hopes to increase accessibility is to help campus dining options accept EBT as a form of payment. The Trader Joe\u2019s and Target in USC Village are the only places directly on campus that currently accept EBT. Stack and Shaw say they are planning on working with Seeds Marketplace to help them accept EBT.\n\n\u201cI have classes that end at 9:50 a.m., and then I have one at 10 a.m.,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cI can\u2019t go to Trader Joe\u2019s in the village or I\u2019ll be late for my class. However, Seeds is right there on my way to class.\u201d\n\nLast semester was filled with disagreement over USG proceedings, which led to numerous protests and sit-ins during senate meetings. Stack and Shaw see a need to turn senate meetings into a safe space where all discourse is welcome.\n\n\u201cI think letting people know that this is a safe space they can come with their concerns, their life, and what\u2019s going on on campus [is important],\u201d Shaw said. Stack added that building stronger attendance at senate meetings is a priority, and he hopes to implement an incentive system to catalyze this change.\n\n\u201cMaybe get a coupon to something at Seeds,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nAnother key experience in Shaw and Stack\u2019s lives is Greek life, as both are members of a fraternity at USC. Greek life has made its mark on USG elections in the past, and the current president is in the Greek system. However, one of the tickets in the upcoming election looks to change this and takes a critical stance on the Greek system.\n\nShaw and Stack said they embrace their experiences in the Greek system. Shaw said one of the many benefits of Greek life include the potential to build a community and network. I found there is definitely a good network of people who I can, you know, go to with my problems,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cI also [found] just genuine people.\u201d\n\nBut they also believe the system is imperfect and in need of change. One aspect they hope to address is the disconnect between USC and the fraternities that disaffiliated from the university in August 2022. Both Stack and Shaw are members of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, which disaffiliated from USC.\n\n\u201cWe could try to start maybe bridging the gap between the disaffiliated fraternities back to the school so they have a little more overreach by the school,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nAmid the need for change in accessibility, Stack and Shaw embrace their identity as Trojans and hope to spread this philosophy.\n\n\u201cOur lives right now are already so amazing at this university,\u201d Stack said. \u201cWe want to highlight that with pride.\u201d```"}

(Photo Courtesy of Shakko Kitsune)\n\nBy Paige Shea January 31, 2024 at 5:57 pm PST\n\nHaute couture is returning to the runway, thanks to one of fashion\u2019s most legendary names: John Galliano, Maison Margiela\u2019s current creative director. Maison Margiela\u2019s newest SS24 couture collection debuted last Thursday in what can only be described as a theatrical, surreal runway show located underneath the Pont Alexandre III in Paris. Utilizing the natural moonlight and concrete streets of Paris, Galliano owned the night time atmosphere, making the architecture of the city the backdrop for his stunning design.\n\nAs described in Maison Margiela\u2019s press release regarding the new collection, the runway show was \u201ca walk through the underbelly of Paris, offline.\u201d Instead of a typical runway show made streamlined by the \u201cquiet luxury\u201d invasion of the fashion industry, Galliano\u2019s Margiela show was a wholly intoxicating performance, producing an energy so palpable that it transcends through thousands of videos circulating online. Galliano conjured the spirit of Brassa\u00ef's famous photographs that depict the darker side of Parisian nightlife. As if a Toulouse-Lautrec painting had come to life, Galliano\u2019s models strode from the streets of Paris to a decrepit \u201cspeakeasy\u201d constructed just for the show.\n\nThe night began with a dramatic musical performance by \u201cLucky Love,\u201d a French Freddy Mercury impersonator and drag queen, followed by a black-and-white short film by Baz Luhrmann. Leon Dame, a prolific model for Margiela since 2018, opened the show in a spine-binding corset, sprinting to the runway as if running from something sinister, clutching his body, and then proceeding to stride.\n\nThe models who walked the show took notes from Dame\u2019s theatrics. Some were doubled over as if in pain, some were teetering down the runway as if ready to tip over, some walked gracefully, and some moved stiffly, as if being controlled by an omniscient puppeteer or animatronics. In a new move for Galliano, the models were all of varying body types, but not in a way that felt performative. Rather, the difference in body types of the models exhibited the shaping of the clothes in diverse ways, adding to the striking lines of the collection.\n\nLegendary makeup artist Pat McGrath did the doll-like makeup for the show, giving the models glossy, latex-like skin that appeared to be plastic, making them appear as animatronic dolls brought to life. With disheveled hair and doll-like skin, the entire show gave a transcendental feel, eliciting an atmosphere of a bygone, underground Moulin Rouge Paris through the haunting ghosts of Paris past. Actress Gwendoline Christie closed the show in a latex gown, embodying a porcelain doll with paper-pale skin and blonde ringlet curls.\n\nThis new collection, which Galliano spent 12 months designing, emphasized the limits and malleability of the human body, with painful-looking corsets pulling models\u2019 bodies in unnatural ways. Completely sheer, chiffon-like garments contrasted with heavier pieces such as heavy trench coats, scarves, and sweaters, but the motif of silhouette-shaping corsets remained the same throughout. Galliano created 15 new composition techniques to bring his vision to life, including \u201cseamlace,\u201d \u201cmilletrage,\u201d and \u201cretrograding,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nThe couture show was reminiscent of the dramatic and avant-garde shows that Alexander McQueen and Galliano were known for in the 1990s; it has been a while since the fashion world has seen anything of that caliber until last week, and certainly not since the social media age. After being fired from his iconic tenure at Dior as creative director in 2011 due to an antisemitic rant, Galliano has kept a relatively low-profile since joining Maison Margiela as its creative director in 2014. Known for staging his camp, dramatic fashion shows with historical nods to bygone eras, it appears that Galliano is returning to his M.O. with the most daring collection he has produced in decades, reminiscent of what made him an icon in the first place and captivating fashion enthusiasts worldwide.\n\nFor Gen Z fashion lovers who have only seen Galliano\u2019s and McQueen\u2019s theatrical runway shows in archival videos, magazines, or articles, this show is a resurgence of haute couture eliciting nostalgia from the \u201890s runway magic. However, even with obvious historical motifs, the show felt strikingly modern and innovative. As Vogue\u2019s Creative Editorial Director Mark Guiducci wrote, Maison Margiela\u2019s SS24 couture collection is \u201cThe John Galliano Show My Generation Has Been Waiting For.\u201d```"}

Nunis could be the first Black vice president in three years. As the only candidates without formal USG experience, they hope to challenge the status quo. Dacity and Nunis said that their lack of USG experience is an advantage. \u201cIt allows us to take a step back and really think about, does the USG serve the students the way the students deserve?\u201d Dacity said.\n\nAs an event productions manager, Nunis says they\u2019ve worked to bring a lot of different club events to life. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what every club is doing and how they operate and how the cultures within each club vary,\u201d Nunis said. \u201cI think it\u2019s such a strength for me, someone who is outside of USG, to come into USG.\u201d\n\nDacity said they draw inspiration from Maebe A. Girl, a drag queen who was elected to the Silver Lake Neighborhood Council in 2019 and is currently running for Congress. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m running in drag is because it\u2019s about expression. A lot of queer people, no matter what our pronouns are, no matter if we\u2019re going in or out of introductions and asking people to call us by pronouns, at the end of the day, we don\u2019t have control of perception,\u201d Dacity said. \u201cIt\u2019s my method of taking back the way I\u2019m perceived.\u201d\n\nDacity and Nunis are both involved in several student organizations and cite their experience in clubs such as the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation and Delta Kappa Alpha (DKA), a professional cinema society, as integral to their campaign. Their first priority is ensuring the student body\u2019s basic needs are met. As outsiders, they also prioritize transparency and communication in their platform.\n\nThe duo have a staunch anti-Greek Life stance and plan to address student food insecurity, USG funding transparency, divestment and USC\u2019s role in the gentrification of the South Los Angeles community. They are also pushing for the removal of monuments related to antisemitic or otherwise problematic views. \u201cWe\u2019re not a mini government; we\u2019re a student body,\u201d Dacity said. \u201cThat\u2019s why if you look at our ticket platform every single thing is about students. It\u2019s not about Fryft or things that are arbitrary. It\u2019s about genuine humans.\u201d\n\nNunis said that they believe humor offers a way to further understand the student body and its struggles and can encourage truer connection. \u201cWe bring a sense of humor to our campaign that brings out the joy in people,\u201d Nunis said. \u201cThen they\u2019re like, \u2018Wait a minute. I feel like I can really talk to you because you\u2019re being real,\u2019...if we\u2019re always being real with you, you have to be with us too. It just comes out. You can\u2019t help it.\u201d\n\nTo the students who may disagree with their platform, Nunis has a message: \u201cWhat we\u2019re pushing for is not for you guys to like us. It\u2019s for you to trust us,\u201d Nunis said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to make a difference, whether you love it or hate it.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Dacity is formally on the USG ballot as \u201cDacity.\u201d We edited this article to reflect the change.\n```"}

The fires took the lives of over 100 people with many still missing. The community\u2019s residents, animals and businesses are still trying to recover from the fires\u2019 long-term aftermath.\n\nMany local organizations on Maui and the neighboring islands uphold their mission to provide resources and support to those affected by the tragedy. Many respondents from the Maui Humane Society have rescued or provided medical assistance to animals and livestock since the night of the fire.\n\nNikki Russell, Director of Community Outreach at MHS, said that law enforcement officers searched for injured animals and distributed food to droves of people who fled to the beach for safety with their pets immediately after the fires. Shortly after that night, the center received many animals with burns and their veterinarians tended to their wounds.\n\nAs of January 16, 2024, MHS brought in 786 animals from the Lahaina burn zone and helped 129 animals get adopted. One hundred and ninety one animals were returned to owners and 152 cats were transferred to the Lahaina Cat Sanctuary. For those that could not be saved, they provided cremations for their owners. Of the nearly 300 animals in their care, about two thirds of them are cats.\n\n\u201cWe have sent cats over to Cat Cafe Maui where they are getting adopted into forever homes, so that\u2019s lovely,\u201d Russell said. \u201cThey have a lot of people who visit from off island, from the mainland. I know that some of the Lahaina kitties have moved to the mainland at this point.\u201d\n\nFor the residents left behind, Maui Food Bank\u2019s Executive Director Richard Yust said the organization continues to provide food, water and other essentials to residents in need. The food bank also partners with disaster relief hubs. Yust said that they provide food for over 20 of them including county distribution hubs.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a steady increase in demand for hunger relief,\u201d Yust said. \u201cPre-fires we were doing roughly 17,000 people a month throughout the county and then it\u2019s slowly been increasing. I would say [in] October [we] probably [had] closer to about 40,000 people that we\u2019ve done food relief for.\u201d\n\nIn the three months following the fires, MFB distributed more food than they typically would in a whole year. Yust said the factors that caused the increased need include separated families and job loss. The food bank also saw a rise in demand after the downturn in tourism also negatively impacted the local economy.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, our efforts were geared toward the shelters and then it shifted to the distribution hubs and then to all of our partner agencies,\u201d Yust said. \u201cNow it\u2019s expanded even more up to other organizations throughout the community.\u201d\n\nEliza Talbot, Vice President of Business Advocacy and Community Relations at the Chamber of Commerce Hawaii, said the organization began a Business Relief Fund to assist businesses in recovery to continue operations. They also set up a resource page on their site as a directory for finding shelter, food and assistance. Additionally, the page includes emergency alerts and grant opportunities.\n\n\u201cThere were thousands of affected businesses,\u201d Talbot said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also seen that it\u2019s had impacts on businesses throughout the state now because a lot of our businesses do partnerships and different things with a lot of the businesses that were affected in Maui, so it\u2019s really had an impact on the whole state.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce made a huge donation alongside other contributing companies like Amazon. Talbot said there is plenty of decision making that happens which involves local lawmakers, businesses and the community to determine what\u2019s best.\n\n\u201cTourism was the number one industry for Maui, but it\u2019s starting to come back,\u201d Talbot said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult balance that the state has to really walk a fine line because we need the income. We need to keep the businesses vital and thriving, but we also need to be very mindful about the different challenges that our residents are facing right now.\u201d\n\nThe Maui community continues to be in long-term recovery nearly six months after the fires in August. The local organizations first prioritized immediate needs such as medical and housing that funds and support helped tackle. While the focus persists on rehousing residents and finding them enough food, the focus has shifted to finding sustainable solutions for the community and the businesses there.\n\nResources from the rest of the state and the rest of the country continue to be allocated to rebuild properties, find permanent homes for the residents and animals and reestablish local businesses.\n\nThe humane society is working on finding permanent outcomes and homes for the animals. Russell said that it\u2019s stressful for the animals to be in a shelter setting which is why adoption is such a huge focus. For their owners and other residents, Yust said the best way for people to support them is to host virtual food drives or visit MFB\u2019s website and donate financially. There, he and his team are able to leverage every dollar donated.\n\n\u201cWe really need to make sure that Lahaina doesn\u2019t get forgotten,\u201d Talbot said.\n```"}

Cooper is one of many 2024 NFL Draft prospects that has spent this week in Frisco, Texas attempting to improve their draft stock at the East-West Shrine Bowl. (AP/Sam Craft)\n\nBy Felipe Londo\u00f1o January 31, 2024 at 1:41 am PST\n\nFRISCO, Texas \u2014 The seasons are changing on the football calendar. With only the Super Bowl left to play and collegiate showcases soon to kick off around the country, fantasy football discourse is slowly turning into mock draft extravaganza, and fans are beginning to shift their focus from their own team to whatever prospect they\u2019re ready to crown as their franchise\u2019s savior \u2014 draft season is upon us!\n\nThe true beginning of the draft calendar was on Saturday in Frisco, Texas, where the East and West teams of the East-West Shrine Bowl took the field in the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 practice facility in preparation for the 99th Shrine game. Talk of Troy has the privilege of attending the prestigious game, which has produced names like Brock Purdy and Isaiah Pacheco in recent years, so in preparation, let\u2019s run down ten big names in Frisco who project to be difference-makers at the next level.\n\nEdgerrin Cooper, LB, Texas A&M\nArguably the biggest name at this year\u2019s Shrine Bowl, Texas A&M linebacker Edgerrin Cooper has a strong chance of being the first Shrine player drafted in April. Boasting solid size for the position at 6-foot-two, 227 pounds, Cooper is a gifted athlete with good short-area quickness and lateral agility to fly downhill and horizontally to erase any type of run play, all while boasting the movement skills to comfortably trail most tight ends and running backs in man coverage. He needs to clean up his awareness in zone coverages and add some mass to be more enforcing on early downs, yet in totality, he projects as a great WILL backer at the next level where he can fly from sideline to sideline and assist on blitzes and simulated pressures.\n\nJonathon Brooks, RB, Texas\nWhile he missed the final four games of the season with a torn ACL and will not be participating in the actual game, few names will garner more attention from scouts and media in Frisco than running back Jonathan Brooks, who, despite only playing ten games on the year, accumulated over 1400 yards from scrimmage to help the Longhorns to a college football playoff appearance. A baby by NFL draft standards, having only one year of starting experience and entering the draft at twenty years old, Brooks is in many ways a developmental prospect. His vision is not NFL-ready, and his current frame and play strength are not at the level where he can be a legitimate three-down back in the NFL right now. With that said, he\u2019s a phenomenal athlete with good one-cut ability and the speed to take house calls from the backfield. Brooks is a project, but if a team commits to getting him stronger and developing his vision, he could be a premier back sooner rather than later.\n\nChristian Mahogany, OG, Boston College\nShrine Bowl practice tweets have overtaken football Twitter over the last four days, and few players have been mentioned more than Boston College guard Christian Mahogany, who projects to be one of the biggest risers in the draft process over the coming months. A good athlete with solid size at six-foot-two, 318 pounds, and a basketball background, Mahogany projects as an ideal option for heavy zone-run teams where he can use his good quickness and lateral agility to execute scoop and reach blocks and excel in space on pulls and second-level opportunities. Mahogany will be a solid pass protector from day one due to his adept processing when defending stunts and blitzes and solid play strength to anchor on bull rushes, but he will need to improve his hand timing in pass pro to better defend twitchy interior linemen who often get the better of him on speed rushes.\n\nLeonard Taylor III, DT, Miami (FL)\nLeonard Taylor is one of the more intriguing prospects at the Shrine Bowl because, despite enduring a disappointing 2023 season by his standards, he\u2019s still projected as an early-round draft pick by draft analysts and scouts alike. His evaluation requires nuance; he underwent a position change this past offseason, changing his body to play as a true nose tackle rather than his accustomed three-technique position in Miami\u2019s fluid front. Watching Miami games, it is evident Taylor is playing out of position \u2013 At six-foot-three and in a linar frame with, he doesn\u2019t have the body to anchor against the runs like nose tackles are supposed to \u2013 yet even out of his comfort zone, there are still flashes in his game: a great initial get-off, heavy hands and violence at the point of contact, and the flashing of a variety of pass rush moves to beat centers and guards when not double-teamed. To this point, Taylor has not practiced in Frisco as he recovers from a late-season injury, yet the interview process promises to be crucial for him as he meets with teams about his fit at the next level. If Taylor is picked by the right team with a clear physiological and coaching plan for him to help transition back to a dominant three-technique, watch out.\n\nMalik Washington, WR, Virginia\nAnother player who has taken Frisco by storm, Malik Washington is quickly rising as one of the better slot wide receiver prospects in this year\u2019s draft. Transferring from Northwestern prior to the 2023 season, Washington enjoyed a breakout season in 2023 where he racked up 1426 receiving yards and nine touchdowns on 110 receptions, more production than in his four years in Evanston combined. Washington projects as a safety blanket from the slot in the NFL, where he\u2019ll be able to leverage the underneath and intermediate areas of the field if given free releases due to his understanding of leverage and good suddenness, alongside very good hands to haul in inaccurate balls and maintain control through contact. He\u2019ll never win consistently outside due to his diminutive frame at five-foot-eight, 192 pounds, and should not be trusted as a field-stretcher due to his average long speed, but if plugged into the right system, he can be a productive player in the slot for years to come.\n\nJa\u2019Tavion Sanders, TE, Texas\nJa\u2019Tavion \u201cJT\u201d Sanders enters the draft as one of the most intriguing skill players in the class. At six-foot-four, 250 pounds, he\u2019s slightly undersized for a tight end yet moves extremely well for the position, enabling him to leverage all three areas of the field well; he excels on screens and short area routes, can run intermediate-deep routes like posts and corners and can even stretch the field vertically and horizontally on crossers and verts with good long speed. The biggest question mark regarding Sanders will be his blocking ability, as he often takes poor angles in his blocks and showcases below-average play strength at the point of attack, making him susceptible to be overpowered by edge defenders and linebackers. Sanders functions as a hybrid between a receiver and tight end, yet that\u2019s as much of an intriguing proposition as it is a scary one; whatever team drafts him must either A) know how to use him in a hyper-specific role or B) be committed to developing his run blocking skills so he can truly be an ace tight end. Like Leonard Taylor, Sanders is not practicing in Frisco as he recovers from an injury, yet the interview process could be just as important for him as teams figure out his fit and willingness to adapt at the next level.\n\nEvan Anderson, NT, Florida Atlantic\nOne of the best players in the AAC this past fall, Evan Anderson is undoubtedly circled on the draft boards of any team that runs a predominantly 3-4 defense. While his size may be below average at six-foot and a half, he\u2019s well built at 318 pounds with an incredibly thick lower half which allows him to dominate as a run stuffer; with tree trunks for legs, he can stand tall against guard/center double teams, reaches, and drive blocks with tremendous lower body strength, also showing solid flexibility for his size to lower his weight and anchor \u2013 almost offensive tackle-like. He won\u2019t offer you much pass rush upside due to his poor get-off and lack of urgency in his hands, but that won\u2019t be his job at the NFL level. As a nose tackle, he\u2019ll be asked to command double teams and not lose, exactly what he can do. Anderson may not go early due to his specialized position, yet it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if he quickly emerged as one of the most impactful 2024 Shrine Bowl players in the coming years.\n\nGarret Greenfield, OT, South Dakota State\nIf you were to survey the general population on who they think the best player in the 2024 NFL draft is based on their look, South Dakota State left tackle Garret Greenfield would amass his fair share of votes. At six-foot-six, 310 pounds in a linear, well-defined frame, he looks like your prototypical tackle. Moreover, he also enjoyed an incredibly illustrious career at SDSU, starting for four years for the Jackrabbits, his first two at right tackle and the last two on the left side, all while playing 55 straight games en route to two FCS championships. He\u2019s a good run blocker who wins with good initial quickness and hand placement to well position, able to execute on both gap and zone schemes. His biggest question mark will be in his development as a pass protector, as he shows good hand usage and anchor to win versus bull rushes but shows questionable lateral agility and foot quickness to match speed rushers inside or outside \u2013 a real concern as he\u2019ll be facing much better athletes at the NFL level. A transition to guard is certainly not off the table.\n\nJalen Coker, WR, Holy Cross\nThe NFL hasn\u2019t seen a Holy Cross draft pick in 35 years, yet that could very well change this year after wide receiver Jalen Coker\u2019s massive season for the Crusaders, where he led all FCS receivers with 15 touchdown receptions. At six-foot-one, 218 pounds, Coker has average measurables and also looks like a solid, albeit unspectacular athlete on tape, yet he wins over and over on routes with tremendous understanding of leverage, fantastic short area quickness, and creativity in his route running, dominating the underneath-intermediate level. He can win versus man and zone, shows very good ball skills on tape and offers solid yards-after-catch ability with good field vision and solid elusiveness. Expect Coker to transition to more of a z-slot role in the NFL \u00e0 la Puka Nacua due to very good route running but lack of explosiveness, and if he falls in the right system, don\u2019t be surprised if he sees immediate NFL success like Nacua and other mid-late round receivers in recent drafts.\n\nQwan\u2019tez Stiggers, CB, Toronto Argonauts\nWith strong performances during practices in Frisco, cornerback Qwant\u2019tez Stiggers is edging closer to making NFL draft history: this coming April, he could become only the third player drafted without any NCAA experience. Unable to play college football due to a family tragedy in 2019, Stiggers worked multiple jobs before getting an opportunity to play in the Fan Controlled Football League, where he excelled and caught the attention of Canadian Football League teams. He joined the Toronto Argonauts for the 2023 season and looked right at home, earning Rookie of the Year honors for his play. While having unimpressive measurables at six feet, 197 pounds, Stiggers makes up for it with his aggressive, physical brand of football. He\u2019s a ball hawk with good instincts to anticipate errant throws or outmuscle receivers at the catch point to force interceptions or incompletions. He shows good range to cover ground quickly while enforcing his will on the offense; he finished his rookie campaign in the CFL with 56 tackles and a second-most five interceptions among all defenders. Stiggers has turned eyes during his first few days in Frisco, and a big performance on Thursday could go a long way to helping him make history.\n```"}

Students express concern and confusion about the affordability of dining options at USC Village.  Expand Dining Hall meal-swipe at the USC Village. (Photo by Michael Chow)  By   Heli Ruiz January 30, 2024 at 10:01 pm PST \n \n \nDining at USC seems easy with the USCard, but the service is more complicated than it appears. The idea behind the service is that students can use their ID cards to dine on or off campus, giving students a wide range of food types and price ranges to choose from. However, the ID card can only be used as a payment method in specific instances. USC offers three payment methods through students\u2019 ID cards: discretionary funds, meal swipes and dining dollars. Discretionary funds are a way to use the student ID as a debit card at limited locations. Meal swipes can only be used at USC dining halls. Dining dollars are from a prepaid balance you can purchase through USC that you can only use on campus. With limited dining options available on campus, many students go off campus to the USC Village for a wider variety of choices. While discretionary funds can be used at some places in the Village, the overall lack of affordability compels some students to use their dining dollars and meal swipes. \u201cI am on the meal plan, so I have more of those swipes, and I really like all of the options here at Campus Center,\u201d said Ben Feldman, a freshman majoring in theatre. \u201cWith the meal plan I have, it is definitely more affordable to eat at than the Village.\u201d The conversation around affordability seemed to shift in 2021 when restaurants at the USC Village started accepting discretionary funds. While this was a welcomed change, only  five places  in the USC Village currently accept discretionary funds from USCards: Rock & Reilly\u2019s, City Tacos, Pizza Please, Greenleaf and Stout. While students await further updates and changes to USC\u2019s dining system, some have a clear idea about what businesses they want to see on campus. \u201cA McDonald\u2019s would be nice,\u201d said sophomore Ivan Ibarra-Moreira. \u201cMaybe something like a [Raising] Cane\u2019s or something like that in the Village would be nice,\u201d said Khusi Choudhary, a senior majoring in computer science.\n```"}

UCLA SAS led the call to action where they presented a petition with their demands during a meeting of the ASUCLA Board of Directors. The deadline falls between ASUCLA\u2019s next meeting on Feb. 7 and the meeting where they will officially vote on the demands on Feb. 23.\n\n\u201cOur deadline will be Feb. 14 where if we don\u2019t have a decision from them by then, we\u2019re going to continue organizing, finding other ways to influence the school to change its consumption practices,\u201d said Charlie Walner, UCLA political science student, UCLA SAS organizing committee member and petition creator. Walner believes that the UCLA student body is in support of their mission.\n\n\u201cMany students at UCLA either are past Starbucks workers or know Starbucks workers and they\u2019ve heard how draining, manipulative and awful the management can be there,\u201d Walner said. \u201cWe also see everyday on the news stories about workers being fired for trying to unionize their locations. So, I think there\u2019s a general consensus among students that we don\u2019t want to have a company like this on campus.\u201d\n\nDuring the ASUCLA meeting where the petition was presented, students spoke out about Starbucks\u2019 alleged \u201cunion-busting\u201d campaign, labor rights violations and anti-free speech censorship. The petition elaborates on these sentiments and urges UCLA to terminate its licensing agreement with Starbucks, as well as divest from and liquidate its investments with the company. The petition also mentions replacing the establishment with an alternative coffee shop on campus.\n\n\u201cOur petition is essentially telling them, students don\u2019t support [ASUCLA] purchasing Starbucks products and we want you to switch to a more ethical coffee supplier,\u201d said Walner.\n\nIn a statement to Annenberg Media, Starbucks spokesperson Andrew Trull said, \u201cAs a company, we respect our partners\u2019 right to organize, freely associate, engage in lawful union activities and bargain collectively without fear of reprisal or retaliation \u2014 and remain committed to our stated aim of reaching ratified contracts for union-represented stores in 2024.\u201d\n\nTrull also shared that the company had reached out in December to the president of Workers United, Lynne Fox, in order to \u201chelp find a path forward that prioritizes the needs of our partners, break the impasse between parties and help us progress store-by-store negotiations \u2014 with the aim of reaching ratified contracts for represented stores this year. We continue to engage in dialogue with Workers United, consistent to this goal.\u201d\n\nTrull added that Starbucks representatives have reached tentative agreements for nearly 30 sections of a draft collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represent partners at a store near Pittsburgh.\n\nMicaela Aragon, a senior studying labor studies and a member of UCLA SAS who spoke at the meeting, noted Starbucks\u2019 prominence in student life. \u201c[Starbucks] wants to be the drink of choice, basically, for college students, for high school students,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wants to be the aspirational brand, and in the past few years it most definitely has accomplished this goal. However, I think it\u2019s really amazing to see people say \u2018not anymore, not now, not here.\u2019\u201d\n\nUSC freshman psychology student Mykalah King had a different take on the issue. \u201cI personally don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any issue with having a Starbucks on campus,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that it being on a college campus, a lot of kids aren\u2019t from here. And I think that Starbucks being a chain is something that\u2019s familiar for a lot of kids to go to or connect about.\u201d\n\nOther USC students voiced their support for the unionization efforts of Starbucks workers. \u201cI\u2019m generally in favor of unionization because it\u2019s kind of their way of fighting back, so to speak.

This year\u2019s conference, which was held at USC\u2019s Town & Gown, was titled \u201cDemocracy on the line? 2024 and Beyond.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real challenge is the type of people being elected to office,\u201d said Politico columnist Jonathan Martin. A closed primary is when one can only participate if they are an eligible voter who is registered with that specific primary\u2019s political party. Voter registration for states with closed primaries includes a party affiliation question, so independent voters are not able to participate.\n\nMartin, the moderator of the discussion, questioned two panelists on why the Democratic and Republican parties do not want election reform. \u201cI think that both parties are okay with being 51% of a declining market share in this political duopoly,\u201d said Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America. Troiano also emphasized the importance of three main election reforms: non-partisan primaries, ranked-choice voting and gerrymandering reform.\n\n\u201cVery extreme right and left candidates are winning elections, and now they don\u2019t have to rely on the big traditional fundraising circles that they would normally have,\u201d said Former Washington Secretary of State Kimberly Wyman. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s the biggest challenges and needs structural reform.\u201d\n\nTroiano agreed with Wyman on campaign finance reform and also focussed on why election reforms would combat the disenfranchisement of independent voters in states with closed primaries. Troiano believed the reforms would be beneficial to both parties. \u201cThe argument for Republicans is that you can stop losing state-wide if you start nominating more mainstream candidates,\u201d Troiano said. \u201cThe argument to Democrats is this is the future voters that you can start courting at the primary level.\u201d\n\nMartin then questioned the effectiveness of non-partisan primaries even with gerrymandering reform in places like Seattle, where voters will \u201celect a democratic member of Congress no matter how you slice the county.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot you can do, and we\u2019re kind of living in our own little silos geographically,\u201d Martin said.\n\nRanked-choice voting was also discussed by the panelists as a possible reform to make voting measures more non-partisan. \u201cMany think that people of color stand a better chance, particularly women, in ranked choice. Do you agree with that?\u201d asked a member of the audience during the question portion of the panel. \u201cThey do find that it is advantageous to these communities in part because it deals with this issue of vote splitting,\u201d Troiano said in response to the question. \u201cAfter it was used in New York City, for example, that helped the city council become the most diverse, majority women council that they\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nAttendee Nivea Krishnan, a senior majoring in public policy and economics, said she enjoyed the final panel the most, out of the four hosted throughout the day. \u201cI\u2019m doing my senior thesis on ranked-choice voting,\u201d Krishnan said. \u201cWith today\u2019s polarized landscape, it\u2019s important to think of state legislation.\u201d\n\nEach panel held during the conference focused on a different topic, such as election disinformation and the upcoming 2024 presidential elections. Each discussion provided insight from a variety of expert speakers. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with the way our democracy is functioning today, that our same democracy doesn\u2019t give us the tools to fix,\u201d Traiano concluded at the end of the conference.\n```"}

However, voter turnout among these communities continues to lag behind rates seen in white, non-Latino communities. A new study from USC Center for Inclusive Democracy found that while Asian-Americans, Blacks, and Latinos make up nearly 30% of those eligible to vote, they represented only 22% of all votes cast.\n\nMINDY ROMERO: People of color are more numerous. They are certainly impacting elections. They\u2019re having a say at the ballot box, but it\u2019s just not representative. Right. So, it could be larger given that, their share of the population. They are underrepresented because we have turnout rates that, are disparate, different by race and ethnicity. That means that each group\u2019s share of those casting your ballot in an election is less than their share of the overall population or of the eligible voter population.\n\nThat was USC Center for Inclusive Democracy President and Founder Mindy Romero speaking today about her organization\u2019s recently released study showing persisting low turnout rates among minority communities. Members of underrepresented groups in Southern California, including high school senior Jonathen Ortiz, say there are many hurdles that stand in the way of solving this continuing issue.\n\nJONATHNEN ORTIZ: I think one, it could just be the fact that maybe we\u2019re not educated on it as much as like other people in different areas, and also maybe because we feel as minorities that democracy hasn\u2019t done enough for us. And because of that, we\u2019re not really motivated to do a change because we believe that democracy is too slow and otherwise maybe a closed mindset of just not voting. It is our mindset, and it\u2019s the decision that a lot of people take because we feel like we don\u2019t really have a voice.\n\nHowever, despite these challenges, community leaders such as high school teacher Joel Snyder are attempting to change the status quo one lesson at a time.\n\nJOEL SNYDER: it\u2019s not a surprise that, that voting rates and registration rates have lagged, in populations of communities of color and that\u2019s something we\u2019ve worked really hard, at our school and in our program, to counteract by, pre-registering, all seniors registering eligible seniors and then, working to get out the vote in our community. We are a get out the vote campaign for the community because their voices aren\u2019t heard in certain ways without voting. And obviously there are many ways to have your voice heard, but voting is one of the primary ones.\n\nIf fully mobilized, the USC Center for Inclusive Democracy expects the millions of eligible non-voters of color to have a transformative and immediate impact in the 2024 elections.\n\nFor Annenberg Radio, I\u2019m Aidan Williams.\n```"}

The rise of artificial media has raised questions of the ethical implications and what social media platforms, and the government can do.\n\nJack Krueger, a freshman communications major at USC, shared his reaction to seeing the AI-generated images of Swift.\n\n\"I knew immediately they were fake, because they were so obscene. And, you know, you wouldn\u2019t imagine Taylor Swift doing what was portrayed in the images. But I also did see immediately that it had like over 40 million views, which I think was the main shocker, just like how widespread it became, how many people were sharing it to like maybe their friends or other people and commenting and reposting it like that was kind of scary.\"\n\nMillions viewed the image in the 17 hours it was live on the former Twitter platform.

So there are different ways that Taylor could proceed against the individuals that distributed the deepfakes. There are several states that do allow individuals to pursue private right of actions, especially if it\u2019s for pornographic depictions of an individual in a deepfake. The issue often, though, with these type of deepfakes in their distribution is that it\u2019s unclear who created the deepfakes, and oftentimes the individuals responsible, they might even be overseas, or they might be using a VPN or other means to kind of hide who they are and whose accounts.\"\n\nWith limited courses of action available, the burden is placed on social media users to decipher what is real and what is fake.\n\nGabriel Khan, a USC Annenberg professor and AI expert, weighed on the chaos.\n\n\"It\u2019s the fact that these tools have been unleashed onto the public with, sort of no restrictions, and platforms don\u2019t have really the, the tools or much interest in trying to police these potential problems.\"\n\nKahn thinks that AI tools might be met with restrictive policy in the near future.\n\n\"There\u2019s easy ways to just completely humiliate somebody. And I don\u2019t see any practice policy approach on the part of the platforms who end up distributing this kind of material to really combat that. That\u2019s obviously going to come very soon.\"\n\nWith artificial intelligence seen as the future, we continue to see its drawbacks and social implications. Deepfakes are just one of the issues that social media platforms and the government will eventually have to weigh in on in their approach towards artificial intelligence protections.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Robert Westermann.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/01/30/california-bill-seeks-to-require-speed-governors-in-all-new-cars-by-2027/", "response": "```\nLos Angeles hit a new milestone in 2023. For the first time in a decade, the number of deaths due to traffic fatalities outnumbered homicides, according to the LAPD\u2019s End of Year Crime Report released last week.  It\u2019s not just a Los Angeles phenomenon though, since car crash rates have surged state-wide.  In 2022, traffic deaths alone claimed the lives of 4,407 Californians, according to the National Transportation Research Nonprofit. It\u2019s a grim situation that the California Senate is hoping to change.  Earlier this week, a package of bills called \u201cSpeeding and Fatality Emergency Reduction on California Streets\u201d was introduced to the California Senate by San Francisco State Sen. Scott Wiener. One of those bills would stop drivers from speeding by requiring the installation of speed governors \u2014 internal speed monitors \u2014 into all vehicles either sold or manufactured in California by 2027. Speed governors use GPS technology to ascertain the speed limit in a specific area. If it detects that the vehicle is going 10 mph over the speed limit, it\u2019ll make the car slow down.  The bill follows recent recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board to mandate speed-limiting technologies and warning systems in order to combat traffic-related deaths.  Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore said he was proud of the work that the LAPD is doing, even with a \u201cdiminished workforce\u201d during his Wednesday end-of-year LA crime statistics press conference alongside Mayor Karen Bass.  \u201cI look forward to taking on [these] terrible instances of fatal hit-and-run collisions and DUI\u2019s,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThis is an organization that constantly looks to improve.\u201d The objective of the bill is to make roads safer and to reduce the number of traffic fatality deaths, but Nizhoni McDonough, a junior majoring in law history and culture, said that the proposed legislation is \u201ckind of insane.\u201d \u201cI feel like that\u2019s really unsafe,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cIf it automatically stops you like that. I think there could be extenuating circumstances where you have to speed up if someone else on the road is driving crazy.\u201d The bill\u2019s author \u2014 Scott Wiener \u2014 is open to the bill being changed, particularly in regards to what type of speed governor should be required. According to the LA Times, there are two types of speed governors: active and passive. An active speed governor physically forces cars to slow down whereas passive speed governors only make loud and irritating sounds upon detecting speeding.  \u201cIf you\u2019re driving over the speed limit and [the loud sound] distracts you that greatly, that could just make more problems instead of solving the safety issue at hand,\u201d McDonough said.  Pradeep Velidi, an electrical engineering master\u2019s student, said that it makes sense that the bill carves out exceptions for the vehicles of first responders \u2014 firefighters, police officers and paramedics \u2014 who would be able to turn off the speed governor at will.  \u201cObviously the firefighters and the paramedics would definitely have to cross the speed limit to save someone\u2019s life,\u201d Velidi said.  But McDonough said that allowing police officers to bypass the speed restrictions can still be dangerous.  \u201cIf [the police] are trying to chase someone, they\u2019re causing danger to other people around them on the road if they\u2019re not being mindful of the pedestrians or other people driving on the road,\u201d McDonough said.  If passed, it would be the first of its kind in the nation, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. If the bill makes it past the Senate, it\u2019ll still have to get the signature of Gov. Gavin Newsom to become law. Newsom vetoed one of Wiener\u2019s previous transportation bills back in 2019.  The bill comes on the heels of the European Union, which passed legislation in 2022 to require speed governors in vehicles starting in July of this year.   Velidi said there\u2019s a chance that the speed governor might malfunction and put the driver in harm\u2019s way.  \u201cThe law sounds good, but the thing is it\u2019s also making us more constrained,\u201d Velidi said. \u201cIt is also making driving more safer than you think. It has both bad and good [parts]. So we have to accept that if they are to put the law into action.\u201d \n```"}

The shuttle was transferred from the Science Center in Exposition Park, only a couple hundred feet away from its new destination. Previously, the shuttle was displayed horizontally and was not attached to its iconic fuel tank and rocket boosters. The new exhibit will make history as the first display of the shuttle in an upright \u201clift off\u201d position.\n\nRohin Pathak, co-lead of the Liquid Propulsion Laboratory and a graduate astronautical engineering student explained why this is significant. \u201cWhen you\u2019re putting a shuttle upright and the way they\u2019re constructing it, you\u2019re going to have levels to it,\u201d Pathak said. \u201cSo you can go onto level four and look into the cockpit, and you weren\u2019t able to see that before when the shuttle was horizontal launch orientation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the installation curators, two cranes were used to position Endeavour upright between two solid rocket boosters and attached to a 65,000-pound external fuel tank known as ET-94. The process began late Monday night and continued into Tuesday morning. Mounting the shuttle was a challenging task that had never been accomplished outside of a NASA facility.\n\nDespite the public opening of the new center being years away, students like Gage Bachmann, an astronautical engineering major and a lead engineer at the USC Liquid Propulsion Laboratory, expressed their enthusiasm for the project. \u201cThe fact that I can see it right out of my window and the fact that you can go to school where you can walk across the street and see the space shuttle for free is just awe-inspiring,\u201d Bachmann said.\n\nOther students felt lucky to be so close to the one-of-a-kind display. \u201cThis is such a difficult thing to accomplish, and every day I get to drive by it and see it. I feel proud in a way that it\u2019s right next to campus,\u201d Pathak said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited in the next four years when it fully goes up to actually go in and take a look at it. It\u2019s going to be awesome.\u201d\n\nSebastian Bouckenooghe, another lead engineer at the USC Liquid Propulsion Laboratory and a graduate mechanical engineering student, said the Endeavour installation will likely inspire students and the greater Los Angeles community. \u201cI think all in all it\u2019s nice to see something like that, especially given that nowadays Southern California is really turning into a hub for airspace work,\u201d Bouckenooghe said. \u201cBeing able to have something like that right next to campus...everybody can be inspired.\u201d\n\nAccording to NASA, Endeavour embarked on a total of 25 missions between 1992 and 2011. Upon completion, the Samuel Oschin Air and Space Center will give visitors a unique look at the world\u2019s first reusable spacecraft, and the only shuttle displayed upright.\n```"}

Critics also say there is no clear path to full-time employment and voting is limited to SCA adjunct professors that are teaching this semester.\n\n\u201cThose of us that are working really hard at it, we meet at a minimum of three times a week,\u201d said James Savoca, adjunct professor in the Division of Film & Television Production.\n\nSCA adjuncts formed a leadership board that delivers weekly newsletters, the \u201cAFA Weekly,\u201d in an effort to keep faculty members up to date on AFA meetings and the timeline of voting.\n\nPeter Gamble, a representative of the AFA-UAW, wrote in a Jan. 16 newsletter that they hope to receive a supermajority vote to obtain the strongest possible position when it comes time to negotiate the terms of a contract with USC.\n\n\u201c[USC] immediately started to use some of the anti-union rhetoric that is essentially boilerplate,\u201d said Moses Journey, an adjunct professor of Cinematic Animation and Digital Arts.\n\nIn 2023, the Writers\u2019 Guild of America went on strike for 148 days, and SAG-AFTRA, the actors\u2019 union, went on strike for 118 days.\n\n\u201cBetween the WGA strike and everything that\u2019s been going on here, I\u2019ve made very little money in the last 365 days, and it sure would have been nice to have been paid more fairly and to know that I had backup healthcare at USC if my WGA healthcare fell through,\u201d said Dara Resnik, an adjunct professor in the Cinematic Peter Stark Producing Program.\n\nTeaching at USC is not intended to be an SCA adjunct professor\u2019s main source of income, as the point is for students to learn from someone who actively works in their respective fields of interest. But many film industry workers have struggled to make ends meet in the last year.\n\n\u201c[USC\u2019s] policies show in our pay, our benefits and in the unpaid work we are asked to do,\u201d wrote Peter Gamble, adjunct associate professor in the Division of Writing for Screen & Television, in an announcement email for an AFA-UAW town hall Zoom meeting. \u201cMany of us are already in unions, and we have seen the power we have when we come together to make our voices heard.\u201d\n\nThe AFA-UAW has been communicating with USC through the National Labor Board, and ballots will be sent out with adjuncts\u2019 paychecks.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten even a cost of living raise since I started working at USC,\u201d said Journey, who has been an adjunct professor at SCA since 2021. \u201cParking costs were going up, and I was just wondering, \u2018What the heck?\u2019 I even asked them for a token percent raise and actually ended up having less money because of changes in the tax code.\u201d\n\nAFA-UAW first began a movement toward unionization in November after delivering a letter of intent to the USC Provost\u2019s office.

Since the beginning of December, they have a 26-5 record. Kawhi Leonard has been one of the league\u2019s most consistent and reliable players this season, averaging nearly 24 points per game. James Harden, who\u2019s struggled to find a proper home since leaving Houston in 2021, appears to have found his place on this Clippers\u2019 squad.\n\nOn Monday night, however, the Clippers confronted another of the NBA\u2019s most in-form teams: the Cleveland Cavaliers. Led by four-time All-Star Donovan Mitchell, Cleveland has lost just one game in January. The Cavaliers defended their home court with a 118-108 win, ending L.A.\u2019s five-game win streak as Cleveland earned its eighth-straight home victory.\n\nThe absence of the Clippers preferred starting center Ivica Zubac hurt them, as Cleveland center Jarrett Allen racked up 20 points and 17 boards. And despite the Clippers having full-strength matchups around the perimeter, they couldn\u2019t stop Mitchell from putting up another stellar performance. He led the game in assists with 12 to go alongside his 28 points.\n\nHarden and Paul George, two of the Clippers\u2019 most consistent scorers, scored a combined 28 points and went just 2 for 10 from beyond the arc. Despite having an off night, this loss should not worry the Clippers too much. Cleveland was the third stop on a seven-game road stretch  and it wasn\u2019t a particularly bad loss given the Cavs\u2019 recent performances.\n\nOn a positive note, the Clippers\u2019 bench, including Russell Westbrook, Norman Powell and Amir Coffey, put up another solid performance. \u201cI thought [Westbrook], [Powell] and [Coffey] were great,\u201d Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue said in his post-game press conference. \u201c[I\u2019m] really happy and proud of [Coffey], just to continue to stay with it... he\u2019s been phenomenal... so I\u2019m happy for all the work he\u2019s put in [and] it\u2019s paying off.\u201d\n\nClippers fans also shouldn\u2019t forget about Saturday night in Boston. After the Clippers steamrolled the floundering Toronto Raptors 127-107 on Friday, they went into TD Garden and handed the Celtics only their second home loss of the season by a score of 115-96. The Clippers surged to a 36-point lead late in the third quarter, making the fourth quarter practically irrelevant.\n\nLeonard had 26 points along with 7 boards and Daniel Theis added 18 points off the bench, scoring 8 of his 9 attempts. \u201cOverall, I thought defensively we did some good things,\u201d Lue said after the game. \u201c[We were] trying to keep [Jayson Tatum] off balance, blitzing him, switching him, firing, not letting him get comfortable. Same thing with Jaylen [Brown], trying to keep them off guard because they\u2019re great players [and] great scorers.\u201d\n\nIn the two teams\u2019 first matchup earlier this season, Boston trashed LA at Crypto.com Arena 145-108. Four Celtics players scored over 20 points and they outrebounded the Clippers 51-34. The Clippers did miss Leonard in that game, their star forward who has become the heart and soul of this team and its most consistent contributor on both ends.\n\nCompared to the first matchup, the Clippers defended much better in the back court on Saturday, holding some of the Celtics\u2019 guards to under 10 points. Al Horford, who is usually a consistent spot-up three point shooter, was 0 for 4 from three-point range on the night. Additionally, the Clippers flipped the script and outrebounded the Celtics 43-34 and scored 16 more paint points.\n\nThese statistics are a testament to how Theis and Mason Plumlee have stepped up while Zubac recovers. Harden\u2019s performance against the Celtics demonstrated how he\u2019s adapted his game to the Clippers\u2019 roster.  In Houston, he was used to being a first-option scorer, but while he struggled to shoot against Boston, finishing with only nine points, his seven assists still helped the offense flow.  Since he has talented scorers around him like Leonard and George, he\u2019s able to play more like a true point guard.\n\n\u201c[Harden] did a great job controlling the game, and that\u2019s what great point guards do,\u201d  Lue said. \u201cIf he needs to get 15 assists he can get that, if he needs to get 30 points he can get that, but just controlling the game, understanding how [the Celtics] were trying to play us and guard us, and trying to take advantage of how we wanted to play offensively.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers head to Washington D.C. to play the Wizards on Wednesday night and then travel to Detroit and to play the Pistons Friday as they hit the second half of their road trip.\n```"}

Gavin Newson after Feinstein\u2019s death in 2023, announced in October that she wouldn\u2019t run to keep the position. \"After considering those questions I\u2019ve decided not to run for a full term in the US Senate. Knowing you can win a campaign doesn\u2019t always mean you should run a campaign. I know this will be a surprise to many because traditionally we don\u2019t see those who have power let it go.\"\n\nDirectly outside of the building the Los Angeles chapter of Jewish Voices for Peace and the USC Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation issued a joint call for the senatorial candidates to support a ceasefire by standing against \u201cthe US-backed genocide in Gaza,\u201d according to their respective social media accounts.\n\nThe Bovard Administration building housed this political contest with audience members and students who were told not to applaud or disrupt during the debate except for a brief applause after candidate introductions. The audience was warned in advance that disruptions or protest during the debate would cause the attendee to be escorted out.\n\nDuring the debate, the candidates spoke about the economy, homelessness, abortion, health care, crime, immigration and the rise of antisemitism and Islamophobia on college campuses.\n\nBarbara Lee was given the first question to kick off the debate. USC Senior Sophia Perez asks the candidates about the unprecedented housing shortage and \u201chow [the candidates] will ensure the next generation can actually afford to live in California?\u201d\n\nOver the course of the night a couple students asked questions to those debating about topics that included housing and speech on college campuses.\n\nModerator Elex Michaelson, Fox 11 anchor and host of \u201cThe Issue Is\u201d asked Garvey about his support in the presidential race if it comes down to Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Garvey, who voted for Trump in the last two presidential elections, was evasive about who he would back in the primary election just over a month away or in a general election.\n\n\u201cWhen the time comes I will do exactly what I said to you. I will look at the two opponents, I will determine what they did and at that time I will make my choice. I don\u2019t believe Joe Biden has been good for this country,\u201d Garvey said.\n\nOne of Katie Porter\u2019s big moments of the debate was when she reacted to Garvey\u2019s remarks and called out his level of responses throughout the night. \u201cHe just chewed up two and a half minutes of the time to talk about substantive issues in this debate and refused to answer the question,\u201d Porter said. \u201cBallots go out in six weeks, Mr. Garvey. This is not the minor leagues. Who will you vote for?\u201d\n\nIn response to the issue of homelessness, Garvey attempted to stand out by calling his competitors \u201ccareer politicians\u201d and proposing that they are out of touch with the priorities of those who are unhoused. \u201cWhen was the last time any of you went to the inner city, actually walked up to the homeless,\u201d Garvey said to the representatives. \u201cI needed to talk to the people of this city, I needed to talk to the homeless. [I] went up to them and touched them and listened to them, and you know what they looked at me and they said you\u2019re the first time anybody has come up and asked us about our lives.\u201d\n\nLee called out this response by Garvey, calling it \u201cpatronizing\u201d while referring to her own time being unsheltered, and how she could \u201cnot believe how he described his walk and touching and being there with the homeless,\u201d Lee said.\n\nMichaelson and Politico Senior Political Reporter Melanie Mason shortened the amount of time for each response to policy areas, hoping to address more issues. \u201cEverybody\u2019s been going over time and we\u2019ve had a lot of exchange[s] which is interesting and shows the contrast, but let\u2019s maybe try moving this to 30-second answers instead of a minute if we can, going forward, just so we can get more topics in,\u201d Michaelson said.\n\nAfter this change was stated, the first question in regards to immigration and the border was directed to Lee. Her response\u2019s length elicited two bell dings and eventually Michaelson\u2019s interruption. Michaelson sent the question over to Schiff who then validated the need for time when addressing immigration. \u201cThis question deserves a lot more than 30 seconds,\u201d Schiff said, before stating his own policy considerations.\n\nAfter the debate all the candidates except for Garvey went to the spin room to talk with the media.\n\nLee highlighted the importance of youth issues to her campaign. \u201cYoung people as you know are graduating from school saddled with debt and have to live two to three people, two to three families together or with their parents... Young people need to know they can have a dream,\u201d Lee said. \u201cRight now they can\u2019t even envision buying a home. And so we have to make sure young people are supported so they can study. That\u2019s what they\u2019re here for.\u201d\n\nSchiff in the spin room detailed his multiple priorities for \u201cmaking higher education affordable... [I] want to address the scourge of gun violence,\u201d Schiff said. He also talked about how the \u201cUS should help Israel defend itself from terrorists\u201d and how his position of having both a two-state solution and supporting Israel isn\u2019t mutually exclusive.\n\nPorter reiterated how she differed from the others on stage. \u201cI was the only elected official on that stage who has never taken corporate PAC money, ever, in any race,\u201d Porter said.\n\nFor information about the candidates\u2019 positions check out Annenberg Media\u2019s live updates.\n```"}

(Photo by Eli Masket)\n\nBy Heli Ruiz, Kim Ly, Cordelia Weld, Daniel Park, Devon Lee, and Nebai Esaias\nJanuary 30, 2024 at 12:57 pm PST\n\nThe USC Department of Facilities Planning and Management (FPM) released a statement to Annenberg Media on Monday saying McCarthy Quad will be closed until early April while it undergoes repairs. \u201cNo events will take place in the area until that work is finished,\u201d FPM said. The damage was caused by \u201crain during the set-up of a large canopy in McCarthy Quad for New Student Convocation on Jan. 5,\u201d according to the statement. As a result, gates were placed around the perimeter of the area, with the quad\u2019s central path remaining open for passage.\n\nThe quad hosts a variety of popular USC events, from the weekly Trojan Farmers Market to concerts to tailgates, sure to be missed by the student population. USC master\u2019s student Annie Jia recalls her time spent on the quad from having fun at Conquest \u2013 one of the concerts held at McCarthy Quad \u2013 to a graduation ceremony she attended. \u201cThere are not really a lot of spaces like this on USC\u2019s campus. [USC is] not really big, and open spaces are even more limited. There is definitely going to be an impact,\u201d Jia said.\n\nKylie Sabo, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies, was initially surprised to hear the news about McCarthy Quad\u2019s closure. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely disappointing that the freshman won\u2019t get to experience the McCarthy Quad, and hopefully they can find another space for those activities, especially the farmers market.\u201d Katlynn Thai, a freshman studying biomedical engineering, expressed a similar sentiment, saying new spring admits will especially lose out on getting to experience the farmers market.\n\nOn another hand, senior applied and computational mathematics major Eddie Sanchez raised safety concerns over the barricades surrounding the quad. \u201cThere have been a few moments where the barricades are a little concerning. I have seen my fair share of accidents in person,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nThe FPM statement notes that they are currently replanting the grass on the quad, and events will be postponed until it has regrown. \u201cOnce sod is planted, it will take about a month for the grass to take root and grow,\u201d FPM said.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/01/30/triple-threat-73-points-and-counting-whats-next/", "response": "```\n\u201cTriple Threat\u201d is a column by James Bao in which he covers trends in the NBA through an analytical lens. Welcome to the first edition of the \u201cTriple Threat,\u201d where I\u2019ll be writing about the strategies, stories and statistics that make up the National Basketball Association. Forget just highlights and box scores, this column will go beyond the surface and decode the defensive schemes that stifle LeBron James, analyze the statistics that fuel Nikola Jokic\u2019s dominance and uncover the legends who are still influencing today\u2019s NBA.\n\nIt\u2019s as if superstars like Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, Luka Doncic and Devin Booker somehow knew I needed a strong pitch to kick off the column as they put up insane \u2014 not just insane but historical \u2014 scoring numbers last week.\n\nNBA\u2019s recent scoring spree\n\nIn case you missed it, Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers put up a career-high 70 points last Monday against the San Antonio Spurs. Soon after, on the same night, Towns recorded his own career-high of 62 points for the Timberwolves in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets. But it didn\u2019t stop there. NBA fans saw two more historical scoring efforts last Friday from Booker (62 points) and Doncic, who dropped a whopping 73 points on the Atlanta Hawks. 73! In a game where the Dallas Mavericks had 148 points in total, Doncic single-handedly carried half of the entire team\u2019s scoring efforts on his back. It\u2019s also a tally that tied for the fourth-highest ever in a single NBA game.\n\nWhat\u2019s crazier is that none of the games went to overtime, meaning that Doncic scored all 73 of his points in the 45 minutes he played. That\u2019s an average of 1.62 points per minute in the most competitive basketball league out there.\n\nSo, what\u2019s driving the scoring spree?\n\nPatterns of the past\n\nAfter looking at the statistical anomalies of last week\u2019s scoring and comparing them to past high-scoring performances, one pattern emerged: 3-pointers and free throws weren\u2019t just raining down, they were rewriting history.\n\nBack in 1990, 3-point offense was about as common as unicorns. But on March 28, Michael Jordan lit up the Cleveland Cavaliers for 69 points; he took six out of the total seven shot attempts from beyond the arc that game. More importantly, Jordan had 23 free-throw attempts out of a game total of 37, and he converted 21 of them, or 91.3%. Now if you take away the freebie points, Jordan would have scored 46 points \u2014 still very high, but not enough to make the history books.\n\nKobe Bryant\u2019s 2006 one-man assault on my home team, the Toronto Raptors, remains second in the historical tally. He averaged 1.93 points per minute, converting on a ridiculous 61% of his 46 shot attempts. Combining Bryant\u2019s three-pointers (7-for-13) and free-throws (18-for-20) that night sums to 39 points, almost half of his scoring efforts. Although Kobe\u2019s era still saw plenty of traditional post-play and midrange jumpers, it also signaled the start of a modern era when perimeter-oriented playbooks run the courts.\n\nScoring in the modern era\n\nSix players have crossed the 70-point threshold in the 2000s, but four of those milestones occurred during just the last two seasons. These performances start with Donovan Mitchell\u2019s 71-point outing in January 2023 and end with Doncic\u2019s recent 73-point effort.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect combination of historic efficiency and astronomical usage rate \u2014 and astronomical use of the 3-point line,\u201d said Chris Herring, an NBA expert and senior writer for Sports Illustrated, in an interview with ESPN.\n\nHere are some stats from the four 70+ outings from 2023-2024:\n\n41 of Mitchell\u2019s 71 points came from seven threes and 20 free throws.\n53 of Damian Lillard\u2019s 71 points in February 2023 translated from 13 threes and 14 free throws.\nOne three-pointer and 21 free throws made up 24 of Embiid\u2019s 70 points.\nDoncic\u2019s eight threes and 15 free throws combined for 39 points out of his 73 points.\n\nBesides Embiid, who is mainly a power forward/center known for his dominance in the painted area, all the other players were guards who depended heavily on shots from deep and the line. From the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 veer play for J.J. Redick to Golden State Warriors\u2019 elevator doors for Stephen Curry, the league is evidently evolving towards strategies that emphasize outside shooting, which I believe is a source of fuel for recent scoring trends.\n\nThe mamba lives on\n\nStatistics aside, it\u2019s been four years since Bryant\u2019s passing (R.I.P.), but his \u201cMamba Mentality\u201d undeniably remains an influential and enduring legacy within the NBA. Coincidentally, the day Doncic put his name into the record books was also the four-year anniversary of Bryant\u2019s passing.\n\n\u201cTriple Threat\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

(AP/Ian Maule) \n\nBy Mia Nu\u00f1ez January 30, 2024 at 10:38 am PST\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver has announced that the In-Season tournament the league debuted this year will \u201cno doubt\u201d be back for the 2024-25 season. After a successful first run, the league will look to build on the midseason cup format which increased game viewership by over 20%. The NBA plays 82 regular-season games, with viewership tending to lull during November and December. The NBA Cup was in an effort to increase viewership, bring eyes to the sport, and make more money overall. This year the Los Angeles Lakers won the NBA Cup in an exciting game against the Indiana Pacers.\n\nSilver was pleased with the success of the tournament, telling AP the format will return \u201cwith just a couple of tweaks.\u201d While he didn\u2019t elaborate on specific changes that are coming, he noted that he liked the colorful alternative courts used for the tournament, and wants the league to incorporate more of such creativity going forward. \u201cI\u2019m a big advocate of the colorful courts,\u201d said Silver. \u201cFor the Finals, we could have a special Finals court \u2014 not just with the (Larry O\u2019Brien) trophy in the center, but a little bit more colorful.\u201d\n\nTeams from each conference were separated into groups of five to play four games round-robin style. The team with the best record in each group, along with one wild card team from each conference, advanced to the quarter-finals. Four teams then advanced to the semi-finals in Las Vegas. To further incentivize players, the first-place team received $500,000 per player, second place $200,000, and $100,000 for those who made the semi-finals.\n\nPlayers seemed in favor of the tournament. LeBron James, whose Los Angeles Lakers won the inaugural NBA Cup on Dec. 9, 2023, said following a 122-119 group play win over the Phoenix Suns, \u201cIt feels great... There\u2019s $500,000 on the line \u2013 so we\u2019re goin\u2019 for that.\u201d \u201cA lot of competitiveness. I think everybody is trying to get off to a good start during the year with the In-Season Tournament vibe, the court change and all that added a little energy to it,\u201d said Warriors guard Steph Curry of the tournament.\n\nViewership data suggests the fans love the tournament, too: viewership for nationally broadcast games was up 26% from December 2022, and the league\u2019s average attendance in November was the highest it has ever been at 18,206. While it seems to be going well, some fans still have some concerns about the point differential rule. This first tiebreaker is a head-to-head record, the second is the point differential rule, meaning that the team with the most points throughout the whole tournament advances. Fans noticed the impact of the point differential rule when in a game against the Boston Celtics and the Chicago Bulls, the Celtics kept on fouling Bulls\u2019 center Andre Drummond. Even though the Celtics were up by 30 points, they fouled him in hopes that he would miss and keep the Bulls from adding to their score.\n\nSilver addressed fans\u2019 concerns following the Lakers\u2019 NBA Cup win, expressing he did not intend to get rid of the rule, but was open to tweaks that would make the games feel more fair to fans. \u201cI\u2019m not ready necessarily to move away from it,\u201d Silver told Bleacher Report last December. \u201cBut if ultimately there\u2019s going to be a sense, particularly from our American fans, that it\u2019s somehow an indication of poor sportsmanship, that\u2019s not a good idea for us to be doing it. And maybe there\u2019s some ways to tweak that.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Luisa Tripoli-Krasnow January 29, 2024 at 6:38 pm PST\n\nFor Julianna Melendez and Klarissa Palacios, first-gen identity extends beyond academics to how they value college as a whole. Wearing matching pink suits \u2014 which they said are meant to symbolize compassion and hope \u2014 they want to position themselves as \u201cthe untraditional entering traditional spaces.\u201d Palacios said that one of her main motivating factors is her grandmother seeing her graduate. \u201cI always say that she crossed the borders so that I can cross the stage with a degree,\u201d she told Annenberg Media.\n\nMelendez wants to work with the new First Generation Student Assembly to expand accessibility beyond academics, in part by using a social media plan outlined by Palacios, who currently works in the communications department of USG. In their campaign, they also prioritize accessibility for disabled students who are not always represented properly by the university. Drawing on her own experiences as a visually impaired student, Palacios feels that the Office of Student Accessibility Services has not always been adequate, citing problems with communication and timeliness. \u201cYou should be able to come to USC with full confidence knowing the administration, faculty and even the infrastructure is able to support you,\u201d Palacios said.\n\nMelendez says she has the experience and the connections to support these students because of her position as Accessibility Chair. The main role of the USG is to serve as a bridge between the student body and USC Administration, something that both Melendez and Palacios say they are highly experienced in. During the past semesters, Palacios has invited President Carol Folt to USG meetings, hoping to foster more communication between the student body and the administration.\n\nLast semester in USG was marked by heightened conflict within the student community, as well as numerous protests and sit-ins during senate meetings. As a result, these meetings were transitioned to an online format. According to Melendez, this change came straight from USC administration, as opposed to the USG. In response to this crisis, the administration organized a series of meetings with the Middle Eastern North African Student Assembly (MENASA). As the Senator for MENASA, Melendez has relayed a general feeling of dissatisfaction from students involved with these meetings. \u201cThey came to share their story and that was it. I feel like that also happened at Senate meetings. They came to share their stories and they wanted an answer and they weren\u2019t given that.\u201d\n\nIf elected, Melendez plans to leverage USC administration connections to point students toward resources and connections that can help them make the actionable change they are looking for. One way they hope to do is by creating a monthly town hall with students, faculty, and USG. Melendez says that students have the right to speak to USC administration themselves instead of through their student representatives. \u201cThis past year, as a senator, I\u2019ve noticed the deep need for students to be heard by those they feel that represent them and by those that they feel should be advocating for them,\u201d said Melendez.\n\nWhile Melendez is off the campaign trail, church is a large part of her life. Melendez said that religion is a large part of her motivation, and Palacios added that she\u2019s motivated by her drive to succeed in college as a first-generation student, and also that she wants to make the most of her time in college because she expects to lose her eyesight in her early twenties. Both candidates agreed that they see their opportunities as \u201ca blessing.\u201d\n```"}

The Pineapple Express refers to an atmospheric river that brings tropical moisture from the Hawaiian islands to the West Coast. Starting early next week, the floodgates could open as Southern California prepares for monumental flooding.\n\n\u201cAn atmospheric river is basically an air current that carries a huge mass of water and condensation with it,\u201d climate journalist Shreya Agrawal said. \u201cAnd when that happens, we experience a lot of rain...Southern Californians should be worried because L.A. streets and drains are not equipped to handle that amount of rain in such a short time.\u201d\n\nWeather forecasters are expecting the rain to start Wednesday, January 31, and continue periodically with strong winds through Friday, February 2. While no reports of any flooding have been confirmed by news outlets, environmental studies major and research assistant Natalie Lopez said that traffic and commutes would be heavily impacted.\n\n\u201cNext week, driving is going to be increasingly more difficult and there\u2019s probably going to be less Ubers out because it\u2019s not safe to drive,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to drive in L.A. when it\u2019s dry to begin with. It\u2019s gonna be a lot worse when it\u2019s pouring. Don\u2019t plan to go anywhere far off campus because even getting to the metro station might be kind of messy.\u201d\n\nStudents who are interested in climate effects, such as Tvisha Singh, are concerned about safety measures during dramatic weather events such as an atmospheric river. Singh said that the preparation for the intense rain is similar to that of any natural disaster.\n\n\u201cFor housed students, preparing for an atmospheric river event would involve preparing for power outages, closed roads, and some flooding,\u201d Singh said. \u201cFor all emergencies, having an emergency kit, evacuation route, flashlights, and charged devices is always advisable.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming weather patterns have Singh concerned about what this may entail for current residents of L.A. as well as future generations.\n\n\u201cIncreased global temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emission are responsible for increasing evaporation, thereby making precipitation-related weather events much more extreme,\u201d Singh said. \u201cWarmer air can also hold more water vapor. Hurricanes are also becoming stronger in California because of this.\u201d\n\nThese storms have become more prevalent across the country over the past decade. In 2023, the state of California experienced the longest stretch of continuous atmospheric river conditions ever recorded, according to the New York Times. Over this past year, the Golden State experienced some of its most extreme precipitation, forming lakes in the farmlands and a hurricane in Death Valley, where a year\u2019s worth of rain fell in just 24 hours.\n\nAgrawal said that these astonishing and record-breaking numbers of rain are a direct result of climate change.\n\n\u201cA climate is a constant set of 30-year weather patterns,\u201d Agrawal said, \u201cRight now that pattern is shifting because we\u2019re adding more heat to the atmosphere, in the form of carbon. The heat we are experiencing right now is from all the carbon we added 30 years ago, and we\u2019re going to see the effects of all the carbon we\u2019re adding now in 30 years.\u201d\n\nTodd Richards, a lecturer at USC Annenberg with a meteorology background, said that the incoming atmospheric river is more in line with a strong El Ni\u00f1o year than direct global warming. El Ni\u00f1o, a climate pattern that results in higher sea temperatures, usually occurs every two to seven years. When it does, regions of the southern U.S. \u2014 including Los Angeles \u2014 tend to have wetter winters.\n\nLopez said that the importance of staying informed on climate change could not be overstated and that being prepared for freak weather occurrences is pertinent to all Angelenos.\n\n\u201cEven if you don\u2019t know about the climate crisis, and it\u2019s not something that\u2019s really important to you, sooner or later, it\u2019s going to affect you,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be continually informed on potential weather changes and somewhat prepared in the event of any natural disasters. Because of climate change, these disasters could be just around the corner.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Yang)\n\nBy YJ Si January 29, 2024 at 6:13 pm PST\n\nMore than halfway through the season, the USC women\u2019s basketball team has been putting on a show, and the student body has taken notice. With a 14-4 record, a No. 15 AP poll ranking, and star freshman guard JuJu Watkins breaking conference records, attendance is up and many students believe the team should be getting more attention than it is.\n\nThe women\u2019s team has averaged 3,386 fans in the stands over 11 home games, while the men\u2019s team has averaged 6,228 fans over nine games. Both teams had full stands \u2014 more than 10,000 fans \u2014 for their games against crosstown rival UCLA. Compared to last year, the women\u2019s team has averaged more than three times as many fans this season. The men\u2019s game attendance has risen too, by 50%, which some students credit to men\u2019s freshman guard Bronny James \u2014 whose debut game against Cal State Long Beach had 9,806 fans in attendance. The women\u2019s game against UC Riverside, which was scheduled immediately after, had 4,201 fans in attendance.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of stardom happening with Bronny James on the men\u2019s basketball team that\u2019s pulling in a lot of viewers,\u201d said Connor Zook, a sophomore studying Astronautical Engineering. \u201cI think that us being ranked nationally from our women\u2019s team makes a huge difference on whether or not people want to attend the games.\u201d\n\nTheo Hockstader, a senior studying philosophy, cognitive science and economics, said that the attendance disparity makes sense from a celebrity standpoint. \u201cI mean, just purely off of having Bronny James on the men\u2019s team, I think that\u2019s a big draw,\u201d he said. \u201cBut of course there are stars on the women\u2019s team who deserve some more celebrity as well. I think the attendance should be higher for the women\u2019s games.\u201d\n\nMany students believe that the women\u2019s team deserves more attention, primarily because of their performance this season compared to the men\u2019s. \u201cThe men\u2019s team is good, but the women\u2019s team is performing better right now,\u201d said Prinay Patel, a junior studying business. \u201cThe women\u2019s team should definitely get more importance as well.\u201d\n\nBryne\u00e9 Evans, a senior studying psychology, said that she thinks the games could be marketed more effectively. \u201cAdvertising is a big thing because I didn\u2019t really know when the UCLA game was for the women\u2019s, but I would have gone if I had known,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more students know about the game, the more likely they\u2019re going to be inclined to go.\u201d\n\nErin Yoon, a freshman studying journalism, thinks that there isn\u2019t as much buzz around the games, leading to lower attendance, rather than an advertising problem. \u201cI do get the emails, and it\u2019s not like they\u2019re marginalizing the women,\u201d Yoon said. \u201cI think that it\u2019s more so a problem that\u2019s everywhere, like with the WNBA and the NBA, like nobody really cares about the women\u2019s team. In general, I think that men\u2019s sports just get more attention.\u201d```"}

Swifties, Swift\u2019s legion of diehard fans, have stormed the NFL, motivated by her relationship with Travis Kelce. In doing so, they\u2019ve introduced new viewers into the world of football. Kelce, Swift\u2019s boyfriend and Kansas City tight end, is set to play the Super Bowl with the Chiefs \u2014 meaning that Swift will likely be in the stands as she has for much of the season, sparking intense interest from fans and haters alike.\n\nThe excitement is palpable with airlines introducing special \u201c1989\u2032\u2032 Super Bowl flights and a remarkable 400% surge in Travis Kelce jersey sales, according to Bleacher Report. On Monday, USC students weighed in on this topic that is dominating social media and the worlds of sports and pop culture.\n\n\u201cI think it introduces the sport to people who would have traditionally not given it a second look,\u201d said David Clayton, a freshman studying business. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s a positive. Definitely, because, you know, increased viewership and fan base. You know, as many people watching football is pretty awesome. I mean, my little sister cares a lot more now.\u201d\n\nBut a number of social media critics have complained that Swift is featured too prominently during broadcasts of the games, contradicting a New York Times report that Swift\u2019s screen time is less than 25 seconds during each almost-three hour broadcast.\n\nEllie Moore, a sophomore majoring in Sociology, is both a football fan and a self-proclaimed Swiftie. When asked to comment on the backlash from Taylor Swift\u2019s NFL \u201ctakeover,\u201d Moore said, \u201cI think it doesn\u2019t really take away from the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like they show celebrities at games all the time,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think people are just annoyed that it\u2019s Taylor Swift.\u201d\n\nSome students also believe the Swifties have increased ranges in audiences and a variety of viewers. \u201cI think [Taylor Swift] just adds something else for people that maybe weren\u2019t as into football, and they could kind of watch it for different reasons,\u201d said Ryan King, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think it really takes away from the original sport.\u201d\n\nWhile there are plenty who see Swift\u2019s weekly introduction to football as a positive, some do not share the same sentiments. Jill Ofodu, a freshman, said much of the criticism is \u201cmisogynistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople can never win, especially girls, it\u2019s like, guys get upset when girls don\u2019t know ... about football,\u201d Ofodu said. \u201cBut now that girls are watching it, it\u2019s a problem for the reason that they\u2019re watching it...it\u2019s a dumb conversation.\u201d\n\nCatalina Dyson, a freshman majoring in Worlds Bachelors Business, also emphasized the importance of having a diverse audience. \u201cPeople might think that the Super Bowl is turning into something a little more feminine, because girls will want to watch for Taylor Swift,\u201d Dyson said. \u201cAnd I know a lot of guys in the media have criticized it for that, that football\u2019s \u2018turning girly,\u2019 even though it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just something that can be enjoyed by both genders.\u201d\n```"}

Minaj seemingly thought that the reference was addressed to her husband, who is a registered sex offender.\n\nShe took to Instagram live shortly after the release of \u201cHiss\u201d to respond to Megan\u2019s lyrics. \u201cI think that the line wasn\u2019t even fully directed at Nicki,\u201d said Olivia Batist, an international relations major. \u201cIt could have been towards anybody in the industry since it\u2019s actually kind of common.

Royal Rumble traveled down to Tampa Bay and took place on January 2024. (Photo courtesy of Business Wire)\n\nBy Maddy Myer January 29, 2024 at 3:15 pm PST\n\nConsidered one of the big four live events WWE puts on each year, Royal Rumble is always full of surprises and can\u2019t-miss action. This year was no different, as we witnessed the return of Andrade, Naomi, Liv Morgan, Sami Zayn, Pat McAfee and more. The event comes days after Vince McMahon, WWE co-founder and former CEO, resigned from his role as TKO executive chairman and his position on TKO\u2019s board of directors. TKO is the parent company of WWE as of last year when it merged with UFC. McMahon\u2019s resignation follows a lawsuit that was filed on January 2, which accused him of sexual misconduct.\n\nThere were over 48,000 people in attendance at Tropicana Field \u2014 normally the home of MLB\u2019s Tampa Bay Rays \u2014 for this event, and from the energy inside the stadium, you could tell. I, along with everyone around me, was on my feet every time the countdown came on before the Royal Rumble match entrants, and the chants that started out of nowhere easily picked up around the entire stadium. Attending live wrestling events is indescribable. It\u2019s something that I think everyone should experience once in life, because it\u2019s so different from any other sport. It will be a night I\u2019ll never forget, so to reminisce, let\u2019s look at some of the standout moments of the night:\n\nWomen\u2019s Royal Rumble Match\nIn this match, two women start in the ring, while every 90 seconds, another woman enters until the number of wrestlers reaches 30. Each woman is trying to throw one another over the top rope to eliminate them from the match. In this case, Natalya started the match with Naomi, who returned from her hiatus with WWE. After 90 seconds, Bayley entered third, and so on and so forth. The stipulation for the match itself makes it interesting, but also the caliber of it, as the winner gets a shot at a world title and main eventing WrestleMania in April.\n\nSome standout moments were seeing some of NXT\u2019s greatest superstars, Roxanne Perez and Tiffany Stratton, in the rumble. They held their own, which hopefully means they\u2019ll be part of the full-time roster soon. Another fun moment was when Chelsea Green was caught in a sequence of attack after attack. From her own teammate accidentally hitting her to Nia Jax laying blows, Green was a pure ragdoll for a solid two minutes. Speaking of Jax, she was the woman so many superstars tried to get out, but failed. That was until Jade Cargill made her debut and proved just how strong she is. I\u2019m stoked to see what the future looks like for Cargill, though it was briefly hinted in the ring that a matchup against Bianca Belair is imminent.\n\nAt the end of the match, the last three women standing were Cargill, Bayley and Morgan, who returned from injury. Bayley had been in the match for over an hour at this point, a feat that only she and Naomi accomplished this time around. While my bet was for Morgan to win, Bayley won in the end. Still, I was satisfied with this outcome and some of the surprises. Did I mention R-Truth randomly appeared as part of his normal funny antics, because he thought it was the Men\u2019s Royal Rumble? It\u2019ll be exciting to see how this storyline with Bayley aiming for a mania main event goes. It\u2019s so deserving for the workhorse of the women\u2019s division and can make for a great feud against her fellow Damage CTRL member, Iyo Sky, who currently holds the WWE Women\u2019s Championship.\n\nFatal Four-Way Match\nIn a fatal four-way match for the WWE Universal Championship, Roman Reigns defended against LA Knight, Randy Orton and AJ Styles. While I knew Reigns was definitely retaining, and most likely from outside help as usual, I was still excited to see the actual match. Knight has become a megastar that you can\u2019t help but love. Styles has always been phenomenal, and since his recent return, he\u2019s come back with an even heavier grit. As for Orton, he\u2019s fresh on a return and is as clean as ever with his moves.\n\nSince this was a fatal four-way match, there were no disqualifications. That meant they could use weapons and spend as much time outside the ring as they wanted. For Orton and Knight, that meant taking turns dropping Reigns and Styles on top of the announcer\u2019s table. For Styles, that meant connecting on several steel chair shots with each of his competitors. For Reigns, that meant getting Solo Sikoa to do his dirty work, as usual, but also saving Reigns from being pinned.\n\nThe actual match was great, as all of the competitors each had a bone to pick with Reigns. Sadly, when you already know the outcome, it takes away from the match just a little bit. Reigns hit Styles with a spear to win the matchup and retain his championship.\n\nMen\u2019s Royal Rumble Match\nWith the same stipulations as the Women\u2019s Royal Rumble, the Men\u2019s Royal Rumble closed the night. I was going back and forth between my pick for winner \u2014 CM Punk or Cody Rhodes \u2014 but in the end, Rhodes pulled off the victory. What made this so significant was the fact that he also won the rumble last year. Back-to-back rumble wins are something super rare for a superstar. Now Rhodes can finish his story and rewrite history from last year\u2019s WrestleMania when he lost to Reigns.\n\nSimilar to the Women\u2019s Royal Rumble, two NXT-bred superstars, Carmelo Hayes and Bron Breakker, really showed out with their performances. Unfortunately, it looks like Punk suffered a torn triceps during the match and will be out with injury for several months.\n\nOverall, the night was fantastic because there\u2019s truly nothing like the Royal Rumble. Sure, there could have been a few more surprises or returns, but you can\u2019t have everything. There was also a match between Kevin Owens and Logan Paul for the United States championship. Again, a great matchup in terms of the wrestling, but the same tired \u2018brass knuckles\u2019 storyline was used, and it gets old after a while.\n\nI highly recommend people go back and watch this premium live event if they can, or at least the two rumble matches. The road to WrestleMania has officially begun!\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d is a pro wrestling column by Maddy Myer that runs every Monday.\n```"}

The Ducks sit second-to-last in the Pacific Division, only trailed by the San Jose Sharks, and are due to receive another high draft pick. While the season has been full of negatives, the future may hold greatness if the pieces can come together. Through 49 games played, there\u2019s no better time to reflect on Anaheim\u2019s first-half highlights as the All-Star break approaches.\n\nFrank Vatrano\u2019s breakout year\nVatrano may have had an unconventional path to NHL relevancy, going undrafted and now playing on his fourth team in nine years, but the winger has found his groove in Orange County. Entering 2023-24, Vatrano was coming off a solid 41-point campaign in the previous season but now sits on the verge of passing his personal best with 35 points already, leading the Ducks. While the first-time All-Star has drawn interest from contenders in the trade market, Vatrano has been the main contributor to the Ducks\u2019 wins. His 21 goals include four game-winners, displaying his ability to score at will and be a veteran leader on a rebuilding team.\n\nVatrano\u2019s breakout began right at the start of the season, when Anaheim looked like a dark-horse playoff team. The 29-year-old scored nine goals in the first month of the season and helped the Ducks win six straight games, including upsets over the reigning champion Vegas Golden Knights and Presidents\u2019 Trophy-winning Boston Bruins. While the team fell off immediately afterwards, losing eight straight in the latter half of November, Vatrano didn\u2019t lose his stride and has been a source of positivity throughout Anaheim\u2019s woes.\n\nAlthough Vatrano\u2019s future on the Ducks is uncertain, Anaheim could certainly take advantage of his flashy trade value to help with the rebuild. Considering that he is having a career year, and the Ducks sit nowhere close to a playoff spot, moving him near the deadline could make for a good deal if they find a buyer willing to give up picks and prospects.\n\nA big season for Adam Henrique\nLike Vatrano, veteran center Adam Henrique is also having a standout season. As he heads into free agency, he\u2019ll likely be moved before the deadline, but trading him might be in Anaheim\u2019s best interest. The Ducks would likely receive some long-term pieces like draft capital or prospects in return.\n\nHenrique has tallied a point in all but four games in January, which one can attribute to his speed and craftiness in the offensive zone. Henrique will hope to finish with a 50-point campaign, as he reached that mark in the 2011-12 and 2015-16 seasons. He has 32 already this year, so he\u2019s in good shape to replicate his prior success.\n\nThe 33-year-old has been linked to a variety of playoff-hopefuls including the Avalanche, Devils, Jets and more. Be on the lookout for trade updates as Henrique has been a premier name on the market.\n\nYoung talent on the rise\nWhile injury-ridden star center Trevor Zegras has played less than half of the Ducks\u2019 games, Anaheim\u2019s other young players have developed positively. While already in his seventh season, right winger Troy Terry is still only 26 years old and has been a reliable, point-producing forward again this year. His 21 assists lead the team, and like Vatrano, he\u2019s been clutch; most recently, his two goals against the Minnesota Wild on Saturday included the Ducks\u2019 game-winner, which also extended his point streak to five games.\n\nCenter Mason McTavish had sky-high expectations when the franchise drafted him No. 3 overall in 2021, but his rapid progression has already proven him a standout pro. McTavish\u2019s 30 points so far put him on pace to pass last season\u2019s 43-point mark and the Ducks will hope to keep him long-term.\n\nPicking center Leo Carlsson No. 2 overall last summer might have surprised Ducks fans, putting him ahead of the touted Adam Fantilli and other prospects, but Carlsson has already been proving doubters wrong. His size and offensive prowess have made him a shifty player that can generate points while also being physical, allowing him to evade defenders with ease.\n\nDefenseman Pavel Mintyukov is currently on the injured reserve, but when he\u2019s been on the ice, he\u2019s been an elite passer at just 20 years old. The No. 10 pick in 2022 has been a major upside in the Ducks\u2019 defensive zone.\n\nWhile Ducks fans have endured a half-decade of pain, there will be a lot to look forward to in the coming years. Anaheim\u2019s rebuilding phase has allowed them to combine veteran mentorship with promising prospects, something that has helped them develop young players into burgeoning stars.\n```"}

Opening statements for the ousted politician were heard Thursday. Ridley-Thomas, 69, was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison in August for conspiring with former USC School of Social Work Dean Marilyn Flynn. He allegedly received benefits for his son, Sebastian, in exchange for voting for contracts in favor of USC. The former politician was found guilty of conspiracy, bribery and five counts of honest-services fraud. He was acquitted of 12 other charges related to his son\u2019s admission, scholarship and professorship at USC. Flynn pleaded guilty to bribery and was ordered to pay a $150,000 fine. Ridley-Thomas\u2019 lawyers argued that the 9th Circuit should either reverse the convictions or grant a new trial. During the opening briefs, they claimed that prosecutors defined bribery in a way that would jeopardize standard political practices. The lawyers also argued that the jury-selection process was flawed because government attorneys allegedly excluded two Black women from serving on the jury.

After a hot start to the season, the Trojans have cooled down, losing three of their last four games, including their first home loss of the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I thought that we came out here and said, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re wearing USC on our jerseys, and therefore we\u2019re going to win,\u2019\u201d head coach Lindsey Gottlieb said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t win like that.\u201d\n\nUSC graduate guard Kayla Padilla scored a team-high 20 points, hitting a season-high six threes. USC freshman guard JuJu Watkins struggled from the field all game, finishing with 20 points on 8-of-27 shooting. Washington senior forward Lauren Schwartz scored a game-high 21 points, along with three rebounds and three assists.\n\nIn the recent losses, the glaring problem has been the Trojans\u2019 shooting inefficiencies from the field. Against the Huskies, the struggles continued and were apparent early on in the game. The Trojans finished the game shooting 37% from the field.\n\nFor the Trojans, their slow start from the field mixed with low energy, which hurt them the rest of the way. The whole game USC found itself fighting an uphill battle, only holding a lead for one minute in the first half.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like our energy. I didn\u2019t like our juice in the first half,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nOn the other hand, the Huskies\u2019 patient offense and smart shot selections had them leading the rest of the game. The Huskies simply came into this game wanting to be the more aggressive team, and the results showed on the court.\n\nWashington completely dominated the paint, out-rebounding the Trojans 39 to 24. But, even after a sluggish first-half performance, the Trojans still managed to stay alive until the final buzzer.\n\nTrailing by eight points with 30 seconds to go, there was little hope left for Trojan fans in the stands.\n\n\u201cThe first half was a bit stubborn, like we recognized what we needed to change, but we\u2019re not necessarily executing on that,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cAnd at that point we had a great second half, but we were just trying to climb out of all that.\u201d\n\nHowever, back-to-back 3-pointers by Watkins and Padilla in the next nine seconds completely changed the atmosphere in Galen Center. After the six straight points, the Trojans were only down three with 27 seconds left. \n\nNot a single fan was in their seat anymore, as there was newfound energy in the building.\n\nFollowing a free throw trip for the Huskies, putting their lead back to four points, the Trojans responded again. Padilla, who had the hot hand all game, converted on a second-chance 3-pointer to bring the margin back to one point.\n\nWith 1.3 seconds left, the Huskies inbounded from their baseline with a rocking Galen Center behind them. The Huskies got the inbound pass in, but a split-second later, graduate forward McKenzie Forbes attempted to steal the ball in the process. While everybody in the stands thought USC had pulled off a miraculous comeback, the referee whistled a foul on Forbes for her steal attempt.\n\nThe Huskies headed back to the line to ice the game, surviving a last-second comeback by the Trojans.\n\nThe Trojans head back on the road for another two-game stretch, starting at Stanford on Friday at 7 p.m. and Cal Sunday at noon.\n```"}

The author of the book on which the film is based, Amy Liptrot, helped hone the script, alongside director Nora Fingscheidt and Ronan, who produced (with Jack Lowden). The trio opted to change the lead\u2019s name to Rona to help provide some \u201chealthy distance and creative freedom\u201d for them all, but the story is grounded in Liptrot\u2019s intimate truths.\n\nWe first meet Rona in a voiceover in which she explains an important piece of Irish folklore: a tale about how when people drown and are lost to the sea, they turn into seals. These humans-turned-seals, called Selkies, come to the shore at night and dance naked. They are free and wild in the night, but if a human sees them, they are unable to return to the sea. They become discontent on land, stuck in a world where they don\u2019t belong.\n\nWe then see Rona dancing, face bedazzled in jewels, blue haired and joyous. She\u2019s at a club with a lover, both swimming in electronic music and sweaty bodies. We are jolted to a different moment in time. Under fluorescent lights, she is alone, guzzling a beer as the bartender, with whom she seems familiar, begs her to leave. What starts as a friendly request \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re closing, it\u2019s time to go\u201d \u2014 turns into a violent struggle as she is booted to the curb. She\u2019s an aggressive drunk, a mess.\n\nThe metaphor is profound. Rona is a Selkie trying to find her way back to the sea. But she can\u2019t return because the sea was killing her. Rona is an alcoholic who has lost the life she loved and is forced into a new one, which feels joyless to her now.\n\nRonan admitted in an interview with the Sundance Institute: \u201cI don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve been psychologically ready to take on a role like this even three or four years ago. I wouldn\u2019t have been secure enough in myself. I wouldn\u2019t have been secure enough as an actor to feel brave enough to take on someone whose ugly parts we see consistently throughout the whole film.\u201d\n\nSaoirse Ronan at the Sundance Film Festival premiere of her new film \"The Outrun\" (Photo courtesy of Sundance Institute)\n\nTo capture these drunken nights in the most honest way, the team brought in choreographer Wayne McGregor. Saoirse explained that \u201che worked a lot on how Rona would move when she was drunk, but fun drunk, and how she would move when she was heavy drunk and messy drunk, and how she would move when she was sober and in recovery and nervous. How she would move with her father versus her boyfriend. All these different scenarios to give me an awareness of how to hold this character in my body at different stages of her life, so that was the biggest way in for me.\u201d\n\nFast-forward and Rona has left London to spend some time in recovery, living with her separated parents working on the farm where she grew up. Her father (Stephen Dillane) suffers from bipolar disorder and we slowly begin to understand the immense impact that he has had on her life, how similar she is to him. Her mother (Saskia Reeves) has turned to religion, a path that has given her a lot of peace, but has isolated her from the rest of the family.\n\nFingscheidt tackles the complicated timeline of this film cleverly: using Rona\u2019s hair color to help the audience establish various periods of her life. She paces the film and Rona\u2019s varied memories according to her emotional state. In the beginning of the film, the scenes move from one to the next in a way that is quick and jolted. It is difficult to grasp hold of them, almost as if we are drunk ourselves, moving recklessly from one room to another of Rona\u2019s memory.\n\nRegarding this approach in an interview for the Sundance Institute, Fingscheidt explained: \u201cThere are three layers to the story: the Orkney layer, which is sort of gray and blueish and greenish; the memory layer, which is colorful and pink and orange and the extreme opposite, so the two of them are intertwined; and then London becomes more distorted and out of focus and you see the color drop out of it, whereas Orkney opens up and becomes full of life.\u201d\n\nThe power of \u201cThe Outrun\u201d is its ability to understand the layers of addiction and the heavy battle that a person must fight within themselves to get to the other side and find any sort of peace. One character says to Rona of the process: \u201cIt never gets easy... it just gets less hard.\u201d\n\nThe film is a simmering excavation. It can be monotonous as we trek along with Rona in her nightly search for the sound of the corncrake bird, a species at risk for extinction. For much of the film, Rona is antisocial and uncomfortable in her skin. Her insecurities are obvious and off-putting to others in the small town where she now resides, and her unhappiness is glaring. It is easy to understand why she is alone. It is hard to imagine her being any other way.\n\nBut as we dip into her various memories of when she first fell in love, when she spent her days working in a biology lab, effortlessly scoring As without needing to study much at all, riding bikes with her friends and laughing freely, we understand her pain in a more nuanced way. \u201cI can\u2019t be happy sober,\u201d she admits at one point in the film, solidifying the picture that we, as an audience, have started to paint.\n\nThe profound thing about this film is that the human experience, addicted or not, is full of this type of inner struggle. To truly be happy, we are required to do so much work. We all experience trauma in some capacity, and if we numb ourselves from understanding our limitations, we tend to eventually fall into a depressive or regretful state. But \u201cdoing the work\u201d is immensely challenging and discouraging. It is much easier to find a quick fix; to suppress and ignore.\n\nAddicts who are trying to get sober are stripped of all their crutches in such an abrupt and painful way that it is almost as though they must rebuild their entire existence from scratch. How does one experience joy again when so much of their social life was prompted by liquid courage? How does one face their own shame with nothing to hide behind?\n\nRona is reliant on nature. As a biologist, she has what Fingscheidt calls the \u201cNerd Layer,\u201d which she also described in the same interview with the Sundance Institute, as a crucial element from the book that needed to be depicted on-screen: \u201cIt is the most intimate insight into Rona\u2019s head and her perception of the world.\u201d\n\nIt can be difficult to bring an inner monologue from a book to a visual medium without losing its impact, but here, Fingscheidt used archival footage and animation to unravel these complicated concepts and \u201cnerdy\u201d diatribes. And due to the aesthetic choices made in these montages, it worked.\n\nA factoid that Ronan found the most surprising is that human beings share about 60% of the same DNA as jellyfish, for example. Through these elements, we learn factual and historical information from Rona, but we also gain a more layered understanding of her as a person: her logical and scientific approach to life.\n\n\u201cThe Outrun\u201d is one of the films from the festival that isn\u2019t easy to shake. The details and monotony connect us so deeply with the character that every small victory feels earned. We become her, in a sense. We feel her struggle and, therefore, we also feel her ecstasy after jumping into the icy waters of the Northern Sea, or the hope that comes with finally feeling passionate about something after years of disillusionment.\n\nIt is a beautiful film in every sense of the world and Saoirse Ronan, just 29 years old, has proved once again that she is one of the finest working actors today. The film feels cathartic and intelligent. It shows, not tells, the transformative power of healing \u2014 through wildlife, the sea, the expansive cliffs overlooking what seems like an abyss. The healing powers of the wind and a strong fire. The metamorphosis that comes from moving through one\u2019s pain and the strength that metastasizes from small things: lighting candles, dancing to music, cooking your favorite meal. These little moments, these small wins, are what make up a life.\n```"}

There were many big names in attendance, including NBA legend Scottie Pippen as well as USC alum and former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez.\n\nUSC came into the matchup on a four-game losing streak, while UCLA lost its previous game at Arizona. Both teams had 8-11 records prior to the matchup, with USC having won six of the last nine games against the Bruins, as well as five consecutive wins against UCLA at home.\n\nEveryone was on their feet as fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis scored his first 3-pointer of the evening about two minutes into the game after not playing in the last three games due to a hamstring injury. However, after scoring eight of the Trojans\u2019 first 10 points, he did not score again for the rest of the game.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t let me catch the ball,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cThey did a great job of face-guarding me. They made me work hard every possession.\u201d\n\nHead coach Andy Enfield spoke on the future of the Trojans\u2019 captain and top leading scorer. \u201cBoogie came out and made those three shots, and then I thought you could tell his timing\u2019s a little off,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cHe only practiced one day in the last three weeks ... so he\u2019s not quite back yet to where he needs to be. He needs to keep getting stronger and get his win back and his timing back, and I\u2019m sure he will soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no excuse,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get my feet underneath me and just get back in shape.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, standout freshman guard Isaiah Collier hasn\u2019t played since January 10 due to a hand injury and will continue to be out for several more weeks. In USC\u2019s last three games, the Trojans have had just over half of their 15 players available.\n\nThe Trojans and the Bruins appeared evenly matched throughout the first half, with UCLA picking up speed and shots toward the end of the half. UCLA led 37-26 at halftime.\n\n\u201cWe came out and played pretty well defensively in the first half until the seven-minute mark,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe just did not play very well offensively with our shot-making and our finishing around the rim. We couldn\u2019t get a lot of easy baskets and unfortunately got outplayed in certain areas tonight, and I\u2019ll take the blame for that.\u201d\n\nGoing into the second half, the Trojans were not able to get within 10 points. UCLA had its largest lead of the night at 18 with two minutes left in the game. Sophomore guard Oziyah Sellers was the leading scorer and only player with double-digit points for the Trojans, though he had just 10 points. Junior guard Kobe Johnson, like Ellis, also only scored eight points. Freshman guard Bronny James put up a mere two points in his 15 minutes of playing time.\n\nAside from USC\u2019s leading scorers not finding much success on the court, junior forward Harrison Hornery only saw about a minute of playing time in the entire game, despite struggles from the Trojans\u2019 big men.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re struggling this year with a variety of things, [but] we enjoy playing UCLA,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s great for the league, it\u2019s great for the city, and unfortunately tonight they played better than us.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s no secret that the season hasn\u2019t gone exactly the way we wanted it to, but at the end of the day, we\u2019re a team; we\u2019re a family,\u201d redshirt senior forward Joshua Morgan said.\n\nUSC (8-12, 2-7 Pac-12) looks to bounce back from its losing streak on Friday against Oregon at Galen Center at 7:30 p.m.\n\n\u201cGoing into February, I feel like we\u2019ve got to lock in and stack up some wins,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cEverything we\u2019re doing now is to prepare for the Pac-12 tournament.\u201d```"}

Shohei Ohtani has been named The Associated Press' Male Athlete of the Year for the second time in three years. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File)\n\nBy Matt Kim January 27, 2024 at 1:29 pm PST\n\nWith the Shohei Ohtani sweepstakes over, Angels fans can only look back at his dominance in Anaheim as they prepare to move forward to 2024. Baseball fans are already counting out the Halos as spring training approaches. When a 73-win team loses a player like Ohtani, it\u2019s easy to envision the worst. Looking at the current 40-man roster, however, there\u2019s an intriguing new wave of youth combined with some exciting returning veterans.\n\nKey Returners\n\nMike Trout\n\nThe three-time MVP, 11x All-Star and cornerstone of the Angels franchise is still producing at an elite level, albeit not quite at his peak MVP level. The most important factor for him will be health and staying on the field for the Angels. Dating back to 2019, Trout has only been on the field for 60 percent of the Angels games. It\u2019s obvious that when he\u2019s manning center field, the Angels are a better team, so they\u2019re depending on a healthy Trout for future success.\n\nAnthony Rendon\n\nWhen the Angels signed the then 29-year-old Rendon to a lucrative seven-year, $245 million dollar contract in 2019, the future looked bright in Anaheim. Until it didn\u2019t. This contract has been an absolute disaster outside of the Covid-shortened 2020 season. Rendon earned the nickname \u201cTony Two Bags\u201d in Washington when he led the National League in doubles from 2018-19, but Angels haven\u2019t seen much of that power thus far. In the past three seasons, Rendon hasn\u2019t even played a full year\u2019s worth of games. He\u2019s only hit 13 home runs, a far cry from his 25 home-run power with the Nationals. Even more surprisingly, he\u2019s only hit 29 doubles. It seems that the injuries have taken a toll on his power. Unfortunately things don\u2019t get much better off the field. He\u2019s had altercations with fans, refuses to speak with the media at times. In recent news, Rendon was quoted on the Jack Vita show saying, \u201cWe gotta shorten the season up. It\u2019s too many dang games,\u201d and an article by CBS sports cites an ex-Nationals teammate saying Rendon \u201chates baseball\u201d. Not a great look for a player looking to turn it around and be a mentor for the younger guys on the team. Things may have started poorly, but Rendon still has time to turn it around. He has three years left on his contract and the Angels will without a doubt have the hot corner reserved for him when he\u2019s healthy. The Angels aren\u2019t expecting his previous levels or production, but if he can turn in a healthy 2024 season with above-average production, Angels fans will be elated.\n\nReid Detmers\n\nThe former number-two ranked prospect in the Angels farm system has turned in a pair of solid yet unspectacular seasons since his rough rookie campaign. Over those two seasons, he recorded a 4.15 ERA and in 2023, a stellar 10.2 K/9. If Detmers had a qualifying innings total, that mark would\u2019ve had him ranked tenth in MLB ahead of guys like Gerrit Cole, Zach Wheeler and Corbin Burnes. The Angels rotation as a whole is full of uncertainty as they lack a true ace. As it stands right now, their rotation consists of Detmers, Patrick Sandoval, Tyler Anderson, Chase Silseth, and Griffin Canning. Sandoval and Anderson have found success at the big-league level but had down 2023 campaigns. Silseth and Canning are promising young pitchers, but neither have taken the leap quite yet toward becoming a workhorse. Detmers has a great combination of youth, experience, and a nasty arsenal. All signs point towards him being the top dog of the Angels rotation as he continues to develop as a pitcher.\n\nNew Kids on the Block\n\nLogan O\u2019 Hoppe, Nolan Schanuel, and Zach Neto\n\nAll three of the Halos\u2019 younger faces are former top prospects in the Angels system, and for good reason. O\u2019 Hoppe, acquired in a trade from the Phillies in exchange for Brandon Marsh, had a promising rookie campaign. He was off to a hot start in April before tearing his labrum and returning late in the season. In only 51 games, he mashed 14 home runs, great offensive numbers from a rookie catcher. With a glimpse of the big leagues, he\u2019ll be looking to explode onto the scene in his sophomore season. Schanuel only appeared in 29 games in 2023, but has already flashed maturity at the plate. The 2023 draftee jumped right to the big league club after a brief stint in the minors and set a rookie record by reaching base safely in all of his first 16 games. He also walked more than he struck out. The thing for Schanuel is the power, as he only recorded one home run in 109 plate appearances. Schanuel is a first baseman as well, so he\u2019s expected to provide some middle-of-the-order power at an offensive-heavy position. The good thing is he\u2019s still considered a rookie throughout the 2024 season, so he has plenty of time to find that power stroke the Angels saw in him at FAU. For Neto, it\u2019s the same story for many who have donned an Angels jersey in the past decade, and that\u2019s staying healthy. When he was on the field, he played solid defense at shortstop and showed potential at the plate, but it was difficult for him to develop with so many injuries throughout the year.\n\nExpectations\n\nThe Angels aren\u2019t going to be fighting for a division title in the stacked American League West. They\u2019ll be competing with contenders like the reigning World Series champion Texas Rangers, the always-dangerous Houston Astros and a young, competitive Mariners team. They also didn\u2019t add anybody in free agency outside of a recent addition to the bullpen in Robert Stephenson who they signed to a three-year, $33 million dollar deal. Stephenson was one of the more sought out bullpen arms in free agency, and he\u2019ll be a great addition to the backend of a deteriorated bullpen. There are still many holes in their roster, mainly in the bullpen. The 2023 Angels had the sixth-worst bullpen in baseball in ERA and were bottom ten in key statistics like K/9, BB/9, and HR/9. Stephenson will surely be a key contributor, but outside of him and Carlos Estevez, there isn\u2019t much to be fond of. The starting rotation isn\u2019t necessarily bottom of the barrel, but they need an established MLB ace. Free agent Blake Snell still remains without a team, and the Angels have been connected to him throughout the offseason. The 2-time Cy Young award winner would be a major addition to the rotation and would be the Angels first blockbuster move of the offseason. In the event of a key injury, which Angels fans have unfortunately become very accustomed to, there isn\u2019t much depth to replace MLB level talent. Bleacher Report had the Angels farm system ranked 27th so promoting minor league talent throughout the season may not translate as well as teams with top ranked farm systems. But don\u2019t count the Angels out too early. At a high point in last year\u2019s season, they were in win-now mode, acquiring big trade deadline names like Lucas Giolito, Randal Grichuk, and CJ Cron in an effort to supplement Ohtani in what was now his final year in Anaheim. The Angels have maintained most of their roster from that team and a new youth movement at the Big A might be what the team needs to be sneaky good. Other key contributors like Taylor Ward, Brandon Drury, and Luis Rengifo have all been quality pieces at the major league level as well. What ties this all together is the new addition at the top of the dugout steps in Ron Washington. Washington has been at the helm of championship-level teams such as the Rangers in the early 2010s, and was a part of the Braves coaching staff that won it all in 2021. Washington has long been a favorite by players, especially the young stars of today\u2019s game. Ronald Acuna Jr. and Ozzie Albies thrived under his development in Atlanta and credited a large part of their success to him. That coincides perfectly with the current state of the Angels roster and it seems like a match made in heaven. If the Angels can finally shake that pesky injury bug, they\u2019ll surprise baseball with their success and hopefully make a trip to the playoffs for the first time since 2014.\n```"}

(Photo by SAM YANG)\n\nBy Daniel Palmore\nJanuary 27, 2024 at 11:59 am PST\n\nEntering Friday\u2019s home matchup against Washington State, No. 11 USC was coming off two tough losses on the road against No. 20 Utah and No. 3 Colorado. It marked the first time the Trojans had lost consecutive games this season, following a three-game winning streak that included a home victory over No. 2 UCLA.\n\nComing off those two disappointing losses, USC wasted no time against the Cougars and played with haste from tipoff. After leading by as many as 21 points during the game, the Trojans came out on top with a 70-62 wire-to-wire victory at Galen Center.\n\n\u201cI thought we did a great job out of the gates and really asserted ourselves,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cWe made it a little closer than we would have liked, but a lot of respect to the other team, and we know there are some things we can manage better down the stretch.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans built a double-digit lead to open the game as USC began the first period on a 10-0 scoring run. Freshman guard JuJu Watkins scored half of those points on her way to finishing the first half with 21 of USC\u2019s 43 points.\n\nWatkins was efficient in the first half, as she made seven of her 15 field goal attempts, which included going 50% from the three-point line and 100% from the charity stripe. Watkins had the hot hand for the Trojans in the first, so much so that she channeled her inner Cristiano Ronaldo and hit his signature \u201cSiu\u201d celebration after making a tough stepback jumpshot as time expired in the first quarter.\n\nGraduate guard McKenzie Forbes also made her presence felt throughout the first half. She had 13 points on 5-for-8 shooting from the field and made three out of five attempts from beyond the arc.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m in the game, I\u2019m confident and I have no reason not to be,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cI think it just kind of happened naturally. I think it has a lot to do with the trust coach has in me and my teammates finding me.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans were firing on all cylinders on the offensive side of the ball and also made points hard to come by for Washington State. In the first half, the Cougars were just 9-for-27 from the field and made just four out of 14 three-point attempts. Washington State also committed eight turnovers to USC\u2019s five and faced a 43-25 halftime deficit.\n\nWatkins and Forbes combined for 34 points in the first half and were the only two players on either team to score in double figures. With Watkins and Forbes filling up the stat sheet, the Trojans looked to use the attention they garner to get other players involved and make their offense as efficient as possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a high-powered offense,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThe pressure [Watkins and Forbes] put on defenses allows other people to find their rhythm and find their spots.\u201d\n\nThe second half, however, was a different story for the Trojans. They were outscored 37-27 through the period, as Washington State found its rhythm on offense and disrupted the Trojans\u2019 offensive flow.\n\nAfter an efficient shooting performance in the first half, Watkins struggled in the second half offensively, scoring just eight points on 3-for-12 shooting from the field. Forbes, who made three 3-point shots in the first half, made only one in the second half and was held to nine points on 3-for-10 shooting from the field.\n\n\u201cI think I need to be a little more careful with my shot selection and keep trying to make the right plays,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cI\u2019m just happy we won, honestly. We had one of our best first halves all season, and we just need to make sure we apply things that we can improve on in practice.\u201d\n\nUSC struggled in the third quarter specifically; the Trojans were held scoreless for the final 3:40 of the period. However, Watkins came up with a block reminiscent of a volleyball spike to end the quarter, as Washington State attempted a half-court buzzer beater with 1.1 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Trojans play every game expecting teams to center their defensive gameplan around slowing Watkins down, and the Trojans are continuing to find ways to counter that strategy.\n\n\u201cWe are playing Pac-12 teams who are some of the best defensive teams in the league,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cEvery single game plan is about \u2018How do we stop [Watkins]?\u2019 and we still feel like we\u2019re surprised when she misses.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans entered the fourth quarter with a 12-point lead and were outscored 20-16 by the Cougars. Even though the Cougars outplayed USC in the fourth, Watkins still found a way to produce another signature play.\n\nWith just under five minutes remaining in the game, Watkins was guarded tightly by freshman guard Jenna Villa and unleashed a between-the-legs dribble that sent her defender to the floor. This gave Watkins a wide-open 3-point look that went right through the net.\n\n\u201cI saw it coming,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cThe moment she went back that way and the girl chested up and stopped her, I knew she was going to go down.\u201d\n\nDespite the second half struggles, USC\u2019s performance was good enough to earn its 14th victory of the season. The Trojans\u2019 homestand continues against Washington, where the action will tip off at noon on Sunday at the Galen Center.\n```"}

He picks up more gigs helping the police department catch people trying to find a murderer-for-hire, and tries out a slew of personalities and costumes in the process.\n\nIn a particularly memorable montage of his hitman roles, Gary tries out a series of accents, applies artificial facial hair, uses colored contacts and even gives a stab at a Patrick Bateman impression, pun intended. He seems to be loving the double life he is leading, switching back and forth from swindling criminals to refilling his bird feeder and listening to classical music while reading.\n\nThat is, until he meets a beautiful damsel in distress seeking his services. The film then develops into a killer rom-com, pun also intended, between Gary and Madison, played by Adria Arjona. The only problem between the relationship that blossoms between the two is that Madison thinks Gary is actually the mysterious and macho Ron, a bonafide hitman.\n\nWhat follows is a series of close-calls, hijinks and layered irony, which is a delight to watch. The film\u2019s premise is enough to grab your attention, but the stellar performances and sharp writing keep that attention; and, keep you laughing. The premise also simultaneously feels both familiar and fresh, which is impressive. It has a classic \u201cMr and Mrs. Smith\u201d feel while still being exciting and unpredictable.\n\nMost of that excitement comes from Powell\u2019s magnetism on screen and his witty writing. Powell collaborated with director Richard Linklater on the script, and despite what may seem like an out-of-the-ordinary plotline and main character, they based the story on the life of a real Renaissance man named Gary Johnson. Powell and Linklater used a 2001 Texas Monthly article about the real Gary Johnson as inspiration for the film, but some of the larger plot twists and more dramatic elements of the film were by their own design.\n\nWith his multi-hyphenate capacity as the star, co-writer and producer of this action-packed film, Powell seems to be giving Tom Cruise a run for his money. It\u2019s an instant classic, designed to prompt more dynamic roles and writing gigs for Powell in future projects.\n\n\u201cThis movie was designed for the audience,\u201d Powell said at a Q&A following a screening of the film at Sundance on Monday. \u201cThank you for making that so fun, it was almost as fun to shoot.\u201d\n\n\u201cHit Man\u201d will be available to stream on Netflix on June 7.\n```"}

(AP/Rick Bowmer)\n\nBy Tripp Carrington January 26, 2024 at 3:58 pm PST\n\nThis week\u2019s recap covers games from January 19 through 25.\n\nTeam of the Week\nPurdue dominates twice, restates case for best team in the nation\n\nAfter a disappointing loss to an unranked Nebraska Cornhuskers team two weeks ago, the Purdue Boilermakers dropped to No. 2 in the AP Poll after nearly a month of holding the top spot. Coming into this week, they had already righted the ship with two consecutive conference wins, but tests against the Iowa Hawkeyes and Michigan Wolverines still loomed.\n\nOn Saturday, the Boilermakers went into Carver-Hawkeye arena, where Iowa was 8-1 on the season, and made a statement. National Player of the Year favorite Zach Edey continued to make history by logging his third straight game recording at least 30 points and 14 rebounds en route to a double digit victory. Additionally, Edey blocked four shots, whereas every other player on the court combined for just three total blocks.\n\nConsistent with the rest of this season, Edey\u2019s output was absurd, and the rest of Purdue\u2019s starters made solid contributions as well. Lance Jones made four of his nine three-point attempts, and Fletcher Loyer scored 12 points. In terms of ball movement, the Boilermakers relied heavily on Braden Smith, who dished out nine assists.\n\nPurdue led by as many as 19 points, never letting the Hawkeyes within striking distance in the second half. Iowa has yet to find their signature win this season, and may be in danger of missing the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIowa still hopes to go dancing, but Purdue\u2019s second opponent this week, Michigan, has completely squandered their chance at an at-large bid due to an awful 7-12 start, including a 22-point blowout loss to Purdue on Tuesday night. The game was already a foregone conclusion at halftime: the Boilermakers led by 24 points, and Edey did not play the last nine minutes.\n\nThis week\u2019s two convincing victories remind the nation who has the best r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in the country. Purdue has 18 wins, five of which came against ranked teams, and just two losses, which were both on the road to conference opponents. The Boilermakers have the best offense in the country, led by the best player in the country. Regardless of where they are ranked in the AP Poll, they will be the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament for the second consecutive year barring a historic collapse.\n\nDriving the Struggle Bus\nBYU\u2019s wheels fall off in the nation\u2019s toughest conference\n\nThe BYU Cougars ended non-conference play with an impressive 12-1 record, but the team was more than aware that their first year in the Big 12, the most challenging conference in college basketball, would be a major test. In fact, after their last non-conference contest, a huge 26-point victory over the Wyoming Cowboys, fifth-year head coach Mark Pope said, \u201cWe\u2019re stepping into 18 straight really, really challenging games where we\u2019ll have all kind of things happen to us.\u201d\n\nThis week, Coach Pope\u2019s prediction came to fruition. BYU\u2019s opponent on the road this week was the Texas Tech Red Raiders. They have yet to lose a game on their home floor, but BYU seemed unphased by their deadly home court advantage after finishing the first half with a sizable 48-32 lead.\n\nHowever, BYU was sloppy, turning over the ball 12 times as opposed to Texas Tech\u2019s six turnovers. Additionally, the Cougars had trouble getting to the foul line, an issue that has plagued them all season long. According to kenpom.com, BYU ranks in the bottom three of all 362 D1 schools in the percentage of their points that come from free throws.\n\nOn Saturday, they scored just three points from the charity stripe, whereas 17 of Texas Tech\u2019s points were made free throws. Suffice to say, BYU\u2019s halftime lead vanished, and the Red Raiders were victorious, 85-78.\n\nAfter a short two-day turnaround, BYU was faced with an even tougher opponent, the No. 4 ranked Houston Cougars. This season, Houston\u2019s defense has obliterated teams in ways that match up extremely well with BYU\u2019s weaknesses. For example, per kenpom.com, Houston\u2019s defense causes the third-highest percentage of turnovers per possession in the country, and BYU\u2019s offense ranks tenth in turnover percentage out of the 14 Big 12 teams in conference play this season.\n\nOn Monday night, Houston forced 13 turnovers against BYU and held their offense to under 70 points for just the fourth time this season. In addition, BYU\u2019s leading scorer this year, Jaxson Robinson, shot a ghastly 2-10 from beyond the three-point line.\n\nUltimately, Houston\u2019s defense proved too much to handle, and BYU dropped their second straight contest, 75-68. The margin for error in the Big 12 is miniscule, and BYU will have to avoid being out-hustled by opponents if they are going to have success in conference play.\n\nHowever, recent struggles do not take away what has been an immensely successful season for the Cougars. After Monday\u2019s loss, Guard Dallin Hall said that the team \u201cha[s]... more room to grow, which is exciting.\u201d Whether or not BYU learns from their losses in January will determine how they handle the gauntlet that is March Madness.\n\nStayin\u2019 Alive\nSouth Carolina boosts their tournament odds after SEC upset\n\nComing into this week, the South Carolina Gamecocks were 14-3 without a single home loss to a non-conference opponent, yet they haven\u2019t been ranked all year and are on the outside looking into the NCAA Tournament. Why is that? Well, they had not yet secured a signature win against a ranked opponent.\n\nHowever, with the No. 6 Kentucky Wildcats coming into town on Tuesday night, the Gamecocks had their chance to slay a giant. But first, they had to travel to Bud Walton Arena on Saturday night and face off against the Arkansas Razorbacks.\n\nThis season, the Razorbacks had lofty expectations following an impressive trip to the Sweet 16. Disappointingly, they have only mustered up a 10-9 record, including Saturday\u2019s loss to the Gamecocks.\n\nSouth Carolina had four of their five starters score in double figures, including an 18-point effort from fifth year senior forward B.J. Mack. The Gamecocks\u2019 leading scorer this season, Meechie Johnson Jr., had the lowest scoring output of the starters, which shows that South Carolina\u2019s offense is one of the more balanced groups in the country.\n\nThe story of the game was on the glass, as the Gamecocks outrebounded the Razorbacks 36-24. Rebounding has been a strength of South Carolina\u2019s attack all season long: they rank in the top 40 in the country in offensive rebounding percentage per kenpom.com.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Gamecocks outrebounded the Wildcats and shot eight percentage points higher from the floor. Surprisingly, after a 23-23 tie late in the first half, South Carolina never gave up the lead and coasted to victory.\n\nThis time, they were led by a different starter, Ta\u2019Lon Cooper, who scored 20 points on an efficient 8-11 shooting. Kentucky is still in control of their own destiny regarding their seeding placement in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nNow, South Carolina is, too. The Gamecocks will need to continue to defend their home floor over the next month, but assuming they are able to do so, they will punch a ticket to March Madness.\n\nEndangered Species\nNC State is dangerously close to losing their way out of the tournament field\n\nLike South Carolina, NC State entered this week with a decent record, 13-4, but zero quality wins. However, there was no team of Kentucky\u2019s caliber on their schedule to give them a chance to prove themselves.\n\nIn early March, the Wolfpack will play No. 3 North Carolina and No. 12 Duke in back-to-back games, but with the ACC in the midst of a down season, their early conference slate has been against mostly mediocre teams.\n\nTherefore, it is imperative that they stay out of the loss column if they want to be in consideration for an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nOn Saturday, the Wolfpack played a home game against an unranked, 10-7 Virginia State Hokies squad. The first half was disappointing for NC State, as they went into the locker room down one point, desperately needing energy to pull forward in the game\u2019s final 20 minutes.\n\nThe opening possession coming out of halftime resulted in a 3-pointer from the team\u2019s leading scorer, DJ Horne, a much-needed confidence boost after only having scored four points in the first half.\n\nFor the next thirteen minutes of game time, the Wolfpack and Hokies traded baskets, including two more Horne 3-pointers. Then, with 7 minutes remaining, Virginia Tech\u2019s leading scorer, Sean Pedulla, made a 3-pointer of his own to take the lead, 56-54.\n\nFrom then on, the Hokies only extended their lead, including a 11-3 scoring run over the course of two minutes and 38 seconds of game time. The game ended as a loss for the Wolfpack, 84-78.\n\nAfter the game, head coach Kevin Keatts said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t defend... we didn\u2019t lock in... we relaxed a little bit.\u201d\n\nWednesday night, the Wolfpack would have to do the opposite of \u201crelax\u201d to beat the Virginia Cavaliers, arguably a top-10 team on the defensive side of the ball.\n\nUnfortunately for them, their sluggishness from the second half of Saturday\u2019s game bled into the beginning of their matchup against Virginia. NC State was outscored 27-15 in a very low-scoring first half.\n\nThe tides turned coming out of the break, and the Wolfpack clawed their way back into the game. With 3:28 left, sixth man Michael O\u2019Connell made a layup to take the lead, 43-42.\n\nO\u2019Connell would come up big again with a putback layup to tie the game with just 8 seconds remaining, forcing overtime. However, he did not record a single statistic in the five-minute overtime period, and the Wolfpack lost the game, 59-53.\n\nAfter that second straight loss, Coach Keatts said, \u201cWe\u2019ll get back, we\u2019ll shake it off, and we\u2019ll prepare for our next game.\u201d\n\nThe Wolfpack still have a lot to play for: ACC standings, rivalry games, and school spirit. However, unless their team\u2019s performances drastically change, shaking off this week\u2019s two disappointing losses will not erase the fact that NC State\u2019s tournament odds are near zero.\n```"}

They were handed pieces of paper with the names of candidates campaigning across Iowa: Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy and Donald Trump. Though Trump was the caucus victor on Jan. 15, speaking with voters before the race was called gave insight into varying Iowan views on candidates.\n\n\u201cI voted for DeSantis. He\u2019s someone fresh and still wants similar things to Trump, but DeSantis I\u2019m sure can deliver,\u201d said Brad Bragga, a 72, retired automobile dealer from Marshalltown. \u201cPlus he doesn\u2019t have criminal cases, which is just too much drama for a president.\u201d Adding that he and his wife Kathy, a retired nurse, are tired of broken promises they cited DeSantis\u2019 work in Florida as evidence of his merit.\n\nBragga\u2019s close friend Ronald Crow, 72, a farmer in Marshalltown, defended Trump, whom he voted for. \u201cThey are just going after him. [Trump] is who we need, he did great work and helped the economy when in office,\u201d Crow said. \u201cSo we just need him back in there to shake things up again.\u201d\n\nThough Bragga and Crow didn\u2019t agree on their choice of candidate, the two said they wouldn\u2019t let politics separate them. Other voters included Ryan Carroll, 30, a teacher in Marshalltown, who spoke in support of Ramaswamy at the caucus. Caroll said he is looking for someone younger to lead the country and someone who understands the younger generations\u2019 struggles and problems.\n\nEvery voter had their preferred candidate, but all believed that no matter what, they did not want another term for the Biden administration. Duane Garrett, 61, works in maintenance. He backed Trump in the 2020 general election and on Jan. 15. Garrett said he believes Trump is what the country needs.\n\nJennifer Bryant, 49, a registered nurse, voted for Trump in the last general election, but is hesitant to vote for him in this year's Caucus. She was torn between Trump and Haley, citing Trump's current legal charges as a deterrent.\n\nHeather Hammer (left), 30, is a senior account manager at Verizon, and Brady Hammer (right), 29, is a field service tech. The couple voted for Ramaswamy. The two believe that someone closer to their age can truly understand their economic struggles and beliefs.\n\nA retired couple sits with their son and his spouse in the bleachers at an Iowa caucus meeting in Marshalltown.

(Photo by JINGE LI) \n\nBy Marco Haynes January 26, 2024 at 12:08 pm PST\n\nOn Thursday night, No. 11 USC men\u2019s volleyball tried to get back to its winning ways against Central State after defeats to CSUN and Ohio State. This was the second match in a back-to-back homestand for the Trojans, who looked to extend their home record to 5-1. Against the Marauders, the Trojans triumphed early, winning the first set 25-13 and the second set 25-12. The Trojans prevailed late, finishing the final set 25-16 and improving their record to 6-2 for the season. This was the Trojans\u2019 first-ever meeting against the Marauders.\n\nRedshirt junior opposite hitter Jack Deuchar led the team with 10 kills, three service aces and three digs, while sophomore outside hitter Dillon Klein collected nine kills and three digs. Freshman setter Caleb Blanchette added 33 assists, three digs and two blocks. Freshman middle blocker Wesley Smith hit 1.000, collecting nine kills and one service ace.\n\n\u201cI expect all of us to be getting a lot of kills,\u201d Deuchar said. \u201cWhen we pass, we\u2019re a really hard team to defend. I think that you can see high-kill nights from everybody on the roster, but it all starts with the passing, which we did a good job of tonight.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the two recent defeats and getting the victory tonight, Trojans head coach Jeff Nygaard felt this was all a learning experience. Towards the end of the final set, the team saw heavy rotation, giving minutes to all players.\n\n\u201cWe got a long season ahead of us. So there\u2019s a couple bumps,\u201d Nygaard said. \u201cBut the question is not do we get overly frustrated and shut down. ... Everything is used towards the next one. We\u2019re on to the next one.\u201d\n\nFor the seventh time this season, USC recorded a higher hitting percentage and collected more blocks than its opponent, while also hitting over .300. The Trojans out-shined the Marauders .493 to .104 in hitting percentage and won the digs battle 22-17. Central State headed into the game losing seven straight games in a row to start its season.\n\nNygaard spoke about the focus and setting the standards for his team against any opponent to perform and be consistent for the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cThat includes us going in for preparation before the game so that we\u2019re locked in when we\u2019re locked in. We can be a great team, so just flexing that mental muscle,\u201d Nygaard said.\n\nUSC is back in action again at UC San Diego (2-5) on Wednesday and returns to the Galen Center against the Tritons on February 2 at 7 p.m.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/01/25/clippers-leonard-and-co-seek-fourth-straight-win-vs-raptors/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES - In mid-November, the Clippers had just lost their sixth consecutive game and looked like a team that hadn\u2019t changed over the offseason. They couldn\u2019t find ways to win close games and the chemistry between Paul George and Kawhi Leonard simply wasn\u2019t there. Since then, LA is 25-7 and seems to have gotten those issues sorted out. The Clippers are set to take on the Toronto Raptors Friday afternoon in Canada after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers Tuesday night. Despite a rematch against the Boston Celtics looming on Saturday, the Clippers cannot overlook their game against the Raptors.\n\nThe Clippers\u2019 127-116 win on Tuesday was not as dominant as Clippers fans had hoped it would be given LeBron James\u2019 absence, but picking up their first win out of three matchups against their hometown rival was certainly notable. Star forward Kawhi Leonard recorded a triple-double \u2014 only the second of his illustrious career \u2014 with 25 points, while guards Russell Westbrook and Norman Powell contributed 16 and 17 points off the bench, respectively.\n\nThe biggest issue currently facing the Clippers is finding a suitable replacement for injured center Ivica Zubac, who was diagnosed with a calf strain on Jan. 16. Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue has effectively split Zubac\u2019s minutes between centers Mason Plumlee and Daniel Theis, who have posted solid offensive performances but have struggled defensively and on the boards. On Tuesday, the Lakers outrebounded the Clippers 41-36 and 13 of the Lakers\u2019 rebounds came on offense. This is something that Lue will need to manage until Zubac returns.\n\nDespite the Raptors\u2019 measly 16-28 record that puts them in last place in the Atlantic Division, they can still beat any team on a good night. With players like RJ Barrett and forward Scottie Barnes both averaging over 20 points per game, the Raptors have been able to beat multiple over-.500 teams since they traded for Barrett, including the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Miami Heat. However, those two games were won with power forward Pascal Siakam hovering the lane, whose presence they now miss. The Raptors recently traded Siakam to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Bruce Brown, Kira Lewis, Jordan Nwora and three future first-round picks.\n\nThis is a positive for the Clippers since Zubac, who leads the team in rebounds and is a significant piece in the team\u2019s defense, is out for at least the next three weeks until his injury is re-evaluated. Now that Siakam is no longer on the Raptors\u2019 roster, the Clippers should face less trouble in the paint despite Zubac\u2019s absence. Regardless of which matchups take place in the paint, the Clippers\u2019 perimeter talent should be enough to handle the Raptors. Leonard remains healthy and leads the team in scoring with 23.7 points per game. In his second year as a Clipper, Westbrook seems to have found his role coming off the bench and is still receiving significant minutes.\n\nSince James Harden\u2019s first game as a Clipper on Nov. 6, the team is 25-11 with impressive wins against the Oklahoma City Thunder, New Orleans Pelicans and the Phoenix Suns. The key to this team\u2019s ultimate success will be managing injuries as they get into the second half of the season, especially with regard to their core three players: Harden, Leonard and Paul George. George, who recorded 17 points against the Lakers while shooting 8-12 from the field on Tuesday, played through a groin injury late in the game, according to Janis Carr of the Orange County Register.\n\nOn the positive side of things, the Clippers will have had two days of rest before Friday\u2019s game, allowing the team time to thoroughly evaluate George\u2019s injury. This seven-game road trip will be a huge test for the Clippers, as they have struggled on the road so far this season, winning only nine out of their 19 away games. If the Clippers want to earn the No. 2 seed in the west and have home-court advantage for the first two rounds of the playoffs, a win on Friday would be a significant step toward that goal.\n```"}

However, when the Crimson Tide scored National Championship runner-up head coach Kalen DeBoer just two days later, Williams had a change of heart. On Jan. 24, Williams recommitted to Alabama.\n\nWilliams reportedly visited Texas A&M before returning to Tuscaloosa, where DeBoer recruited him back to the program. Considering the Tide lost 2023 receptions leader Isaiah Bond to Texas, Williams will be a huge addition to the team. Bond wasn\u2019t the only player to enter the transfer portal, though. Alabama additionally lost 2024 five-star quarterback Julian Sayin, SEC Newcomer of the Year safety Caleb Downs, cornerback Dezz Ricks and more.\n\nCrimson Tide junior defensive back DeVonta Smith was critical of players who instantly left following Saban\u2019s retirement. \u201cAny of these cats that are thinking about leaving need to meet with [DeBoer] immediately, and if they still want to leave then they are idiots, and we don\u2019t need them,\u201d Smith said, according to Bama Recruiting 247.\n\nWhile the Williams commitment news represents a massive win for DeBoer, the former Huskies coach also brought along some recruits from his old stomping ground. Former four-star recruit and now-former Washington quarterback Austin Mack followed his former coach to the South, among other former Huskies.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a near-impossible task to fill Saban\u2019s shoes, acquiring Williams is his first major win as head coach of the Crimson Tide, especially in college football\u2019s NIL and open-portal era.

After attending the Trump rally on her campus, Perkins remained committed to picking the former president for her first-ever caucus, but raised concern about turnout due to the freezing temperatures. \u201cThis weather is definitely going to stop a lot of people,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, I think that those who want to vote will get out, and those who are on the fence won\u2019t go because of the cold.\u201d In the end, 110,000 Iowans showed up to caucus meetings across the state, down from higher levels of participation in 2016 and 2012, according to  CBS News . Nonetheless, this was still a strong showing given Trump was the frontrunner. For caucusgoers like Perkins, this was a significant and exciting event as Iowans have America\u2019s first chance to weigh in on their Republican presidential preference. While the GOP candidates have spent many months campaigning throughout the 99 counties of Iowa, the winter storm conditions forced Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, among others, to alter their schedules. Most campaign events were canceled Saturday as blizzard conditions blanketed the Hawkeye State. Thus, Sunday was the candidates\u2019 last chance to mobilize their supporters and reach Iowans prior to the critical caucus. Jacqueline Riekena, 58, who moved to West Des Moines 15 years ago from Seattle, voted for Trump in the last two caucuses, but committed to Ramaswamy on Monday. Will the inclement weather deter her from voting? \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d She said she believes the record-setting amount of snowfall that Iowa received over the previous week \u201cwill have a huge toll on the caucusing.\u201d Riekena, who was seated a few feet away from Ramaswamy at his campaign event at Grimaldi\u2019s Pizza on Sunday in Ankeny, explained that despite how others may react to the weather, no amount of snow or harsh weather conditions would stop her from exercising her right to vote. \u201cIt was 20 degrees when I left my house this morning and the snow was up to my porch, but I only live 2 miles away from the nearest caucus location,\u201d she said. According to the National Weather Service, the wind chill pushed the temperature as low as -45 degrees Fahrenheit Monday evening just as Iowans began to line up at their local caucus locations. If the caucusgoers were outside for extended periods of time, the dangerous weather could put them at risk of frostbite. This record-breaking forecast had the ability to keep Iowans, who are accustomed to the cold, at home. Caucus attendees were advised to put on extra layers of clothing to combat the extreme conditions. In Adel at a rally on the eve of the caucus, Haley, the former South Carolina governor, addressed the need of Iowans to trudge on through caucus night. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be out there in the snow like we\u2019ve been all day today and up until the very last second,\u201d she said. Haley expressed confidence that Iowans would turn out for her. \u201cMy Southern skin has struggled, but y\u2019all are taking it to a new level,\u201d she said. Jane Sturtz, who traveled from Ankeny to attend the Haley rally with her husband, acknowledged the harsh weather conditions that all Iowans were experiencing. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we had this much snow in such a short amount of time,\u201d she said. Sturtz remained steadfast that she would show up for Haley no matter the circumstances and said she believed that others who were truly committed to their favorite candidates would make the trek as well. \u201cIowans are pretty tough,\u201d she said. \u201cWe go to school, we go to work, and we are going to push through it.\u201d \n```"}

The annual Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count, organized by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA), started Tuesday at 8 p.m. and will run through the end of tonight. This year marks the third time LAHSA volunteers will use a mobile app for volunteers to enter their tallies in their assigned areas. Volunteers are looking for people who might be living in vehicles, tents, or other makeshift dwellings.\n\n\u201c[The count] is strictly a visual account,\u201d said Chris Yee, a LAHSA spokesperson. \u201cThey are looking for people who look like they are exhibiting signs of homelessness.\u201d While the system is subject to human error, it provides an estimate of the city\u2019s unhoused population. In South Los Angeles alone, there were 12,995 unhoused people counted in 2022 \u2014 roughly 30% of the city\u2019s total unhoused population for the year \u2014 according to LAHSA.\n\nPart of LAHSA\u2019s goal is to find specific trends in homelessness, like the large percentage of unhoused people in South L.A., in order to better coordinate services that help address homelessness. \u201cBy having an overall large citywide number, that is what essentially allows the city of Los Angeles and the county of Los Angeles to receive appropriate funding from the federal government so that the whole issue can be addressed,\u201d said Jon Regardie, a journalist covering Los Angeles government, city hall, and homelessness. \u201cPeople within the county service providers can adopt an overall strategy to help.\u201d\n\nSolving the city\u2019s homelessness crisis requires more than just recognizing that there is a problem, it also includes addressing the circumstances that lead to people becoming unhoused in the first place. \u201cInflow, drivers to homelessness, skyrocketing rents, stagnant wages, that stuff hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Yee said. \u201cInside Safe and Pathway Home for the County, programs like that, don\u2019t change those factors.\u201d Yee acknowledges that the count is beneficial, but asserts that the right course of action to address homelessness isn\u2019t being taken. \u201cThey don\u2019t bring rents down, they don\u2019t make companies pay people more,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo those drivers of homelessness still exist and could very well be, as we\u2019re getting people housed, more people are falling in.\u201d\n\nAs of Monday, LAHSA had received 4,800 volunteer sign-ups; roughly half of the 8,000 volunteers LAHSA said were needed to conduct the count. \u201cThe more people who participate and who volunteer, the more accurate the count can be,\u201d Regardie said.\n```"}

They can come out of isolation if they are fever-free for 24 hours without medication and are either free from other symptoms or have mild and improving symptoms. Previous guidance required anyone who tested positive to isolate for at least five days, regardless of whether symptoms were improving.\n\nThe school district also recommends those who test positive wear a \u201cwell-fitting, high-quality mask in all settings when around others,\u201d for at least 10 days after the positive test. People can safely stop wearing masks in various social settings once they have received two negative COVID tests at least one day apart, according to the new guidelines.\n\nLAUSD\u2019s new guidance came less than two weeks after USC updated its rules to better align with the California Department of Public Health. However, the university does require students, faculty and staff to complete a contact tracing form, available in the MySHR portal, if they were on campus in the 48 hours prior to onset of symptoms or the date of positive test.\n\nBoth LAUSD and USC have said they would continue to align with public health recommendations while working to keep students, staff, and faculty safe and reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n```"}

Several feet away, their classmates stacked rocks on their arms. Others piled themselves in blankets and moved slowly beneath while some took a blue pencil and traced Earth\u2019s timeline across a blank white wall. That\u2019s Touch Library, an installation in \u201cBlood Baby.\u201d\n\nEach of these interactive displays were stationed around the mezzanine of the ONE Archives at USC Thursday. The library is one of the largest queer archives in the world, according to curator Alexis Bard Johnson. For the next week, the space will house the brainchildren of choreographers, visual artists, playwrights and librarians in a Visions & Voices exhibition celebrating the queer family experience.\n\nThe exhibition is split into four installations: Carpet Womb, Communion, Primordial and Touch Library. The first two are performances exploring queer sexuality and family as they relate to space and ecology. Or, as the program reads, \u201ca sweaty gay disco ritual.\u201d Primordial is an audiovisual installation featuring videos of project director Meg Foley, hidden beneath blankets, expanding and moving against a lakefront backdrop. Touch Library means to engage attendees in thought about their geological, physical and mental relationship with art.\n\nThe series includes \u201cContinental Collisions,\u201d blocks of foam that participants hold and fall on. There\u2019s \u201cPangea and the Next Continental Formation,\u201d a table where participants listen to a script about the poetic nature of blood and rock formation, and the similarities to pregnancy. That\u2019s followed by \u201cPlate Tectonics,\u201d a piece of velvet wrapped to a pole where the goal is to hug it. If it sounds complicated, that\u2019s because it\u2019s meant to be.\n\n\u201cEach set is really designed for a particular physical activation of the audience,\u201d Foley said. \u201cIt\u2019s designed this way because of the intricacy and complicated nature of family and gender identity and queer sexuality, and trying to pull those apart.\u201d\n\nBlood Baby is inspired by Foley\u2019s experience co-parenting her child and navigating the experience as a queer family. Before coming to Los Angeles, the exhibition premiered in its entirety in Seattle last September. But Foley said the space at ONE Archives has shaped the exhibition more than any other location.\n\nJohnson said the nature of the project made it a good fit for the archive. \u201cIt has four to five different components. There\u2019s not a lot of spaces that are actually able to host all of them, and I felt it was really important to try to,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cA space like ONE could do that.\u201d\n\nFoley never imagined holding Blood Baby in a library. But one of her collaborators, Sylvan Oswald, suggested that the project doubles as an archive of her family history in the same way a library archives stories. Now, they can take advantage of the diverse space to host both outdoor performance events and intimate conversations in bookstacks.\n\n\u201cBeing with the books, it feels like being a living room\u2014but also like a library, surrounded by stories,\u201d Foley said.\n\nAttendees at the exhibit explored the many interactive elements it had to offer. (Photo by Sophie Sullivan)\n\nThe collaboration between Foley and ONE Archives began more than two decades ago with a friendship between Foley and Alison d\u2019Amato, an associate professor of practice at Kaufman. Together with curator Alexis Johnson, d\u2019Amato drafted the proposal to Visions & Voices so the university could fund and house Blood Baby.\n\nToday, d\u2019Amato took students in her graduate-level Visual and Performance Theory class, CRIT-560, to the product of her proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to hear that the conversations that we\u2019ve been having for 20 years now are still going, but in another way,\u201d d\u2019Amato said.\n\nThe class explores how performance invites participation in art. The professor made an agreement with her class before they explored the installation and its meanings: \u201cIt\u2019s OK not to know.\u201d\n\nThat summarizes much of the experience of senior theater major Jamie Gallo. \u201cI don\u2019t think I understand it yet, but I think that\u2019s OK,\u201d Gallo said of Primordial. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about Touch Library, and interactive pieces\u2014inviting the audience to be participants in the art.\u201d\n\nGallo\u2019s classmate Venus Green, also felt that the interactive parts were the most impactful parts of the exhibition. \u201cYou arrive to the space and have one particular experience because of your own interests and where you come from,\u201d said Green, a first-year American Studies PhD student. \u201dBut when you\u2019re given a set of instructions or things to pay attention to, it facilitates your experience in a very particular way. It slowed me down.\u201d\n\nBlood Baby is on display daily at ONE Archives until Thursday, Jan. 31.

The Lakers lost 127-116 to the Los Angeles Clippers at their shared home court of Crypto.com Arena. D\u2019Angelo Russell led the Lakers with 27 points, closely followed by center Anthony Davis with 26 points. Without LeBron James\u2014who was out with an ankle injury\u2014the Lakers didn\u2019t have enough shots fall and failed to put together enough defensive stops to halt the Clippers\u2019 offense. The loss brings the Lakers below .500 with a 22-23 record. The team remains in the No. 9 spot in the Western Conference standings, but now has the same record as the No. 10 Utah Jazz.\n\nThe Clippers shot 59.1% from the field compared to the Lakers\u2019s 48.9% on the night, but the greatest difference lay in their shooting from behind the arc. The Clippers shot a stellar 51.9% from three compared to the Lakers\u2019s 34.4%. With trade rumors still swirling around Russell, Lakers fans might wonder if his hot streak is him making a case to stay in the purple in gold. Along with his 27 points, Russell added to his case by leading all Lakers with 10 assists and recording a chase-down block against Clippers guard James Harden in the fourth quarter.\n\nRussell\u2019s playmaking for Davis helped the Lakers stay close to the Clippers for most of the first half. However, an impressive 18 for 24 shooting run by the Clippers late in the second quarter gave the Clippers a 74-66 lead over the Lakers at halftime. Active defense was a key part of the Lakers\u2019 second half strategy. The Lakers outrebounded the Clippers 41-36 across the entire game, giving the Lakers 18 second chance points compared to just three for the Clippers. The Lakers also had nine steals compared to the Clippers\u2019 eight and nine blocks against five blocks for the Clippers.\n\n\u201cWe had a couple [defensive] breakdowns, but for the most part they made some tough, tough shots... our guys competed,\u201d head coach Darvin Ham said to the media post-game. \u201cThey competed their butts off, but again with every mistake, if you close out the wrong way or if you\u2019re not doubling in a timely fashion, [the Clippers are] going to make you pay.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers made the Lakers pay indeed. Forward Kawhi Leonard led the Clippers with 25 points on 11/16 shooting and Harden finished with 23 points and 50% from behind the arc. Despite the Clippers\u2019 impressive shooting night, the Lakers eventually shrunk the Clippers\u2019 lead to within two points at the top of the fourth quarter. But from there, the Lakers\u2019 shots would not fall. They shot 35% from the field in the fourth compared to the Clippers 44%.\n\n\u201cMyself, I got a lot of good looks tonight, just didn\u2019t capitalize on them,\u201d Lakers guard Austin Reaves said to the media after the game. \u201cIf I, we, make open shots the outcome could be different.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers will have one day of rest and one more game against the Chicago Bulls before they embark on their six-game road trip that features the powerhouse Boston Celtics. James\u2019 status for the next home game and that road trip are still in limbo, as he is listed as questionable for the Lakers\u2019 game against the Bulls. Davis has also been newly added to the injury report, listed as questionable for Thursday\u2019s game.

LA welcomed back legendary, two-time Stanley Cup winner Jonathan Quick to Crypto.com Arena for the first time since trading him last season. The 38-year-old goaltender spent 16 years donning the crown and holds the franchise records for wins, save percentage, shutouts and games played between the pipes.\n\nQuick might\u2019ve played well in his return to Los Angeles, stopping 24 of the 26 Kings\u2019 shots, but LA still bested the Rangers. Winger Kevin Fiala opened up scoring for Los Angeles, capitalizing on a pass from Trevor Moore to the low slot in the first period\u2019s closing moments. Left wing Chris Kreider tapped in the equalizer for New York in the second period before center Quinton Byfield wristed in the game-winner toward the period\u2019s end. The Kings held on for a much needed victory over the Metropolitan\u2019s top team.\n\nBut two nights later, in David Rittich\u2019s third straight game in net for the Kings, Los Angeles lost to the NHL-worst San Jose Sharks in a shootout. A pair of San Jose goals in the second left LA down two midway through the period, but Moore cut the deficit to one heading into intermission. Byfield tied the game early in the third period before San Jose regained the lead minutes later. After Sharks goaltender Kaapo K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen was penalized for delay of game with two and a half minutes remaining in regulation, the Kings tied the game on the power play thanks to a heroic Drew Doughty one-timer from the high slot that made it past K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen\u2019s glove side. After a scoreless overtime period, the Kings ran out of gas in the shootout and the Sharks hit all of their shots.\n\nWhile Los Angeles still gained a point by playing in extra time, losing to No. 1 pick-hopeful San Jose was a gut punch. Against the Sabres, the Kings put All-Star Cam Talbot back in net, but couldn\u2019t carry their first period success over the game\u2019s duration. Los Angeles allowed four unanswered goals despite leading 3-1 at the first intermission. On the bright side, Pierre-Luc Dubois, who has struggled so far this season, was able to score, but the Kings just had no response to Buffalo\u2019s resurgence. Byfield also posted an assist, extending the fourth-year player\u2019s point streak to three games.\n\nLos Angeles still remains at fourth place in the Pacific, but the Seattle Kraken and Calgary Flames don\u2019t lag far behind. The Oilers, who trailed the Kings for most of the season, are creating separation in the standings thanks to their incredible 14-game winning streak. The Kings hold the first Wild Card place, but barely; if LA can\u2019t get back to its consistent winning ways, expect the surging St. Louis Blues, the scrappy Arizona Coyotes or the star-studded Nashville Predators to overtake their position.\n\nThe Kings have a crucial slate of games for the next week. After playing the high-scoring Avalanche, Los Angeles will face both St. Louis and Nashville, two teams hungry to return to the playoffs after having down years in 2022-23. This upcoming stretch serves as an opportunity for the Kings to make up ground in the playoff race if they can win, but if not, they could lose their top Wild Card spot.\n\nHead coach Todd McLellan\u2019s team has hit a wall. While the Kings don\u2019t need to press the panic button yet, recent woes have left fans wondering about the direction the team must take to win consistently. The fact of the matter is, LA\u2019s offense is not meeting the production it previously had earlier this season. Also, certain roster decisions, like the Dubois trade, look worse every game. It\u2019s going to be an uphill battle for the Kings the rest of the way if the front office doesn\u2019t make changes before the March 8 trade deadline.\n\nThe Kings will venture out to the Rocky Mountains to battle the Colorado Avalanche on Friday at 6 p.m.\n```"}

If there\u2019s one word to describe the Trojans\u2019 season thus far, it\u2019s unpredictable. With hopeful dreams of freshman guard Isaiah Collier and fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis creating an unstoppable backcourt duo, many expected USC to continue its 2020-23 streak of second-best overall record in the Pac-12. However, currently standing at an 8-11 record, the Trojans have suffered an extensive number of injuries this season, including the team\u2019s two leading scorers, Collier (hand) and Ellis (hamstring). Neither one has played since the 72-64 Washington State loss on January 10, and their absence on the court has not gone unnoticed.\n\n\u201cJust the scoring ability Boogie brings to the team, it\u2019s like no other,\u201d junior guard Kobe Johnson said. \u201cHe can score from anywhere when he\u2019s in the half-court. As soon as he crosses that half-court line, you gotta be guarding him. ... It\u2019s been amazing playing with him, and I can\u2019t wait to finish this season out with him when he gets back.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans are averaging 76 points per game this season, but in the past three road games since Washington State, they haven\u2019t scored more than 67. Ellis\u2019 ability to play in Saturday\u2019s game is still up in the air, but his 18 PPG could be the key factor in what leads the Trojans to overpower UCLA\u2019s offense and maintain a comfortable lead.\n\nWith the \u201cCrosstown Showdown\u201d just days away, the limited number of healthy players remaining on the roster are utilizing this off week to reset and gain momentum for Saturday. \u201cI think it\u2019s more important how we start off the second half. I think we need to come out and start the second half how we start our games,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe have to bring that energy. I think these past few games, when we built the lead, we kind of let off the gas. That\u2019s something we need to dial in on.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been no easy feat adapting to the dynamic on the court as more and more players were injured throughout the pre- and regular seasons, including freshman guard Bronny James (cardiac arrest), Johnson, Collier, Ellis and senior forward Joshua Morgan (illness) throughout the season. But in times when USC cannot rely on the continuity of a starting lineup, it\u2019s crucial to cultivate a sense of routine while maintaining energy on the court. This has been especially tough during practices at times when USC hasn\u2019t had enough players to practice five-on-five.\n\n\u201cIf we just focus on the little details within practice, by going hard every single drill and every single thing we do in practice, I think everything will fall into place,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nDespite the challenges of having part of the starting five recovering on the sidelines, it\u2019s an opportunity for the young players to step up and produce efficient plays. \u201cIt\u2019s important for other players to come in and get the repetitions,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of our guys; we\u2019ve improved defensively over the past couple of weeks without having (Collier, Ellis and Morgan).\u201d\n\nThe best offense is a good defense, and Enfield continues to emphasize the importance of building up a defense day by day, praising the strength of USC\u2019s man-to-man D. However, the Trojans must watch out for their biggest rival, and it\u2019s not the Bruins. Turnovers (USC averaged 18 per game during its three-game road trip last week versus Colorado, No. 9 Arizona and Arizona State) are the area of priority for Saturday\u2019s game. The Trojans\u2019 82-67 loss to Arizona State Saturday included 22 turnovers and a resulting 24 points for the Sun Devils.\n\n\u201cWe have to limit our live-ball turnovers,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe need a mix of our man and zone [defenses], and we have to rebound the ball.\u201d\n\nWhile Morgan has used this week to regain his strength, Collier is out until mid- to late February and Ellis\u2019 ability to play remains a game-time decision. Despite this added pressure on top of defeating its fellow City of Angels rival, the Trojans are focusing on the importance of this rivalry game and what it means to them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to beat them for as long as I\u2019ve been in college, and now that I\u2019m at their rival school, it\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d transfer forward DJ Rodman said.\n\nUSC most recently faced the Bruins on January 26, 2023, when the Trojans claimed a 77-64 win at Galen Center, led by Ellis. Scoring his then-career record of 31 points, Ellis matched UCLA\u2019s second-half points with 27 of his own. Hopefully, the Trojans can embody the same spirit of last year\u2019s game to clinch a Bruin takedown, evade a potential five-game losing streak and begin this season\u2019s comeback era.\n\n\u201cThe rivalry between USC and UCLA, for all sports, is great for the city. It\u2019s fun for the whole community, and we enjoy the rivalry. Coach Cronin and his staff do a great job; they always have outstanding players on the team,\u201d Enfield said.\n```"}

But his inventive, provocative feature film could not have happened without Leonard Maltin\u2019s Theatrical Film Symposium class.\n\nBegert, who directed and co-wrote the film \u201cLittle Death\u201d with Dani Goffstein (\u201915), lit up when he spoke about USC. They made the film with fellow School of Cinematic Arts alumni Tyler Sobel-Mason (\u201915), Noor Alfallah (\u201916) and Sam Canter (\u201914), with Sobel-Mason serving as the executive producer and Alfallah and Canter as producers.\n\nOnce the friendship among these Trojans started, their professional collaboration also blossomed. \u201cI saw all these boys in the class and they would all get good grades...and I\u2019m like, \u2018How do these boys get good grades, but they\u2019re always joking around and not taking it serious?\u201d\u2019 Alfallah said of Maltin\u2019s class, which she took with her sister. \u201cI told my sister, \u2018Talk to that boy,\u2019 and it was Jack. We became really good friends, all of us.\u201d\n\nAlfallah said the \u201cboys\u201d then created Psycho Films, a production company headed by Begert and Canter. Then the group created a short film called \u201cLa Petite Mort\u201d on a $40,000 budget that was the basis for their feature. Once Begert\u2019s star began to rise with the success of his music videos, he was signed by United Talent Agency, opening the doors to get the project off the ground.\n\nFrom there, Darren Aronofsky signed onto the project as a producer under his company Protozoa Pictures, and they got to work. \u201cWe had a lot riding on this,\u201d Alfallah said. \u201cWe had to shoot it in 20 days. We were trying to scrap together on a small budget. But we did it, and we\u2019re excited.\u201d\n\n(L-R) \"Little Death\" director Jack Begert poses with actors Talia Ryder and Dominic Fike, and producer Darren Aronofsky on Friday at the Sundance Film Festival. (Photo of the Sundance Institute)\n\nBegert and Alfallah both said their time at USC prepared them well for the obstacles they tackled while making the film, and agreed that the Trojan network was what they valued most as alumni. \u201cThe main thing that I got out of being at USC was I met so many talented people,\u201d Begert said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the promise of that program: that it attracts a lot of people that are super passionate and hardworking and have all types of different disparate and diverse talent.\u201d\n\nEven those involved in the project who didn\u2019t attend USC recognized the program\u2019s prestige. \u201cI love USC, I think there\u2019s a lot of talent,\u201d said producer Andy Cohen, who did not attend USC, but who rattled off the list of alumni involved in the project. \u201cYou created a class of geniuses. Whatever the prescription is in that school, keep doing it.\u201d\n\nBegert and Alfallah were also both eager to offer advice to current USC film students. For the director and producer, it all comes down to making connections with fellow students, just as they did about ten years ago. \u201cReally enjoy class,\u201d Alfallah said. \u201cDon\u2019t rush out. Don\u2019t be the one that signs in just to get the attendance. Really pay attention and make friends with the people in your class. Without my friends in school, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be here today. Really try to value your friendships and keep your word.\u201d\n\nBegert echoed a similar sentiment, eager to emphasize the collaborative nature of filmmaking. \u201cWhatever it is you\u2019re drawn to, just try to complement yourself with other people who are more talented than you in those other ways,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s the cheat code.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cLittle Death\u201d team were just some of the over 50 alumni whose work was selected to be a part of the Sundance Film Festival, which kicked off on Jan. 18 and concludes on Sunday.\n```"}

While the draft lottery system doesn\u2019t guarantee that the worst team will necessarily receive the first pick, four teams were in the running: the Chicago Blackhawks, Anaheim Ducks, Columbus Blue Jackets and San Jose Sharks. While the Blackhawks won the Bedard sweepstakes, and the other three teams picked up top talent themselves, all are hungry for more.\n\nThis season, the same four teams are the worst in the NHL. This year\u2019s prize is expected to be 17-year-old Boston University freshman center Macklin Celebrini, who has been extremely impressive in NCAA and World Junior Championship play.\n\nChicago has been a work-in-progress during Bedard\u2019s rookie season. While Bedard has led the Blackhawks in scoring and is living up to his sky-high expectations, his team hasn\u2019t been there to support him. With the All-Star forward breaking his jaw and being sidelined for at least six more weeks, Chicago will benefit in the race for Celebrini and won\u2019t have trouble losing games.\n\nIf the Blackhawks can draft Celebrini, they\u2019ll be adding him to their plethora of young talent, including Frank Nazar, Sam Rinzel, Adam Gajan and more. The tandem of Bedard and Celebrini could be generational for years to come and would truly exemplify taking a team from nothing to a contender.\n\nThe Ducks are in a strange position \u2014 they have loads of talent but can\u2019t quite get it together. The conjunction of young phenoms with skilled veterans has been exciting, but it isn\u2019t good enough to win yet. Twenty-year-old center Mason McTavish has been stout with 29 points, and 2023 first-round selection Leo Carlsson looks promising thus far.\n\nAdding Celebrini along with a healthy Trevor Zegras could make for an extremely bright future in Anaheim.\n\nThe Blue Jackets began moving in the right direction after selecting center Adam Fantilli No. 3 overall last year. Fantilli will continue to grow under the mentorship of veterans like Johnny Gaudreau, but picking a player like Celebrini would ease the pressure for Fantilli to be Columbus\u2019 primary goal scorer for years to come.\n\nThe Blue Jackets have had an unfortunate franchise history, so landing a player like Celebrini would be monumental in building a contender.\n\nThe Sharks chose Boston College freshman center Will Smith in last year\u2019s draft; he is yet to debut in the NHL. San Jose has young potential in the form of William Eklund and Fabian Zetterlund, but the team\u2019s little victories have been overshadowed by two separate double-digit losing streaks and the worst record in the league.\n\nAcquiring Celebrini would not only be beneficial for San Jose\u2019s future, but would also help the Sharks\u2019 front office finally have a true star to be more competitive with in the present.\n\nWhile almost half of the season remains, be on the lookout for the race for the No. 1 pick as a variety of teams would love to have their hands on a highly touted prospect like Celebrini.\n\nSalt Lake City hockey?\n\nThe Smith Entertainment Group, the owners of the NBA\u2019s Utah Jazz, reportedly plan to bring the NHL to Salt Lake City whether it be in the form of an expansion team or relocating an existing franchise. The ownership group has been in talks with the NHL since 2022 and is determined to bring a team to the market.\n\nThe Arizona Coyotes would be the most likely to relocate if the group chooses to inherit an existing franchise, but roadblocks still stand in the way. The Coyotes have been passionate about staying in Arizona despite a failed arena vote last year and an unclear future in the region.\n\nThe franchise currently plays at Arizona State\u2019s 4,600-seat Mullett Arena, but time is ticking for the Coyotes to get a plan together.\n\nThe NHL most recently expanded in 2021, adding the Seattle Kraken to be even at 32 teams. While the price for an expansion team would be costly, Salt Lake City also hopes to bring the 2034 Olympics to the city, so a brand-new, state-of-the-art arena could be beneficial in more ways than one.\n\nUtah is currently home to the ECHL\u2019s Utah Grizzlies, but moving to the big leagues seems to be the goal in the Beehive State.\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

Harbaugh will be the coach of the Los Angeles Chargers, leaving Michigan after capping his ninth season as coach of college football\u2019s winningest program with the school\u2019s first national championship since 1997, two people familiar with the situation told The Associated Press. The people spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team hasn\u2019t made the announcement.\n\nBy Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as January 24, 2024 at 10:12 pm PST\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 In this offseason\u2019s wild NFL coaching carousel in the NFL, yet another domino has fallen. Former Michigan Wolverines head coach Jim Harbaugh has agreed to become the next head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers. After ten years with the maize and blue, Harbaugh has returned to the NFL landscape. Harbaugh hoisted the College Football Playoff National Championship Trophy center stage in Houston to end his time at the college level. The Wolverines went a perfect 15-0 in the 2023 season, defeating the Pac-12 champion Washington Huskies to capture the first national championship of Harbaugh\u2019s tenure and the program\u2019s first championship since 1997, which they shared with Nebraska.\n\nSince his 2014 arrival in Ann Arbor, the goal was to reach the CFP and beat the team down south The 2023 season came with many twists and turns for Michigan, which dealt with one of the more controversial scandals in recent memory. After a season-long investigation by the Big Ten into a sign-stealing scandal conducted by Michigan recruiting analyst Connor Stallions, the conference found that Michigan violated \u201cThe Big Ten Sportsmanship Policy for conducting an impermissible, in-person scouting operation over multiple years, resulting in an unfair competitive advantage that compromised the integrity of competition.\u201d As a result, the Big Ten suspended Harbaugh for the final three regular-season games. Harbaugh returned for the CFP games, leading the No. 1 Michigan Wolverines.\n\nTo end his time at Michigan, Harbaugh is a one-time national champion, three-time Big Ten Champion, one-time AP Coach of the Year and holds an overall record of 86-25. Harbaugh is not a new name to either the NFL or the Chargers organization. Before running the show from the sidelines, Harbaugh had a 13-year playing career as a starting quarterback in the NFL from 1987 to 2000. In his twilight years, Harbaugh played two seasons with the then-San Diego Chargers.\n\nFollowing the 2000 season, Harbaugh turned in his helmet for a headset, starting a new chapter. The Chargers fired former head coach Brandon Staley following their Week 15 blowout loss versus the Las Vegas Raiders, where the Raiders scored a franchise-record 63 points. In need of a new direction, they elevated outside linebacker Griff Smith as the interim coach for the season\u2019s final three weeks.\n\nIn recent seasons, the Chargers begin the year with a talented roster, yet they never live up to expectations by season\u2019s end. As such, Harbaugh will have some pieces to work with rather than building from the ground up. He already has his franchise quarterback in Justin Herbert, as well as a receiver room sprinkled with talent. And on the defensive side of the ball, it is a one-two punch at edge rusher with former Defensive Player of the Year Khalil Mack and four-time Pro Bowler Joey Bosa.\n\nHowever, for Harbaugh and the Chargers, it comes down to staying healthy and managing late-game situations. Every season, the Chargers seem to sustain early-season injuries to star players that haunt them the rest of the way. Seventh-year receiver Mike Williams tore his ACL three weeks into the 2023 season, landing him again on Injured Reserve and knocking him out for the rest of the campaign. Other names like Herbert, Bosa, running-back Austin Ekler, and receiver Keenan Allen all dealt with injuries throughout the season.\n\nFar too often, Chargers fans were used to seeing their former coach, Staley, choke in the final seconds of a game due to a lousy timeout or terrible play call. There is no better hire than Harbaugh for the Chargers to fix this problem. Harbaugh has coached some of the biggest games at the college and professional levels, reaching the Super Bowl as the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 head coach in 2012 and, most recently, the CFP National Championship with Michigan. He understands what it takes to secure a win in a tough atmosphere with 100,000 rowdy fans heckling at the top of their lungs.\n\nTo begin this chapter with the Chargers, Harbaugh will be responsible for finding the next batch of young stars in this year\u2019s NFL draft. With the 5th overall pick, the Chargers will have plenty of options to help rebuild the defense or provide more protection for Herbert.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/01/24/rookie-report-chet-holmgren/", "response": "```\nThe Talk of Troy Rookie report: Chet Holmgren\n\nAfter a year-long injury lay-off, the former Gonzaga Bulldog has taken the NBA by storm.\n\nChet Holmgren goes for a dunk during the second half of a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves Saturday, Jan. 20, 2024, in Minneapolis. (AP/Abbie Parr)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan January 24, 2024 at 7:56 pm PST\n\nChet and Wemby. Wemby and Chet. Two easy nicknames, two sides of the same basketball coin. The pair of big men will likely define the next decade and a half of NBA basketball with their ability to stretch the floor and dominate at the rim, particularly as shot-blockers. Down the line, Victor Wembanyama will almost certainly have a column of his own, but this is not it. While the 7-foot-5 Frenchman has lived up to expectations as a game-breaker, his team, the San Antonio Spurs, have been frustratingly uncompetitive. They sit at a 8-35 record (as of Tuesday, Jan. 23), the worst in the Western Conference. If the Pistons hadn\u2019t gone on a staggering 28-game losing streak, perhaps the Spurs\u2019 lousiness would\u2019ve been covered more closely. For that reason, Victor will have to wait.\n\nMeanwhile, Chet Holmgren has already established himself as a difference-making, modern big at the NBA level. We already knew that the Oklahoma City Thunder had a chance to be good. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had an MVP-esque season in 2022-23, averaging 31.4 points, 5.5 assists and 4.8 rebounds, leading a young team to 10th in the West. On top of that, they found breakout role players in Jalen Williams and Josh Giddey and played a fun brand of basketball. With his shooting ability (39.3% from deep so far in his NBA career), Williams has even looked like a future All-Star at times. Going into 2023-24, Holmgren was just the cherry on top. And while he may not yet be the main course (shoutout to Chef Jude), he\u2019s at least a hearty side salad.\n\nAs you may remember, the Thunder drafted Holmgren in the 2022 class after his phenomenal freshman season at Gonzaga where they reached the Sweet 16 at that year\u2019s March Madness. But before the NBA season even began, he suffered a Lisfranc injury on his right foot that ruled him out for the year. Holmgren would probably want his true rookie season back, but for NBA fans, him and Wembanyama entering the league at the exact same time has been a delight. Wembanyama currently ranks first in the league for blocks per game with 3.2, and Holmgren sits at fourth with 2.5. The Frenchman also edges out Holmgren in points per game, 20.3 to 17.3, but that\u2019s mostly a function of Wemby being the Spurs\u2019 first option when he\u2019s on the floor. The former Bulldog can also hang his hat on his efficiency, which his newfound rival has sorely lacked at times. While Wembanyama\u2019s three-point shot remains somewhat theoretical, Holmgren makes them at a 38.6% clip on 4.2 attempts per game.\n\nMost importantly, the Thunder are winning. At 30-13, they hold the tied-best record in the West, and only the Celtics have a better record across the entire league. Make no mistake, the Thunder are ready to contend this season. As such, don\u2019t be surprised if General Manager Sam Presti\u2014who\u2019s been stockpiling first-round picks like a nuclear armageddon is coming\u2014takes a trade deadline swing at a big target. But even if the Thunder keep the team as-is, Holmgren\u2019s immediate ascension to being one of the league\u2019s premier stretch-fives will make them a hassle for any team in the West.\n\nHolmgren\u2019s combination of shooting and solid ball-handling means that opposing teams need to respect his playmaking from anywhere on the court. This progression from his 33-point, three-block performance against the Philadelphia 76ers in November shows exactly that: Holmgren begins the play with the ball on the perimeter, forcing Joel Embiid to come check him, as the paint is otherwise vacant. Holmgren could\u2019ve easily pulled up from here, as Embiid isn\u2019t close enough to truly put his hand up to defend the shot, but with the 2022-23 MVP pulled out, Holmgren sees the opportunity to get downhill. He dumps the ball off to Giddey and sets an easy pick on Tobias Harris, providing Giddey some space to maneuver. Meanwhile, Embiid is standing on the free-throw line, leaving the rim still completely unguarded. Holmgren rolls out of the pick as soon as Giddey has a step on Harris and attacks the rim, guiding Giddey\u2019s lob in with one hand for an easy two points.\n\nLater in the same game, the Sixers put the smaller guard (and former Trojan!) De\u2019Anthony Melton on Holmgren for a play, just to try and frustrate the big man when he has the ball. Against a lot of centers, a small guard can usually irritate a big man around his chest and torso in an attempt to prevent them from causing damage around the perimeter. And while Melton could\u2019ve battled a bit more aggressively in this sequence, Holmgren never appears bothered by the matchup. He attacks Melton from the left, then the right, pushing Melton closer to the basket, before spinning out of Melton\u2019s reach and knocking down a push-floater with ease.\n\nHis strengths have shined, but that doesn\u2019t mean Holmgren is perfect yet. Just last week, he and the Thunder had a rough road trip to Los Angeles, losing against both the high-flying Clippers and the downtrodden Lakers. Holmgren scored just 17 points between the two games, while the Clippers\u2019 backup big men Mason Plumlee and Daniel Theis (Ivica Zubac was unable to play due to a calf injury) had a combined 23 points and 13 rebounds. The Thunder will need to fortify their frontcourt if they really want to capitalize on Holmgren\u2019s early excellence and another MVP-caliber year from SGA. Brooklyn\u2019s Nic Claxton or even Cleveland\u2019s Jarrett Allen might be available at the deadline depending on how close the Nets are to the Play-In or whether or not the Cavaliers think Evan Mobley and Allen will work together long-term. Presti has a cache of picks piled up, and now is the time to use them.\n\nWith his unique combination of individual and team excellence, the Rookie of the Year award should be Holmgren\u2019s to lose.\n```"}

Journalism students worry about a dying industry after layoffs at the LA Times and other major publishers.\n\nStudent journalists at work in Annenberg's Media Center. (Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Lindsey Miller and Makai Singleton January 24, 2024 at 5:56 pm PST\n\nThe journalism industry seems to be on the decline, and it is news to no one. This week the Los Angeles Times laid off 20 percent of its newsroom, and questions about the lifespan of longstanding publications like the Times and how the type and quality of their reporting will change are at the forefront of students\u2019 minds at Annenberg, USC\u2019s school of journalism.\n\nRecent mass layoffs at the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post and Sports Illustrated have rattled the struggling field, leaving USC students majoring in journalism facing an uncertain future and some tough decisions. Sports Illustrated, the pillar of sports journalism publications, announced plans to lay off the majority of its workforce earlier this week, an act widely regarded as the death of the publication according to Forbes. Pitchfork, the most popular music publication of the digital age, has been absorbed by GQ, a men's fashion magazine, with numerous staffers laid off according to The Guardian. CNN Business reported that Time Magazine also joined in the job slashing this week, laying off some 15 percent of its editorial staff.\n\nLayoffs are nothing new for twenty-first century journalists, but the number of publications cutting positions is startling and, as the New York Times describes it, especially grim. \u201cThese layoffs are very sad and at the same time worrying because we want to go into journalism as our profession and wonder if this trend is going to continue,\u201d said Eric Yeh, a junior journalism major at USC.\n\nYeh\u2019s sentiment is shared by many other USC journalism students who are witnessing the disappearance of jobs, internships and other opportunities in the industry. \u201cAs someone who hopes to be on screen one day, I know a lot of big-time journalists start out at places like Sports Illustrated, writing articles and earning their stripes at these outlets,\u201d said Anthony Bottino, a sophomore journalism major at USC. \u201cWith that opportunity being taken away from so many people, it makes me worried for the future because how am I going to be able to work my way up if there are really no opportunities anymore?\u201d\n\nWith concern circulating among students, journalism professors at USC are focused on keeping students engaged and motivated. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to continue to inspire the next generation of journalists when they don\u2019t see as much of a career pathway for themselves, and a lot of the organizations they aspire to work for are closing, cutting, etc.,\u201d said Christina Bellantoni, a professor at Annenberg and director of the Annenberg Media Center.\n\nBut Bellantoni said she hopes the mass layoffs won\u2019t deter students from pursuing a career in such an important field. \u201cOne thing I found myself doing in the last 24 hours is encouraging students to think in an entrepreneurial way,\u201d she said. \u201cIf these big media institutions are not going to be hiring, I don\u2019t want students to just say journalism isn\u2019t for me.\u201d\n\nRebecca Haggerty, a professor of Professional Practice in the USC School of Journalism and Associate Director of the Undergraduate Journalism Program, said though the layoffs may be worrying, she believes this is far from the death of journalism. \u201cThe industry is definitely going through a tough time, and there are challenges about revenue models but, at the same time, there are signs of hope in the industry,\u201d Haggerty said.\n\nFor Haggerty, the current layoffs may simply represent a shift from old pillars of the industry like Times Magazine and Sports Illustrated, to younger publications that are learning to thrive in the digital age. \u201cThere are newer outlets that didn\u2019t exist before that are covering a lot of news. I am not saying that everything is rosy, but the industry is changing, and still, they\u2019re covering news.\u201d\n\nJournalism students may be worried after seeing the huge number of layoffs this week and thinking about how they will fit into the journalism industry, but many still have the confidence and passion to pursue a career. \u201cIt definitely makes me nervous, but I am still going to pursue it,\u201d Yeh said. \u201cA lot of companies do layoffs sadly, but you just hope you\u2019re on the right side of it.\u201d\n```"}

Student organizations took to campus to participate in the semiannual Involvement Fair hosted by USC Campus Activities. About 150 organizations participated in the fair. The event is scheduled to continue on Thursday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n\nOrganizers said the event got off to a successful start as they assisted Trojans in finding clubs and organizations to join to get the most out of their USC experience. The university is home to over 1,000 Recognized Student Organizations (RSOs) that range from cultural, arts and academic groups to Greek life.\n\nEvery year the fair is hosted by USC Campus Activities, who have been planning the event since Thanksgiving break. Despite having to postpone the event a couple of times and move locations, the event is a staple for the Trojan Welcome Experience.\n\n\u201cWe try and get everyone involved in student life to support us and get as many RSOs as possible. We have about 150 tables for student organizations each day and we\u2019ve seen a pretty good turnout. We ran out of tickets for our food vendors every day\u201d said Madison Lang, Compliance Coordinator for Campus Activities.\n\nTroy Camp is one of USC\u2019s oldest and largest organizations devoted to serving the greater South L.A. community, specifically elementary youth. The leadership and mentorship club strengthens its relationship with local kids by providing tutoring, after-school activities and a free week-long camping trip to the mountains.\n\n\u201cThe Involvement Fair is pretty much our time to spread our community and message,\u201d said Fernando Campos, a Troy Camp member. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here since 1948 and we\u2019re just trying to spread some love within our community. This is our time to allow the students to come be a part of that.\u201d\n\nGrupo Folklorico de USC is a Mexican folklore dance group on campus. The cultural group was originally established in 1975 and then brought back in 2018. Members said the involvement fair is important to the overall growth of the group.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really helpful for them to just see the posters and see our vestuario on the table, or the zapatias, and being able to just know what we do and then be able to ask questions,\u201d said GFUSC President Emily Hurtado.\n\nFor some organizations, this was their first time participating in the Involvement Fair. IDEAS is a USC organization that has created a \u201csafe space for undocumented students and allies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is amazing. We\u2019ve gotten so many people, even people who just want to be allies for our community. So I think that the involvement fair honestly was a great choice to start,\u201d said Heydy Vasquez, advocacy liaison for IDEAS.\n\nMiddle Eastern North African Student Assembly, MENASA, also participated in the Involvement Fair and is a new organization on campus that was established just last year. Maideh Orangi, MENASA\u2019s co-executive director, is optimistic for the future of the club.\n\n\u201cOur growth is not super steady because we\u2019re new, so we\u2019re expecting it to be exponential as people find out about it. So I feel like the Involvement Fair is one of the best ways [for] people who are new students, especially freshmen and sophomores, to find out about MENASA,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really helpful tool for us.\u201d\n```"}

Bellinger declined his end of a $25 million mutual option for 2024 as expected and will test the free-agent market coming off a bounce-back season. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II, File)\n\nBy Nicci Barron January 24, 2024 at 7:27 am PST\n\nWith a month left until 2024 spring training begins, some crucial free agents are still up for grabs, including third baseman Justin Turner, center fielder Cody Bellinger and left-handed pitcher Blake Snell. This offseason has become costly for many teams, but none compare to the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers spent over $1 billion in free agency, with $700 million of that total dedicated to pitcher and designated hitter Shohei Ohtani. Despite the massive sum, Ohtani\u2019s contract terms also made history with its team-friendliness, with $680 million deferred to the end of his contract. As such, he will only be paid $2 million per season over the next 10 years. After Ohtani, the Dodgers signed Japanese right-handed pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto to a 12-year deal for $325 million. After both star-studded pitchers were taken, teams had to change their game plan and with that, free agency slowed down. But there are still plenty of stars available to be signed.\n\nThe top four, which includes Bellinger, Snell, left-handed pitcher Jordan Montgomery and third baseman Matt Chapman, are all represented by the infamous agent Scott Boras. Boras is notorious for getting his clients the best deals, no matter how long it may take. \u201cBoras is the best and most powerful agent in the game because he gets great contracts for his clients, even if he has to drag their free agency out until late in the offseason,\u201d wrote CBS Sports writer Mike Axisa.\n\nCenter fielder Cody Bellinger\nBellinger hit a rut in his last year with the Dodgers, but quickly pulled out of it after joining the Chicago Cubs, winning National League Comeback Player of the Year. It\u2019s rumored that the Cubs will re-sign him, but only if Boras agrees to a lower asking price \u2014 a rare occurrence for the veteran agent. The San Francisco Giants and the Toronto Blue Jays could emerge as other options for the outfielder, but the latter seems unlikely since they just re-signed center fielder Kevin Kiermaier. However, Bellinger could also play first base, which he did frequently for the Cubs in 2023. \u201cThe [Los Angeles] Angels, [San Francisco] Giants, Mets, and [Seattle] Mariners all make sense as potential landing spots for Bellinger, but none of those clubs appear to be ready and/or willing to pay the asking price, which is believed to be north of $200 million,\u201d MLB Analyst Mark Feinsand wrote.\n\nLeft-handed pitcher Blake Snell\nWhere might this two-time Cy Young Award winner end up? Snell exceeded expectations in the 2023 season with the San Diego Padres posting a 14-9 record and a 2.25 ERA, which was the lowest in the MLB. As of today, the New York Yankees are the only team to offer Snell a contract, according to Feinsand. The contract offered would extend over six years for $150 million. Snell would join the reigning Roberto Clemente Award recipient and center fielder Aaron Judge as well as the highly sought-after right fielder Juan Soto. The latter also played alongside Snell for the Padres, so will the two reunite again in the Bronx? Or will another suitor win him over? There are a number of teams looking to add depth to the bullpen which is crucial if they hope to compete with Ohtani and Yamamoto of the Dodgers and Josh Hader of the Astros.\n\nAnother pitcher to look out for is Jordan Montgomery, who most recently played with the Texas Rangers. Which brings us to:\n\nLeft-handed pitcher Jordan Montgomery\nMontgomery is one of the best available starting pitchers, Snell being the other. The midseason trade that landed him a contract with the 2023 World Series champions resulted in a 2.79 ERA and 58 strikeouts in 11 starts. It\u2019s likely the Rangers will sign him again according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. Given that Montgomery was essential to the Rangers\u2019 championship win, a return to Arlington makes the most sense. There are concerns that the Rangers cannot land a top-shelf pitcher this offseason due to complications with their TV rights deal. Should that be the case, other top options for Montgomery include the Giants and the Angels.\n\nThird baseman Matt Chapman\nChapman is a two-time Platinum Glove award winner and a strong hitter despite having a tough time at the plate batting .205 from May on, but we can blame that on his right-middle finger injury. The Jays put a qualifying order on the table for roughly $20 million, but he declined. Both the Yankees and the Giants have been closely linked to Chapman, but the latter seems a better fit. The Giants have significant space in their payroll after losing out on both Ohtani and Yamamoto, so this might be the right move. According to Ken Rosenthal from The Athletic, \u201cChapman would help address the Giants\u2019 shortage of power while providing, along with free-agent center fielder Jung Hoo Lee, the type of everyday anchor they lacked last season. He also would increase the defensive stability on the left side of the infield, something the Giants will need if they make rookie Marco Luciano, 22, their everyday shortstop.\u201d J.D. Davis, current Giants third baseman, put up good numbers in the 2023 season, but failed to avoid arbitration as his agent\u2019s ask was almost half a million more than what was offered. Davis is entering the final year in his contract which would open up a spot for Chapman.\n\nThere are 30 teams vying for these two star pitchers and two strong field players. Will the clubs give into these players\u2019 asking price or will Boras continue to freeze up the free agency market?\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Adam Bradford January 24, 2024 at 7:18 am PST\n\nTo say that the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 offseason was eventful would be a massive understatement. All the team did was go out and sign Shohei Ohtani, a two-way superstar and the best baseball player on the planet, to a 10-year, $700-million contract. Just your typical, run-of-the-mill stuff.\n\nWhen the Dodgers arrive at Camelback Ranch next month, all eyes will be on Ohtani, and for good reason. Even though he will not be able to pitch in 2024 due to a UCL injury, Ohtani still figures to be one of the team\u2019s best hitters this season.\n\nBut he will not be the only high-profile player putting on Dodger blue for the first time. There\u2019s also Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the Japanese phenom pitcher who will make his MLB debut this spring. After lighting up the mound in Japan over the past few years, Yamamoto became one of the most high-profile international free agents in history. In December, he signed a 12-year contract with the Dodgers worth $325 million.\n\nNot to be forgotten either is Tyler Glasnow, whom the team acquired via trade from the Tampa Bay Rays in December as well. Glasnow has posted an ERA of 3.53 or lower in four of the past five seasons and has the potential to be a legitimate ace if he stays healthy.\n\nBut while the newcomers will receive the majority of the attention this spring, the Dodgers have plenty of returning star power as well. Obviously, that starts with the elite 1-2 punch of utility player Mookie Betts and first baseman Freddie Freeman, who in their careers have combined for two MVPs, five all-MLB first-team honors, and 14 All-Star selections.\n\nThere will also be plenty of other familiar faces, including All-Star catcher Will Smith, All-MLB starting pitcher Walker Buehler, and veteran outfielder Chris Taylor.\n\nFair or unfair, the question surrounding Los Angeles throughout this season will be whether they can finally get it done in the playoffs. Despite having appeared in the postseason 11 consecutive years dating back to 2013, the Dodgers have won just one World Series during that stretch\u2014during the shortened 2020 season, where the majority of the playoffs took place at a neutral site with a reduced-capacity crowd.\n\nOver the past two years the Dodgers have combined for 211 regular season wins and exactly one playoff win, getting eliminated in the NLDS both years.\n\nBut there will be plenty of time to worry about that right down the line. Right now, the focus is on spring training in Arizona and getting ready for the start of one of the most-anticipated seasons in franchise history.\n\nSoon enough, it will be time for Dodger baseball once again. So grab a Michelada, sit back, relax and get ready for what should be an incredibly exciting year. Welcome to the Sho.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of The Sundance Institute)\n\nBy Kaitlyn Huamani January 23, 2024 at 8:58 pm PST\n\nA movie with a title like \u201cA Real Pain\u201d is bound to be a tear-jerker at some point during the two hours you sit with it, but Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s new film hits all the right notes to start the waterworks. The story, which is semi-autobiographical for director, writer, producer and star Eisenberg, follows two cousins, David and Benji, as they travel to Poland to honor their grandmother after her death. They join a Jewish heritage tour and visit several Holocaust remembrance sites as they bond with their eclectic group of fellow travelers.\n\nDavid and Benji, played by Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin, respectively, were inseparable as children, but now that David lives with his wife and child in New York City and Benji lives on his mother\u2019s couch in Binghamton, they\u2019ve understandably grown apart. The interactions between the nervous, straight-laced David and the outspoken, feeling Benji are as natural, and have as much tension, as those between brothers.\n\nThe cousins share tender moments and memories of their grandmother, they bicker, they smoke weed on the rooftops of Polish hotels and they grieve the loss of their grandmother together. The film, like the cousins, effortlessly oscillates between humor and seriousness. In one particularly poignant moment, Benji tells David that sometimes when he looks at David\u2019s face, he sees their grandmother. \u201cI look like an old Jewish woman?\u201d David shoots back. They chuckle. Benji then corrects him and tells him he looks wise. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he says.\n\nThis simple interaction, and the several others the cousins share when they talk about their grandmother or about Benji\u2019s mental health struggles since her death, feels fresh. It\u2019s easy and free, but it\u2019s vulnerable. It doesn\u2019t feel like some belabored conversation where the characters are forced to sit down and talk about their feelings. It\u2019s just two people showing care and love for each other, beautifully written and directed by Eisenberg, and skillfully performed by him and Culkin.\n\nThe film, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on Saturday, played to packed theaters of people who laughed and cried along with the characters at its heart. During an audience Q&A following a Sunday morning screening, Eisenberg said he\u2019s surprised how many people have told him they appreciated the nuanced portrayal of men experiencing pain and being vulnerable. \u201cPeople are surprised, \u2018Oh, the guys talk about their feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, I can\u2019t imagine anything else to talk about. But it turns out, I guess, I\u2019m in the minority. If somebody will allow me to cry in public I\u2019ll do it \u2013 to me, that seems the norm.\u201d\n\nBeyond the moving chemistry between Eisenberg and Culkin\u2019s characters, the ensemble cast also portray the pain of remembering ancestors who survived or were killed in the Holocaust. Led by Jennifer Grey and Will Sharpe, the cast that rounds out the Polish tour compliments the vulnerability of Eisenberg and Culkin with their own musings on how the suffering throughout Jewish history impacts them today.\n\nEven with the impressive performances across the board, the film is a star vehicle for Culkin. The actor, who recently won a slew of awards for his work on \u201cSuccession,\u201d shows a level of depth and nuance in this performance that even fans of the HBO show, who saw Roman Roy\u2019s relentless snark and deep insecurity, were not necessarily privy to before. \u201cHe\u2019s a genius,\u201d Eisenberg said of his co-star. \u201cI can\u2019t say enough good things about an actor who also wouldn\u2019t rehearse, who showed up the day before, late to rehearsal, told me he didn\u2019t know his lines, and then the camera turns on and this guy is like the most magical creature I\u2019ve ever worked with and it\u2019s just this astounding thing.\u201d\n\nKieran Culkin (L) and Jesse Eisenberg attending the World Premiere of \"A Real Pain\" by Jesse Eisenberg, an official selection of the U.S. Dramatic Competition at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. (hoto by George Pimentel, courtesy of the Sundance Institute)\n\n\u201cAstounding\u201d is an appropriate word to describe Culkin\u2019s presence on the screen. His haunting expression and eventual breakdown during the group\u2019s visit to the former site of the Majdanek concentration camp is so stirring, it almost makes you sick to your stomach. Still, even when exploring such weighty themes as what Eisenberg calls the \u201cgenerational trauma\u201d that came out of the Holocaust, it maintains levity throughout, which is due, in great part, to Culkin\u2019s sharp comedic timing.\n\n\u201cMy entire goal was to try to make a movie that can speak to these weighty themes without being pretentious and without being kind of inaccessible or feel impenetrable or like homework,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenge, really, is to be able to tell a story that is funny and is about those themes without compromising the reverence that those themes deserve.\u201d\n\nIt was evident through Eisenberg\u2019s words following the screening, and in his humility following the standing ovation he received, that this film was, as he called it, \u201ca labor of love,\u201d and a love letter to his Polish heritage. The gorgeous shots of Polish museums and landscapes, many of which are scored by musing Chopin Nocturnes, are enough to make the film beautiful, but the themes and impressive emotional gymnastics it accomplishes make it an instant standout at Sundance.\n\nLess than a full day after its premiere at the festival, Searchlight Pictures acquired the worldwide rights to \u201cA Real Pain\u201d for $10 million in the first major deal to come out of Sundance. It is not yet known when the film will be released.\n```"}

It\u2019s great because she deserves that, it\u2019s a great performance,\u201d Malik said. \u201cIt makes me feel more excited and lucky to be here, meeting new collaborators and people that I get to work with.\u201d\n\nAlthough Malik was unfamiliar with Ferrera\u2019s Trojan background, he was familiar with Sean Wang, another USC alumnus whose film, \u201cN\u01cei Nai & W\u00e0i P\u00f3,\u201d was nominated for Best Documentary Short Film. Sean Wang, a USC SCA alum, is going head-to-head with two other SCA alumni in the Best Documentary Short Film Category, director S. Leo Chiang\u2019s \u201cIsland in Between\u201d and co-director Ben Proudfoot\u2019s \u201cThe Last Repair Shop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a really big fan of this filmmaker Sean Wang, who is from Fremont, California... his first film, called D\u00ecdi, just premiered at Sundance, and it\u2019s getting a great response,\u201d Malik said.\n\nVictor Longin, a graduate student in the Peter Stark producing program at SCA, was pleasantly surprised to learn that Ferrera is a USC alumna. \u201cThat\u2019s super inspiring. It\u2019s amazing she\u2019s nominated now for best supporting actress,\u201d Longin said.\n\nDuring Ferrera\u2019s time at USC, she was involved in the Joint Educational Project and the Teaching International Relations Program in Dornsife. Ferrera took a leave of absence during her studies at USC to pursue her acting career. Ten years later, she returned to complete her degree.\n\nThere are over half a dozen USC alumni nominated for Oscars, including Thornton School of Music graduate Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, who earned his third Best Original Score nomination for his work on \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe history of the school of cinema is almost exactly parallel to the age of the awards themselves,\u201d said David Isaacs, the Chair of the John Wells Division of Writing for Screen and Television at SCA. \u201cOf course, people work with people they went to school with here; that\u2019s very much part of the legacy of the school.\u201d\n\nThe current Trojan nominees join the over 200 USC alumni that have garnered Academy Awards nominations since its inception.\n\n\u201cTo be a part of an institution that is so closely associated with the industry, it\u2019s almost like you could call it the minor league of the major leagues of filmmaking,\u201d Isaacs said.\n```"}

Duo and USC announced on Tuesday that a new feature called \u201cVerified Push\u201d will replace the current \u201cPush\u201d feature, and Duo app passcodes will be eliminated as a sign-in option. Using Duo is required to access USC services online.\n\nThe removal of the passcode method will prevent users from accidentally accepting a login request, according to a university-wide email alert from USC ITS services. The current system is susceptible to what Duo calls \u201cPush Harassment\u201d \u2014 when a user is bombarded by repeated fraudulent login push notification requests.\n\nStaff, faculty, affiliates and student workers will be required to use Verified Push, which makes users enter a three-digit verification code to complete the login process. Students, who will not be required to use Verified Push, will see fewer changes. Besides some minor changes to the Duo login interface and the loss of the app passcode sign-in option, the core functionality will remain the same.\n\nUsers will still be able to receive phone calls as well as SMS passcodes on their registered phone number, according to USC\u2019s Keep Teaching Digital Campus website.\n\nNicholas Villanueva, a sophomore at USC majoring in biology, said that while the new changes will be annoying, they will ultimately make USC more secure. \u201cWhen it comes to cyber security, I guess it\u2019s a step forward,\u201d Villanueva said. \u201cbut I do think that there can be ways to make it a little faster than having to type in a whole passcode.\u201d\n\nOther students, like Doug Peterson, a sophomore majoring in computer science, showed less optimism for the potential benefits. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to make that much of a difference to be completely honest,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cI get you know, they\u2019re trying to do stuff in the name of security.

A very American mourning ritual was taking place in the largely Asian American city. Only three days prior to my arrival, a mass shooting had taken place on January 21, 2023, where eleven people were murdered and nine were wounded. It was silent when I arrived. The sun had just set. Incense smoke rose and spread throughout the crowd. According to some volunteers, the smoke represented those who had died. In the center of the vigil, which was located at city hall, an American flag looked limp. Near it was a podium where pastors prayed for the safety of Monterey Park\u2019s residents and by extension, I felt, for Americans all over.\n\nSmoke and fire is what I remember most from the vigil. Incense smoke stuck to my nose and clothes, and I couldn\u2019t help but look at the little candles in people\u2019s palms. There were murmurs of amens and pastors delivering speeches, with one saying \u201cWe have been tempted by other things beyond God\u2019s vision of human flourishing.\u201d Later in the vigil, there were shouts for a doctor as one attendee had fainted.\n\nVigil attendee holds candle on Jan. 24, 2023 (Photo by Shane Dimapanat)\n\nAn argument also broke out between a man who held a sign which stated \u201cThe problem is guns!\u201d and a few vigil attendees who insisted there was a time and place for such protests. Some attendees, very tender in grief, wanted to spend the vigil to simply rest and process what had happened. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to process everything. It\u2019s kind of weird, I guess, you know. And in a lot of ways, it feels like your brain is kind of scrambled,\u201d said attendee Ken Haraikawa.\n\nIt makes one wonder: has there ever been a time and place in our nation for true rest? Will our vigils, processions, shootings and violence ever cease, or even just come to a trickle rather than a torrent for one day? National debates manifested at the vigil through little conflicts and questions such as these, with issues surrounding gun control, mental health and the presidency localized to the Monterey Park situation.\n\nA few people at the end of the vigil shook their heads at one Asian American woman evangelizing for Trump\u2019s presidency. And there were prayers, curiously enough, for politicians. One caught my attention. \u201cWe pray for our state leaders, for Senator Susan Rubio, Assembly Member Mike Bowen, and their teams. For our national leaders, Congressmen Judy Chu, Senator Feinstein, all the way up to the Vice President, President of the United States,\u201d said Jason Ashimoto, a pastor from the Evergreen Baptist Church. He continued, \u201cGod, will you give them grace? Give them wisdom and discernment in order to lead us, in order to heal us. In order to find us a better future. In Jesus\u2019 name, Amen.\u201d\n\nI felt peculiar, because in the history of America, what has the Presidency done for Asian Americans? Was the Presidency not the branch that issued an executive order to incarcerate Japanese Americans? Was this not the same government that banned Chinese immigrants, colonized Filipinos, and initiated endless wars in countries like Vietnam and denied bombings in Laos? What could politicians or a government built upon these foundations do for the Monterey Park community? More gun laws? Regulation? Appeals to morality? A visit by Kamala Harris?\n\nA child looks at the candles left for the deceased during a vigil held at Monterey Park City Hall on Jan. 24, 2023 (Photo by Shane Dimapanat)\n\nThe fact of the matter is, the Monterey Park mass shooting is novel. Novel, not in the fact that it is a mass shooting, but in the fact that it occurred in a largely Asian American community and that the shooting was perpetrated by an elderly, Asian American man (when most mass shootings are done by white young men). Does this fact matter? Is it a petty dissolution of the Monterey incident into identity politics? No, this fact matters because it attests to one truth: American carnage comes for all, and immigrants, newly wedded to the American project, can be especially vulnerable to its excesses and ills.\n\n\u201cThis is probably not the story that they had imagined coming to this country,\u201d said attendee Siwaraya Rochanahusdin. As she spelled her name out for me (\u201c\u2018S\u2019 as in Sam. \u2018I\u2019 like ice. \u2018W\u2019 like water. \u2018A\u2019 like apple. \u2018R\u2019 like Roger. \u2018A\u2019 like apple. \u2018Y\u2019 like yellow. \u2018A\u2019 like apple\u201d), her voice broke down, and we took a pause to center ourselves and cry.\n\nThis was a rawness apparent, I felt, to all attendees. The mere question of \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d would at times garner chuckles, silence, or tears from those I talked to. That same rawness struck me, an Asian American, as I tip-toed the line between community member and journalist.\n\nThis was the state of people then: confusion and shock. And perhaps, in this shock, residents felt subsuming their loved ones into the national debate of gun control \u2013 where their family members could become nameless numbers, another case study to simply cite \u2013 would be too soon, a glossing over of their loss by treating it as a commonplace American phenomenon.\n\nThe vigil, in a certain way, was a resistance against the namelessness and invisibility historically imposed upon Asian Americans in American discourse. So, as a remembrance, these are the names that we should know, people who fell within our American house: 65-year-old My Nhan, 72-year-old Ming Wei Ma, 70-year-old Diana Tom, 57-year-old Xiujuan Yu, 63-year-old Lilian Li, 68-year-old Valentino Alvero, 67-year-old Muoi Ung, 62-year-old Hong Jian, 72-year-old Yu Kao, 76-year-old Chia Yau, and 64-year-old Wen Yu.\n\nAs the vigil came to an end, people disbursed, and Ashimoto said some last words: \u201cThank you again for coming to this and looking to each other for strength,\u201d he finished.\n\nCandles left for deceased form a heart during a vigil held at Monterey Park City Hall on Jan. 24, 2023 (Photo by Shane Dimapanat)\n```"}

(Photo by Yannick Peterhans)\n\nBy Zack Lara, Joseph Domingot, and Dylan Luden\nJanuary 23, 2024, at 5:50 pm PST\n\nPlayers and fans of USC baseball shared mixed emotions following the release of the 2024 season schedule, which features zero home games on USC grounds. The Trojans will play their home games away from home for the entirety of the 2024 season as Dedeaux Field undergoes major restoration.\n\nUSC President Carol Folt\u2019s \u201cmoonshot\u201d program includes plans to improve USC athletics programs through a series of investments, driven by an emphasis on innovation, gender equity, and world-class facilities. USC Athletics reports that renovations to Dedeaux Field will include a new capacity of up to 2,500, indoor hospitality services, outdoor social spaces, and a video and audio system.\n\nThe team announced Monday that USC will host most of their home games at the Orange County Great Park baseball stadium in Irvine. This stadium seats 1,300 fans and can accommodate an additional 1,000 spectators in the outfield grass. The Trojans will also play three midweek home games at LMU\u2019s Page Stadium and host Oregon State for a three-game series at UC Irvine\u2019s Cicerone Field.\n\nAccording to USC athletics, all home games will be free and open to the public. Some USC fans are disappointed with the schedule changes. Bennet Patterson, a sophomore studying communications, said he worries that the team will suffer without a proper home-field advantage. He says the absence of an energetic environment may hinder the team\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cIt kind of sucks that they\u2019re not on campus,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cA sport like baseball doesn\u2019t have as much recognition in the NCAA or at USC. I feel it\u2019s definitely hard to fill out stands and that\u2019s just kind of annoying.\u201d\n\nConstruction on the field began over winter break, following the annual baseball alumni game and the Cardinal vs Gold intrasquad scrimmage series. The Trojans have been practicing at El Camino College in Torrance since the beginning of the spring semester.\n\nThe drive down to the temporary home stadium in Irvine is about 50 miles from USC, which could take up to two hours in rush-hour traffic. USC catcher Connor Clift says that the team will stay overnight for the series in Orange County.\n\n\u201cWe have a job to do,\u201d Clift said. \u201cNot one person has complained about having to go off-site to practice or play games. We have a goal we have to reach, and in order to get there we still have to do the work necessary, at a very high level. Getting on a bus doesn\u2019t change that.\u201d\n\nAlthough traveling could pose a challenge, it may be a blessing in disguise for the four players from the San Diego area and 13 players from Orange County on USC\u2019s roster. Families will be in closer proximity to USC\u2019s home games while they play at Irvine.\n\n\u201cIt is always good to be surrounded by and playing in front of family and friends. But it\u2019s not just about us, it\u2019s about all of us and completing what we set out to accomplish,\u201d Clift said. \u201cWe have so many alumni in Orange County that every time we play down there the Trojan family fills it up.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s schedule is not just going to be difficult because of the extra traveling, but also because of the quality of their opponents. They will be facing 10 top teams that competed in last year\u2019s NCAA tournament. Four of their opponents are currently ranked in D1Baseball\u2019s preseason poll, two of which are in the Pac-12 (No. 7 Oregon State and No. 22 UCLA).\n\nHead Coach Andy Stankiewicz led the Trojans to a massive resurgence last season, winning 34 games in his first year as head coach after coming from Grand Canyon University. It was the Trojan\u2019s best season since 2015.\n\nAfter narrowly missing out on the NCAA tournament last season, USC baseball faces a new challenge \u2013 without a home field, they are taking this season on the road.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\nBy Curran Rastogi January 23, 2024 at 5:34 pm PST\n\nCalifornia State University (CSU) faculty reached a tentative agreement Monday night with CSU management to end their planned five-day strike after its first day. The new agreement retroactively raises the salaries of CSU faculty 5%, with another 5% increase scheduled for July 1, according to the California Faculty Association (CFA), a union comprised of more than 29,000 instructors, professors and coaches. The agreement, which the CFA has been fighting for the last eight months for, will also raise the salary floor for the lowest-paid faculty by $3,000.\n\n\u201cThe collective action of so many lecturers, professors, counselors, librarians, and coaches over these last eight months forced CSU management to take our demands seriously,\u201d CFA President Charles Toombs said in a Jan. 22 press release. \u201cThis tentative agreement makes major gains for all faculty at the CSU.\u201d\n\nThe CFA fought previously for eight months to obtain an immediate pay increase of 12%, which CSU management said was not \u201cfinancially viable.\u201d CSU management countered with a 5% salary increase but refused to continue negotiating with the CFA before the strike, due to their unwillingness to move away from their proposed 12% pay increase. Ultimately both sides agreed on the current raise structure.\n\n\u201cI am extremely pleased and deeply appreciative that we have reached common ground with CFA that will end the strike immediately,\u201d CSU Chancellor Mildred Garc\u00eda said in a statement released Monday. \u201cThe agreement enables the CSU to fairly compensate its valued, world-class faculty while protecting the university system\u2019s long-term financial sustainability.\u201d\n\nThis current fight follows a larger trend of university faculty and employees fighting for higher wages. USC\u2019s Graduate Student Workers Union ended its planned strike a day before it was set to begin after it reached a tentative agreement with USC last November. SCA adjunct professors also recently unionized to fight for higher pay and paths to full-time positions.\n```"}

On some nights, they look like the team that climbed to the Western Conference Finals last season and won the inaugural In-Season Tournament this season. Other times, the team has looked dysfunctional due to multiple factors including injuries, poor shooting, and slow transition defense. On top of that, head coach Darvin Ham has been the subject of Twitter memes recently, with fans mocking how he had his hands in his pockets while LeBron James signaled for a timeout and tried checking himself out of play against the Portland Trail Blazers Sunday by intentionally committing a foul.\n\nLeBron took a foul to take himself out and then called a timeout because Darvin Ham wouldn't do it himself, can't make it up lol  pic.twitter.com/kx3lbKrb9U \u2014 LakeShow Highlights (@LSH_lakeshow)  January 22, 2024\n\nAfter the Lakers crushed Portland that night 134-110, news broke that James would sit out the contest against the Clippers on Tuesday due to an ankle injury. James, who\u2019s the oldest player in the league at 39, has only missed four of the Lakers\u2019 44 games so far this season. Lakers fans are hoping that James is just being extra cautious and it isn\u2019t a serious injury.\n\nA bright note, however, is that the rest of the Lakers are healthy once again, and they\u2019ll need the whole team\u2019s help to beat the Clippers for the third time this season. This will be the toughest game yet against their Los Angeles rivals. The Clippers have been on fire the last two months and have climbed to fourth in the Western Conference with a 27-14 record.\n\nAfter acquiring James Harden in a trade with the Philadelphia 76ers on Oct. 31, the Clippers immediately dropped six straight games. Then, their core of star players finally started to gel, and they haven\u2019t looked back since. Since Dec. 1, they\u2019ve gone 19-4, rattling off a nine-game winning streak during that span. They\u2019ve also gone 8-2 in January so far, including an outstanding come-from-behind victory on Sunday against the Brooklyn Nets, finishing the game on a 22-0 run.\n\nWith James out, the Lakers are going to have to figure out a way to contain the Clippers\u2019 star power. Kawahi Leonard and Paul George struggled on Sunday, but Russell Westbrook and Harden combined for 47 points. Sunday\u2019s game against the Nets proved that the Clippers can win games even if all of their stars aren\u2019t playing at their best, which is a scary thought for not just the Lakers but for the whole NBA.\n\nDuring the James and Anthony Davis era in Los Angeles, the Lakers have been built on stopping shots with Davis being the focal point of their interior defense. Without the physical presence of James, someone from the bench like Jarred Vanderbilt or Cam Reddish is going to have to step up big-time on defense.\n\nEven though there\u2019s been trade rumors swirling around D\u2019Angelo Russell, he\u2019s been playing his best basketball of the season in January. After shooting just 41% in December, D-Lo boosted his shooting percentage to 53% in January. After dropping 34 points on Sunday, Russell is primed to continue scoring and help take the pressure off Davis on offense.\n\nIf the Lakers want to keep their winning streak going against the Clippers, they need to feed Russell while he\u2019s hot and get Austin Reaves involved more on offense as well. With James not facing the Clippers Tuesday, their game plan has to change if they want to move above .500.\n\nThis matchup against the Clippers isn\u2019t do-or-die for the Lakers season in any fashion, but it would be a big statement to come out victorious against one of the most in-form teams in the league without one of their stars. The Lakers and Clippers will tip off at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Crypto.com Arena.\n```"}

Photo by Nova Blanco-Rico\n\nBy Angelina Hicks January 23, 2024 at 9:58 am PST\n\nMARSHALLTOWN, Iowa \u2014 In the days leading up to the Iowa caucus, the Republican presidential candidates all had a similar message: brave the cold and get out to your caucus meeting on Jan. 15. With weather forecasts depicting record-breaking, subzero temperatures, turnout numbers came into question: would a state-wide freeze keep people from heading out to caucus?\n\nAsked if she ever considered staying home because of the weather, Marshalltown local Jennifer Bryant had a simple answer: \u201cHeavens no.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were coming, for sure,\u201d Bryant said before casting her vote Monday night. \u201cI\u2019m a Christ follower. I want to make sure I\u2019m doing everything I can to make a difference and be a light and hopefully pick someone that will represent the truth.\u201d\n\nBryant, a 49-year-old registered nurse, was caucusing for the first time Monday night at the Marshalltown High School Roundhouse. An hour\u2019s drive from Des Moines in central Iowa, the town is home to about 28,000 people.\n\n\u201cI know how important this is to get the right nominee for the Republicans to run,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to be able to have an opportunity to maybe make a little difference.\u201d\n\nBryant said she was still deciding between former president Donald Trump and Nikki Haley, former governor of South Carolina and ambassador to the United Nations. Bryant never revealed which candidate she picked, but Trump won this caucus with 267 votes, and Haley came in third place with 101. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis came in second place with 163 votes.\n\nAlthough many dedicated Republicans didn\u2019t bat an eye at the freezing temperatures, the weather got so severe that multiple candidates were forced to cancel campaign events just days before the caucuses. Haley had to move one of her speeches into an audio-only telephone format for Iowans to call in. Vivek Ramaswamy livestreamed one of his speeches on Instagram for people who weren\u2019t able to leave their homes.\n\nWhen caucus day arrived, about 100,000 Iowans trudged through the snow in temperatures as low as negative 17 degrees Fahrenheit. It was the first time any voters in America were able to voice their preference on who should receive the Republican presidential nomination. The weather on Jan. 15 for the 2024 Iowa caucuses was the coldest caucus day in history.\n\nTrump received the most votes in 98 of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties. Statewide, he received 51% of the vote as fewer Iowa Republicans participated in caucus than years prior. DeSantis came in second with 21.2% of the vote but didn\u2019t win any counties. Haley \u2014 who came in third with 19.9% of the vote \u2014 won Iowa\u2019s Johnson County by a single vote over Trump. (DeSantis and Ramaswamy ended their campaigns last week and endorsed the former president.)\n\n\u201cIowans braved record-low temperatures after a blizzard blanketed their state just days earlier to deliberate with members of their community about the future of our country and participate in true, grassroots democracy,\u201d Republican Party of Iowa Chairman Jeff Kaufmann said in a statement released Monday night. \u201cI could not be prouder to be an Iowan than I am tonight.\u201d\n\nChristopher Tiernan Sr. also attended the Marshalltown caucus to support DeSantis. As a caucus captain, he knew it was important to show up in person despite any cold or snow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dedicated to trying to get this changed,\u201d Tiernan said. \u201cWe need new people.\u201d\n\nAlthough Tiernan is in his 70s, he said he wouldn\u2019t vote for Trump because the country needs younger people in office.\n\nIowans line up to register at a caucus site in Marshalltown, Iowa on Jan. 15. Photo by Angelina Hicks\n\nJust days before the caucus, residents across the state were attending various campaign events to hear the candidates speak and shake their hands. On Jan. 11, 49-year-old Nancy Gourley went to a DeSantis event in Ames to hear more about what he has to offer. Even though she had never caucused before, she knew the weather wouldn\u2019t stop dedicated Iowans from making their voices heard.\n\n\u201cI think that people who caucus feel passionately about what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Gourley said. \u201cSnow isn\u2019t going to slow people in Iowa down.\u201d\n\nThe younger generation had a similar sentiment.

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Eniola Adeleke January 22, 2024 at 7:50 pm PST\n\nUSC women\u2019s lacrosse released its 16-game regular season schedule Monday. The team will take on seven opponents at home and nine on the road, complicated by the construction of the new Rawlinson Stadium for women\u2019s lacrosse and soccer, set to open in 2025. As such, Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California, and the L.A. Memorial Coliseum will serve as the site of USC\u2019s home games this season.\n\nDignity Health Sports Park, the home of the LA Galaxy, will host the first five home games, while the last two will be held at the Coliseum, the long-time home of USC football. The Trojans will play Hofstra in their first home game at Dignity Health on February 17.\n\nLast summer, USC President Carol Folt announced the $38 million renovation of Soni McAlister Field, the former home of USC women\u2019s soccer and lacrosse teams. The Fritz B. Burns Foundation gifted $10 million towards this world-class renovation that will become Rawlinson Stadium, the new home of USC women\u2019s soccer and lacrosse. The new venue is expected to host more than double the spectators its predecessor could.\n\nThe stadium is set to host the women\u2019s lacrosse squad upon its completion in 2025. In the Pac-12\u2032s final lacrosse season, USC will face seven conference opponents. The Trojans will face UC Davis, California and Colorado at home and will visit Arizona State, Oregon, Stanford and San Diego State.\n\nThat leaves USC with several non-conference foes on its schedule, including Villanova and Johns Hopkins, the latter of which ended the 2023 season ranked No. 14 in the NCAA RPI. The Trojans will also host Michigan at Dignity Health, a preview of future Big Ten matchups.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to our out of conference opponents \u2013 all incredibly strong teams that will allow us to compete against the best as well as prepare us for Pac-12 play,\u201d head coach Lindsey Munday said in a statement.\n\nThe Trojans are coming off of a successful 2023 season; they finished 16-4 with a Pac-12 Championship title, beating Colorado 12-6 in the final to earn their second conference title in program history. USC went on to lose 10-7 to the University of Denver in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\n\nThis season, the Trojans will look to become the final Pac-12 lacrosse champions in history before their move to the Big Ten next season. USC will also host the Pac-12 tournament at the Coliseum from May 1-4.\n\n\u201cTo send off the Pac-12 lacrosse conference in an iconic venue like the Coliseum is something we very much look forward to,\u201d Munday said.\n\nUSC kicks off their season against Army on Friday, February 9, at 2 p.m. PST in West Point, New York.\n```"}

Annenberg Media is at the frontline, bringing you live updates from Bovard Auditorium.\n\n7:28 End of the Showdown. The candidates did not make closing statements, the audience applauded them and they left the stage. Media filed into the spin room at the close of the debate. Porter, Schiff and Lee took questions from the press, but Garvey was not present.\n\n7:24 p.m. Response to USC student question on campus hate speech. USC journalism student Jacob Wheeler asked a question about a rise in antisemitism and islamophobia on college campuses. Garvey responded by calling for compassion in response to the Israel-Hamas war. Porter answers: \u201ccampuses should be places of debate, not hate. Young people should learn and dialogue with each other.\u201d She underscored her background in keeping places of worship safe as well. Schiff reflected on his personal experiences with antisemitism and said hate speech must be condemned and responded to with force.\n\n7:15 p.m. Immigration reform. Both Porter and Schiff agreed that the nation needed change on the issues of the immigration system and border control. Porter specifically stated that \u201cwe need to have an ordered immigration system\u201d and then pointed out that Washington is not delivering. Schiff also promised that he will go to the Senate and strive to \u201cpass a comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d Garvey added one more remark before this segment concluded: \u201c[Californians\u2019] life is threatened.\u201d\n\n7:11 p.m. Lee responds to crime in the Bay.

Lee concluded the segment by saying that we should \u201cnot over-police\u201d while also maintaining public safety.\n\n6:52 p.m. Another hot topic: Abortion. Garvey said he would \u201calways support the voice of the people in California,\u201d in response to a question about supporting the right to abortion if elected to the Senate.

Garvey referred to Schiff\u2019s censure from the House of Representatives and explicitly stated that he would not support a federal abortion ban. The two candidates then traded jabs about the former president. Schiff defended his record on impeaching Trump, and Garvey closed and said that in Congress, Schiff lied to Americans and that he cannot take that back.\n\n6:43 p.m. Homelessness in California is a \u201ctop issue\u201d for voters Porter stated that the solution to homelessness is building more housing. \u201c[Homelessness] is the direct result of Washington\u2019s failure\u201d and it \u201ckeeps Wall Street printing money,\u201d she said. Schiff echoed Porter on the housing issue and highlighted securing more affordable housing as the solution to homelessness. \u201cIt\u2019s a supply problem,\u201d Schiff said, and added that homelessness could be addressed through tax incentives for affordable housing.\n\n6:41 p.m. Democrats respond to Garvey\u2019s opinion of Trump Porter fired off insults at Garvey as the live audience erupted in laughter: \u201cOnce a Dodger, always a Dodger.\u201d Porter quickly followed up with another snap: \u201cThis is not the minor leagues, who will you vote for?\u201d Her fellow Democratic representatives pressed Garvey further. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s all personal choice,\u201d Garvey said, lamenting the one-party state of California once again.\n\n6:35 p.m. Donald Trump questions spark a fiery debate on stage A radio host launched a fill-in-the-blank question: \u201cIf the American people choose former President Donald Trump to return as commander in chief, then blank.\u201d The candidates responded in a heated debate. Lee and Schiff touted their legal cases against the former president and said that he is a threat to democracy. Garvey\u2019s prior support for the former President led to a heated exchange between him and Porter, who said that re-election would hurt America\u2019s credibility on the world stage.\n\n6:29 p.m. Candidates talk healthcare Both Schiff and Lee touted their prior support for the Affordable Care Act. Garvey made a case for private healthcare providers. Porter called out \u201cbig pharma\u201d and rebuked her fellow Democratic members of Congress. The candidates then talked over each other to respond to Porter\u2019s remarks.\n\n6:15 p.m. Candidates discuss the Israel-Hamas War Lee answered first by calling for an immediate ceasefire. In response, Schiff argued that the U.S. should stand in support of Israel. Porter supported a conditional ceasefire alongside release of hostages and a two-state solution. Garvey closed the question stating that a two-state solution may not be possible.\n\n6:09 p.m. Economic talk from the candidates The moderators asked candidates to rank the U.S. economy on a number scale. Schiff rated the economy a seven out of 10, explaining that labor laws and inflation make negative impacts. Garvey gave it a five, referencing Californian tax laws and high gas prices. Rep. Lee gave the economy a six. Porter rated it a five out of 10, blaming corporate power for the nation\u2019s economic faults.\n\n6:07 p.m. Steve Garvey makes the case against Democrats Republican candidate Steve Garvey introduced himself as a former Dodger athlete and made a case against a one-party rule in California. In response to the question about his disagreements with the Republican Party, he described himself as a \u201cconcerned moderate,\u201d but dodged the question.\n\n6:05 p.m. Rep. Schiff distinguishes himself as a fighter Rep. Adam Schiff acknowledged the similar voting records between the Democratic candidates and boasted his record on taking on \u201cwould-be dictator\u201d Trump.\n\n6:04 p.m. Lee a progressive Rep. Barbara Lee defined herself as a \u201cconsistent progressive\u201d in response to Michaelson\u2019s question.

(Art courtesy of Electric Futures)\n\nBy Natalie Lopez\nJanuary 22, 2024 at 3:26 pm PST\n\nThe Imperial Valley is primarily agricultural land with massive wind turbines and solar panel farms. It is where I grew up in the border cities of Calexico and later the city of Imperial, but now things may start to change because of one thing: lithium.\n\nAs an Environmental Studies major at the University of Southern California, I do my best to keep up with Los Angeles\u2019s work in its energy transition plan of reaching 100% renewable energy by 2045 and net zero by 2050. Keeping watch of LA\u2019s work, I was led right back to the Imperial Valley \u2014 soon to be known as Lithium Valley.\n\nThe area welcomes the new industry of lithium, which will allow industrialized cities such as Los Angeles to have a local source of lithium, an essential mineral for electric cars and batteries. The Imperial Valley is now preparing for a massive change that the industry will bring to a currently agricultural-based economy.\n\nWith a new industry coming in, the community faces turmoil regarding the possible economic benefits, environmental impacts and social implications this will bring. The Imperial Valley is historically known for having the highest unemployment rate in California, usually at about 18.5%. It is also known to have one of the worst air qualities, on average, in the nation.\n\nTo dive into the topic I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working as the associate producer with the USC Annenberg Center for Climate Journalism and Communications (CCJC) on Electric Futures, a podcast exploring the upcoming changes lithium will bring to the Imperial Valley.\n\nThe podcast aims to represent the circumstances and the community of the Imperial Valley, which has a population of 86% Hispanic or Latino origin (as defined by the U.S census). It also highlights the changes coming globally with the energy transition, as well as the compelling stories that are yet to be told. Additionally, there will be an episode special in Spanish coming out in February.\n\nUSC Professor of Chemical Engineering, Charles Zukoski, is the host of Electric Futures, which will be coming to Spotify and all other streaming platforms on January 24, 2024.

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Cam Kauffman January 22, 2024 at 3:00 pm PST\n\nDain Blanton looks around some days at practice and, like David Byrne of the Talking Heads, wonders, how did I get here? He is one of the most surprising gold medalists of all time. No collegiate head coach experience. And yet, here he is, one of the most successful sand volleyball coaches in West Coast history. And he\u2019s only just getting started.\n\nBlanton is entering his fifth season as coach of the Southern Cal sand volleyball team. His team has boasted a 165-15 record over three full seasons; his first season ended 6-5, cut short due to the pandemic. SC has won three straight NCAA championships.\n\nAs a coach, he\u2019s a silent leader, pacing USC\u2019s beach courts on Figueroa Street. Sometimes he even takes a seat in the shade to talk to another coach, trusting his players can handle themselves. \u201cWe know if coach is talking to us, it\u2019s big,\u201d Delaynie Maple said. \u201cHe sees something.\u201d\n\nThe senior has been at USC for all but 11 games of Blanton\u2019s head coaching career and said she has grown as much as a player under Blanton as he has grown as a coach. Throughout all of it, Maple said Blanton has remained committed to molding his players into the athletes and people they aspire to be.\n\nNever having coached collegiately before aside from a few volunteer assistant years at USC from 2015 to 2017, Blanton has stepped into his self-described \u201cdream job\u201d at USC. His commute to work is 20 minutes, his office is 50 yards from the courts and the support he feels from USC is unmatched.\n\nHis journey to get there, however, has been far from easy. Blanton grew up in Laguna Beach around two older brothers who were constantly playing sports. When he was 11, older brother Kurt showed him beach volleyball for the first time. \u201cI wanted to do everything that they did and compete,\u201d Blanton said, emphasizing the last word.\n\nAs Dain got older, he focused his efforts on volleyball and basketball, earning offers from various colleges in both sports. With beach volleyball neither a collegiate sport nor an Olympic sport at the time, Blanton elected to focus his efforts on indoor, joining Pepperdine, a smaller Division I school a little more than an hour up the coast from his hometown.\n\nHe chose Pepperdine because of its small-school feel and because of the opportunity to be coached by someone who had been to the Olympics before, Marv Dunphy, who coached the 1988 U.S. men\u2019s indoor team to a gold medal. As a sophomore, Blanton helped lead his squad to win the 1992 national championship; as a senior, he was named All-American.\n\nHe still holds the career record at his alma mater for digs per set (2.3); he previously held the record for career total digs (707). As a player, Blanton held his teammates to a high level of excellence, pushing those around him to improve every day, Dunphy said. \u201cIf a teammate did not meet that standard, there was hell to pay,\u201d Dunphy said. \u201cBut it was a good hell. That\u2019s who he was. \u201cI had to match the standard that he wanted, and he made me a better coach.\u201d\n\nDespite his collegiate indoor success, Blanton always had beach volleyball in the back of his mind. When he wasn\u2019t in class, at practice or doing homework, he was on the sand. Because of this, he knew he wanted to become an Olympian someday. There was, however, just one problem: beach volleyball wasn\u2019t an Olympic sport yet.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that I would have the opportunity,\u201d Blanton said, \u201cbut I knew that that was the sport I wanted to play.\u201d\n\nTwo years after Blanton graduated, beach was added to the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Although he hadn\u2019t established himself enough before the Atlanta Games, Dain started preparing for the next Olympics, joining the Association of Volleyball Professionals tour shortly thereafter in hopes of finding a partner who he could succeed with.\n\nWhen he found Kent Steffes, winner of the 1996 beach gold, he thought everything was set. But when Steffes announced his sudden retirement in April 1999, Blanton was left scrambling to find a new partner \u2013 and fast.\n\nAt the same time, Eric Fonoimoana lost his partner due to injury. The only logical thing to do, Dain said, was to try to play together again and see if they clicked. This was their second partnership. The duo lost all 26 matches they played together less than two years before that.\n\nThis time, however, the way they worked together was much different, according to Fonoimoana. \u201cI was going to find someone where we had good chemistry, and I knew they were hungry to win like I was,\u201d Fonoimoana said. \u201cWhen Dain was available, I knew he was hungry.\u201d\n\nThe duo later defeated Adam Johnson and Karch Kiraly \u2013 an American volleyball legend with two indoor gold medals, and Steffes\u2019 beach partner in the 1996 Games \u2013 to qualify for the Sydney Olympics in 2000.\n\n\u201cHey, take a lot of pictures, have a good time,\u201d Blanton recalled being told as he and Fonoimoana left for Australia. \u201cBasically, what they were saying is, don\u2019t get your hopes up too much,\u201d Blanton said. \u201cBut Eric and I had different plans.\u201d\n\nDain and Eric came into those Olympics ranked ninth in the 24-team field, which essentially meant they \u201cweren\u2019t supposed to be there,\u201d according to Fonoimoana. That resulted in the No. 7-ranked U.S.-team of Kevin Wong and Robert Heidger Jr,. along with the two-standout female American duos, getting most of the media attention.\n\nBlanton and Fonoimoana were left to play in the shadows. \u201cThat might have been a chip on our shoulder, but it was more of, like: \u2018That\u2019s fine. We have to prove ourselves anyway,\u2019\u201d Fonoimoana said.\n\nBlanton said he and Fonoimoana played \u201cone match at a time, one point at a time,\u201d not focusing on outside noise. \u201cIf we got momentum, we were confident enough that we could beat teams,\u201d Fonoimoana said.\n\nAfter beating Germany, Norway, the other Americans and Portugal, the unlikely Americans qualified for the gold-medal match and took on the third-ranked Brazilian duo of Z\u00e9 Marco de Melo and Ricardo Santo, a team Blanton and Fonoimoana had lost to all four times they\u2019d faced off previously.\n\nThis time, however, was the only match that truly mattered, and the undersized Americans took it in straight sets. Dain\u2019s and Eric\u2019s execution that year still stands as one of the greatest Olympic beach performances in history, marking the only time a team seeded outside of the top three has won gold since it became an Olympic sport.\n\n\u201cIt was a big surprise to a lot of people, but it was pretty cool to play your best volleyball when your best volleyball was needed,\u201d Blanton said, adding that it was surely the \u201cbiggest upset of all time in beach volleyball Olympic history.\u201d\n\nBetween Dain\u2019s return to the Olympics in 2004 and coaching at USC, Blanton took a different approach to sport than he was used to: he became a broadcaster. He started out announcing high school football games before moving up to Dodgers and Angels pre- and post-game coverage. In 2008, Blanton became the Clippers\u2019 sideline reporter. He did that for five years.\n\nMeanwhile, he started at USC as volunteer assistant coach under highly touted head coach Anna Collier. When Collier left USC after the 2019 season, Blanton knew he had to have the job.\n\nWith the volleyball resume that he has, it would have been pretty easy for Blanton to get into coaching in the professional or Olympic ranks. That, however cool it might sound, did not appeal to Dain.\n\n\u201cCoaching one duo isn\u2019t that attractive to me,\u201d Blanton said. Instead, Dain said he enjoys coaching 15 or more players at a time and enjoys the NCAA beach schedule in its best-of-five format compared to the professional ranks\u2019 straight-bracket format.\n\nIn addition, he also enjoys being close to home for once in his career compared to the constant travel associated with coaching professionals.\n\nBeyond Dain\u2019s love of the program, his players said the feeling is mutual. \u201cHaving him as a coach is a really special experience because he knows how to push people to be the best people, the best players on and off the court that they can be,\u201d sophomore Madison White said.\n\nThe Trojans look to continue their winning ways as they kick off the upcoming season in February.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a fascinating sport, and I think that SC is at the epicenter of it all,\u201d Blanton said. \u201cWe pride ourselves on being the best organization, and we\u2019ve been able to do it so far.\u201d\n```"}

After the Lakers won the first two matchups of the season by a combined eight points, the Clippers will be looking to return the favor on Tuesday night.\n\nThe rivalry between the Clippers and the Lakers became more prominent than ever after the Lakers traded for former New Orleans Pelicans forward Anthony Davis in 2019 and the Clippers responded by acquiring forwards Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the same offseason. Since then, the two teams have played each other 17 times in the regular season with the Clippers winning 13 of those 17 meetings.\n\nLately, the Clippers have been one of the NBA\u2019s hottest teams after a six-game losing streak in early November left the team surrounded with nothing but question marks. Since the Clippers\u2019 111-108 loss to the Nuggets on November 14, Los Angeles has won 24 of its last 31 games and holds the No. 4 seed in the Western Conference.\n\nMore recently, the Clippers are coming off of two impressive wins against the No. 2 seed Oklahoma City Thunder and the Brooklyn Nets. The Nets are just 17-25 on the season, but the Clippers were down by as many as 18 points and came back to win the game 125-114. With stars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George having rough shooting nights against Brooklyn, it was the other star duo of James Harden and Russell Westbrook that propelled the Clippers to victory.\n\nHarden finished the game with 24 points and 10 assists while Westbrook added 23 points, nine rebounds, six assists, a steal and a block off the bench. After facing a 114-103 deficit, the Clippers went on a 22-0 scoring run to secure the 11-point victory.\n\nIf the Clippers want to extend their winning streak and end their homestand with a victory, they cannot underestimate a Lakers team that has had their number this year. The Lakers are 5-3 in their last eight games, but have come away with quality wins over the Toronto Raptors, Thunder and Dallas Mavericks in that span. In this recent eight game stretch, the Lakers have scored 125 points or more four times, so defense must be a focal point if the Clippers expect to come up with a victory.\n\nIn particular, the Clippers will have to find a way to contain LeBron James, who has had two excellent showings against his intra-city rival this season. In the first matchup, the Lakers won 130-125 in overtime and James finished with 35 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists. In the second meeting, the Lakers came out on top by three points and James had another near-triple double with 25 points, eight rebounds and seven assists.\n\nThe Clippers will also be looking for Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to shoot the basketball better than in the previous meeting against the Lakers. The two were a combined 14-35 from the field 6-18 from the three-point line. Both Leonard and George also did not get to the free-throw line much in the previous meeting, shooting four free throws combined.\n\nOverall, Leonard and George are both having sensational individual seasons heading into this matchup and both Clippers and general NBA fans should be more excited about their consistent availability. Out of the 41 games the Clippers have played this year, Leonard has played in 37 games and George has played in 39, both on pace to qualify for All-NBA teams with the new 65-game rule.\n\nIt has been a struggle for the Clippers to keep their stars on the court over the last few years as neither Leonard nor George have played more than 57 games in a season since joining the Clippers. This season will likely buck that trend.\n\nJames Harden and Russell Westbrook have also filled tremendous needs for Los Angeles this season. After a shaky start with the Clippers, Harden is averaging 17 points, five rebounds and nine assists per game. Harden has been able to step into the role of being a true point guard for the Clippers while also still being able to provide sufficient scoring.\n\nWestbrook has also embraced his sixth man role and since his disappointing stint with the Lakers, he has played great basketball for the Clippers. This season, Westbrook is averaging 11 points per game, six rebounds per game and five assists per game. While those numbers may not be eye-popping to the average NBA fan, it is important to note that Westbrook has played in every game for the Clippers and is shooting 47% from the field.\n\nDuring Westbrook\u2019s tenure with the Lakers, he never shot the ball above 45% as he struggled to fit in with their roster.\n\nDespite the Lakers leading the all-time series between the two franchises 152-85, the Clippers have essentially owned this rivalry over the last five seasons and will be looking to add another chapter to their dominance over the Lakers on Tuesday night.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson January 22, 2024 at 2:27 pm PST\n\nUSC baseball will be without a true home this season. After USC Athletics announced a string of renovations to their facilities \u2014 including Dedeaux Field, the normal home of the baseball team \u2014 the Trojans needed to find a place to play their home games. The team announced today it would have multiple spots to play its \u2018home games\u2019 throughout the year: Orange County Great Park, Loyola Marymount and UC Irvine. Great Park will be the main venue, with 21 of USC\u2019s 27 home games being at the park\u2019s stadium with a 1,000-person capacity. The Trojans will play at LMU for three-midweek matchups, then play at UC Irvine for a series against Oregon State March 28-30.\n\n\u201cWe have found a temporary home at Orange County Great Park in Irvine that we can truly make our own,\u201d head coach Andy Stankiewicz said in a USC Athletics press release. \u201cWhile we will certainly miss playing on the University Park campus, we look forward to spending time with the large contingent of Trojan fans down in Orange County.\u201d\n\nAll of the 27 games will be \u201cfree and open to the public,\u201d according to a USC Athletics statement. The Trojans will be on the road or at a neutral site for 29 of their games, the first time since 2008 that USC has more road games on the schedule than home matchups. This includes two three-game tournaments filled with non-conference foes. USC will play in the MLB Desert Invitational to open up its season between February 16-18 in Arizona, then compete in the Kubota College Baseball Series between March 1-3 in Arlington, Texas. Grand Canyon \u2014 Stankiewicz\u2019s former school \u2014 highlights the Desert Invitational, with the Trojans also facing off against BYU and Ohio State. USC will then take on TCU and Texas A&M to open up March.\n\nThe non-conference schedule for USC is particularly tough, with the Trojans taking on five teams who competed in the NCAA Tournament in 2023. TCU made it the furthest of the five, getting all the way to the eight-team College World Series. Then add the five Pac-12 teams who made the tournament to USC\u2019s schedule, and the Trojans will be playing 10 of the 64-team field during the regular season.\n\nDespite the tough task of not playing at their normal home and scheduling multiple high-level non-conference matchups, the Trojans are on the rise as they enter Stankiewicz\u2019s second year at the helm. USC went 34-23-1 last season but was not tabbed to compete in the NCAA Tournament after a poor finish to the season. However, it was the first time in history that a Pac-12 team won 17 games in conference play and was not selected for the tournament. The Trojans added 24 players in the fall \u2014 10 transfers and 14 freshmen \u2014 as they look to improve this season and make the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2015. USC has not made it to the College World Series since 2001.\n\nOnce Dedeaux\u2019s renovations are completed, the ballpark will be able to hold 2,500 fans. The new field will also include a new video board and audio system, with revamped hospitality options. \u201cThe University and our Athletic Department have once again shown their commitment to USC baseball through this incredible investment in Dedeaux Field,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cThis stadium will provide our student-athletes with the world-class facilities they deserve.\u201d\n\nUSC opens up its schedule against BYU on February 16 at Sloan Park in Mesa, Arizona.\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Gribbon)\n\nBy Annie Bang January 22, 2024 at 2:00 pm PST\n\nBlending in amongst a crowd of local Iowans, Missouri native Laela Zaidi held a poster that read \u201cNever Back Down,\u201d a slogan from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 campaign. But she was no supporter. Minutes later, Zaidi would be one of three climate activists heckling the politician, labeling him a \u201cclimate criminal\u201d a week before the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucus.\n\nThe disruptions were not unique to DeSantis \u2014 as the presidential hopefuls continued their campaigns throughout the state, protesters from the Sunrise Movement showed up to heckle the Republicans to raise awareness about climate change. It might seem like a futile effort, but young people from across the country attempted to be heard as the nation looked to Iowa.\n\nRay Mitchem, a retired public school teacher who previously taught biology, said in an interview at his Marshalltown caucus meeting on Monday that the protesters were \u201cyouths [who] have been part of those that drank too much of the Kool-aid.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the global level, Mother Nature will do what Mother Nature wants to do without humans trying to intervene,\u201d Mitchem said. \u201cIf the youth are there trying to promote that it\u2019s human fault causing the climate problems, those youths have been pulled in by the wrong crowd.\u201d\n\nMitchem, who said he would be caucusing for the first time this year, shared that he planned to support Vivek Ramaswamy, a businessman who has previously expressed controversial views toward climate change. Ramaswamy suspended his campaign Monday night after taking a disappointing fourth place in Iowa.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, it\u2019s a total hoax,\u201d Mitchem said.\n\nDeSantis didn\u2019t go quite that far at his event, even as student after student forced him to pause his stump speech. Paul Campion, a student at Loyola University of Chicago who also disrupted a rally with former President Trump, waited for his opening during the evening event at a barbecue restaurant. He climbed onto the stage next to DeSantis and raised a banner before being tackled by security.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to ask Ron DeSantis what his plan is to stop the climate crisis,\u201d Campion told Annenberg Media after being escorted out. \u201cI know he\u2019s taken millions of dollars from oil, gas and coal executives, and it looks like he\u2019s padded his heels with that cash instead of creating a plan.\u201d\n\nDeSantis remained unshaken and blamed the higher education system as protesters were swiftly escorted out of the room.\n\n\u201cThis is [what\u2019s] wrong with our college system right there. That\u2019s Exhibit A,\u201d DeSantis said, before continuing with the rest of his speech, in which he mentioned abolishing the Federal Department of Education.\n\nThe book-banning politician also spoke on eradicating \u201cwokeism\u201d and repeatedly encouraged his supporters to attend the caucuses on Monday to vote.\n\nUniversity of Minnesota student John Higgins attended the event, despite being a registered Democrat, in hopes of hearing moderate stances. The first-time voter said that he disapproved of DeSantis\u2019 platform on education and his \u201canti-woke agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he really represents what we should be pushing for as Americans,\u201d Higgins said.\n\nAfter the rally was over, Higgins shared that it was \u201cso much worse than [expected].\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s obsessed with thinking that colleges indoctrinate people,\u201d he said. \u201cTrust me, there\u2019s no indoctrination, and it\u2019s not like colleges are overtly Democratic. I think it\u2019s a ridiculous talking point, and it\u2019s shocking to see that he gets so many supporters off of it.\u201d\n\nActivists from the Sunrise Movement disrupted other Republican candidates\u2019 rallies across the state \u2014 a small but meaningful presence of the youth\u2019s prime concerns even if the crowd didn\u2019t appreciate left-leaning ideas.\n\nShiva Rajbhandari, a University of North Carolina student who was one of the three protesters accusing DeSantis of pocketing money from oil companies, believed that the Florida governor was \u201clying to the American public.\u201d\n\n\u201c[DeSantis] undermines the reality of the climate crisis and has no plan to address the greatest threat to national security and the greatest threat to our well being,\u201d Rajbhandari said. \u201cWe see that this room is packed with 60, 70, 80-year-olds. There are no young people here... It\u2019s abundantly clear that these people don\u2019t want our vote, so I don\u2019t know why we would give it to them.\u201d\n\nRajbhandari described the Sunrise Movement as a group of young people working to end fossil fuels with the goal of establishing a Green New Deal and transition into clean energy. The organization has chapters across the Midwest and consists largely of members who are students and minors too young to vote.\n\nEmma Weber, a 16-year-old high school student from Colorado, traveled to Iowa with the organization to attend a Trump rally, and shared that the movement had been planning the protests for about a month in an attempt to make climate change a greater issue in the upcoming November elections.\n\n\u201cIn Colorado, we\u2019ve seen so many fires that are getting worse from climate change; one of them burned hundreds of homes in my community to the ground and evacuated my family,\u201d Weber said. \u201cIt\u2019s really clear that some politicians are not taking action on that and they don\u2019t care about our futures \u2014 they care about the money.\u201d\n\nOlder voters and caucus-goers displayed different priorities from DeSantis\u2019 younger audiences, marking generational divides in politics. According to Pew Research Center, views on climate change differ depending on age, with Gen Z more likely to favor shifting away from fossil fuel usage than older people.\n\nUnlike his similarly-aged peers from the Sunrise Movement, University of Northern Iowa student Stephen Blom shared that he is in favor of DeSantis\u2019 climate policies and believes the Florida governor lacks support from younger generations because they don\u2019t know him.\n\n\u201c[My peers] might just not know about him or just might have gotten misinformation from a different candidate,\u201d Blom said.\n\nAriela Lara, a 17-year-old high school student from California, conducted a similar protest at a Trump rally in Indianola before security guards grabbed her arms and escorted her out of the building.\n\n\u201cI remember how determined I was to make Trump hear me,\u201d Lara recalled in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m raising my voice so that it\u2019s known how young people deserve politicians who care about our lives and communities, protecting our generation with a plan to stop climate change, and if I have to shout from the top of my lungs in a room full of \u2018boos\u2019 and \u2018get out of here,\u2019 so be it.\u201d\n\nThe protests didn\u2019t seem to be stopping voters from caucusing, according to Joel Tenney, an evangelical Trump supporter who also works as a caucus captain for Trump.\n\n\u201cI think every Iowan considers it their obligation because we are the first in the nation,\u201d Tenney said. \u201cWe consider our obligation to show up to the caucus and the majority of those people are going to be Trump supporters, the most energetic and fiery of all the [supporters].\u201d\n```"}

WWE Superstar Seth Rollins celebrates becoming the new WWE World Heavyweight Champion at WrestleMania 31 at Levi's Stadium on Sunday, March 29, 2015 in Santa Clara, CA. WrestleMania broke the Levi\u2019s Stadium attendance record at 76,976 fans from all 50 states and 40 countries. (Don Feria/AP Images for WWE)\n\nBy Maddy Myer January 22, 2024 at 12:15 pm PST\n\nWith WWE\u2019s hype in the past few weeks, things have never looked better for the Royal Rumble. Already one of their biggest premium live events, news of certain contract expirations could spring some of the best surprise returns the company has seen to date. There are also so many active wrestlers on the roster that have been showing out over the past few months and are ready to put on an even grander show at the rumble. Leading up to the Royal Rumble, however, one of their top stars, Seth Rollins, suffered a torn MCL and partially torn meniscus. Signs are pointing that he\u2019ll be out for several weeks, but hopes are he\u2019ll be back in time for WrestleMania in April.\n\nHere are the top pro wrestling matches from the past week leading up to the Royal Rumble.\n\nSeth Rollins vs. Jinder Mahal (WWE Monday Night Raw, January 15)\nJinder Mahal recently made his return to Monday Night Raw, which meant he had something to prove. What better way to prove yourself than to take on one of the best to ever do it and current World Heavyweight Champion, Seth Rollins? It was a match that showed Mahal\u2019s mean streak, strength and, of course, heel tendencies. But as usual, Rollins didn\u2019t give up, and once he had his offense going, Mahal was no match. Rollins hits several forearms on Mahal that looked brutal, then he hit him with a crossbody off the top rope and even a senton followed by a moonsault. Sadly, it was probably the latter move that caused his knee injury. Still, Rollins finished the entire match, hitting Mahal with a falcon arrow right after that affliction. Even after Rollins was slowed down a bit by the injury and Mahal tried to win by cheating, it still wasn\u2019t enough for a Mahal victory. Rollins won the match with his signature finisher, the stomp.\n\nPete Dunne and Tyler Bate vs. Pretty Deadly (WWE Friday Night SmackDown, January 19)\nAll four men in this match are great in the ring, but in this match in particular, all eyes were on Pete Dunne. The Bruiserweight, formally known as Butch, reclaimed his original NXT name Pete Dunne to tag with Tyler Bate. Dunne hit a picture-perfect enzuigiri on Pretty Deadly\u2019s Elton Prince, then went straight to teammate Kit Wilson for a suplex and some targeted attacks. Dunne and Bate worked well as a unit, doing double-team moves and making tags to each other at the perfect time. To finish off the match, Bate dove to the outside to take care of Wilson. Simultaneously in the ring, Dunne hit Prince with his bitter end finisher to earn the victory.\n\nCarmelo Hayes and Trick Williams vs. Edris Enof\u00e9 and Malik Blade (WWE NXT, January 16)\nWhile NXT storylines don\u2019t usually have much to do with the major premium live events, it is likely that we\u2019ll see Carmelo Hayes and Trick Williams in the men\u2019s royal rumble match this year. Both men have been putting on phenomenal showings for the company as of late, and their Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic match against Edris Enof\u00e9 and Malik Blade continued to show that. Enof\u00e9 and Blade dominated the match for a good portion due to their quick offense, double-team moves and quick back-and-forth tags. At one point, each of them jumped over the ropes to take out Williams and Hayes. But once the momentum shifted back in Hayes and Williams\u2019 favor, it was pretty evident who the winners would be. Williams pulled out his perfect balance of strength and speed, while Hayes went for his flashy, yet effective moves like springboard crossbodies. Hayes hit Blade with double knees, then tagged Williams in who hit Blade with a running knee for the 1, 2, 3.\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d is a pro wrestling column by Maddy Myer that runs every Monday.\n```"}

I didn\u2019t even know what was happening. Somebody grabbed me and put me inside the hot dog restaurant next door.\u201d\n\nThis was the scene about 2:50 pm, on Friday, January 19th in the Japanese Village Plaza of Little Tokyo, when an altercation between two people escalated into five shots being fired at the Nijiya Market, leaving one person wounded. In the wake of the incident, LAPD Central Division tweeted that the \u201cvictim suffering a gunshot wound was transported to a local hospital.\u201d According to LAPD Media Relations, the victim\u2019s name has not yet been released, but he is in stable condition.\n\nOn the scene, more details emerged from eyewitnesses. A security guard on duty at the Nijiya Market, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of losing their job, described the gunman. \u201cThe suspect appeared to be a white male in his thirties, around 6 foot 3, 6 foot 4, dressed in black pants, a black hoodie and wore a black bandana covering his mouth,\u201d the guard said. \u201cHe had hazel-green eyes and wore a fanny pack across his midriff area.\u201d The security guard also said they saw the suspect follow the victim into the Japanese grocery store. LAPD Media Relations corroborated the security guard\u2019s interview as valid descriptors of the suspect.\n\n\u201cThe suspect pulled out a gun and pistol-whipped the victim near the registers,\u201d the guard said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I saw the suspect fire shots in the victim\u2019s direction before escaping. So I started shouting at people to run, and everyone ran out of the market.\u201d\n\nA bullet hole was left in the Nijiya Market floor after the suspect opened fire. (Photo by Aditya Thiyag)\n\nThe turmoil following the shooting caused a lot of businesses to close up shop early on Friday. Foot traffic was down, restaurants were nearly empty, and the only sounds that could be heard were the faint noises of cars driving past the village plaza. Some workers remained in the area, continuing to process the harrowing incident that had happened hours prior.\n\nMatthew Calderon, an employee at a local sushi restaurant, was shocked, as he had briefly interacted with the victim and his friends before the shooting. \u201cI gave the victim and his friends takeout from our restaurant literally 10 minutes before I heard the shots,\u201d Calderon said. \u201cI later saw him get wheeled out by the paramedics, and his friends all walked up to me. They said that they were not near him when they heard the gunshots. It all just happened so fast.\u201d\n\nSybil Cerezo had been well into their shift as a cashier at the Yamazaki Bakery when they saw people running their way. Cerezo herded people into the bakery as their coworkers hid behind the store counter, where they waited for over thirty minutes. \u201cIt was as if time had stopped,\u201d Cerezo said. \u201cThe atmosphere in the store was so palpable right until we got the sign from security that it was clear and okay to get up. I never imagined I would one day be caught in the middle of something so frightening.\u201d\n\nFurther down the plaza, Luciano Pe\u00f1a hid with bated breath behind the closed doors of the local business he worked at after the shots went off, peering through the window to see people searching for a safe place to take shelter in. \u201cI saw an older lady get pushed aside onto the ground, and people were just running all around her,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said. \u201cSomeone pulled her into a business next to where she fell before closing their doors. Eventually, paramedics came, and they wheeled her out on a stretcher.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Little Tokyo has had an armed suspect disrupt the plaza. In the summer of 2023, two armed suspects sprinted through the area following a high-speed chase with the LAPD. Pe\u00f1a said that being present for the incident last summer was enough for him to become far more vigilant afterward. \u201cI always carry the keys to the store with me, and I\u2019m always walking around to monitor the store in case something like that happens again,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said. \u201cSo today, when this [shooting] happened, I was prepared, and I quickly closed the door.\u201d\n\nHowever, not all of the vendors at the store were as anxious about the shooting incident. An employee at a local plushie store said that he saw Friday\u2019s shooting as a freak accident. They spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for their workplace\u2019s reputation. \u201cLittle Tokyo has become more popular, especially within the last two years,\u201d the employee said. \u201cI think it\u2019s inevitable that when you have an increase in the amount of traffic and the amount of people that you\u2019re also going to have an increase in the amount of incidents. My comfort level hasn\u2019t changed because of this, and I don\u2019t plan to leave.\u201d\n\nAs these issues arise and Little Tokyo expands its appeal, other businesses in the area have grown concerned about the safety of their community. Cerezo said that their biggest question in the wake of Friday\u2019s shooting was the likelihood of another dangerous incident happening in such close proximity to employees and customers. \u201cThe community within the plaza and its immediate vicinity are shaken up, and you can\u2019t help but wonder, \u2018what if it happens inside an establishment next?\u2019\u201d said Cerezo. \u201cI hope we\u2019re able to move forward by continuing to be there for one another with open ears and arms. It\u2019s just unfortunate that in the world we live in today we constantly have to look over our shoulders and be expected to be aware of our surroundings at all times.\u201d\n\nEmployees within the plaza had split reactions to the shooting overall but were unified in their wish to see visitors and vendors return to their lives in the bustling plaza. Raymond Park, a waiter at a local ramen shop within the plaza, said that the biggest thing that incidents like this had taught him was that people just want to move forward with their lives as soon as they can. \u201cWe just need to have a peace of mind [as] a community,\u201d said Park. \u201cIt\u2019s super important that that happened, but that nothing has really changed for us... You know, everything is just normal. We carry on with our everyday lives and just kind of pray and hope that it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nThe next day, the Japanese Village Plaza was operating at full capacity. (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nAfter the last restaurant had closed up on that desolate Friday night, the following day brought the exact energy that Park and the Little Tokyo community had wished for. Couples played crane games, families lined up to enter cute plushie stores, and local vendors beckoned tourists to buy their homemade goods. The plaza\u2019s reputation as the beating heart of Little Tokyo had been swiftly restored, and both tourists and employees were reinvigorated by Saturday morning.\n\nA large part of this, according to Park, can be attributed to the resilience of those working in the plaza. He said that the sense of community they all share is what allows them to push forward day by day. \u201cEverybody knows each other, you know, we\u2019ve all been here for years,\u201d Park said. \u201cThe mentality is that it happened \u2013 let\u2019s get over it, let\u2019s continue. The Little Tokyo community is strong and tight knit, so if something does happen, we have a shoulder to lean on. We know we can put our backs against other businesses because they\u2019ll always have our backs as well.\u201d\n```"}

Thornton has officially announced his retirement from the NHL following a 24-year career as one of the game's top playmakers. The 44-year-old hadn't played since the 2021-22 season with Florida but hadn't made an official declaration about his plans until releasing a video on Saturday, Oct. 28, 2023, through the Sharks. (AP Photo/Josie Lepe, File)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner January 22, 2024 at 11:38 am PST\n\nOften recognized by his intimidating brown beard, \u201cJumbo\u201d Joe Thornton was a force to be reckoned with for almost a quarter-century and a San Jose Sharks staple for 15 seasons. While they never hoisted the Stanley Cup, the San Jose Sharks were electric in the 2000s and 2010s, consistently qualifying for the playoffs with a deep roster. From Thornton to Joe Pavelski to Patrick Marleau, one could always count on San Jose to either win the Pacific Division or finish a close second.\n\nThornton is the Sharks\u2019 all-time leader in assists with 804 and his 1,055 point total only trails Marleau for the franchise record. For the franchise\u2019s first 30 seasons, the Sharks didn\u2019t have a single number retired before Marleau became the first one to receive the honor during the 2022-23 season. Last week, however \u2014 the Sharks announced that Thornton would have his No. 19 retired \u2014 etching the former center\u2019s name in Sharks history forever.\n\nThornton actually spent seven full years as a Boston Bruin before the Sharks landed him in a blockbuster trade during the 2005 season. From then on, San Jose won four of the next six division titles, with Thornton leading the league in points and assists in 2005-06 and pushing his team through the playoffs. Jumbo Joe\u2019s Sharks tenure started off with him winning both the Art Ross Trophy and Hart Memorial Trophy in 2006 and he never looked back.\n\nThornton became captain of the Sharks in 2010 and didn\u2019t take his leadership role lightly, constantly fighting opposing players to stick up for his team. While the Sharks constantly fell short of the Stanley Cup Finals, they were always so close, and it felt like it was just a matter of time before they won big.\n\nIn 2015-16, Thornton totalled 82 points despite only having 65 the year prior. San Jose was coming off its first year not qualifying for the playoffs in over a decade, and was destined to get back to the promised lands. The then-36 year old\u2019s dynamic passing ability not only helped carry the Sharks back to the playoffs, but this time, to uncharted waters: the Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nThornton\u2019s team-leading seven assists in San Jose\u2019s tight Western Conference Finals series victory over the St. Louis Blues in six games continued to show his resilience, even with so many games played on the season. While the Sharks failed to win their first Stanley Cup, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games, Thornton was part of a historic Sharks team that did something past team\u2019s never accomplished.\n\nThornton was awarded Sharks Player of the Year for the third time in 2016, which emphasized his critical role on that incredible runner-up squad. Thornton would depart the Sharks following the team\u2019s disappointing 2019-20 season when they missed the playoffs following yet another Western Conference Finals berth the year before. He would attempt to contend for a Cup with the Toronto Maple Leafs the next season before joining the Florida Panthers in 2021-22 for what would be his last season.\n\nWhile he failed to win a Stanley Cup, Thornton\u2019s 24-year career will forever give him legendary status in the NHL. While the exact date for Joe Thornton\u2019s number retirement hasn\u2019t been specified yet, expect a huge celebration for the fan favorite, similar to Marleau\u2019s last season. In the wake of what could be San Jose\u2019s worst season in over 30 years, the announcement has surely generated plenty of excitement for otherwise downtrodden Sharks fans. While the Sharks are now only a shell of what they once were, fans can forever reminisce about the glory days of Thornton and his decade and a half of leadership and poise in teal. Starting next season, all they will have to do is look up to the rafters to remind themselves of Thornton\u2019s reign.\n```"}

(Photo by Elijah Patterson)\n\nBy Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier January 22, 2024 at 9:00 am PST\n\nAfter Lincoln Riley made the decision to fire former defensive coordinator Alex Grinch following USC\u2019s 52-42 loss to Washington on November 4, he had to rebuild his entire defensive staff. After the regular season ended, Donte Williams accepted the defensive backs coaching position at Georgia, while Roy Manning and Brian Odom were let go by USC. With four defensive vacancies to fill, Riley started with Grinch\u2019s successor and looked for someone who had success in turning struggling defenses into units that could compete with college football\u2019s best offenses.\n\nOn December 1, Riley hired D\u2019Anton Lynn. In 2023, Lynn was UCLA\u2019s defensive coordinator who turned the Bruins\u2019 defense into the best in the Pac-12 and the 10th-best nationally in yards allowed per game. Lynn also helped develop senior defensive lineman Laiatu Latu, who had 49 total tackles and 13 sacks in 2023, into one of the best edge rushers in the country. Prior to his one-year stint at UCLA, Lynn worked in the NFL for nine years after getting his start coaching as an intern for the New York Jets in 2014.\n\nNine days later, Riley brought on former North Dakota State head coach Matt Entz as the linebackers coach; Entz was also named the assistant head coach for defense. During his time in charge of the Bison, Entz went 60-11 and won the FCS Championship in 2019 and 2021. In the two years that NDSU won national championships, the American Football Coaches Association voted Entz the FCS National Coach of the Year. He has seen eight former Bison drafted to the NFL and has coached 20 All-Americans.\n\nDoug Belk, the former associate head coach and defensive coordinator for the University of Houston, will serve as the Trojans\u2019 secondary coach after being hired on December 16. During his five years with the Cougars, Belk coached 13 All-American Athletic Conference players from 2019 to 2022. In 2023, he had eight players earn All-Big 12 honors in Houston\u2019s first year as a member of the conference. He also saw five Cougars get selected in the NFL Draft.\n\nRiley\u2019s final defensive hire was Eric Henderson, who was named USC\u2019s co-defensive coordinator, run game coordinator and defensive line coach on January 15. Henderson has spent the last five years working for the Los Angeles Rams, where he served as the teams\u2019 defensive line coach and run game coordinator. During his time with the Rams, Henderson\u2019s defenses have consistently been among the top units in the NFL, in part due to his ability to develop defensive tackle Aaron Donald into one of the league\u2019s best defenders. Donald is now a three-time winner of the NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 defensive line was most notable during the 2021 season, as it ranked third in sacks and fifth in tackles for loss en route to winning Super Bowl LVI. After winning the Super Bowl, Henderson was also voted the John Teerlinck Defensive Line Coach of the Year by his NFL peers.\n\nShaun Nua, who served as an interim co-defensive coordinator following Grinch\u2019s dismissal, was the lone defensive coach retained by USC and will serve as the defensive ends coach after previously coaching the defensive line. In 2022, his first year with the Trojans, Nua helped turn defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu into one of the best defensive players in college football. Under Nua\u2019s guidance, Tuipulotu led the country with 13.5 sacks and was named the Polynesian College Football Player of the Year, the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year, the defensive Morris Trophy winner and a unanimous First Team All-American selection. Prior to USC, Nua worked at Michigan, Arizona State, Navy and BYU (his alma mater). Nua was also a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers team that won Super Bowl XL as a player.\n\nWith the new defensive staff finalized, USC will now look to solve all of the issues that have plagued its defense for the last two years as it prepares for its first season as a member of the Big Ten Conference.\n```"}

January 22, 2024 at 8:00 am PST\n\nGrowing up as a young Black girl, I gravitated towards characters on screen who either looked like, or reminded me of myself and my community. Stars like Raven-Symon\u00e9, Kyla Pratt, Keke Palmer and China Anne McClain were pivotal figures for myself and other young Black girls to look to for representation in film and television during the 2000s and 2010s.\n\nBut apart from these select individuals, Black representation in lead roles has been a continuous issue within Hollywood. Black actors and actresses are more often than not considered for recurring or small supporting roles, many of which fall within the Black sidekick trope, the character used for comedic relief or the butt of stereotypical jokes. The privilege of being a lead actor or actress in a television show or film is something most talent in Black Hollywood could only hope for.\n\nHowever, within the last decade there\u2019s been a significant turn towards addressing this issue of Black representation on screen. With the success of projects like ABC\u2019s \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d and \u201cBlack-ish,\u201d it\u2019s safe to debunk the inaccurate stigma that Black-led projects don\u2019t perform well.\n\nThis year\u2019s Emmy Award show served as a testament to the contributions Black talent can make in the industry, when put in the position to do so.\n\nThis year\u2019s Primetime Emmy Awards was special because of the team producing the live event. According to Essence, this year was the first time in the history of the Emmys that the awards show was produced by an all-Black team of executive producers, led by Jesse Collins Entertainment. This coupled with the show being hosted by actor and comedian Anthony Anderson gave way for this year\u2019s show to be a special one for fans of Black talent in Hollywood both on and off screen. This level of intention for inclusivity of Black talent preceding the production truly set the tone for the evening.\n\nThis year\u2019s Emmys was filled with historic wins and heartfelt acceptance speeches. First and foremost Quinta Brunson, executive producer of ABC\u2019s \u201cAbbott Elementary,\u201d won Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Janine Teagues in \u201cAbbott Elementary.\u201d Brunson is the first Black woman to win this award in over 40 years, with the last win by a Black woman being Isabel Sanford in 1981 for her role in \u201cThe Jeffersons.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Ayo Edebiri won her first Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Sydney Adamu in \u201cThe Bear.\u201d Edebiri became the third black woman to ever win this award, followed by Sheryl Lee Ralph in 2020 and Jack\u00e9e Harry in 1987. As if these two respective wins weren\u2019t historic enough, this year was also the first time two Black women won Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in the same award year.\n\nThe sweep of Black Emmy wins did not stop there, as Niecy Nash-Betts took home an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for her portrayal of Glenda Cleveland in \u201cDahmer.\u201d Days prior at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards Show, Keke Palmer also made history as the first woman in 15 years to win an Emmy for Outstanding Host for a Game Show for her work on NBC\u2019s \u201cPassword.\u201d\n\nAs the contributions of Black talent in Hollywood become more apparent, it\u2019s important to highlight areas in need of improvement. According to research conducted by McKinsey & Company, less than 6 percent of the writers, directors, and producers of US-produced films are Black. Furthermore, their study also stated that 87-percent of TV executives and 92 percent of film executives are white. Addressing concerns of diversity within off-screen talent is equally as important as it is to address within on-screen talent. It\u2019s inspiring to witness current Black talent receive recognition, as they pave the way for more to follow.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/01/21/even-backing-trump-iowa-republicans-complain-about-his-age/", "response": "```\nEven backing Trump, Iowa Republicans complain about his age\n\nMARSHALLTOWN, Iowa \u2014 Iowa caucusgoers on Monday chose between Vivek Ramaswamy, 38, Ron DeSantis, 45, Nikki Haley, 51, and Donald Trump, 78. Even though Trump was the decisive victor here, interviews with five different Iowa voters attending four candidate campaign events ahead of the big day shed light on many voters\u2019 desire for someone new and younger than the current president or the last one. Right now, President Joe Biden, 81, is the oldest president in history. If Trump returns to the White House, he would inherit that title. Many Iowans said that is an outcome that they would like to avoid, and instead want to bring in someone younger with fresh ideas to serve the country.\n\n\u201cTrump isn\u2019t quite as diplomatic as the other candidates,\u201d said Cory Wandling, 62, an Ames resident and a computer programming consultant who attended a DeSantis event in Ames on Jan. 11. \u201cThough I don\u2019t blame him for it, since the FBI are coming at him very hard. I just think we need someone new and fresh.\u201d Wandling said that he has enjoyed the other candidates, but will caucus for DeSantis. \u201cWith DeSantis, we have a chance to do all the things that Trump promised us, like how he said he would get rid of Obamacare. He didn\u2019t do that. He said he would decrease the national debt, yet didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Wandling said. \u201cSo I\u2019m hoping DeSantis can fix that and tackle the immigration crisis which is causing chaos.\u201d\n\nSixty-seven-year-old Paul Stone, a retired IT technician, shared similar concerns, saying he voted for Trump before, but believes he now has too much baggage. Stone said he would like to see DeSantis as the Republican pick, seeing him as someone who has \u201cdone well\u201d in Florida and is more capable than Biden or Trump. \u201cI would like to see Trump being displaced in this caucus,\u201d Stone said, speaking a few days before DeSantis claimed a distant second place in the race. \u201cI think there are a lot of unfair things that have been thrown at him, but DeSantis can carry his torch and I rather Trump be separated from the caucus to deal with his crap and not involve us.\u201d (DeSantis ended his campaign and endorsed Trump Sunday.)\n\nAn August 2023 poll by the Wall Street Journal found that 49% of Americans consider Trump not \u201cmentally up for the job of president,\u201d while 60% believe Biden is unfit. A national exit poll in 2020 found that over 50% of those 45 and older had voted for Trump. Now some voters in that age group want a younger leader. This isn\u2019t only a concern for seniors. Younger voters have shown to be eager to get a younger voice leading the Oval Office. Both Trump and Biden have less than half of their support from voters between the ages of 18 and 34. About 46% of folks in that age group support Trump and 42% support Biden according to a poll by NBC News in November 2023.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m young. Trump is wounded in this fight, with the lawsuits, whereas Vivek is young and ready to kind of take our country to the next step,\u201d Noah Hermanson, a 21-year-old student majoring in dentistry at the University of Iowa, said on caucus day. \u201cFor Biden, we have to worry if he even is mentally capable of doing the job and Trump\u2019s getting up there, so us Republicans should worry about the same thing, it\u2019s a concern.\u201d Hermanson was referring to businessman Ramaswamy, who suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump soon after a disappointing caucus finish in fourth place.\n\nAnother college student studying engineering, Diego Ortiz, 20, also turned in his ballot at the caucus in Marshalltown with his mark next to Ramaswamy\u2019s name. \u201cI think someone like Vivek understands us, our point of view, since they\u2019re someone closer to our age, I think he gets us,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I\u2019m not voting Democrat, so we will see [who wins].\u201d\n\nDespite wanting to see other Republican candidates shine this election season, flipping to a Democratic candidate is not in the cards, many caucusgoers say. \u201cMy wife and I have attended a lot of Vivek\u2019s events and he pinpoints the exact problems we are facing. He is smart, successful and young, [and] can both inform and educate us on what the media hides,\u201d said Davin Roberts, 57, just before caucusing in Marshalltown. \u201cIf Vivek doesn\u2019t make it to the [general election] and it\u2019s a Trump-Biden rematch, then I\u2019d lean towards Trump since I wouldn\u2019t vote for Biden.\u201d Roberts, who works in sales, added that he felt Trump left office with a lot of things broken and with a lot of unfulfilled promises, yet he\u2019d still prefer to vote for him than for a Democrat. That\u2019s a similar consensus to many voters \u2014 anything but another Democratic presidency.\n```"}

(Photo by Robert Westermann)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nJanuary 21, 2024 at 3:54 pm PST\n\nFollowing a 20-point blowout loss to No. 20 Utah on Friday, No. 6 USC (13-3, 3-3 Pac-12) was looking to avoid consecutive losses for the first time this season. With No. 3 Colorado (16-2, 6-1) on the schedule next, it wasn\u2019t going to be easy. While the Trojans gave the Buffaloes a run for their money for the entirety of the game, Colorado controlled the final moments of the fourth quarter to win 63-59.\n\nFreshman guard JuJu Watkins led USC with 20 points and four steals before fouling out with 5:50 remaining in the game. Her ejection was critical, as the Trojans trailed by just three at the time. Without their leader, the Trojans would only muster two field goals the rest of the way.\n\nWatkins started the contest off strong, scoring 12 of USC\u2019s 18 first-quarter points. Her electric play from mid-range and inside, though, was constantly matched by Colorado\u2019s graduate forward Quay Miller, who dominated inside. Miller was perfect in the first frame and went on to have a 19-point and 12-rebound double-double performance to lead her team.\n\n\u201cI thought the team rallied, we haven\u2019t played too many minutes without [Watkins],\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cI thought others did a good job keeping us in a situation to have a chance to win against a really good team on the road.\u201d\n\nRedshirt sophomore guard Taylor Bigby complemented the Trojans\u2019 first-quarter success by adding eight points in the second. While Watkins went cold in the second quarter \u2014 missing all five of her attempts from the field \u2014 Bigby\u2019s ability to get to the free throw line on top of hitting a slick 3-point jumper early in the period kept USC in the game. The Trojans trailed by two at the half.\n\nGraduate guard McKenzie Forbes was the Trojans\u2019 third-leading scorer with 11 points; she hit two 3-pointers early in the third quarter to swing the momentum back to USC. However, when the Trojans started to pull away, the Buffaloes always responded. Following a Watkins layup that put USC up six in the penultimate frame, Miller immediately replied with a pair of 3-point shots of her own to even the score.\n\nA punchy, back-and-forth end to the third quarter previewed the intensity that would come in the fourth. Colorado graduate guard Jaylyn Sherrod put together a solid 17-point performance, including eight in the fourth quarter to give the Buffaloes the edge.\n\nWithout Watkins, the Trojans had to rely on others to take the game back. Down four with 14 seconds remaining, graduate guard Kayla Padilla answered the call with a downtown prayer to cut the deficit to one. However, with a chance to tie the game on the Trojans\u2019 next possession, a missed layup from Forbes with hardly any time on the clock sealed USC\u2019s fate, and Colorado avoided the upset.\n\n\u201cWe should be disappointed that we didn\u2019t win, but not discouraged \u2014 that was a great basketball game,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe know we can do better, but the confidence levels should grow for us as we\u2019re put in these situations, and we\u2019ll figure out how to respond.\u201d\n\nWhile getting swept to the Rocky Mountain schools was disappointing, the Trojans will have a chance to get back on track at home, where they\u2019re undefeated this season. Narrowly losing to Colorado was heartbreaking, but without Watkins for over half of the fourth quarter, USC still put up a good fight without their primary scorer.\n\n\u201cThis was probably the toughest three-game stretch anyone will have, UCLA, at Utah, at Colorado,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nThe Washington State Cougars (14-5, 3-3) will head south to face the Trojans this Friday at 7 p.m. at Galen Center.\n```"}

In fact, for the first 15 minutes of the movie, it was impossible to think about anything aside from how grotesque these creatures are, with their sunken eyes and protruding foreheads, hands and feet so chapped you\u2019re not sure if they still have any feeling. There is dirt caked into every crevice and wrinkle, and food is crusted into their bearded chins. So what did this movie do to make me care so much about them by the end? Brothers Nathan and David Zellner have created something truly masterful with \u201cSasquatch Sunset,\u201d a film that explores the life of the sasquatch when he is not tramping across the background of a photograph. Facetiously, when introducing the movie to the Jan. 20 premiere audience at Sundance, David touted, \u201cWe really did an anthropological deep dive into the lives of sasquatches, and you should know that everything you see them do in this film is 100% accurate. Everything....\u201d The audience members nervously giggled, knowing they were in for a treat. Because of the ability of the cast (Nathan Zellner, Riley Keough, Jesse Eisenberg and Christophe Zajac-Denek) to bring such emotional depth, brilliant physicality and complete conviction to their roles, this inexplicable film triumphs against all odds. It follows a troop of sasquatches as they roam the wilds of Northern California, where the film was shot. And being sasquatches as they are, the film has absolutely no dialogue. But no shortage of grunts. The lives of this band of bigfoots are told in four chapters: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. Committed to rigorously detailing the sasquatches\u2019 daily routine, the Zellners manage to extract human truths and heartfelt lessons. The comedy is imaginative, unrestrained, and completely unforgettable. Viewers will find it striking that the actors were able to emote so effectively underneath the layers of prosthetic makeup required for the project. When asked about this challenge at the post-premiere Q&A, Keough said, \u201cWhat you feel like you look like with the mask on isn\u2019t actually what you look like,\u201d explaining that they would use a mirror to practice their sasquatch faces. Zajec-Denek added, \u201cI realized that certain muscles wouldn\u2019t move certain parts of my face and other muscles would, so it took a second to figure that out,\u201d to which Keough quipped, \u201cIt\u2019s like Botox!\u201d The crowd laughed. Eisenberg talked about how the role challenged everything he was taught to do as an actor, suddenly having to add 30% more to each movement for it to be conveyed through the suit: \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re over-acting. It was a struggle for me.\u201d When he spoke about first receiving the script, though, he remembered feeling a certain urgency. \u201cThis has to happen,\u201d he recalled thinking, \u201cand if that means getting into the suit, that\u2019ll be the last resort, but I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Riley Keough and Jesse Eisenberg, stars of \"Sasquatch Sunset\" at Sundance press line. \n\nThis movie is completely singular. The Zellners have constructed something inspired and new. As much as it might be about a band of beasts, the film is quite human. Observing human-like creatures living as animals do, reflects on how our species has evolved; how technology and shelter, comfort and convenience have shaped our experience of the world and disconnected us from nature. The exceptional director of photography, Michael Gioulakis, captured the scenery of Humboldt County with a keen understanding of its majesty. Most notably, no CGI was used, which means all of the animals that are seen \u2013 skunk, deer, mountain lion \u2013 were completely real. David Zellner spoke about how they opted to let each animal react and engage naturally, which resulted in some jaw-dropping shots of the wildlife. \u201cSasquatch Sunset\u201d is a remarkable movie \u2014 difficult to describe and, at times, difficult to view, but completely captivating from start to finish. It is an insane concept thoughtfully executed and the result is a ludicrous, filthy, bawdy and commanding film that sincerely gets to the heart of what it means to be...a sasquatch. The film is being distributed by Bleeker Street Films and is expected to hit select theaters on Apr. 12, and nationwide Apr. 19.\n```"}

In a mock-government program comprised of 500 girls in Missouri, some of these bright high-achievers start to question the very program they worked so hard to get into.\n\nRarely do we see a mirror held at just the right angle that reflects properly upon an issue as massive as sexism. Yet, in typical McBaine and Moss fashion, this film is a sharp depiction of the country\u2019s condition wherein no person, issue or concept is painted with a single brush. Through a select cast of characters, the audience is taken through the gut-wrenching roller coaster of what it means to be female in America today. Moreover, we are shown something even more jarring than the blisters from a day of high heels: the future isn\u2019t on track to be too different.\n\nThe girls are told quite frequently by counselors and leaders at Girls State that the Boys State program is completely different, and thus should never be weighed with theirs, declaring it \u201cincompatible for comparison.\u201d But the year of filming, 2022, is the first in the 80-plus year history of the program that both Boys State and Girls State will run on the same campus. When the two groups interact (which happens rarely, according to the film), the shots reveal the boys flexing their muscles at the girls or hollering with each other (one makes faces at the camera in the corner, and another dumps water on himself for laughs). But through the glimpses of the boys\u2019 actual program, they are participating in rigorous athletic training or listening to a guest speaker, including one that discussed abortion as \u201cmurder.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t long before the girls begin to notice the vast differences in the programming. While the film doesn\u2019t exactly clarify the structure of the program, it is almost inconsequential. The spine of the film is moreso the friendships between the girls, especially those who couldn\u2019t be more different from one another. Shy, reserved Nisha and bubbly, outgoing Brooke try out for the same Girls State \u201cgovernment\u201d position, but there is no competitiveness between the two. While they each have their own ambitions and goals, the relationship is so palpably sweet and innocent.\n\nArguably even more inspirational are the relationships portrayed between girls of drastically different beliefs \u2014 relationships that American adults don\u2019t seem to be capable of echoing frequently. One of the protagonists, Emily, is a sharp and conservative Christian with a hard-as-nails exterior. She\u2019ll be president by 2040, she assures the audience at the beginning of the film. But rather than use her beliefs to isolate herself, she encourages conversations with her more liberal peers. One of said peers, Maddie, definitely doesn\u2019t agree with Emily\u2019s policy beliefs, but she admires Emily\u2019s tenacity and seemingly unbreakable strength. By the end of the week, the pair cries at being separated; they are still able to find common humanity, and it is an incredibly refreshing and heartwarming relationship to watch and take part in.\n\nOf the seven girls highlighted in the film, Emily\u2019s story will particularly resonate with anyone who has set incredibly high standards for themselves from a young age. The preacher\u2019s daughter rattles off an astounding amount of extracurriculars that would alarm top Ivy League students. Plus, she aspires to be governor of Girls State, campaigning mercilessly up and down the cafeteria and on social media. It\u2019s heartbreaking to watch as she drops her plate of food before the campaign speeches and implodes, humiliated to be crying in public because it doesn\u2019t align with the tough image she is convinced makes her a worthy opponent to a man.\n\nIt raises another difficult set of questions: who told us that crying was a feminine trait? Or that femininity was inherently weak? The other throughline of the film is the political climate, which the girls frequently make a topic of conversation \u2014 including climate change, reproductive rights and mental health. At the time of filming, word was out about the Supreme Court\u2019s draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade. During the second half of the film, the girls are able to take part in a mock trial regarding a fake abortion case; but it doesn\u2019t feel very \u201cpretend\u201d as the fate of all of their futures hangs over the experience like a dark cloud. Six days after Girls\u2019 State ended, Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nThough this isn\u2019t news as we watch the film, the onscreen text is a punch to the gut. I\u2019m not a huge Taylor Swift fan (I know), but the ending hits like a ton of bricks when her song, \u201cThe Man,\u201d plays over the credits: \u201cI\u2019m so sick of running as fast as I can, wondering if I\u2019d get there quicker if I was a man.\u201d\n\nThe girls\u2019 journey to prove that injustice and inequality exist within the program \u2014 and the world itself \u2014 before they can even start to fight their own battles and chase their dreams is a perfect demonstration of the barriers that exist when it comes to gender inequality. The film does an incredible job representing diverse people and opinions, and ultimately comes down to the extreme harm that polarization causes when prioritized over humanization. It\u2019s incredible just how devoted and diligent Moss and McBaine are when they are able to ethically represent the stories of hundreds of people, and somehow they do so carefully and successfully.\n\nNo girl is portrayed as \u201cjust\u201d a Democrat or Republican, harsh or sweet, mean or nice. As usual, when it comes to social or political issues, writing off one side of your audience will never spark change. This is something the filmmakers seem to deeply understand, and the message resonates in an impactful, painful and emotional way as we learn this message through the lens of American girlhood.\n\nApple Original Films will release \u201cGirls State\u201d on April 5.\n```"}

But the cast is an ensemble including Ben Mendelsohn, Normani, Dominique Thorne, Jay Ellis, Jack Champion, Ji-young Yoo, and the late Angus Cloud. At its Jan. 19 premiere, there were so many attendees that the entire standby list and even many ticket holders were turned away. I was finally able to see it at a press screening the following day but had to get there more than two hours early to secure a spot. With all that buzz, it\u2019s hard to imagine that the film could live up to, but there was excitement in the air.\n\nCo-directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden, who got their start with the 2006 Sundance premiere of \u201cHalf Nelson,\u201d brought an imaginative playfulness to their newest film, incorporating Tarantino-like influences from comic books and pulp noir. The film begins with a voiceover and a roll-up, the opening crawl that is reminiscent of each episode of the Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s and 1940s, which George Lucas also famously paid homage to in \u201cStar Wars.\u201d The year is 1987, so the film, with Atari fonts and neon colors, embraces the video game aesthetic of the era.\n\nOn the Sundance press line, Pascal talked about how it felt like an \u201cenergetic memoir of a certain city,\u201d and the nostalgia of that time from the perspective of Fleck, who was raised in Berkeley. Chiming in, Ellis roared, \u201cThe cars, the costumes, the jewelry...it\u2019s a vibe.\u201d\n\nThe film is broken into four vignettes, each one introducing a new set of underdogs, but all with the same common enemy \u2014 neo-Nazis who are terrorizing the city of Oakland. A dark horse could come out swinging from anywhere: the underground punk scene, two women breaking into the male-dominated rap industry, or one beloved basketball player. The spirit of the underdog is infused into the storyline in both subtle and very non-subtle ways \u2014 a thrilling Bay Area native cameos in act three to underline these themes by playing a video store manager who quizzes Pascal\u2019s character on the top five best \u201cunderdog\u201d movies in cinematic history.\n\nFirst, we meet Yoo and Champion as teenagers leaving a screening of \u201cThe Lost Boys\u201d before heading to a punk show, a night that seems on par with their usual routine. A group of neo-Nazi skinheads march up to the venue with the sole intention of beating everyone up, on par with what seems to be their usual routine as well. The group of pacifists must decide if they are willing to put their anti-violence beliefs aside to stand up to these racist bullies once and for all.\n\nIn part two, Normani and Thorne are introduced as Barbie and Entice, a rap duo going by the name Danger Zone. After the same screening, they are approached by a producer who invites them to show up for an open mic session with rapper Too Short (the artist responsible for the song that inspired the film\u2019s title). Barbie is increasingly intrigued by Psytopics, a program that pops up in ads all over town, promising to help people harness the power of the mind.\n\nThe third chapter formally introduces Pascal\u2019s Clint, a retiring debt collector who uses unsavory methods to squeeze his clients. He is seen walking by in a diner in part one. He is a soon-to-be father and a happy husband until one day something goes wrong.\n\nThe finale centers on a criminal cop, played chillingly by Mendolsohn, who enacts a plan to rob a list of celebrity basketball stars on the night of their big game. Cloud plays his hired henchman sent to the home of NBA legend Sleepy Floyd, played by Ellis in his most illustrious role yet. What he doesn\u2019t know is that Sleepy got his nickname because he is often seen meditating as part of his dedication to Psytopics.\n\n\u201cFreaky Tales\u201d is an entertaining film that feels like an instant classic. It is easy to watch, evocative of cult exploitation movies of the era in which it was set, and begs to be watched in a group setting. Between the soundtrack, the costuming, and the gore \u2014 notably a lot, everything is exceptionally stylized and vibrant. And as we learn, revenge is a dish best served in yellow leather with a sword.\n```"}

(Photo by Micah Chow)\n\nBy Molly Phan\nJanuary 20, 2024 at 4:30 pm PST\n\nUSC men\u2019s basketball (8-11, 2-6 Pac-12) closed out its three-game road trip with an 82-67 loss to Arizona State (11-7, 5-2) at Desert Financial Arena on Saturday afternoon. The loss in Tempe, Arizona, was the fourth straight defeat for the Trojans and brought their record away from home this season to 1-6.\n\nComing off of an 82-67 loss to the No. 12 Arizona Wildcats on Wednesday night, the Trojans were given the opportunity to prove themselves, but with their backcourt duo of fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis and freshman guard Isaiah Collier out with injuries, they lacked leadership, creativity and ball handlers on the court.\n\nThe matchup remained close for most of the first half until the last few minutes, when Arizona State\u2019s high energy and change of pace brought the Sun Devils to a seven-point lead at half time. However, in the second half, the Trojans were unable to fall into a rhythm and struggled to compete with the Sun Devils\u2019 quick transition offense.\n\nThe Trojans were led by sophomore forward Vincent Iwuchukwu, who had 14 points and 12 rebounds, earning his first career double-double. Other notable contributors include junior guard Kobe Johnson, with 13 points, and freshman guard Bronny James, who did not seem to be bothered by the boos coming from the arena when he was in possession of the ball.\n\nAccording to USC head coach Andy Enfield, redshirt senior forward Joshua Morgan, who is still recovering from an illness, was a defensive leader on the court. \u201cJoshua was outstanding defensively,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cHe\u2019s still not nearly at full strength. He\u2019s still about 14 pounds underweight with his sickness, but he gave everything he had. I thought Joshua played great.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the Trojans\u2019 efforts were not enough to keep Arizona State in the half court, and what really killed them was their excessive turnovers, especially in the backcourt. USC gave up a season high 22 turnovers in Saturday\u2019s game, which was detrimental since the Sun Devils thrive in transition. Led by star junior guard Frankie Collins, Arizona State earned 26 fast-break points and 24 points off of turnovers.\n\n\u201cI thought we played pretty good offensive basketball, other than the turnovers,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cI thought our center position played the best of everybody, and that\u2019s encouraging. Vince and Josh had 22 points and 15 rebounds between them, so that\u2019s outstanding. They did their job.\u201d\n\nDue to the Sun Devils\u2019 defensive pressure and the absence of USC\u2019s key guards, it was evident that the Trojans lost confidence, and, therefore, were unable to take care of the ball.\n\nDespite its losing streak, USC men\u2019s basketball looks forward to its three-game stretch at home over the next few weeks. As the injured Trojans work toward recovery, the team will prepare for a crosstown showdown against UCLA at the Galen Center on Saturday at 5 p.m.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko)\n\nBy Valerie Fang January 20, 2024 at 3:15 pm PST\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d is a column by Valerie Fang dedicated to the sport of figure skating. Welcome back to In the Loop! Hope you had a restorative break and an excelsior start of 2024. I have missed writing about figure skating. This time, I thought we could do something different to kick off a new semester of coverage. Last December, the IOC (International Olympic Committee) officially announced their approval of Individual Neutral Athletes\u2019 eligibility for Paris 2024. Shortly after, I received a reader\u2019s email inquiring about the status of Russia and Belarus\u2019 participation in international figure skating competitions in 2024, namely this spring\u2019s World Championships. Having the reader\u2019s permission, below is our correspondence in which I share my answer and some other thoughts on what the IOC\u2019s new move means for Russia and Belarus.\n\nQ: Has there been any further clarity regarding the controversial measure of Russian skaters and their coaches participating in events in 2024? Relying on your expertise and journalistic experience, do you believe these measures will be in place for the next skating worlds in March?\n\nA: I assumed that the news about the IOC officially approving Russian and Belarusian athletes competing in Paris 2024 was what prompted your inquiry. Although the IOC has issued this formal approval, it\u2019s still up to the international federations to green-light individual athletes. I have been on the lookout for any communications from the International Skating Union on this matter, and it seems like they have not put out a response yet. Considering Russia\u2019s long dominance in the sport, I think the ISU will allow Russian and Belarusian skaters to come back, but most likely after this season and the Valieva (RUS) doping case is concluded. Allowing Russia to return to figure skating will allow Valieva to compete internationally again when CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport) still hasn\u2019t decided on a verdict yet. Besides, it will be a lot for the ISU if they take on two separate controversies at once. It would be too late for Russian and Belarusian skaters to compete at Worlds in 2024. For a member country to qualify for Worlds, the skaters must obtain minimum technical scores at an international competition during the previous or ongoing season. I remember the cut-off date for skaters to do so is around three weeks before the first day of Worlds. So, unless the ISU comes up with some special pathways for them to be eligible, I don\u2019t see a way for Russia or Belarus to compete there.\n\nAs for the coaches, I think the only language that potentially affects them is \u201csupport personnel who actively support the war will not be entered\u201d and \u201csupport personnel who are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies will not be entered.\u201d But, how do they define \u201cactively\u201d and the scope of \u201csupport\u201d? Does hosting a pro-war in Ukraine ice show count as \u201cactively support[ing] the war\u201d? Does receiving Russia\u2019s highest honor for a civilian insinuate Tutberidze\u2019s support for her country\u2019s stance on foreign policy? It all sounds very vague to me and will likely come down to only rhetoric. As you might know, Eteri Tutberidze was already spotted at Worlds earlier this year accompanying her student Daniel Grassl (ITA), sparking quite a bit of controversy. She and her team were treated just like all other coaches. However, the official approval bans Russian and Belarusian athletes from doing interviews. It\u2019ll decrease their overall media coverage, especially in figure skating, and I hope it can be applied to their coaches and entourage as well.\n\nIn summary, I don\u2019t like how the headline of this official Olympic article says \u201cstrict eligibility conditions in place,\u201d because it\u2019s not true. The IOC is simply letting everything go back to the way it was. Russia (and Belarus) just gotta compete \u201cneutrally,\u201d again. They are already used to it and have found a way to use Individual Neutral Athletes\u2019 accomplishments to instill national pride back home.\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d runs every other Friday.\n```"}

The festival kicked off Thursday morning with a full slate of screenings, red carpets, a press conference and a star-studded gala. Here are the top moments from the first day of the festival.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. presented his \u201cOppenheimer\u201d director Christopher Nolan with the first-ever \u201cTrailblazer Award.\u201d Robert Downey Jr.  (R) presented his friend and collaborator Christopher Nolan with the \u201cTrailblazer Award\" at the opening night gala. Downey Jr., who starred in Nolan\u2019s latest work, \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d praised the director for his body of work and his \u201ctimber wolf\u201d spirit. In his typical jokester style, Downey Jr. overshared about his friend, saying that praise is as desirable to Nolan \u201cas being tarred, feathered and pilloried.\u201d He then asked the audience to join him \u201cin a thunderous and extra schmoozy welcome\u201d as he brought Nolan on stage to accept his award.\n\nNolan, who made a name for himself at Sundance in 2001 when his film \u201cMemento\u201d screened, said he\u2019s \u201cnever been an independent filmmaker.\u201d \u201cI think painters are independent. I think poets can be independent. As filmmakers, we\u2019re so dependent on other people,\u201d he said. The director, who\u2019s poised to rack up Oscar nominations next week for \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d said he \u201ccould not be more grateful\u201d for the experience he had at the festival 23 years ago.\n\nJesse Eisenberg shared memories of working with Kristen Stewart as he presented her with the \u201cVisionary Award.\u201d Jesse Eisenberg presented Kristen Stewart with the \"Visionary Award\" at the opening night gala. Before welcoming Stewart to the stage to accept the Sundance Institute\u2019s Visionary Award, Eisenberg reflected on the movies he\u2019s appeared in with Stewart, saying he was always \u201cin awe\u201d watching her work on set. \u201cKristen is one of these rare performers where she is so committed, so authentic, so feeling, that you almost want to make sure she\u2019s okay at the end of the day,\u201d he added.\n\nOnce Stewart was honored with the award, which recognized \u201cher work as an uncompromising artist and contributions to the field of independent film,\u201d she took time to similarly praise Eisenberg. \u201cJesse, I adore you and your work and your whole life,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cJust like endlessly and lifelong. I\u2019ll do it for my whole life. I love you so much.\u201d Stewart, who first came to Sundance 20 years ago, described the festival as \u201ca place full of \u2018Yes\u2019 in a world full of \u2018No.\u2019\u201d \u201cTo be accepted by the community I have admired so personally, it is so lovely and so enlivening, it is so well-timed \u2013 I need this,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cSundance is the f***ing sh*t, I love being here, thank you so much.\u201d\n\nEisenberg and Stewart each have two films playing at the festival; Eisenberg with \u201cSasquatch Sunset\u201d and his sophomore directorial feature, \u201cA Real Pain,\u201d which he also stars in, and Stewart with \u201cLove Me\u201d and \u201cLove Lies Bleeding.\u201d\n\nPedro Pascal responded to Keiran Culkin\u2019s awards season cracks against him. Pedro Pascal at the World Premiere of Freaky Tales by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, an official selection of the Premieres Program at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. Culkin and Pascal have shared competitive banter since the Golden Globes as Culkin swept through awards season for his role in \u201cSuccession,\u201d beating out Pascal who was nominated for \u201cThe Last of Us.\u201d Reeling from his Golden Globe win during  his speech  earlier in January, Culkin said \u201cSuck it, Pedro,\u201d which prompted a laugh from Pascal and started the long-running joke between the actors at January\u2019s awards shows. A week later at the  Emmys , as Pascal presented an award \u2014 with his arm in a sling \u2014 he told the audience that Culkin \u201cbeat the sh*t out of him.\u201d\n\nPascal, who stars in the Sundance selection, \u201cFreaky Tales,\u201d and Culkin, who plays opposite Eisenberg in \u201cA Real Pain,\u201d are both attending the festival for their respective premieres. When asked what message he wanted to fire back at Culkin, Pascal said, \u201cJust be nice to me,\u201d before shrugging and looking directly into the  camera  with a sympathetic expression.\n\nThe Sundance Institute celebrated 40 years of the festival. Joana Vicente, CEO of Sundance Institute; Kim Yutani, Director of Programming; Eugene Hernandez, Director of Sundance Film Festival & Public Programming, and Jason Blum attend Sundance Scoop on Day One of the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. In a kickoff press conference on Thursday morning, Sundance Film Festival and Sundance Institute staff celebrated the 40th edition of the storied festival. In a conversation moderated by prolific horror filmmaker Jason Blum, the panel discussed how Sundance is what Blum described as a \u201cvital part of the entertainment ecosystem,\u201d and shared their excitement for the diverse lineup of stories and filmmakers. \u201cSundance is always a place of renewal. It\u2019s always a place of discovery,\u201d said Sundance Institute CEO Joana Vicente. \u201cThe films are so compelling, and we are very hopeful that they will find a way to connect with audiences.\u201d\n```"}

Courtesy of the Sundance Institute. Photo by Neon.\n\nBy Elise Hernke January 20, 2024 at 11:59 am PST\n\nSUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL \u2014 \u201cStress Positions\u201d is a film that stars the unstoppable and uniquely hilarious John Early, as Terry. It also stars the incredibly talented and formidable writer-director Theda Hammel. But the heart and soul of this film is newcomer Qaher Harhash, as our \u201cRapunzel.\u201d He plays Bahlul, a beautiful model from Morocco who also happens to be Terry\u2019s nephew, recovering from a broken leg in the basement of his uncle\u2019s Bed Stuy brownstone.\n\nTerry inherited this place from his estranged husband, Leo (John Roberts), who left him for a younger man and has been traveling through Europe. There is a scrawled sign on the door that reads \u201cBuzz 2 for Apt. 3.\u201d The layout is such that a projector screen blocks the entrance to one of the rooms and the upstairs neighbor/landlord is a constant looming presence now that the pandemic has forced all the bustling New Yorkers to remain homebound. Clutter, decay and sweat feel ever-present throughout the apartment, a staple of most of these old-style, cheaper buildings.\n\nThe house was best used for throwing raucous parties, as evidenced by almost everything about the space, but especially the strewn-about wigs, the crusty backyard shared by the neighbors and a disco ball the size of a boulder. The \u201cstar\u201d guest, Bahlul, has a rich inner life and complex backstory, but no one in the room with him would know because they don\u2019t ask. Through voiceover narration, we learn that growing up with his mother, he was \u201csheltered, smothered and adored.\u201d He has always been treated as some prized jewel, a kindness that ultimately stripped him of his humanity and experience.\n\nArriving in New York he hoped to find himself, but instead was subjected to the same kind of isolation and lack of autonomy he felt at home. There is a lot to love about this film, but many of its lead characters do not fall into this category. They are not likable from the get-go, but it is solidified when Carla (Theda Hammel) waltzes into her friend\u2019s apartment and \u2014 during a pandemic \u2014 sticks her unwashed index finger into the top of an untouched birthday cake. Meanwhile, Terry is too tightly wound and intense. He is fiercely protective of Bahlul, but it is increasingly obvious that his behavior is selfishly motivated.\n\nHe has staunch beliefs, but little insight to back them up and attempts to control everyone around him while negating those who don\u2019t benefit him in some way. Early described this type of character as his \u201cbread and butter.\u201d Qaher Harhash, John Early, and Theda Hammel at the Sundance Premiere of \"Stress Positions,\" January 18, 2024. Photo by Elise Hernke of Ampersand LA.\n\nJohn Early spoke to Ampersand LA on the Sundance press line and spoke about his admiration for the script. \u201c[Theda] sent it to me on my birthday in 2021, the most beautiful gift [one] can get. I was so moved. I was crying when I read it because she took this thing that I do naturally in my work, this bourgeois clown, like this gay liberal clown...she took that thing that I do in a very blunt way and contextualized it in something deep and political. I have never experienced anything like that and I may never again. It was tailor-made for me,\u201d he said.\n\nHammel described Early\u2019s character as someone who is \u201ca master of throwing a bad party,\u201d explaining that he is good at playing an anxious host, always worried about doing something socially wrong. Early elaborated on this, explaining, \u201cI love a character who is trying so hard to not do something, or say something, or feel something, that they end up doing all of those things without realizing it. And he spends so much time repressing and holding it in, and reprimanding other people and policing...the more you repress, the more likely you are to do the thing you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d\n\nThis film takes place in a particular time and place: Brooklyn, New York during the summer of 2020. Having lived there during this time, I can attest to the accuracy and subtle comedy found in relating. As Terry is baking while chatting on the phone, he unenthusiastically pauses to bang pots and pans out the window to commemorate the healthcare workers, a practice that happened for several months every single night at 7.\n\nCarla\u2019s girlfriend, Vanessa (Amy Zimmer), is seen making a sign that reads: \u201cF*ck this Sh*t!\u201d as she is about to head out the door to join the protests, which were in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement against police brutality. Amid the strict quarantine, people came together to march after the horrific murder of George Floyd and so when the 4th of July rolled around, many were feeling especially unpatriotic.\n\nTo show her allegiance to the movement, there is a bit in the film where Carla \u2014 calling it \u201cthe resistance\u201d \u2014 attempts to burn an American flag out of the apartment building window. While Carla, Terry and Bahlul are chatting one night over drinks, Carla has to abruptly leave due to the city-wide curfew, which was around midnight each night all summer.\n\nI will never forget sitting on the roof of my East Village apartment feeling startled at the silence of the city, empty sidewalks and abandoned bodegas, with NYPD SUVs roaming the streets looking for any pedestrians they would have to send home. Theda Hammel deftly crafted the script so that it can comment on all of these layers without making it ever feel too obvious.\n\nEverything circles back to the heart and soul \u2014 Bahlul. His existence in their lives is confrontational by nature. Carla is caught having described him as \u201cthe little brown kid of [Terry\u2019s] own stashed in his basement,\u201d a so offensive narrative that it is difficult to know where to begin. But there are more muted tensions when Bahlul and Vanessa engage in a discussion where she relates her experience as a Jewish woman to his as an Arab man.\n\nThis is an incredibly risky route to go down in the script, but ultimately Hammel approaches it in a way that acknowledges the truths found in each of these perspectives without attempting to find an answer or villainizing either perspective. The power of this film lies in its honesty. It confronts empty liberalism and passive ignorance just as superfluously as it jabs at the absurdity of ordering DoorDash daily while living in an apartment that doesn\u2019t have basic amenities.\n\nIt has the feel of a classic screwball comedy for a modern audience that will have you laughing in the theater, and then reflecting on your way home. \u201cStress Positions\u201d was produced and distributed by Neon.\n```"}

(Photo by Robert Westermann)\n\nBy James Bao January 19, 2024 at 10:42 pm PST\n\nIn its first out-of-state road conference matchup, No. 6 USC women\u2019s basketball suffered a 78-58 defeat at the hands of No. 20 Utah. The Trojans struggled to find their rhythm against the determined Utes, leading to a disappointing upset.\n\nExpectations were high for the Trojans as they entered the game with a backdrop of historical dominance, securing victories in 18 of their last 27 encounters with Utah since the 1977-78 season. Despite high hopes, early struggles foreshadowed USC\u2019s cold offensive night. A four-minute scoring drought in the first quarter became a recurring theme, as the Utes\u2019 suffocating defense limited the Trojans to a 36% field goal percentage and an even worse 28% from beyond the arc for the game.\n\n\u201cThey did some interesting cross matches where they had some post [players] guarding guards and took away some of our space. [Utah] did a good job of not letting us get to space and get in some of our easy, comfortable offensive rhythm,\u201d USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said.\n\nWhile their defense played tough, the Utes put on an impressive offensive display. Star senior forward Alissa Pili (a former Pac-12 Freshman of the Year at USC) led the way, tying her career high with 37 points. Pili drained five of six 3-point attempts and connected on 81% of her shots overall (13-for-16).\n\n\u201c[Pili] is terrific. Obviously if she\u2019s going to go 5-for-6 from three, it changes how you can guard her in any set of coverage,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cShe\u2019s a one-on-one nightmare in the post and if she\u2019s gonna stretch it to three, it\u2019s nearly impossible to find the right matchup.\u201d\n\nUSC clawed back in the third quarter, trimming the deficit to just five points thanks to a nine-point burst from freshman guard JuJu Watkins. However, the Trojans\u2019 momentum stalled in the final four and a half minutes of the period, managing only two points from junior center Clarice Akunwafo and ending the third trailing 61-44.\n\n\u201cWe fought and clawed to make it a game, and when that happened I thought they were a veteran, mature and mentally tough team who put a clamp on,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cEverytime we got close, they made a big shot, turned us over or got an offensive rebound. I thought they did a really good job when the momentum at all shifted our way; they put their foot on the gas a little bit.\u201d\n\nDespite committing a similar number of turnovers, Utah punished USC by converting them into 27 points. In contrast, USC only managed to score 13 points on Utah turnovers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a concern. We\u2019ve been pretty good about taking care of the ball,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI think when it\u2019s a team like Utah where they\u2019re so good on offense, you got no shot if they\u2019re in transition and moving forward, so I thought that was critical.\u201d\n\nUSC couldn\u2019t hold their ground inside and was outrebounded 43-34 by the Utes. Utah grabbed 13 offensive boards, giving it second chances that fueled its home-court victory. The Utes\u2019 offense thrived on teamwork, racking up 19 assists compared to USC\u2019s meager six. Many of these assists came after offensive rebounds, giving the Utes second chances to attack the basket and break down the Trojans\u2019 defense.\n\n\u201cI thought they beat us in every way tonight. I thought they were better offensively, I thought they were better defensively, they got some key offensive rebounds,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nWatkins, the No. 2 scorer in the nation, led USC\u2019s offense with 26 points on 50% efficiency but only connected on one of eight attempts from 3-point range. The Trojans couldn\u2019t recover from the deficit as the final buzzer echoed, dropping the first of two road games in three days.\n\nUSC will have a chance to prove itself against No. 3 Colorado in Boulder on Sunday at 12 p.m. PST.\n```"}

This announcement comes months after layoffs were announced by related outlets like OkayPlayer, MTV News and Buzzfeed News. Some of these layoffs have come similarly to Pitchfork\u2019s \u2014 under the guise of announcements of \u201crestructuring\u201d from their corporate offices \u2014 but have unfortunately seen declines in the viability and livelihood of the platforms.\n\nIt is no secret that the entertainment industry has been seeing layoffs on a widespread scale. In December, it was announced that Spotify would lay off 17% of their employees amid an alleged \u201ctech slowdown\u201d referenced by CEO Daniel Ek. Q Magazine has ended its legacy after 34 years. NME has halted production of its print edition. Vibe stopped producing its print edition in 2014. Both Paper Magazine and OkayPlayer laid off their respective editorial staff. Now, the disconcerting trend blazes on in the form of a merge of Pitchfork into GQ Magazine and consequently, the announcements of tons of layoffs.\n\nWe are seeing a sharp decline in the number of active music journalism platforms, a troublesome trend not just for music, arts and culture journalists, but also for the musicians and artists who have enjoyed, and need, coverage from these publications. The Pitchfork merge and the consequential layoffs not only affect music journalists and staff members, but also the artists that the publication has been serving since its mid-1990s conception.\n\nPitchfork\u2019s History\nThe publication began as an indie music blog in 1996 in Minnesota. It has become known for its opinionated reviews and recognizable numerical ratings system for some of the most popular albums, EPs and other projects. For context, Pitchfork designates a score for each project that it reviews. This score comes from the opinions of multiple employees, whose scores all get merged to form an average. Pitchfork is home to over 28,000 album reviews (as of 2021) and many look to the brand as a baseline to foreshadow how society might potentially process certain projects.\n\nPay to Play\nAn unfortunate trend that has been sweeping across the music industry is that of \u201cpaid placements\u201d (colloquially referred to as \u201cPR\u201d) through which writers and publicists will offer articles in exchange for financial compensation from artists. This trend is seeing an upward increase, as the value of traditional music journalists becomes lost in the acquisition and monopolization of some of its most visionary outlets.\n\nChristian Carter-Ross is an independent music journalist who runs \u201cThe Melodic Note,\u201d an online music-oriented publication dedicated to highlighting R&B music amongst other genres. \u201cI hate that people are losing employment. The more you water down music journalism with content creation, it kind of cheapens the craft a little bit,\u201d said Carter-Ross. \u201cYou kind of lose the conversation that we need to be having about music.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to go deep when you talk to people about music \u2014 we\u2019re kind of losing the foundations of music journalism when you fire these journalists from Pitchfork or Vibe.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to make light of what happened, but I wonder if this will push audiences to go more towards independent journalists,\u201d Carter-Ross said.\n\nAlthough the dissemination of some of music journalism\u2019s most recognizable platforms is disturbing, Carter-Ross hopes the future of music journalism will see writers able to flourish in a more independent industry.\n\nPayola Concerns\nCarter-Ross recalls a time growing up in North Carolina where he would see talented artists offer money to DJs in exchange for their music to get played. This is called \u201cpayola\u201d and is commonly known to be an unethical process across the industry. If not unethical, it is often inaccessible, another reason why gaining mainstream music success can be so difficult for those without preexisting money, power, or influence.\n\nAccording to Yahoo News, \u201c57% of music industry creatives come from professional family backgrounds.\u201d This draws a comparison to the music industry climate that we are seeing right now \u2014 we are headed towards a climate in which \u201cpay to play\u201d is becoming normalized through paid placements.\n\n\u201cI hate that there aren\u2019t enough music journalism spaces,\u201d Carter-Ross concluded. \u201cI hate to see it happen that way. I want to see people retire in these roles.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good for music journalism and criticism as a whole,\u201d said Josh Svetz, content coordinator at HipHopDX, who also does freelance journalism as well as artist consultation and strategy. \u201cWith the framing of the messaging, I have pretty much lost all faith in any type of restructuring after seeing what happened with MTV News, OkayPlayer, BandCamp [...] the list goes on and on,\u201d Svetzs said.\n\nThe future of music journalism may look different than it has in previous decades \u2014 many industry professionals foresee a formatical change into a \u201cblog era\u201d where the challenge will look more like figuring out how to monetize content and still preserve the traditional, authentic foundations of music journalism.\n\n\u201cNone of these announcements of restructuring have led to something better, or of keeping the old values of what good music journalism was,\u201d Svetz said. \u201cIf they [Pitchfork] are not safe, then nothing is pretty much safe at this point.\u201d\n```"}

With a positive rating of about 14%, it currently ranks 8th on Steam\u2019s list of most negatively reviewed games.\n\nThe Hype of The Day Before\nOn January 29, 2021, the open-world multiplayer survival game entered gamers\u2019 sights. It gained a lot of attention with the realistic physics, realist picture quality, and simple user interface shown in its official launch trailer. This led the game to secure the top spot on Steam\u2019s wishlist ranking in less than a year.\n\nThe Controversy of The Day Before\nDespite a successful campaign launch, The Day Before went through two game delays, two live stream delays, a trademark dispute, and a phase of recruiting volunteer developers before finally launching on Steam as an early access title on December 7. While intermittently releasing actual gameplay footage, the studio also continuously advertised for their other game Propnight and office software Continent.\n\nA Trail of Delays and Disappointments\nThe game was originally advertised to launch in June 2022, but a month before the release, Fntastic delayed the launch to March 2023, stating that they were upgrading the game\u2019s engine from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5. In January 2023, Fntastic was under a trademark controversy with the name The Day Before. Once again, they announced that the game would be delayed until November 2023.\n\nGamers were confused because multiple games and softwares were called The Day Before on Steam. This confusion led to a growing concern among the gaming community, who questioned the significance of the trademark dispute and why it warranted such an extensive delay in the game\u2019s release. Fntastic then admitted that the delay was decided long ago and that the trademark dispute was not the main issue.\n\nLaunch Day Letdown\nOn the day of its release, the peak number of online players nearly reached 40,000. But, despite being an open world game focused on massively multiplayer gameplay, The Day Before did not have adequate servers ready for its launch. This resulted in very unstable connections for players. Many were unable to join the game, while the lucky few that could suffered performance issues.\n\nPlayers also soon found out that the game not only lacked some of the most basic required actions found in post-apocalyptic survival games, such as climbing, vaulting, closing doors, as well as missing animations for opening boxes and cabinets, avoiding zombies, and melee attacks, but it was also filled with various bugs.\n\nGameplay-wise, since the zombies also had no climbing system, players were technically invincible when standing on something as high as a table. Additionally, The Day Before failed to implement the essential resource collection and management system that is crucial in survival games.\n\nQuestionable Development Practices\nOf course, these issues can be understandable in a game developed by a small company mostly made up of volunteers. In the past, many successful games started off with unfinished infrastructure and processes, due to their over ambitious aspects. However, over ambition was not the main issue for Fntastic. Rather, their apparent cheapness or lack of funds was a much bigger detriment to their developing process.\n\nMany of the game\u2019s models and materials were purchased from the Unreal Engine\u2019s Marketplace, at a total cost of no more than $10,000, according to estimates from Reddit user /u/EpicStory1998.\n\nAlso, following the announcement by the development team about the engine upgrade to Unreal Engine 5, Fntastic began inviting netizens to volunteer their services to help with the development work without compensation. According to information previously released on the game\u2019s official website, the number of volunteers recruited by Fntastic was almost twice the number of the company\u2019s employees.\n\nMarketing Missteps\nWhile utilizing a significant amount of free labor, The Day Before also chose to take shortcuts in its game promotion and marketing. Its last trailer essentially \u201cpaid homage\u201d to other games, from the storyboard to the dialogue, closely imitating various aspects of them.\n\nThe days after The Day Before\nJust four days after The Day Before\u2019s release, the developer Fntastic announced the closure of its studios. Nowadays, the website only displays the closure announcement.\n\nOn December 22, the production team of The Day Before released a community announcement on Steam stating that they had ceased operations. The game\u2019s servers will be shut down on January 22. After discussions between Mytona Fntastic and Valve, it was decided that all players would be issued a mandatory refund, regardless of how long gamers played. Even activation keys were deactivated.\n\nBefore vanishing, Fntastic had some final words to say about their work, in response to the backlash they received.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner January 19, 2024 at 4:47 pm PST\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Earlier in the season, the Kings looked like a contender to win the Pacific Division. Now, a playoff spot doesn\u2019t even seem like a guarantee. Los Angeles is 1-5-4 in its last 10 games and now sits fourth in the division.\n\nOn the eve of a highly anticipated 2014 Stanley Cup Finals rematch with the New York Rangers, the Kings need a sense of urgency to turn their skid around. The Vancouver Canucks have dominated the Pacific, leading the division with 64 points. Right behind them sit the injury-ridden Vegas Golden Knights, still a dangerously good team when healthy. And in third \u2014 passing the Kings on Thursday \u2014 are the Edmonton Oilers, who have thrived under new coach Kris Knoblauch. The Oilers\u2019 current 12-game winning streak is a franchise record.\n\nIf falling out of the top three wasn\u2019t worrisome enough, the Calgary Flames and Seattle Kraken trail Los Angeles by just three points, inserting themselves in the thick of the Wild Card race.\n\nThe Kings\u2019 fall from glory began at the turn of the calendar year. Los Angeles earned some crucial divisional wins in late December, until a date with the Golden Knights in which things went south. A 3-2 loss to Vegas kicked off an eventual eight-game losing streak, with four coming in overtime or shootouts. The Kings finally got their first and only win of 2024 against the Carolina Hurricanes on Jan. 15, but haven\u2019t won since.\n\nLosing backup goaltender Pheonix Copley to a torn ACL served a major blow to the Kings\u2019 depth at the position. While Cam Talbot may be an All-Star and has shown greatness at times this season, at 36 years old, the sustainability of that success is in question with half the season left. Journeyman David Rittich has split time with Talbot between the pipes since Copley\u2019s injury and has looked promising, so the Kings will hope that Rittich can keep lightening Talbot\u2019s load.\n\nPierre-Luc Dubois was a major acquisition for Los Angeles over the summer but simply hasn\u2019t lived up to the expectations. His -11 plus/minus has shown his inefficiency thus far and his measly 19 points in 42 games have been disappointing, especially considering that he posted a career-high 63 points last year for Winnipeg.\n\nVeteran defenseman Drew Doughty may have hit double-digit goals for the first time since the 2017-18 season, but he\u2019s only recorded 13 assists, 30 less than his total from last season. The Kings\u2019 defensemen have always been more physical and defensive-minded, but points are just not being generated at the rate they need to be.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 top-six forwards have maintained consistency through the slump, but the once-great depth production has dwindled since the start of the season. Carl Grundstrom and Arthur Kaliyev were extremely valuable on the bottom lines to start the season, but have seemingly disappeared since their strong starts.\n\nWhile the Kings haven\u2019t looked like their true selves this past month, there is still plenty of time to improve. Sitting second in the Wild Card isn\u2019t a bad problem to have. This week, after taking on the Rangers, the Kings will have an opportunity to start a win-streak by facing the struggling San Jose Sharks and Buffalo Sabres next. Then, Los Angeles will hit the road for a big game against the Colorado Avalanche.\n\nGeneral manager Rob Blake is still confident in his team and has not indicated that any major changes will come soon. On Thursday, in a midseason press conference, Blake stated that he was \u201cgoing to rely on the players and the leadership\u201d and not make any coaching changes. According to The Athletic, coach Todd McLellan will be the leader of the Kings for the remainder of this season, but if the team can\u2019t turn its recent woes around, expect him to be on the hot seat.\n\nThis season hasn\u2019t been ideal for the Los Angeles Kings, as inconsistent play from several players has led to the team\u2019s downfall. The Pacific is as competitive as can be, so L.A. must rise to the occasion in the second half of the season.\n\nThe Kings will face the Rangers on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at Crypto.com Arena.\n```"}

Metro Transit security officers approach the scene and help hold her down as a deputy ties her legs together.\n\nThe two deputies speak calmly, as the woman yells profanities and racist slurs and thrashes on the ground. The video ends as one of the deputies holds the woman down and the other stands by, speaking into his radio. A Metro security officer stands over her, and the woman lies face-down on the pavement.\n\nThe run-in, which occurred around 10 a.m. on June 27, shows an extreme case of the realities Metro passengers and law enforcement face every day throughout the transit system, with more unhoused passengers riding trains and buses and pushing the limits of available services.\n\n\u201cIt seems that tragically this woman was suffering from a mental health crisis, something that is not uncommon on our Metro trains,\u201d County Supervisor and Metro Board Member Janice Hahn said in a statement. \u201cI think we need more mental health workers on our trains and buses and I hope this is something that could help someone like her in the future.\u201d\n\nAnnenberg Media\u2019s Beacon Project contacted 13 Metro board members for this story. Hahn, a former member of Congress, is the only one who agreed to comment on the video. She has studied the public agency\u2019s handling of the unhoused population. She recently visited Philadelphia and said its transit agency could be a model for Los Angeles. She said that she found the Hub of Hope, a center inside a subway concourse that provides resources like showers and social services, to be an effective and humane way to address the needs of unhoused individuals as well as transit riders. She said she hopes to instill some of the organization\u2019s ideals in Los Angeles.\n\nMetro often runs into difficulties meeting the needs of unhoused riders and other passengers who frequent the trains and buses. The Torrance Transportation Committee voted to conduct more research into whether to move forward with plans to expand the C-line to the city. Councilmember Aurelio Mattucci said having the end of the line in Torrance would lead to more unhoused people on the rails, which would increase crime in the city, as reported by the Daily Breeze. The Metro Board of Directors is set to vote in early 2024 on the route.\n\nThere have been efforts to build community support for the line. L.A. County Supervisor Holly Mitchell hosted a community walk on December 16 to build awareness and engagement for the project.\n\nMany Metro Board members did not respond to the Beacon Project when seeking comment on this story. L.A. County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, who is on the Metro Board of Directors and oversees Santa Monica, did not respond to requests for comment. Board Member Fernando Dutra said he \u201cwill not be able to provide an opinion\u201d because it is an active investigation. Representatives for Board Member Kathryn Barger and Board Member Hilda Solis declined to comment. Board Member Paul Krekorian did not respond. Board Member Ara Najarian said, \u201cI will not be making any comments about the incident reflected in the video you sent.\u201d A representative for Board Member Katy Yaroslavsy said, \u201cbecause this occurred in Santa Monica, which is outside of our jurisdiction, we won\u2019t be offering a comment from our office.\u201d\n\nThe video was captured by USC journalism Professor Alan Mittelstaedt, who took his high school summer class on a reporting trip to Santa Monica. One of the high school students, Star Correa, said it looked like deputies overreacted. \u201cI feel like they don\u2019t care about our safety any more,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it was definitely excessive. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a world in which grabbing an unhoused woman who\u2019s probably dealing with mental issues and putting her on the ground is a good situation,\u201d another student Olivia Gorman said.\n\nAlthough not easily accessible on its website, nor posted around the train stations, Metro\u2019s Code of Conduct requires that passengers wear shoes while on a Metro platform or train. Metro spokesman Dave Sotero called it \u201cbattery on a police officer.\u201d He added, \u201cwe try to avoid use of force incidents whenever possible but they\u2019re not always unavoidable.\u201d He went on to say that the unhoused woman was not arrested at the scene.\n\nThe woman was taken to a psychiatric unit, according to Luis Alba of the transit services bureau. Sheriff\u2019s officials refused to provide any more information about her and rejected five written requests for information filed under the California Public Records Act. It is unknown whether the woman was charged with any crime or even basic details such as her identity or age.\n\nFor three months, the sheriff\u2019s department gave various reasons for refusing to provide more information, such as her name. They included that the department was experiencing technical difficulties, that they couldn\u2019t find the records, and that the Santa Monica Police Department might have them. All this despite Sotero, Metro\u2019s representative, saying to a reporter that he had the report on his desk.\n\nErnie Arce, who works in the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s public records office, said he could not provide information because it is an \u201congoing investigation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s possibly HIPAA-related issues,\u201d Arce said, referring to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 which provides patient privacy. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything medically related, like a mental health crisis issue, if there was an intervention related to that sort of situation\u2013 then we can\u2019t release it.\u201d\n\nMedia lawyer and director of the First Amendment Coalition David Loy said HIPAA only applies to healthcare providers and would not be a valid reason for a law enforcement agency to withhold information. \u201cPolice departments or sheriff\u2019s departments aren\u2019t covered by HIPAA at all,\u201d Loy said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a category error.\u201d He did say, however, that if the incident had not resulted in an arrest, the agency could withhold records, including the woman\u2019s name.\n\nRamon Girgis, an operations deputy with the transit division, spoke about the leg restraint device used in the video called the \u201chobble.\u201d He says it is standard and is used \u201cif someone is kicking or being assaultive with their legs.\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s encounter occurred at a time when the use of excessive force was being scrutinized by the public. The sheriff\u2019s department came under scrutiny in March 2022 when it attempted to cover-up an incident of excessive force in which a deputy knelt on the head of a handcuffed inmate for three minutes, as reported by the LA Times. During the summer, an incident in Lancaster prompted an investigation when body-cam footage showed a deputy tackling a woman as she filmed a man being handcuffed on June 24.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the FBI is reviewing all documents and other materials pertaining to this incident,\u201d Deputy David Yoo wrote in a statement emailed to The Beacon Project.\n\nLast year, LA Metro\u2019s Board of Directors voted to renew its contract with the Long Beach Police Department and the sheriff\u2019s department, a contract that would last up to three years. Metro is also considering the creation of its own police force, detailed in this motion from June. A report is expected to be presented to the board this month.\n\nMetro has contracted with the Los Angeles Police Department, the Long Beach Police Department and the Sheriff\u2019s Department since 2017 to enforce Metro rules and address crime. Proponents say the new police force would save the department more than $38 million, according to the LA Times.\n\nMetro is working to improve its relationship with the homeless population by partnering with various teams deployed on the rail and busway. Currently 25 teams work with the agency, with about three to five multidisciplinary staff working with each group, according to Craig Joyce, the deputy executive officer of homeless initiatives at Metro.\n\nPATH, a nonprofit dedicated to ending homelessness, is contracted by Metro to help individuals find permanent housing, provide mental and medical health care, offer employment training, along with other services.\n\nThe Expo line takes passengers from East L.A. to Santa Monica.\n\nSotero says Metro operates on a \u201cmulti-layered plan,\u201d that includes Metro ambassadors, sheriff\u2019s deputies, police officers and outreach programs like PATH. He says there are also mental health evaluation teams \u201cin the works\u201d with plans to have teams ride the Metro system and offer assistance.\n\n\u201cWe have mental health evaluation teams,\u201d Sotero said. \u201cWe\u2019re working with our partners to get those mental health teams on the system. It\u2019s gonna be another layer of the safety plan.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to the Beacon Project, PATH spokesperson Tyler Renner outlined the group\u2019s staffing situation. \u201cPATH\u2019s Metro Outreach team employs approximately 35 staff members. They are not stationed at a particular location, as they ride the Metro to connect with individuals who are experiencing homelessness. The shifts range from 3 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., with various groupings of team members working together. Our teams work alongside a range of other providers to offer connections to services across the transit system.\u201d\n\nPrince Montez, a Metro ambassador stationed at the 7th Street Station, has a personal relationship with PATH. The ambassador, who uses they/them pronouns, stands by the turnstiles a couple days a week with a pack of naloxone, a drug used to reverse opioid overdoses, strapped to their hip. They were unhoused before being assisted by PATH and securing a job with Metro.\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m actually a felon so I know what it\u2019s like to work at becoming a better person. I feel bad for the mentally ill people, but at the same time, there is ample opportunity to get off the streets,\u201d said Montez, looking around the station at nearly a dozen unhoused individuals. They said they believe that PATH could be doing a lot more, calling it a \u201cpreschool version\u201d of what could be done to assist the homeless in Metro systems.\n\nThe encounter with the woman at the Santa Monica station occurred just a few days before the city released its annual report which revealed a 10% increase in homelessness in the city of Los Angeles. The Homeless Initiative reports that lack of affordable housing is one of the leading causes of homelessness in L.A. County. L.A. Mayor Karen Bass has allocated $1.3 billion to addressing homelessness this year.\n\n\u201cPeople with houses have a house to hide mental illness, to hide hygiene issues,\u201d Montez added, \u201cBut unhoused people have to put it all on front street.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of Sundance Institute | Photo by MUBI)\n\nBy Kaitlyn Huamani January 19, 2024 at 1:41 pm PST\n\nMinutes into Molly Manning Walker\u2019s \u201cHow to Have Sex,\u201d the film is already a breath of fresh air. It\u2019s a far cry from Maddy in \u201cEuphoria\u201d screaming expletives between every other word, and it feels different than the Gen-Z pandering in the latest rendition of \u201cMean Girls.\u201d The interactions between the three British teen girls at the heart of the film feel free and real. They tease one another, they drunkenly order French fries, they profess their love for each other. They are simply teenagers, and the audience is just a fly on the wall to their conversations.\n\n\u201cHow to Have Sex\u201d tells the story of Tara, skillfully played by Mia McKenna-Bruce, and her friends, Skye and Em, played by Lara Peake and Enva Lewis, as they go on an unsupervised trip to celebrate the end of school exams. Skye makes it clear that 16 is an unacceptable age for Tara to have not yet had sex, and she takes the lead in pressuring her friend into finding a boy to \u201cget it done.\u201d Once you get used to the British slang, what remains is dialogue that feels so true to how a group of 16-year-old girls would talk with one another.\n\nShortly after they arrive in the Greek town of Malia, where they bounce around between clubs, smoking cigarettes and drinking, the girls befriend a group of boys staying in the hotel room next door. With the mounting pressure from her friends to \u201cfinally\u201d have sex, Tara is eventually assaulted by one of the boys. Everyone around her celebrates the \u201caccomplishment,\u201d not seeing her hurt and pain.\n\nThe story is a familiar one for director and writer Manning Walker, who said she frequented destinations like Malia with her friends as a teen, and was assaulted at 16. \u201cIt\u2019s a topic I felt wasn\u2019t talked about enough and has always come with lots of shame, so I felt like it was something we had to open up,\u201d Walker said on the red carpet at the Sundance Film Festival on Thursday, ahead of the film\u2019s screening there. \u201cAs we made the film, we realized so many women have been through this experience, so it felt important.\u201d\n\nBy drawing on her own experience and teenage memories, Manning Walker enriches the writing and contributes to the highly realistic feeling of the film. She said she wanted a \u201cdocumentary level of realism,\u201d so she shot on location in Malia and hired a documentary cinematographer to try to \u201creplicate that feeling\u201d they saw in the party scene there. Manning Walker also knew that her Gen-Z cast would be a key part of achieving the film\u2019s authenticity. She said in a post-screening Q&A that while the final cut follows the script pretty closely, she had the actors do an \u201cexperiment\u201d as their last take of each shot, where they could improvise and add whatever they wanted.\n\nEach of these intentional and powerful choices contributed to the realistic representation of these teens and this story, which only makes the careful depiction of Tara\u2019s assault and its aftermath all the more heartbreaking. The best, most natural dialogue of the film comes in its final minutes. Tara, through broken words and avoidant eye contact, tells Em what really happened with the boy on the trip. Flustered, her friend says, \u201cYou should have told me,\u201d before trailing off. It\u2019s an insensitive, imperfect reaction to what Tara just told her, but you believe it. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I should have told you,\u201d a resigned and exhausted Tara replies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in the lack of language we have for each other when someone is going through something,\u201d Manning Walker said of that final scene. With the film\u2019s success in Europe \u2013 it won a top prize at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival and scored three BAFTA nominations on Thursday morning just as the director was preparing for Sundance \u2013 Manning Walker said she\u2019s eager for not only young women to see the film, but for young men, too. \u201cI hope women feel seen and feel like there\u2019s people around them that had also gone through the same things,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what was really shocking about releasing it is that lots of men felt they had been in that position and felt they need to change or learn from that, and that\u2019s something we didn\u2019t really expect. And it feels really powerful.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow to Have Sex\u201d will be released in theaters in New York and Los Angeles on Feb. 2.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/01/19/iowa-caucusgoers-find-fault-with-the-media/", "response": "```\nMARSHALLTOWN, IA \u2014 As Iowans gathered across the state to cast their votes for the first-in-the-nation caucus Monday night, many toiled over which candidate to choose. In their eyes, the coverage they saw on TV and in the news all but pushed them in one direction, toward former President Donald Trump.\n\nAt a series of candidate events just before the caucuses, Iowans made clear to reporters from Annenberg Media they thought Trump continued to dominate local and national conversations, in person and in the media. So much so that they felt the other candidates were \u201cleft out\u201d of coverage, as one Vivek Ramaswamy supporter remarked after a town hall event in Ankeny.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are still stuck in Trump land,\u201d Jacqueline Rinkena told Annenberg Media reporters in an interview after the Ramaswamy event at a pizzeria. She explained that for the candidates trailing Trump in the polls, being \u201cleft out\u201d was \u201ca nice way to put it.\u201d\n\nLong before Trump first announced his candidacy in 2015, media and news outlets have been in turmoil over how to cover controversial political candidates and the inflammatory rhetoric that now surrounds some Republican party candidates. However, former Missouri Rep. Billy Long, a Republican, actually blamed the media and said it attempts to vilify Trump.\n\n\u201cGenerally the media is against Trump,\u201d Long told Annenberg Media reporters outside Trump\u2019s packed town hall event at Simpson College in Indianola. \u201cThey want anybody but Trump. They want Haley. They want DeSantis. They want Vivek. They wanted Christie. And so they tried to build a thing against him,\u201d said Long, who gave up his House seat to make an unsuccessful bid for Senate in 2022. \u201cBut Trump, I mean how can you draw a crowd like this with people waiting outside in 18 below zero unless you\u2019re pretty popular.\u201d\n\nHe was right on that last part, as negative temperatures stretched across most of the midwest, Iowans were still out, braving the cold to hear candidates speak and maybe get to meet them in person. Trump\u2019s was the largest event Annenberg Media covered in Iowa, with so many people attending his town hall that the local fire marshall barred more people, including credentialed media, from entering the building.\n\nShawn Stout, who braved the cold with his two 16-year-old sons to listen to Trump\u2019s speech because he \u201cprobably never will again,\u201d said he liked Trump\u2019s ideas but was still undecided about which candidate to support. Stout mentioned his sons, who are not yet old enough to vote, also liked Trump\u2019s ideas. Part of Stout\u2019s concern over which candidate to support came from Trump\u2019s domination of conversations and media coverage. He added he \u201cdoesn\u2019t think other candidates have a chance.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Republicans like Trump] spin things,\u201d Stout said. \u201cBut the left does too.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s relentless bashing of the media as \u201cfake news\u201d has also undermined the press\u2019 role as arbitrators of the truth and all but destroyed mainstream media\u2019s credibility amongst his most loyal supporters. Heather Beener, a caucus captain for Trump in the Squaw Creek township south of Indianola, fell in line with the former president\u2019s attacks against mainstream media.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can fix this country until we fix the media,\u201d Beener passionately explained to Annenberg Media reporters. Beener went on to note she was scared that communism could overtake the \u201ccountry of rights\u201d that is America.\n\nSupporters at Nikki Haley\u2019s town hall in Adel noted that coverage they saw surrounding her campaign was \u201creally good.\u201d Jane Sturtz, who was attending a Haley event for the first time in-person, added that the former governor and United Nations ambassador was \u201cwell enough known\u201d by the community. Sturtz said she liked how Haley \u201ckept speaking\u201d at previous debates and town hall events she had watched on TV and seen online.\n\nTrump has not attended a debate with other 2024 Republican presidential hopefuls, instead holding competing live town hall events on Fox News. According to the Associated Press, the Fox town hall with Trump had 1.7 million more TV viewers than the head-to-head debate between Haley and Ron DeSantis at the same time on Jan. 10, just before the caucuses.\n\nEven still, Sturtz emphasized that Haley \u201cdoesn\u2019t throw stones and was not shut out,\u201d during the debates. On caucus night, as Republican voters poured into school gyms and other community centers to cast their votes for who should be on the ballot in November, some continued to note that they would rather see someone other than Trump on the ballot \u2014 even if they did not have hope it would happen.\n\nThis year was Tamara Tuttle\u2019s first time caucusing in Iowa. She came with her husband to the Marshalltown High School Roundhouse alongside roughly 600 of her neighbors to cast her ballot. \u201cIt\u2019s my first time at caucus, so I\u2019ve never done it,\u201d Tuttle said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s really, really important this year to make sure I get out and do all my voting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see [Ramaswamy] be president someday,\u201d Tuttle continued. \u201cI really do like him. But I think I\u2019ll probably end up going with Trump in the end, simply because I don\u2019t think that Ramaswamy has a chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think most of my neighbors feel the same way,\u201d Tuttle added. \u201cTo be honest I think that\u2019s why we are all here.\u201d\n\nAsked who he was going to caucus for, Jim Walkup said he hadn\u2019t totally made up his mind. \u201cI\u2019ve got a favorite, yeah,\u201d Walkup said from the bleachers a few minutes before the caucus meeting was called to order. \u201cBut I\u2019ll wait and hear the talks and the speeches, and then I\u2019ll decide for sure.\u201d\n\nWalkup also wasn\u2019t so sure about the money spent on campaigns in Iowa this election cycle. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good or bad,\u201d Walkup said. \u201cBut I think I heard some of them say they spent over $200 million just on the caucus in Iowa. And this is just the first one.\u201d\n\nHe added that, in his eyes, there hasn\u2019t been anything wrong with the media coverage of candidates, but that \u201cyou\u2019ve got to kind of filter through a lot of it and take it for granted.\u201d\n\nDeSantis\u2019 caucus captain in Marshalltown, David Blom, said he is ready to be done with the former president and move on to a new candidate. \u201cI wanna be focused on the issues Republicans care about,\u201d Blom told reporters. \u201cLife, the border, securing our country and creating a strong, patriotic America and not be worried about all of the distractions of President Trump.\u201d\n\nBlom\u2019s opinion is that the media has focused too much on Trump and his indictments. \u201cThe Democrats already have a playbook and they\u2019re ready to run in November and get President Trump convicted,\u201d Blom said. This highlights a worry in some Republicans that Trump may not be legally allowed to hold the office of the presidency, even if he wins in the general election in November.\n\nBlom emphasized that America needs \u201ca president that\u2019s focused not on his own personal issues, but on people\u2019s issues.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2024/01/19/climate-protest-sows-division-at-trump-rally-but-not-really/", "response": "```\nClimate protest sows division at Trump rally. But not really\n\nINDIANOLA, Iowa \u2014 A winter sun sits high above Simpson College, casting long shadows on a frostbitten campus as Secret Service agents moved decisively through a fervent crowd. Their targets: a group of young protestors from the climate activist Sunrise Movement, who had just interrupted former President Donald Trump\u2019s speech, boldly labeling him a \u201cclimate criminal.\u201d\n\nCollege student Paul Campion stood with other Sunrise Movement members at the forefront of the protest. Being pursued by antagonized Trump supporters in subzero freezing temperatures, he raised his voice as best he could and said with conviction above the din, \u201cTrump has taken millions of dollars in oil, gas, and coal donations. He destroys the planet for his own political gain and the confidence of those who back him.\u201d\n\nThe accusation hung in the cold air. Amidst the fervor, the crowd\u2019s reaction remained mixed. Some looked with indifference, others annoyed. The protest, a sudden eruption in the middle of a relatively disciplined Trump speech, had momentarily shifted the day\u2019s narrative, seeming to amplify political polarization. But not really.\n\nAmong the staunch Trump supporters, Indianola resident Gene Buttrey, 61, sounded as if he actually agreed with Campion\u2019s sentiment on the longstanding power struggle within American politics. \u201cIt\u2019s been happening for over a century. It\u2019s all about the rich wanting to stay rich and in power,\u201d said Buttrey, capturing a common distrust among the crowd toward the political elite.\n\nA few steps away, Grace Pullman, a sophomore student at Simpson College leaning toward Trump, found herself unsettled by the protest\u2019s intensity. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this before,\u201d she said, reflecting the surprise and confusion shared by many of her peers. Her thoughts on climate change, not a primary concern for her or her friends, were a sharp contrast to the protestors.\n\nYet Trump\u2019s position on climate change and fossil fuels is clear. Steve Milloy, a former Trump transition adviser who has repeatedly engaged in industry-backed attacks on climate science, is quoted in Politico saying \u201cthe approach is to go back to all-out fossil fuel production and sit on the EPA.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I left, we were No. 1 in a lot. Now, they\u2019re dismantling all that. They want to go all electric,\u201d Trump said in a November campaign speech in Houston, promising to revive the American oil industry. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that under my leadership the United States became the No. 1 producer of oil and gas by far. Not just a little bit,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe became a net energy exporter for the first time in the history of our country ... but don\u2019t worry we\u2019re going to get it back fast. We\u2019re going to get it back fast.\u201d\n\nLikewise, many Trump supporters at the rally said they felt climate change is being used as a tool to exact political leverage to maintain power. Meanwhile, Trump has recently been endorsed by Bruce Rattester, a wealthy Iowa businessman developing the largest CO2 pipeline in the nation.\n\nNearby, Petrino Ippolito, 28, a first-time caucus-goer whose political allegiance had shifted from undecided to Trump supporter, offered a different perspective. The office administrator at a local insurance company viewed the protest with a hint of cynicism. \u201cI remember, I used to think exactly like them.\u201d His skepticism was not just about the protest but extended to global politics. \u201cI get why the media sensationalizes this stuff ... aren\u2019t we all [climate criminals]?\u201d\n\nIppolito\u2019s musings touched on a common suspicion among some rally attendees \u2014 a belief that climate activism might sometimes be manipulated by larger, unseen forces. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some big oil companies are behind this, making the climate movement look like a farce, paying these people to make climate activists look foolish,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Sunrise Movement, a youth-driven organization, actively challenges the political status quo on climate change. Starting as a reaction to the lack of significant political response to climate crisis warnings, the group has grown into a national movement. They focus on mobilizing young people across racial and class lines, with an emphasis on electing officials supportive of the Green New Deal at various levels of government.\n\nKnown for bold stunts, the group continuously made national headlines disrupting rallies throughout Iowa, notably even being tackled off the stage Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis stood on during an event at Jethro\u2019s Barbecue in Ames.\n\nThe protests and reaction to them highlight Iowa\u2019s unique political landscape. Often perceived as a \u201cflyover state,\u201d Iowa commands national attention every four years during the caucuses. This political spotlight transforms the 3 million-population state, giving a voice to those who might otherwise feel overlooked in the national dialogue.\n\nIt\u2019s during these times Iowans suddenly find themselves at the center of political discourse. This sense of empowerment, deeply ingrained in the state\u2019s identity, resonates with Iowans of all backgrounds, giving them a crucial role in the democratic process.\n\nIt\u2019s why Des Moines high school student Hannah Hayes, 17, an active member of the Sunrise Movement, kept up with the day\u2019s events through social media and news. Her engagement from afar on Sunday was a reminder of how local events can have far-reaching impacts, influencing and mobilizing young people across the state and beyond.\n\n\u201cPeople in the room weren\u2019t happy with our actions but we are looking to speak to those outside the room. Those who care about climate, to show these people (Trump, DeSantis, Nikki Haley) aren\u2019t options for our country,\u201d she said firmly in a phone interview, her commitment unwavering despite her physical absence from the rally. \u201cWe have to hold people accountable for the fossil fuel money they are taking. They are working for special interests,\u201d she continued.\n\nOn the other side, attendees like Pullman and Ippolito left the rally with mixed feelings, their views reflective of the complexities inherent in the nation\u2019s political and environmental debates. Pullman\u2019s reluctance to prioritize climate change and Ippolito\u2019s evolving political beliefs illustrate the diverse and sometimes conflicting viewpoints within the Republican base.\n\nIt\u2019s a complexity mirrored in the broader caucus results. In the shadow of these nuanced sentiments, Trump\u2019s historic 30-point caucus victory affirmed his hold over the party\u2019s base. Despite the evolving perspectives and internal debates within the GOP, his supporters, braving life-threatening cold and perilous roads, turned out in force, delivering a record-breaking win.\n\nPhil Gray, a lifelong Iowan with palpable concerns for the country, said President Biden has to go. \u201cThis country is headed down a tube in the wrong direction,\u201d said Gray, his determined gaze fixed on a future he hopes to change.\n\nIt was clear: nothing would keep these supporters from casting their votes on Monday night. Jacob Fuller, an Indianola resident and soon-to-be grandfather, captured the essence of caucus night \u2014 a blend of civic sincerity and unshakeable resolve, undeterred by winter\u2019s chill. \u201cThey want change,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not cold.\u201d```"}

Also, the Oilers take 11 straight, and the Red Wings rise up in the Atlantic.\n\nWinnipeg Jets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck saves the puck during the second period of an NHL hockey game against the Los Angeles Kings, Wednesday, Dec. 13, 2023, in Los Angeles. (Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner January 18, 2024 at 11:02 am PST\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d is a column by Kasey Kazliner about the National Hockey League.\n\nWinnipeg is soaring Last season, the Winnipeg Jets made the playoffs as a Wild Card, but finished short of their destination after they came crashing down against the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Golden Knights. This season \u2014 in a three-legged race for the Central along with the Avalanche and Stars \u2014 the Jets\u2019 stout goaltending and elite defense has given them the edge. Winnipeg (29-10-4) currently leads the Western Conference with 62 points and is 9-1-0 in its last 10 contests.\n\nWith a deep playoff run in sight, netminder Connor Hellebuyck\u2019s value has been immeasurable as the Jets reach these sky-high heights. Hellebuyck hasn\u2019t allowed more than two goals in a game since mid-December, and his .925 save percentage and 2.19 goals against average have put him right in the thick of the Vezina Trophy conversation.\n\nWith help from solid defensemen such as Josh Morrissey, Dylan DeMelo, Neal Pionk and Brenden Dillon, Hellebuyck has proven to be the Jets\u2019 resilient and reliable leader for yet another season.\n\nThe Pierre-Luc Dubois trade from last summer has given the Jets new life in the form of center Gabriel Vilardi. At just 24 years old, Vilardi is on pace to have the best season of his career if he can stay healthy. Along with left wing Kyle Connor, Vilardi missed significant time with injury, but with both back in the lineup, the Jets\u2019 depth has been bolstered from top to bottom.\n\nConnor returned to the lineup Tuesday after missing over a month of action and added to his team-leading goal total, now at 18. Before getting injured against the Blackhawks last Thursday, center Mark Scheifele was on a tear. Scheifele leads the Jets with 41 points and must be dying to get back on the ice in the wake of Connor\u2019s return.\n\nRegardless, the Jets\u2019 first line has been elite despite his absence. Left wing Nikolaj Ehlers\u2019 craftiness and swift stickhandling has also been vital for Winnipeg. Although missing time in 2022-23 was disappointing, Ehlers\u2019 33 points and +24 plus/minus shows his effectiveness when creating offensive chances.\n\nWhile the Jets haven\u2019t been the flashiest team or the biggest scoring force, they\u2019ve proven to be elite in the defensive zone, which has been the catalyst for their success. Winnipeg only leads the Central Division by one point, so every game will be crucial and limiting injuries will be the biggest test.\n\nThe Jets\u2019 next task will be the Ottawa Senators on Saturday.\n\nThe Oilers\u2019 resurgence\n\nEarlier this season, Edmonton was in an oil crisis. The Oilers had only won two of their first 12 games with little hope in sight. Since then, however \u2014 with the exception of a pair of three-game losing streaks in mid-November and mid-December \u2014 Edmonton has been perfect.\n\nThe Oilers have won 11 straight and stand just one point back of the Los Angeles Kings for third in the Pacific. Center Connor McDavid has returned to looking like his usual self after starting the season injured. The three-time Hart Trophy winner has been among the league\u2019s best, with 58 points on the season thus far.\n\nThe star center has put the team on his back with an 11-game point streak and has shown that a sense of urgency was necessary to turn the Oilers (24-15-1) from a disappointment into a contender.\n\nAs captain, he has not only been a leader statistically, but also as a role model with his elite skating and stickhandling skills. McDavid isn\u2019t the only contributor, though.\n\nThe Oilers have already had four players surpass 40 points on the season; they are stacked offensively, especially on the first two lines. Leon Draisaitl started the season off slow before completely turning it around. The second-line center is coming off the best season of his career, and while he likely won\u2019t match his numbers from 2022-23, his offensive consistency has contributed to Edmonton\u2019s forward depth immensely.\n\nLike Draisaitl, left wing Zach Hyman is also coming off his best season and isn\u2019t showing any sign of regressing. Since joining the Oilers from the Toronto Maple Leafs, Hyman has only improved. He currently leads Edmonton in goals with 26, including three hat tricks, and has been extremely reliable in the slot or next to the net, deflecting in his teammates\u2019 shots.\n\nDefenseman Evan Bouchard is offensive-minded and stands just one point away from matching his career-high of 43 points during the 2021-22 season. At 24 years old, Bouchard hasn\u2019t even reached his peak yet, and he has displayed defensive responsibility as well as offensive awareness in all three zones.\n\nThe Oilers have been the comeback story of the season so far considering how bad they were back in October. While it\u2019ll be tough to catch the Vancouver Canucks, who are running away with the Pacific title, don\u2019t count the Oilers out to make a deep run.\n\nEdmonton will look to extend its win streak to 12 games against the Seattle Kraken tonight at 6 p.m.\n\nDetroit Red Wings: a dark-horse playoff team\n\nThe city of Detroit might be focused on the Lions right now, but its hockey team isn\u2019t too shabby either. The Red Wings (23-16-5) currently find themselves in third place in the Atlantic Division and must keep winning to separate themselves from the rest.\n\nAlthough Detroit started red-hot, it slowed down before resurging at the turn of the new year \u2014 the Wings have only lost one game in 2024. The Red Wings may not have a star-studded cast or a consistent goaltending tandem, but they\u2019ve been about as scrappy as can be.\n\nIf Detroit wants to make the playoffs, though, it must find a way to beat out the experienced Maple Leafs and Lightning, who are creeping up behind them. From wingers Alex DeBrincat to David Perron, the Red Wings have talent spread out all across the lineup.\n\nIf their top-six forwards can keep up their offensive production at the rate it\u2019s been, expect Detroit to finish top three in the division.\n\nDetroit will battle the Carolina Hurricanes Friday to try to cover even more ground in the Atlantic.\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

Ron DeSantis\u2019 entrance, 20-year-old Layne Sagetz, an Iowa native and student at Iowa State University, was almost hiding in the back corner. This isn\u2019t Sagetz\u2019s first presidential campaign rodeo \u2014 growing up in Iowa means that politics has always been part of his life. But this is the first time Sagetz can vote in a presidential election, and participate in the famed Iowa caucuses.\n\nYoung voters were plentiful in the crowd Thursday at the Never Back Down event here at Jethro\u2019s BBQ, a restaurant-meets-dive bar with \u201cVote for Jethro\u201d posters depicting outlandish meaty sandwiches and platters lining the walls. About 75 committed DeSantis supporters, curious college students of all political parties, and, notably, three climate action protestors gathered in the back room of Jethro\u2019s to hear from DeSantis.\n\nSagetz, an independent, said he came to the event with an open mind \u2014 he had planned to caucus for former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had ended his campaign the day before. With a conservative father and a liberal mother, Sagetz has been to a wide variety of campaign events for many candidates. In 2020, his parents brought him to an event for then-Democratic candidate Pete Buttigeg, now the Secretary of Transportation.\n\n\u201cHe seemed really down to earth,\u201d Sagetz said of the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana. \u201cI was surprised he didn\u2019t get more votes.\u201d While Buttigeg won the Iowa Democratic Caucuses in 2020, Sagetz speculated that his sexuality was a barrier to his success. Buttigeg was the first openly gay man to run a competitive campaign for president, but Sagetz thinks some people just weren\u2019t ready for him.\n\nSagetz\u2019s parents also took him to a rally for former President Donald Trump, who lost Iowa to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2016, but went on to win Iowa in a landslide in 2020 as the incumbent and in 2024 hoping to get back to the White House. \u201cIt was basically a concert, they played a hype video and a diss video,\u201d Sagetz said about the Trump rally.\n\nOf the current candidates, Sagetz said that ads for DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley have turned him off \u2014 he said he finds their use of words like \u201cweak\u201d and \u201clame\u201d to attack each other annoying. Sagetz said that while Vivek Ramaswamy was well-spoken, Sagetz suspected him to be \u201can industry plant,\u201d referring to the candidate\u2019s government-outsider status and ties to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nWith the end of Christie\u2019s campaign, Sagetz said he is now still open to all candidates, including Trump. Despite his indecision, Sagetz is much like other Iowans who value their integral role in the election process. He says that while Iowa\u2019s faced a slow decline from having their \u201cfinger on the pulse\u201d of presidential candidates, the state should still keep its status as first in the nation.\n\n\u201cThey should give it to us!\u201d Sagetz said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything else going for us.\u201d It\u2019s political tradition in Iowa to get the chance to hear from presidential candidates, even those with whom attendees disagree or for whom they don\u2019t plan to vote. In fact, many young people at the event who self-identified as Democrats came to check it out because they had the unique, Iowan opportunity to do so.\n\nDeSantis speaks to Iowans about higher education at his caucus event on Jan. 11, 2023. During DeSantis\u2019 speech, he was interrupted three times by climate activists from the Sunrise Movement, a group dedicated to bringing together young people to advocate for climate action. These protestors attended multiple events the weekend prior to the caucuses, including Trump\u2019s event at Simpson College, Ramaswamy\u2019s town hall at Grimaldi\u2019s Pizzeria and Haley\u2019s stump speech in Adel, Iowa, all on Sunday, among others.\n\nOn Friday in Ames, the first protestor rushed up to the stage and unfurled a banner reading \u201cDeSantis: Climate Criminal\u201d before being tackled just a moment later. From the ground, he yelled, \u201cHow much money are you taking from oil companies?\u201d as he was dragged out of the event. As audience members told the protester to \u201cget out\u201d and \u201cshut up,\u201d DeSantis took the tense moment to resume one of his standard campaign lines.\n\n\u201cThis is [what\u2019s] wrong with the college system right there,\u201d he said, a reference to the age of the protestors and the event\u2019s proximity to Iowa State University, although it was unclear if they were college students. However, because of that proximity to ISU, volunteers were handing out \u201cCyclones for DeSantis\u201d stickers to people walking in.\n\nThe second protester interrupted DeSantis\u2019 speech to ask \u201cHow much money are you getting from oil executives?\u201d DeSantis responded by calling him rude and repeating his talking points on low gas prices and energy independence amid cheers from the audience. A later question from the audience \u2014 regarding DeSantis\u2019 position on providing small business loans to young people \u2014 prompted further censure of the \u201cbrick and ivy\u201d college system which DeSantis said allows students to major in \u201cZombie studies\u201d and indoctrinates them with liberal ideologies.\n\nAfter the event, a group of college students sporting the \u201cCyclones for DeSantis\u201d stickers headed out of Jethro\u2019s, peeling the stickers off on the way. These students said that they were just wearing the stickers because someone handed them out, and that they were not DeSantis supporters. The group attended the event simply because, in the Iowan fashion, they were able to.\n\nNineteen-year-old David Hauber, a student at the University of Iowa, said he found the governor\u2019s remarks to be alienating for young people and college students in particular. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why [DeSantis] is so obsessed with thinking that colleges and indoctrinate people,\u201d Hauber said. \u201cThere\u2019s no indoctrination and it\u2019s not like colleges are overtly Democrat.\u201d\n\nHauber said he felt these tactics may help draw older voters in, but distance DeSantis from a whole base of potential voters who seem to be ignored. \u201cI feel like a lot of the younger generation is Democrat. And that\u2019s where they\u2019re getting that from,\u201d Hauber said. \u201cAnd they just say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s indoctrination.\u2019 I feel like it\u2019s an easy hit point for them.\u201d\n\nHowever, he also criticized the protesters for their behavior at the rally: \u201cI just wonder, what are you here to gain? It\u2019s disrespectful,\u201d Hauber said. Hauber is a registered Democrat and came to the event with friends hoping to ask questions and hear from the opposing side. His friend John Higgins, an 18-year-old student at the University of Minnesota and a fellow Democrat, was disappointed that he wasn\u2019t able to ask his questions of DeSantis.\n\nHauber wanted to question DeSantis\u2019 view on super-PACs, considering the candidate\u2019s own criticism of Haley\u2019s donations. Eighteen-year-old Allie Enyart, a student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and also a Democrat, suggested that DeSantis\u2019 attacks on Haley were hypocritical.\n\n\u201cI thought it was interesting how he kept talking about Nikki Haley and being for the lobbyists when [DeSantis] accepts more lobbying money than any other Republican candidate currently in the race,\u201d Enyart said. Enyart said she was similarly frustrated by DeSantis\u2019 criticism of college students, and mentioned that a woman in the crowd next to her aggressively yelled at her after one protester was escorted out, asking if she was \u201cone of them too\u201d because of her age.\n\n\u201cHe was pushing so hard for his anti-woke agenda. It came off the wrong way to me \u2014 it sounds extremely homophobic and xenophobic, especially,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cMultiple times he mentioned that he wanted to remove the \u2018woke\u2019 from the military.\u201d\n\nSagetz also felt that DeSantis\u2019 comments about higher education were out of touch with reality. \u201cI completely disagree with him on this,\u201d Sagetz said. \u201cI think that the majority of my professors are conservative and lowkey are pretty aggressive about their political opinions.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Micah Chow)\n\nBy Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as January 17, 2024 at 11:42 pm PST\n\nThe USC men\u2019s basketball (8-10, 2-4) team dropped its third straight game in an 82-67 loss to the No. 12 Arizona Wildcats (13-4, 4-2) at McKale Memorial Center Wednesday night. The struggles away from home continue for the Trojans, as they hold a 1-5 record on the road this season.\n\nArizona fifth-year guard Caleb Love finished with a game-high 20 points and dished out five assists. USC senior forward DJ Rodman scored a team-high 16 points and added seven rebounds. USC freshman guard Bronny James played a career-high 30 minutes, finishing with 11 points, five assists and six rebounds.\n\nThe Trojans once again entered the game with a handful of injuries: freshman guard Isaiah Collier (hand) and fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis (hamstring) did not play, and senior center Joshua Morgan played a limited 12 minutes after missing the last two games due to illness. Entering the game, Morgan looked like a completely different player, as his illness caused him to lose 15 pounds over the last week.\n\n\u201cI am very proud of [Morgan],\u201d USC head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cHe could barely eat until yesterday.\u201d\n\nThe challenging atmosphere in McKale Memorial Center \u2013 Arizona is now 9-0 at home \u2013 sparked a 7-0 run for the Wildcats to start the game. The Trojans had no answer to start, falling into early foul trouble. The Wildcats found themselves in the bonus with 11 minutes to go in the first half.\n\nAfter a sluggish 1-for-5 start from the field, USC woke up offensively, and frequent movement without the ball led to better looks for the Trojans. The Trojans finished with 12 assists on 13 baskets in the first half.\n\nLeading the charge was James, who came out firing, scoring nine points and converting four of five shots from the field in the first half. It was a completely different version of James, who didn\u2019t score in his last two games.\n\nHowever, Arizona out-hustled the Trojans in the first half, grabbing 25 rebounds and disrupting the Trojans\u2019 ability to secure any type of lead. While Arizona\u2019s senior center Oumar Ballo was quiet from the field early on, his impact was still felt in the paint, contributing eight rebounds of his own in the half.\n\nArizona led for the entire first half; however, the Trojans stayed within striking distance by protecting the ball, only coughing it up six times. Yet, a 7-0 run at the end of the half pushed the margin to 10 for the Wildcats, heading into halftime up 45-35.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like every time we were trying to get back in it ... they went on a four or five to nothing run,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nThe second half was a different story for the Trojans, as the offense struggled to find rhythm yet again. Sophomore guard Pelle Larson and Love started the second half scoring for the Wildcats, opening up the lead to 14 points.\n\nThe Trojans succeeded in their 2-3 zone, forcing Arizona to take tough shots. However, the Trojans didn\u2019t capitalize on Arizona\u2019s missed shots and allowed the Wildcats to score 22 second-chance points in the half.\n\n\u201cI thought our zone was effective; it slowed them down,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe got some turnovers out of it and some challenged shots.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s key guys \u2013 James and junior forward Kobe Johnson \u2013 went cold, combining for eight points on 3-for-8 shooting in the second half. In addition, the Trojans\u2019 protection of the ball got sloppy, resulting in 13 turnovers in the half.\n\n\u201c[Johnson] has to understand what a good shot is ... He takes a lot of tough shots,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cAnd he does feel the pressure to create without Boogie or Isaiah in the lineup. But we\u2019re very confident in him to take those shots and make those.\u201d\n\nAfter a great start to the game, the Trojans finished with the same number of turnovers as assists, 19. Arizona controlled for most of the game, even with shooting a poor 40 percent \u2013 by their standards \u2013 from the field.\n\nEarly foul trouble for the Trojans hurt the team down the stretch, as four of USC\u2019s big men \u2013 Rodman, Morgan, sophomore Vince Iwuchukwu and junior Harrison Hornery \u2013 had four personal fouls each. The foul trouble allowed Ballo and the other Wildcats to attack the paint without hesitation.\n\nUSC couldn\u2019t gain any momentum in the second half, and eight turnovers in the final 10 minutes hindered any chance of victory for the Trojans late in the game.\n\nThe Trojans have a chance to finish the three-game road stretch on a high note with a visit to Arizona State (10-7, 4-2) on Saturday at 11 a.m. PST.\n```"}

While my excitement is still brewing, here is Terence\u2019s Too Early Top 25 for the 2024 season.\n\n1. Georgia\nHead coach Kirby Smart will be on a revenge tour next season after Alabama snapped his 29-game win streak. With junior quarterback Carson Beck returning for another season, they are easily my preseason No. 1.\n\n2. Texas\nTexas is back, folks. Led by my preseason Heisman favorite junior quarterback Quinn Ewers, the sky is the limit for the Longhorns.\n\n3. Ohio State\nNext season is crucial for head coach Ryan Day. If Day can\u2019t beat The Team Up North with all of OSU\u2019s talent, he may be fired. The Buckeyes have reloaded with many of their starters and have upgraded at QB from last year.\n\n4. Oregon\nAfter being dominated by their rival Washington, many were concerned head coach Dan Lanning may leave for Alabama. However, I have to commend Lanning for the job he\u2019s done this offseason and staying with Oregon. With its top-five overall recruiting class, the Ducks will be deadly.\n\n5. Michigan\nEven if Jim Harbaugh leaves for the NFL, this team is still set up for the future with arguably the best defense in college football. The defending national champions will have a gauntlet of a schedule, however, including games vs. Texas, USC and Ohio State.\n\n6. Ole Miss\nHead coach Lane Kiffin is a transfer portal god. With the top recruit in the transfer portal, and returning many of his historic 2023 team\u2019s starters, Kiffin has a title-level squad.\n\n7. Utah\nUtah is my preseason favorite to win the Big 12. Quarterback Cam Rising is returning for his seventh season of college football, and the Utes may dominate the Big-12 from the get-go.\n\n8. Notre Dame\nThe Irish were finally able to get rid of former offensive coordinator Gerad Parker and replaced him with Mike Denbrock, who captained one of the most high-powered offenses in the country at LSU. It pains me to say Notre Dame is in for a great year.\n\n9. Missouri\nMizzou rightfully took no time in extending head coach Eli Drinkwitz after the Tigers 11-win season. With the dynamic duo of junior quarterback Brady Cook and sophomore receiver Luther Burden returning, the Tigers will have a great shot at upsetting the top of the SEC.\n\n10. Tennessee\nI could easily see the Volunteers being in the top five by the end of the year. Freshman quarterback Nico Iamaleava showed he is indeed that guy as Tennessee dominated the stifling Iowa defense in the Citrus Bowl. The Volunteers could have the next Peyton Manning on their hands \u2014 yes, I just said that.\n\n11. Florida State\nAfter being bounced out of the playoff, FSU will want to come back with vengeance. They are my pick to win the ACC next season despite losing many defensive stars. Nonetheless, I want to see FSU get its revenge.\n\n12. Alabama\nNick Saban has officially called it quits after 17 years of domination at Alabama. Despite having a new head coach in Kalen DeBoer, this team still has immense talent. However, with 21 players currently in the transfer portal, I am not as big a fan of the Crimson Tide.\n\n13. Oklahoma State\nThe Big 12 runner ups are sure to give Utah some competition for the top of the Big 12. Sophomore running back Ollie Gordon may quite literally carry this team on his back \u2014 Gordon ran for 1,732 yards this past season \u2014 but the Pokes will be dangerous.\n\n14. Oklahoma\nFreshman quarterback Jackson Arnold struggled in the Alamo Bowl, but he also showed a lot of promise. With its lead defender, junior linebacker Danny Stutsman, returning for another year, Oklahoma has all the tools to be great again \u2014 it just needs to put the pieces together correctly.\n\n15. LSU\nI have concerns for LSU at quarterback, but head coach Brian Kelly let go of the parasite that was his defensive staff. The Tigers should be a powerful offense regardless of losing their quarterback and best weapons.\n\n16. Penn State\nThe question about Penn State will be its offense. The defense was top five in the country, but sophomore quarterback Drew Allar is the definition of mediocre. It makes me question the Nittany Lions\u2019 capability to win big games.\n\n17. Clemson\nI\u2019m just not buying the same hype everyone else is seeing with Clemson. Head coach Dabo Swinney is a relic of pre-transfer portal and NIL college football. The Tigers\u2019 defense will be satisfactory, but it\u2019s yet another team whose offense will underscore them in big games.\n\n18. North Carolina State\nThe Wolfpack finished near the top of the ACC last season and will bring in another experienced portal quarterback in senior Grayson McCall. NC State could sneakily dethrone FSU or Clemson atop the ACC.\n\n19. USC\nAfter a disappointing season, USC fans are already looking forward to the D\u2019Anton Lynn era of Trojan football. With a few talented transfers, as well as many returning offensive weapons, IT\u2019S MILLER TIME!\n\n20. Louisville\nThe ACC runner ups currently have the fourth-best transfer portal class according to 247 Sports this offseason, and with head coach Jeff Brohm entering his second season, there will be high hopes for the Cardinals.\n\n21. Iowa\nAfter one of the most intriguing seasons of all time, when Iowa punted 86 times, the Hawkeyes find themselves with a new focus on offense and hopefully a reset to its dreadful end of the year.\n\n22. Arizona\nWhile head coach Jedd Fisch leaving does hurt my opinion of the Wildcats, star quarterback freshman Noah Fifita and sophomore wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan returning is a huge boost to this program.\n\n23. Kansas State\nThe Wildcats have their QB of the future in freshman Avery Johnson. KSU had the privilege of eating the first edible mascot after its victory in the Pop-Tarts Bowl and will be a sneaky contender in the Big 12.\n\n24. Washington\nWashington had its fun, but it\u2019s back to being just a solid Top 25 team. New head coach Jedd Fisch may bring some of Arizona\u2019s assets with him, but I cannot see the Huskies being dominant again.\n\n25. Kansas\nThe Sunflower State should have a great rivalry next game next season, as the Jayhawks will return longtime quarterback junior Jalon Daniels, who will have high expectations to lead Kansas to the promised land.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Will Simonds January 17, 2024 at 5:00 pm PST\n\n\u201cSimonds Says\u201d is a column by Will Simonds, in which he shares his thoughts on sports at USC and beyond.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, USC women\u2019s basketball set a Galen Center attendance record, as a sellout crowd of 10,657 witnessed the now-No. 6 Trojans take down the then-No. 2 UCLA Bruins. Just two weeks prior, UCLA sold out Pauley Pavilion for the Bruins\u2019 victory over USC in front of 13,659 fans \u2014 another program record.\n\nAnd it\u2019s no coincidence why people showed up to both games. The programs had never met as two undefeated teams until their first matchup on December 30. Entering this season, the schools hadn\u2019t met as top-10 foes since 1981; that\u2019s now happened twice in 16 days.\n\nUSC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said it best after Sunday\u2019s game: \u201cI\u2019m learning \u2014 I\u2019m kind of new here generally \u2014 that L.A. likes winners.\u201d She\u2019s right, as fans are more likely to show up for winning teams just about anywhere.\n\nWith a combined 27-2 record this season, with losses only to each other, L.A. natives have certainly taken notice of the amount of winning going on between the two programs.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than just these two games. It\u2019s the momentum of the sport as a whole. \u201cThe narrative is changing. Women\u2019s basketball is cool,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not on board, you\u2019re behind.\u201d\n\nThe numbers back it up. A record 9.9 million viewers (and a peak over 12.6 million) tuned into the 2023 women\u2019s basketball national championship game between Iowa and LSU, over double the prior year\u2019s viewership. The WNBA had a 21% viewership increase in 2023 as well.\n\nAttendance is also on the rise; people aren\u2019t just tuning it at home because it\u2019s what\u2019s on TV. They\u2019re making an effort to attend games in person. Look no further than the aforementioned Iowa Hawkeyes led by Caitlin Clark, one of the most popular athletes in sports right now.\n\nIn an exhibition against DePaul back in October, Iowa set an NCAA record with 55,646 fans filling Kinnick Stadium to watch Clark put up a triple-double.\n\nThe sport has plenty of engaging personalities, from the budding rivalry between Clark and LSU\u2019s Angel Reese, to joyful players like UConn\u2019s Paige Bueckers and Stanford\u2019s Cameron Brink.\n\nAs Gottlieb pointed out Sunday, women\u2019s basketball includes more recognizable athletes than ever before, both across the country and in Los Angeles. Little girls all the way up to A-list celebrities know the names of JuJu Watkins, Lauren Betts, Rayah Marshall and Charisma Osborne.\n\nThat\u2019s perhaps most impressive in Los Angeles, of all places. Gottlieb\u2019s sentiment about winning holds true, but even winning teams don\u2019t necessarily fill up stadiums in Southern California.\n\nUSC football was perhaps one play away from being in the College Football Playoff in 2022, but the Coliseum wasn\u2019t selling out. The Rams are only a couple of seasons removed from a Super Bowl; their fans are often outnumbered by visiting patrons.\n\nThe Clippers typically rank in the middle of the pack in NBA attendance numbers despite boasting some of the top stars in the league.\n\nThere\u2019s so many ways someone can spend their Sunday afternoon in Los Angeles, both in the world of sports and beyond. So, over 10,000 people showing up to a women\u2019s basketball game not once, but twice in just a two-week span, isn\u2019t anything to scoff at.\n\nIt\u2019s a credit to many: Gottlieb and UCLA head coach Cori Close for rebuilding their programs into top-10 teams, stars like Watkins and Osborne for being appointment TV on the court, the marketing departments of both schools for promoting their entertaining squads, among others.\n\nAs Close pointed out Sunday, perhaps the biggest challenge is what comes next. She addressed both fans and the media during her postgame press conference, challenging them to keep showing up, not just for rivalry games.\n\n\u201cI challenge you guys to tell the stories all year long, so this doesn\u2019t become a one-and-done,\u201d Close said to a room full of reporters. \u201cDon\u2019t let it fall, and I need you guys to help us do that.\u201d\n\nClose is right. It\u2019s not just on the fans to keep showing up, but the media has a duty to recognize and promote what these teams are doing.\n\nI remember showing up to postgame press conferences in Gottlieb\u2019s first season at USC two years ago, and more often than not I was the only reporter there asking questions. After Sunday\u2019s game, every seat in the room was filled, and both teams\u2019 pressers lasted 20 minutes.\n\nThat\u2019s a good thing, because it shows a buy-in from all parties involved: fans, media and the programs themselves. Close herself said she\u2019d stay as long as needed to answer questions in order to help foster strong media coverage.\n\nBut what will be the case in two weeks, when USC returns home to face the Washington schools? No, it\u2019s not a rivalry game, and neither the Huskies or the Cougars are ranked. But both are really solid teams in the top conference in the country that could easily make the NCAA tournament.\n\nHow many fans will show up to Galen Center and Pauley Pavilion? Will the media sections at both arenas be filled again? I hope so, because both teams deserve to keep playing in front of sold-out crowds like they did on Sunday.\n```"}

She is a mother of three children, ages 26, 22 and 15. \u201cThey have no future. This is it,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThis election is our future.\u201d \n\nMonday\u2019s Iowa Caucus was America\u2019s first chance to weigh in on the Republican nomination. Conversations with attendees across four campaign events in the blizzard-stricken state revealed parent voters worry about their children\u2019s future quality of life in America. \n\n\u201cA lot of my decisions as a mom are made because I think of my kids and what their future is,\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cI really believe that\u2019s why I was so passionate about Vivek Ramaswamy.\u201d She said Ramaswamy won\u2019t engage in foreign wars that have \u201cno purpose for American interests.\u201d \n\n\u201cMy 15-year-old is a son,\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m looking at candidates who are flirting with attacking Iran? Are you serious?\u201d Jorgensen also points to $34 trillion in national debt. She said people under the age of 40 are strapped with over $200,000 in debt \u201cjust for being born.\u201d \n\nJorgensen was a Ramaswamy caucus captain in the Beaverdale township, what she describes as the \u201cbluest area\u201d in populous Polk County, which includes the state capital of Des Moines. She ended up being one of the only 10 Ramaswamy voters in her precinct. Those results held true for the rest of the state, and the candidate suspended his bid and endorsed former President Donald Trump late Monday night after a weak caucus showing. \n\nJorgensen said that following the caucus vote on Monday, she was voted out of her leadership position in the Republican Central Committee because of her outward support for Ramaswamy. She said her local party voted in a Nikki Haley supporter instead, in line with what she described as a Democratic activist movement in her area. \n\nKristie Wagner is the mother of a 25-year-old son who lives at home. She said her son cannot afford to buy a house and that the quality of life for young people is going down. \u201cI can see the middle class falling and falling,\u201d she said in an interview during a Trump event at Simpson College in Indianola on Sunday. Wagner, committed to caucus for Trump, added that the middle class is stuck with taxes and inflation, which she identified as some of her core policy issues along with election interference, the border and  Hunter Biden\u2019s legal issues . \n\nHeather Beener\u2019s two young children scurried around her and played with a Trump 2024 yard sign at the event in Indianola, which was so overcrowded the fire marshal stopped letting people in the doors. Her husband only chimed in once, as the conversation was primarily dominated by Beener\u2019s enthusiasm for being selected to be a Trump caucus captain in the Squaw Creek township. She said this is not her first time participating in political events. In the Hawkeye state, residents have a history of prioritizing grassroots campaigning. The top three Republican candidates spent a collective  $123 million in advertising  to convince voters to commit to their campaign this election cycle. \n\nShe said she worries about a worse quality of life for her children because of the national debt. But, she also fears that America, a \u201ccountry of rights,\u201d could be lost to communism. \n\nShawn Stout, a Des Moines resident, brought his two 16-year-old sons to the Indianola rally. He said he fears the future quality of life for his sons because prices are increasing and big companies care about making profits rather than helping people. \u201cOur world is falling apart faster than we are fixing it,\u201d Stout said. He said he likes Trump\u2019s out-of-the-box strategy and doesn\u2019t think any other candidates have a chance. Stout had not yet committed to caucus on Sunday, but mentioned his sons favor the former president. They were holding Trump 2024 yard signs in Indianola. \n\nA Sunrise Movement protester storming the Trump caucus event in Indianola. (Photo by Michael Gribbon)  Voices of opposition worry about climate \n\nAt the same time parents fretted over their kids\u2019 futures, college-age Iowans flocked to caucus events that usually draw middle-aged and retired attendees. Two students attending a Haley event in Adel felt shut out of the discussion. Haley\u2019s caucus-eve event Sunday evening at the Country Lane Lodge was positioned on a snow-covered hill and beaming with energized volunteers at the door. \n\nAaron Park, 19, and Anna Smith, 18, drove 45 minutes from West Des Moines to hear Haley\u2019s stump. They were inside of the building when a staffer told them they would have to leave immediately or be arrested for trespassing, according to Smith. The students were then ushered outside in -10 degree temperatures. A reporter observed a staffer tell the students that Haley\u2019s head of security set a ban on college students for this event. Park confirmed this and added he was frustrated over being thrown out of the event. \n\n\u201cI mean, college students vote,\u201d he said, as the two students were laughing. \u201cThey say they\u2019re concerned about winning the youth vote, but don\u2019t let youth into their events,\u201d Smith said. Smith is a high school student in West Des Moines and Park attends the University of Iowa. \u201cIt feels like she doesn\u2019t really want our vote and she just wants to go talk to the media,\u201d Park said. Park said he was undecided ahead of the caucus, but that being thrown out would probably influence his decision. \n\nIt is unclear if the ban on college-age attendees was related to a series of attempts to disrupt caucus events by the Sunrise Movement, a climate change coalition led by youth under 35 across America. In many of the events leading up to caucus day,  Sunrise Movement  activists orchestrated planned disruptions. The coalition campaigns around keeping candidates out of office who take oil money and expand fossil fuel use. \n\n\u201cI am a young voter that is concerned about our future and Trump is a politician that has taken millions of dollars in fossil fuel money,\u201d said Noah Sebastian, 28, who attended the Simpson College Trump event Sunday. \u201cTrump getting elected would sell out the future that young people are owed.\u201d He said the coalition\u2019s goal is not to persuade caucusgoers to vote differently, but to show young Americans the stakes of the climate crisis and that \u201cserious, drastic\u201d action is needed for a liveable future. \n\nAnother protester in Indianola stormed the building chanting \u201ccriminal, climate\u201d while waving a yellow banner that read \u201cTrump: Climate Criminal.\u201d This protestor was escorted out by security. On Jan. 11, three hecklers from the Sunrise Movement disrupted a Ron DeSantis caucus event in Ames. \n\nSebastian wore a commited-to-caucus Trump sticker on his shirt and said it helped him appear as a supporter to blend in. He pointed to specific climate challenges in Iowa: farmers are facing crop failures, the freezing temperatures are evident of a polar vortex caused by climate change and his parent\u2019s home was almost lost to a forest fire, he said. \n\nLaela Zaidi, 27, is a leader and organizer in the Kansas City, Missouri chapter of the Sunrise Movement. She said she was a part of actions at events hosted by all of the candidates. Zaidi said young people are feeling anxious that the \u201csystem can\u2019t change\u201d and that the future president won\u2019t fight for youth. \n\n\u201cOur goal is to confront these politicians that are bought by oil and gas millionaires and ask them to pick a side,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cAre they going to choose everyday people or are they going to choose the millionaires who are digging our graves, who are burying our futures into the ground?\u201d \n```"}

Two Major League Soccer players have just joined Liga MX in the winter transfer window.\n\nUnited States forward Brandon Vazquez (19) celebrates his game-tying goal against Jamaica with forward Cade Cowell (11) during the second half of a CONCACAF Gold Cup soccer match Saturday, June 24, 2023, in Chicago. (AP Photo/David Banks)\n\nBy Michelle Chavez January 17, 2024 at 12:24 pm PST\n\nCade Cowell and Brandon Vazquez look to become a part of one of the oldest league in the Americas as the two rising stars follow in the footsteps of 50 other futbolistas who moved to Liga MX following time in the MLS. Collaboration in between different soccer leagues is rare, often only resulting in a few friendlies for teams here and there. However, the dynamic between the United States\u2019 Major League Soccer and La Liga MX is unique. No other leagues have the same level of partnership and competition as these two. Their clubs challenge each other in the CONCACAF Champions League, Champions Cup, and the Leagues Cup creating a rivalry that fuels players to be their absolute best. The close relationship between them has also created a rare opportunity for players of both leagues to experience playing domestically and abroad. Stars such as Javier \u201cChicharito\u201d Hernandez, Carlos Vela, and Rafael M\u00e1rquez have played for both leagues.\n\nWho is Cade Cowell? Twenty-year old forward Cade Cowell is leaving the San Jose Earthquakes to play for C.D. Gudalajara\u2019s Las Chivas. In his most recent year with the Earthquakes, he started 53 games and played 1,551 minutes throughout the regular season. He played 5 seasons as the club\u2019s youngest signed homegrown player under the U-22 Initiative and he scored a total of 10 goals and played 5,228 minutes in the regular seasons. He was a 2021 MLS All-Star and was named to MLS\u2019s 22 Under 22 list this season for the third consecutive season.\n\nThe Quakes have struck a deal with one of the most prestigious teams in Liga MX to receive an initial transfer fee of $4 million alongside a 20% sell-on clause which would allow the Quakes to receive a portion of any sales fee if Cowell were to be sold again, as well as additional add-ons according to The Mercury News. Cowell was the Earthquake\u2019s ninth-highest paid player earning $600,000 annually according to the 2023 MLS Players Association annual release. The deal was just made official by both clubs yesterday and he is expected on the pitch in the coming weeks.\n\nSan Jose Earthquakes forward Cade Cowell moves the ball up the field against Vancouver Whitecaps defender Javain Brown during the first half of an MLS soccer match in San Jose, Calif., Sunday, Sept. 4, 2022. (AP Photo/Tony Avelar)\n\nThe deal has raised special interest as Cowell is set to join a club notorious for only allowing Mexican nationals on their roster. However, the California native fits this requirement as he has Mexican heritage through his mother and received his Mexican passport earlier this week. Although Cowell\u2019s dual citizenship would theoretically mean that he could potentially play for la Seleccion Mexicana, he would not be eligible as he has already made the one-time switch allowed by FIFA to play for the U.S. Men\u2019s National Team. Cowell previously played for Mexico\u2019s U-15 but switched to the USMNT. He has already earned 8 caps for senior matches for the U.S. and made senior appearances in the 2023 Concacaf Gold Cup scoring once, as well as the 2023 FIFA Under-20 World Cup where he scored three goals leading the team to advance to quarterfinals.\n\nIn the past Chivas has required all players to also represent Mexico at the international level however they have recently begun to relax this rule, allowing Cowell to continue to play for the U.S. and Chivas. Cade was called up to the annual USMNT\u2019s January training camp in Orlando, Florida however he was given special permission to leave the camp early in order to fly to Guadalajara. Chivas began the 2024 Clausura season with a home opener against Santos Laguna on Jan. 13, however Cowell did not play given the ongoing deal.\n\nWho is Brandon Vazquez? Brandon Vazquez has been a star forward for F.C. Cincinnati since joining ahead of the 2020 season when he was sold by Nashville SC after the 2019 MLS Expansion Draft. He is the top goal scorer in FC Cincinnati\u2019s club history, scoring 43 goals across all club competitions, 17 of which were during the 2023 season and 5 in the 2023 Leagues Cup where he scored a hattrick against Liga MX team Chivas. He was an All-Star in 2022 and named to the MLS Best XI, as well as was incredibly significant in the club\u2019s success at securing the Supporter\u2019s Shield.\n\nVazquez also formerly played for Atlanta United.

(AP Photo/Aaron Doster)\n\nOn January 10th, 2024, the forward officially moved from F.C. Cincinnati to CF Monterrey on a contract running until December 2027. The move is set to have a fee of $7.5 million and the potential for $1 million in additional add-ons. The deal came after Vazquez was linked with possible moves to other clubs such as Middlesbrough F.C. Last summer, Cincinnati also rejected a $7 million offer from Liga MX side Chivas which would have possibly resulted in Vazquez and Cowell playing on the same team.\n\nJust like Cowell, Vazquez is forward for the U.S. Men\u2019s National Team. He debuted in 2023 where he scored 4 goals in 8 appearances including 3 goals during the 2023 Concacaf Gold Cup in July against Canada during the quarterfinals. Unlike Cowell, there is a possibility that Vazquez would represent El Tri at some point. However, although Vazquez is also eligible to play for Mexico at the international level, he has previously told ESPN that there hasn\u2019t been any contact with him from the Mexican federation.\n\nThe two are set to start their club participation as Chivas is set to face Tigres and Monterrey will pay a visit to Santos in week two of the Mexican tournament. Expectations are high for both and fans will be looking to see how the former MLS players mesh into their new teams and if they can keep up with Chivas and Monterrey styles of play.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Nick Whitmill)\n\nBy Ethan Huang and Victor Ye January 17, 2024 at 10:02 am PST\n\nA few months ago, students might remember seeing the viral videos of a lively frat party. Chances are, this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve seen this video of Will Ferrell DJing at Sigma Alpha Mu during the peak of football season. But you may have caught his son, Magnus Ferrell, a student and rising singer-songwriter helping his dad set up next to him. He\u2019s no stranger to transforming a space for music, as he hopes to draw in a crowd with his own art.\n\n\u201cIn terms of performing, I just try to have a blast because if you look like you\u2019re having a blast, then the audience is going to be like, \u2018Wait, I feel like I need to be having fun too,\u2019\u201d said Magnus Ferrell.\n\nWhile Ferrell is currently a sophomore at USC studying acting, he has focused on launching his music career. He already has four songs under his belt, with his newest release, \u201cMissed Your Chance\u201d having hit streaming platforms on January 16. But how did it all start?\n\n\u201cI started with music when I was like five years old and my mom got me into piano and that was the beginning of it,\u201d said Ferrell. \u201cAs I got older, I got into jazz when I was 13 and that\u2019s also when I started writing music. It wasn\u2019t necessarily very good, but that\u2019s when I started just doing it for fun.\u201d\n\nHe said that it was during the pandemic when his interest in making music began to take off. His latest piece is an upbeat song about a topic Ferrell finds relatable, and somewhat sad.\n\n\u201cYou like someone, and you think that person could be someone you really like, but then they start being weird and playing games, and then they miss their opportunity,\u201d said Ferrell. \u201cWhen they try to talk to you after disappearing, you\u2019re like \u2018No, I\u2019m good, I\u2019m just going to move on.\u2019\u201d\n\nLike much of his other music, Ferrell writes to the experiences of himself and those around him, and the sounds are developed from the most spontaneous moments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s normally all real-world events happening in my life and my friends\u2019 lives,\u201d said Ferrell. \u201cIt can be very informal, where like a song that I\u2019m putting out later, we actually started writing it while I was doing the dishes and [producer Gabe Yaron] was playing the guitar and I came in, and I had this melody in my head, and I was just singing it as I was doing the dishes. Then we just sat out on our balcony, continuing writing the song, and it took us like an hour.\u201d\n\nFerrell comes from a family of artists. Of course, his father, the actor, but even his grandfather, Roy Lee Ferrell, was a saxophonist who played with the Righteous Brothers. At the moment, Ferrell feels that his identity is undeniably tied to his lineage, but how does he hope to become more than just the \u201cson of Will Ferrell?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time, and you think about like Jaden Smith, he was Will Smith\u2019s son until he was Jaden Smith because he was making music,\u201d said Magnus Ferrell. \u201cEventually, you hope that it\u2019s like \u2018Oh, that\u2019s Magnus, Magnus Ferrell, isn\u2019t his dad that actor from a while ago?\u2019 We\u2019re not there yet, obviously, but you hope to be there at some point, and I\u2019ve accepted that\u2019s going to be the way it is. It\u2019s a blessing and a curse because it brings a little bit of attention, but then the music has to be good.\u201d\n\nEven so, Ferrell says that his family is supportive of his artistic endeavors, and recalls a piece of advice his father gave him.\n\n\u201cHe told me to be wary about the fact that when it comes to music, when it comes to acting, when it comes to any of the performance arts, a lot of times that you can be as talented as the best, but a lot of it comes to luck,\u201d said Ferrell.\n\nAnd beyond mere chance, Ferrell feels that in a world that is more in tune with listening to and creating music than ever before, he needs to find a way to break the mold.\n\n\u201cI think the hardest part is setting yourself apart from everyone because everyone has access now, and making content, making sure it\u2019s quality content that\u2019s specific to you, but also different enough but not too different, you have to find this perfect balance,\u201d said Ferrell.\n\nHe alludes to jazz performers Bill Evans, Oscar Peterson, and Miles Davis as influences on his stylistic voice, and even says that he is studying current artists like Charlie Puth as a part of crafting his musical identity. Part of that is also straddling the line between his acting and music, and while a combination of the two is still down the line, he hopes to bring his best into both types of performances.\n\n\u201cI think that movies and acting and music have a lot in common, and I think right now the focus is really just to go hard on music, and then if I can kind of carve a path and really find success there, I think you can bunny hop into acting, but obviously you still have to be a good actor,\u201d said Ferrell.\n\nIn the meantime, Ferrell\u2019s plans for 2024 is to \u201cput out the most music I\u2019ve ever put out.\u201d\n\n\u201cMissed Your Chance\u201d is available to stream on audio platforms and a music video is out now on YouTube.\n```"}

However, after experiencing the predominantly white, male industry, I felt challenged and discouraged. For years, Asian American representation in Hollywood has been a continuous struggle and an industry problem where people of color have been demanding more representation on screen and in the writer\u2019s room, but have been given limited opportunities in a ruthless and competitive industry.\n\nHowever, in the last five years, there has been a push for Asian representation within the industry. The popular and critical success of films such as \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d \u201cParasite\u201d and \u201cEverything All At Once\u201d proves that not only do Asians and people of color tell remarkable stories through the beauty of filmmaking, but that their stories are also ones that audiences want to see and engage with.\n\nLast week at the Golden Globes, Netflix and A24\u2032s \u201cBeef\u201d made history as it was the first show created by Asian Americans to win in the Best Limited Series category. Ali Wong was the first Asian American woman who was Vietnamese and Chinese to succeed in her category, Best Actress in a Limited Series. Steven Yeun became the second Asian American man to win in his category for Best Actor in a Limited Series. The show also swept at the Emmys, picking up eight awards including wins for Yeun and Wong\u2019s performances.\n\n\u201cBeef\u201d has a predominantly Asian cast and has resonated deeply with Asian American viewers for its representation. It also discusses the turmoil of everyday life, the cost of mental health and using repressed emotions such as anger against another individual. The struggles illustrated in the show can be considered a universal experience, allowing the show to reach critical acclaim.\n\n\u201cBeef\u201d centers around Amy Lau and Danny Chou, who clash in a road rage incident and begin a series of conflicts that escalate over time as they damage each other\u2019s lives. Danny struggles to build a name for himself and cannot be comfortable alone and with everyday life, such as finances, job security and identity. Amy cannot find satisfaction in her marriage or in her role as a parent, and her business is also struggling to make a name for itself. They both project their anger and insecurities onto one another in a fight to ruin each other\u2019s lives due to their unhappiness.\n\nThe series rose to acclaimed success due to the performances and the way it challenges stereotypes like the Asian American model minority myth. It sheds light on the Asian American lifestyle and the challenges faced with identity and fitting into the United States, such as Christianity and community among Korean Americans. The show brought more attention to representation among Asians living in America and beyond, which was celebrated and attributed to the show\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cBeef\u201d was praised due to the increased presence and representation of Asians on screen. Its incredible performances by a predominantly Asian cast have exemplified that the industry needs to incorporate these stories so that not only can it be celebrated among the Asian community but also that people outside of the community can understand the complexities and various identities of Asian American culture.\n\nSeeing the success of many titles such as \u201cBeef,\u201d \u201cEverywhere Everything All at Once\u201d and \u201cParasite\u201d is the beginning of a revolution where Hollywood integrates more Asian stories that can be brought to life. The diverse list of winners at this year\u2019s Golden Globes proved that people of color can succeed in the industry and inspire those, like me, to enter entertainment and tell stories about their culture, lifestyle and heritage.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Caitlin Roehmholdt January 15, 2024 at 12:56 pm PST\n\nCalifornia is famous for its beautiful weather, clear blue skies, and warm sun beating down. But what happens when that sun becomes too hot? Temperatures are continuously rising, changing California\u2019s climate. According to the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), in the past 70 years, half of the largest wildfires in the state occurred in just two years. The last two decades have been the driest in the millennium, with temperatures up by an average of 2.5 degrees since 1895.\n\nThe rising temperatures create consequences not only to the planet but also for the people who live on it. Rising heat causes increased air pollution. Major cities are heavily polluted, so the mixture of rising heat in California with air pollution in Los Angeles is unhealthy for everyone, especially for athletes who are constantly training and breathing in the L.A. air.\n\n\u201cWhen the air quality is poor, they [athletes] get exposed to pollutants and contaminants that others may not be exposed to,\u201d said Edward Avol, Professor of Clinical Preventive Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine. \u201cThey tend to work harder and go to higher ventilation rates, so they breathe more air, and because they breathe more air, they take in a higher proportion of pollutants because they\u2019re breathing more heavily for a longer period of time.\u201d\n\nEndurance athletes, like runners, train outside and breathe in this contaminated air every time they run. They compete in both fall and spring seasons, and a lot of their heavy training occurs during the hottest season of the year, summer. The air pollution and rising heat not only affects how these athletes train and perform, but it also impacts their respiratory health.\n\nIf poor air quality or high heat causes extremely unhealthy conditions, coaches will often have their athletes cross-train or have a lighter practice. In fact, according to USC Freshman, track and cross country runner, Angelina Vasquez, the athletes take weekly hydration tests that they must pass in order to practice.\n\n\u201cOur coaches want what\u2019s best for us and they listen to us and if we aren\u2019t feeling too well, they have no problem with saying you can go home that day, or train indoors, like aqua jogging in the pool,\u201d she said.\n\nThese alternative workouts can be beneficial in protecting athletes from heat exhaustion and the air pollutants that they are more at risk of inhaling. Implementing these practices is especially important during seasons that are prone to fires, like the fall.\n\nA study on the Impact of air pollution on running performance reported that high-caliber athletes competing at higher levels of air pollution, even levels below the EPA\u2019s threshold for \u201cgood\u201d air quality, experienced slower race times. They concluded that their findings provide a strong rationale for coaches to consider approaches to minimize air pollution exposure among their athletes.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t feel [the pollution] at practice because we\u2019ve gotten so used to it, but when we went out to the Pac-12 [Cross Country Championship] in Washington, everything felt so much lighter,\u201d Vasquez said.\u201dYou feel so light running, and it shocks you because you\u2019re not used to getting so much clean air.\u201d\n\nMany USC athletes have become accustomed to the poor air quality, but also recognize how their quality of performance is strengthened in better conditions.\n\n\u201cWe practice at the Port of L.A., which is pretty much a lot of tugboats and shipping containers. I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s a polluted area, and the water isn\u2019t as clean as some other areas,\u201d USC Freshman rower, Michaela Banta said.\n\nThe Port of L.A. is heavily polluted and worsening over time. The cancer-causing diesel particulate matter rose 56%, smog-forming nitrogen oxides jumped 54%, and greenhouse gas emissions increased 39% from 2020 to 2022.\n\nTypes of pollutants that cause harm to lung function include, \u201cThe particular kinds of toxicants, including ozone, particulate matter of certain sizes, and nitrogen dioxide. These pollutants, which are associated with among other things, the burning of fossil fuels, or the chemical reactions that take place in the air as a result of the burning of fossil fuels, lead to a number of both short-term and long-term respiratory problems,\u201d Avol said.\n\nHaving athletes train in such a polluted environment is harmful to their lungs. Coaches help athletes stay healthy by encouraging them to take breaks when they\u2019re dehydrated or the air quality is bad.\n\n\u201cMoving to electrification in a clean, sustainable way, is going to help us in the long term and the short term,\u201d Avol said. \u201cWe do this in a deliberate, intelligent way to move away from burning oil and gas, to generating it by solar energy, generating it by wind, or other sustainable means of geothermal energy.\u201d\n\nThese sustainable energy sources can help solve these environmental problems. As temperatures keep changing and air pollution gets worse, the future of USC athletes\u2019 health is at risk.\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson January 15, 2024 at 12:33 pm PST\n\nHe may have waited until the last possible moment, but USC junior quarterback Caleb Williams has officially declared for the NFL Draft, per his Instagram. Today was the last day the former Heisman Trophy winner, or any college underclassman, could submit their name for the NFL Draft, leaving some to speculate whether Williams would return to USC for one more season. Williams put that speculation to rest and is presumed to be the No. 1 overall pick in the late-April draft. The Chicago Bears own that pick thanks to a trade they made with the Carolina Panthers prior to last year\u2019s draft.\n\nThe junior from Washington D.C. ends his college career with 10,082 passing yards, 93 passing touchdowns and 27 rushing touchdowns across three seasons, two with the Trojans and one with the Oklahoma Sooners. When head coach Lincoln Riley jumped from Oklahoma to USC, Williams followed him to Los Angeles. He helped turn around a Trojan team that was 4-8 in 2021 to an 11-3 team in 2022 that was one game away from the school\u2019s first College Football Playoff appearance. Williams became the eighth Trojan to hoist the Heisman Trophy after a historic 2022 campaign. He set multiple records that year, breaking USC\u2019s single-season records for total offense, total touchdowns, most completed passes, lowest interception rate and highest passing efficiency rate.\n\nNow, he will try to carry that success to the NFL, but not before he gave a farewell to both USC and Oklahoma in his Instagram post. \u201cI want to thank Sooner Nation for embracing a kid who came to you from Washington D.C. I cherished my time at OU,\u201d Williams said. \u201cTo my Trojan family, it\u2019s been an honor putting on the cardinal and gold these last two years. I hope I gave you as many good memories as you have given to me. No matter what lies ahead, I will Fight On forever and rep Hornsdown4Life.\u201d\n\nThe timing of Williams\u2019 decision has a similar feel to when he first came to USC, as he did not officially announce his transfer until February 1, 2022 \u2014 despite Riley being named the head coach on November 28, 2021 \u2014 spending over a month in the transfer portal. But \u2014 just as everyone figured Williams would follow Riley to Los Angeles in the end \u2014 it was long assumed he would declare for the draft after opting out of USC\u2019s bowl game. With the move now official, the Trojans will likely turn to redshirt sophomore quarterback Miller Moss to take over the helm from Williams. Williams projects as the 86th Trojan to be selected in the first round of the NFL Draft, which takes place between April 25-27 in Detroit. It would be the fifth year in a row that USC has a player taken in the opening round.\n```"}

It would have been tough to believe that outcome would change this time, considering that the Bruins entered at 14-0 and as the No. 2-ranked team in the nation. It might have been more unbelievable knowing that USC would be missing its starting center and that its freshman phenom would spend several minutes after the game lying on the Galen Center court due to cramps. But freshman guard JuJu Watkins still wanted the mic to address the sold-out crowd for a reason. Watkins screamed, \u201cFight on!\u201d, followed by a massive cheer, after her 32-point, 10-rebound performance led No. 9 USC (13-1, 3-1 Pac-12) to a 73-65 victory over UCLA (14-1, 3-1 Pac-12) on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThis was un-f\u2019ing-believeable,\u201d USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb had said to the crowd shortly before, in a fair assessment of a thriller between the two rivals. Both Gottlieb and UCLA head coach Cori Close marveled at the game\u2019s environment at Galen Center. As much as this win means for USC and Gottlieb\u2019s incredible program rebuild, it might be as meaningful for the sport as a whole in Los Angeles, on the West Coast and around the nation. \u201cThe narrative is changing \u2014 women\u2019s basketball is cool. If you\u2019re not on board, you\u2019re behind,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s exciting, people will come out. L.A. appreciates good basketball.\u201d\n\nUSC was without junior center Rayah Marshall, the Trojans\u2019 leading rebounder and shot blocker, due to illness. In her relief, junior center Clarice Akunwafo made her third start of the season, though she entered Saturday averaging less than three points and three rebounds per game. Interestingly, UCLA sophomore center Lauren Betts \u2014 also one of the premiere bigs in the nation \u2014 did not start either, though she checked in after just two minutes. Betts didn\u2019t appear to be 100%, as her 10 points and three rebounds fell well short of her normal averages. Regardless, even though her stat line doesn\u2019t jump off the page, Close praised Akunwafo for putting together one of her best career performances against Betts when USC badly needed it. Gottlieb was short and sweet in describing Akunwafo\u2019s game: \u201cUnbelievably impressed but not surprised.\u201d\n\nSimilar to these teams\u2019 first contest two weeks ago, it was a rather cagey start full of turnovers and missed shots on both sides. USC and UCLA combined to start just 4-for-25 from the field and 0-for-8 from range, along with nine total turnovers. Graduate guard McKenzie Forbes drained 3-pointers on back-to-back possessions to give USC a 15-6 lead late in the first period. Even as a new Trojan, the offseason transfer is already establishing herself as a Bruin beater. Her 23 points at Pauley Pavilion helped keep USC in that game, and she kept up that momentum by outscoring UCLA by herself in the opening quarter, 9-8.\n\nIn the absence of Marshall, one of the nation\u2019s top defenders, Gottlieb\u2019s answer to the Bruins\u2019 size and scoring was to be relentlessly aggressive. Her team was up to the task, with hands absolutely everywhere on the defensive end to force 15 first-half turnovers that led to 16 Trojan points. Graduate guard Kayla Padilla had two of USC\u2019s eight steals before halftime, both of which came on sneaky takeaways in the Bruin backcourt. \u201cWe stepped out today and were like, we\u2019re going to be the aggressors, we\u2019re going to be the ones causing turnovers,\u201d Forbes said. Gottlieb added that the defensive gameplan remained the same against UCLA \u2014 the Trojans just needed a little more from everyone in Marshall\u2019s absence.\n\nEven when UCLA did get shots off, they weren\u2019t falling. The Bruins\u2019 stud guard trio of graduate Charisma Osborne and sophomores Kiki Rice and Londynn Jones scored just two total points in the first half, missing all eight of their 3-point attempts. Only sophomore forward Gabriela Jaquez could get anything going from outside, making three triples to keep the Bruins in it. \u201cWe talked a lot about Londynn Jones, who has kicked our ass a couple of times in a row,\u201d Gottlieb said, complimenting redshirt sophomore guard Taylor Bigby\u2019s defensive effort on Jones.\n\nIt also didn\u2019t hurt that USC had clearly the best player on the court in Watkins. After a Jaquez three made it a 17-16 game, the Trojans responded with a 15-0 run over the next six minutes; Watkins had eight of those points to finish the half with a game-high 16. Even though she didn\u2019t shoot all that well from the field, Watkins\u2019 ability to get to the free-throw line (and convert) proved to be pivotal. As we\u2019ve come to expect, the star freshman didn\u2019t appear to be phased by the spotlight, making all 16 of her attempts at the charity stripe after drawing 12(!!) fouls. Watkins also added four blocks, three steals and three assists in another complete performance that has become typical for her. And as a L.A. native, it was clear how much the game meant to Watkins, who admitted to not getting much sleep the night before.\n\nAfter trailing 34-19 at the break, the Bruins started to wake up, particularly Osborne, who has also been sick this week, according to Close. Following a scoreless first half, Osborne contributed 15 points to keep the Bruins within ten points entering the final frame. Still, Watkins kept up, scoring 10 of her own in the quarter, plus an emphatic transition block of Osborne. As UCLA continued to hang around, USC\u2019s veterans made their mark. Forbes continued to assert herself in Bruin nightmares with a transition three from the wing, followed by a Padilla triple on the next possession to push the Trojan lead to 13 with five minutes to play. That veteran presence from the pair of Ivy League graduate transfers has complemented Watkins\u2019 youthful playmaking very well this season. \u201cI sometimes refer to it as JuJu and the nerds,\u201d Gottlieb, herself an Ivy Leaguer, joked postgame about her squad\u2019s dynamic.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t quite enough to put UCLA away. The Bruins\u2019 press down the stretch caused numerous issues for the USC offense, leading to easy scores for Jones and Osborne \u2014 who finished with 25 points. Finally, after a final few minutes that featured a seemingly endless amount of jump balls, a Padilla rebound and free throws ensured that the Spirit of Troy would be playing \u201cTusk\u201d after a remarkable upset win for USC. The schedule doesn\u2019t lighten up for the Trojans, who now head east for a road trip in the Rockies. No. 19 Utah is up first for USC on Friday at 6 p.m. PST.\n```"}

The Trojans fell to the Buffaloes 68-58 in Boulder, Colorado, after leading by 13 points at the half. Sophomore guard Oziyah Sellers led the Trojans with 18 points and freshman guard Bronny James got his first career start for USC. The loss snapped USC\u2019s three-game winning streak against Colorado.\n\nUSC is now 7-15 all-time against Colorado and also falls to 8-9 overall this season, 2-4 within the Pac-12. The under .500 record brings notable consequences; only three games separate the third-ranked Pac-12 team from the 10th. USC\u2019s new 2-4 record causes it to now be tied for sixth in conference standings with the Cal Golden Bears.\n\nThe game opened with stellar defense from the Trojans. USC held Colorado to only 24 points in the first half. The Buffaloes closed the half shooting 29% from the field and 2-for-9 from behind the arc. Twenty of the Trojans\u2019 37 points came from the paint and the team shot 45% from the field. USC ended the first half with only two turnovers compared to Colorado\u2019s five.\n\nThat statistic wouldn\u2019t remain a bright spot for long, though. Colorado opened the second half with a newly invigorated defense. The Buffaloes\u2019 more aggressive press defensive style led them to go on a 6-0 run in the first three minutes of the half. Unfortunately for the Trojans, the Buffaloes\u2019 shooting improved as well. The Buffaloes would finish the game 27-for-61 from the field compared to the Trojans\u2019 going 22-for-61.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 Achilles\u2019 heel proved, once again, to be their turnovers. Four turnovers for the Trojans in the first half turned into 10 more turnovers in the second. Colorado made 14 points off of USC\u2019s turnovers and scored 21 fastbreak points for the night. In comparison, USC had only three fastbreak points.\n\nHead coach Andy Enfield was pleased with the discipline and poise of the USC offense in the first half, but was left scratching his head at the Trojans\u2019 turnovers. \u201cOut of those 10 turnovers [in the second half], most of them were just on us,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cUsually the live ball turnovers lead to transition points for the other team, and when you do it that much on their home floor, it\u2019s tough to come back from.\u201d\n\nDespite the loss, two bright spots for USC were the performances from Sellers and sophomore forward Vincent Iwuchukwu. Sellers scored a career-high 18 points in 28 minutes off of the bench. Iwuchukwu scored 10 points, as well as recording seven rebounds, three assists and two blocks. James was quiet from the floor, scoring zero points in 25 minutes, but managed to avoid contributing any turnovers to USC\u2019s total.\n\nEnfield had nothing but praise for Sellers\u2019 career night. \u201cWe need that type of production off of our bench. He played really well. He played very hard and smart, very proud of him,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nThe next opponent for the Trojans are the No. 8 Arizona Wildcats. USC will face Arizona in Tucson as a part of a three-game road trip. The Wildcats are 12-4 overall after suffering a loss against the Washington State Cougars on Saturday night.

Questions are being raised about the Boilermakers\u2019 postseason viability after an upset loss to Nebraska on Tuesday.\n\nNebraska's Brice Williams (3) grabs a rebound over Purdue's Zach Edey (15) in the Cornhuskers' 88-72 victory over Purdue on Tuesday, Jan. 9. (AP/Rebecca S. Gratz)\n\nBy Tripp Carrington January 12, 2024 at 7:31 pm PST\n\nWith a bit over five minutes left in the first half of Tuesday night\u2019s game versus the unranked Nebraska Cornhuskers, Purdue Boilermaker guard Fletcher Loyer knocked down a three-pointer from the top of the key to give Purdue a 25-19 lead. In the remaining 25 minutes of the game, the Boilermakers were outscored by 22 points en route to the end of both their seven-game winning streak and their time atop the AP Poll.\n\nComing into the game, Nebraska sported a formidable 12-2 record, but none of their wins had come against a ranked opponent, much less the No. 1 team in the nation. Conference road losses are not uncommon, but Purdue\u2019s recent history is marked by disappointing upsets like this, especially during the postseason. Is their loss to Nebraska indicative of another incoming trip to March Madness cut short?\n\nConsidering that reigning Naismith Men\u2019s College Player of the Year, 7-foot-4 Zach Edey, wears the Purdue white and gold, another early tournament loss would be a generational letdown. Edey is arguably surpassing his accolade-ridden efforts from last season: he is averaging 22.3 points per game while converting on 63.4% of his field goal attempts. Edey also blocks 2.3 shots per game and grabs over 10 rebounds per game.\n\nAs one of the tallest players in the country, Edey is the giant centerpiece of Purdue\u2019s brilliant start to the season. After his third year with the Boilermakers, fans were unsure whether he would leave Purdue for the NBA draft, but Edey elected to return for his senior campaign. Through 16 games, Edey has led Purdue to a 14-2 record.\n\nThe Boilermakers\u2019 dominance throughout the first half of the season should not surprise fans who follow college basketball all year long. In eight of the last nine seasons, Purdue has earned a bid to the NCAA Tournament, and this is their third consecutive season donning the AP Poll\u2019s top spot for at least one week.\n\nIn fact, since the first season of Matt Painter\u2019s tenure as head coach in 2006, Purdue has earned at least a share of the Big Ten regular season championship in four different seasons, a feat achieved by only eleven other power five teams in the same time frame. The only difference between the Boilermakers and those other schools? Success in March.\n\nSince 2006, those programs have accounted for thirty appearances in the Final Four and eight national titles. The only schools not to reach the Final Four among them are the Arizona Wildcats \u2014 another team plagued by recent NCAA tournament upsets \u2014 and the Boilermakers.\n\nWith consistently excellent play, why hasn\u2019t Purdue been able to reach the Final Four in the Matt Painter era? Since Zach Edey\u2019s freshman season, each of the Boilermakers\u2019 three NCAA tournament losses have come in the form of major upsets against double-digit seeds.\n\nIn 2021, a fourth-seed Purdue lost an overtime battle to a 13-seed North Texas Mean Green team in the round of 64. North Texas ran a three-guard lineup that outscored Purdue\u2019s traditional two-guard lineup 53-35. The next season, when Purdue lost to 15-seed Saint Peter\u2019s Peacocks in the sweet sixteen, they moved to a three-guard lineup. However, their guards were still outscored, and combined for six turnovers.\n\nInfamously, in 2023, Purdue became the second 1-seed in history to lose in the round of 64, with the upset coming against 16-seed Fairleigh Dickinson Knights. With each of their three starting guards from the 2022 NCAA tournament either graduating, transferring, or declaring for the NBA Draft, Purdue started three different guards, two of them freshman, against the Knights. The Boilermakers\u2019 guard woes from years\u2019 past continued \u2014 their twelve turnovers were triple the turnover output of Fairleigh Dickinson\u2019s guards, and their guards were also outscored by 24 points.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Purdue\u2019s starting guards were similarly inefficient, shooting a measly 34% from the floor with a combined nine turnovers. Fortunately, this performance is atypical for the Boilermakers this year. Braden Smith has played a particularly key supplementary role this season, averaging 12.8 points and 6.7 assists per game.\n\nHowever, he was part of the Boilermaker guards\u2019 disastrous performance against Fairleigh Dickinson, missing eight of his ten field goal attempts and coughing up seven turnovers. Regardless of Purdue\u2019s regular season success, who\u2019s to say Smith and the rest of Purdue\u2019s guards will overcome the patterns of their disappointing tournament performances?\n\nSmith has upped his scoring output by about three points per game this season, and has improved his 3-point percentage from a respectable 37.6% to an otherworldly 47.9%. Purdue\u2019s other returning starting guard, sophomore Fletcher Loyer, has also improved his 3-point stroke, going from 32.6% to 40.3%.\n\nThese improvements in shooting could be the difference between winning and disappointing against inferior competition in the postseason. Still, shooting percentages over the course of the season fail to fully account for the game-to-game variance (in other words, shooting luck) that plagues every team on both sides of the ball.\n\nFor example, Nebraska made a blistering 60.3% of their three-point attempts against Purdue. Regardless of Purdue\u2019s guards or Zach Edey, it would be nearly impossible to defend a team shooting that well from beyond the arc. Whether or not Purdue will be at the mercy of a similar shooting performance in the NCAA tournament is entirely unpredictable.\n\nRegardless, their returning guards have generally made improvements since last season that suggest that Purdue is closer than ever before to avoiding postseason mistakes that are within their control. Although it will likely take a trip to the Final Four to convince naysayers of Purdue\u2019s standing as one of the nation\u2019s premier college basketball programs, the Boilermakers are undeniably off to a historic start to the season, even including their loss to Nebraska.\n\nWith all eyes on the nation\u2019s top team, will Purdue\u2019s guards be able to support Zach Edey in the NCAA Tournament? That question can\u2019t be answered until March.\n```"}

The margins of the game of inches are now even closer, with rosters stacked with Pro-Bowlers and the league\u2019s best coaches going at it, and thus, let\u2019s delve into non-QB players in every matchup who could be key difference makers, or X-Factors, in getting their team the win and a step closer to a Super Bowl victory.\n\nCleveland Browns vs. Houston Texans: Texans running back Devin Singletary\n\nThe weekend\u2019s first playoff matchup sees an ascending Houston Texans team face the battle-tested Cleveland Browns, who, despite now fielding their fourth quarterback and fourth and fifth-string tackles in the midst of an avalanche of injuries, have still soared to an impressive 11-6 record off the back of a historic defensive season (the Browns defense ranks second in expected points added at 105.92). On the other sideline, Texans rookie quarterback C.J. Stroud has been a firecracker, ranking eighth in passing yards (4,108) and sixth in passer rating (100.8) among all quarterbacks. Yet while Stroud has been sensational, this is his first playoff game against one of the most dominant defenses of the decade, making it likely that the Texans will look to protect him through the run game. Enter Texans running back Devin Singletary, who\u2019s quietly had a solid year in Houston as the Texans\u2019 lead back, rushing for 898 yards at a respectable 4.2 yards per carry. An undersized back with average athleticism, he wins with tremendous patience and vision behind the line of scrimmage, not always hitting triples or home runs but almost always getting on base. Here he is, for example, showing good patience and processing to read the play side linebacker crashing inside on an inside zone run and bouncing the play outside for a 24-yard gain in Week 17\u2032s game versus the Tennessee Titans.\n\nA big Singletary performance would go a long way toward simplifying the game for C.J. Stroud, as it would set up the play-action game and limit obvious passing downs for the rookie quarterback, yet leaning on the former Buffalo Bill may also just be the best way to attack the Browns defense \u2014 while the unit is tied for first in yards per play allowed (4.6), it ranks 20th best in yards allowed per rush (4.3). Look for the Texans to lean on Singletary to protect Stroud and take advantage of the Browns\u2019 exposable run defense.\n\nMiami Dolphins vs. Kansas City Chiefs: Dolphins running back Raheem Mostert\n\nBefore the season, the prospect of a Miami Dolphins vs Kansas City Chiefs playoff game would have broken the internet. The Chiefs dynasty facing the AFC\u2019s newest Super Bowl contender. Tyreek Hill returning to Arrowhead for his revenge game. Two of the game\u2019s best offensive minds in Andy Reid and Mike McDaniel going at it. Fast forward to the playoffs, and now we have both teams facing off in Wild Card Weekend, with the Chiefs offense looking like a shell of its former self and the Dolphins\u2019 once-stacked roster deteriorating by the minute with injuries. It\u2019s tempting to label all-world Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill as the X-Factor here, as he\u2019s by far the Dolphins\u2019 most valuable player and returning to a former home where he put up 6,630 yards and 62 touchdowns over six seasons, yet the fact that this game will be played in potentially record-breaking low temperatures (the \u201cfeels like\u201d temperature is expected to be around -20 to -30 degrees at kickoff) indicate it could be more of a run-fest than fans might anticipate. We thus turn to Dolphins running back Raheem Mostert, who has been a star in his own right this season, ranking first among all backs in rush touchdowns (18) and tenth best in rush yards (1,012) at an impressive 4.8 yards per carry. Mostert is a tremendous athlete and processor who, despite having suffered two high ankle sprains, three knee sprains, and a torn meniscus throughout his career, still looks like one of the most explosive players in the league at 31 years old.\n\nIn a game that\u2019s expected to be played in blizzard-like conditions, running the ball will be paramount, and thus Mostert should have a big role. He\u2019s coming off a two-week absence from knee and ankle injuries, but the team expects him to be fresh and ready to go on Sunday. If he can help the Dolphins establish the run against a Chiefs defense which ranks 25th in yards allowed per attempt, the Dolphins could control the game well enough to leave the blizzard in Arrowhead with a win.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers vs. Buffalo Bills: Steelers outside linebacker Alex Highsmith\n\nDespite looking dead in the water in Week 15 after three straight losses, the Pittsburgh Steelers turned things around during the home stretch of the regular season, winning three straight to sneak into the playoffs as a seventh seed. They face a hot Buffalo Bills team which, despite being labeled by the media as vastly inferior to the Bills teams of years past, finished the year fifth in total yards per play on offense (5.7) and fourth best in yards allowed on defense (5.1). The Bills playing at home coming off an emotional victory over the rival Miami Dolphins make them heavy favorites. Yet when you play Josh Allen, you always have a chance. For as good as the Buffalo quarterback has been this year, ranking fourth in passing yards (4,306) and sixth in touchdowns among all quarterbacks (29), he\u2019s also been a turnover machine, tossing the second most interceptions (18) and losing seven fumbles. Making Josh Allen uncomfortable will thus be paramount, and this is where Alex Highsmith comes in. With three-time All-Pro outside linebacker TJ Watt out with an MCL sprain, somebody on the defensive line will have to step up, and there\u2019s no better candidate than the fourth-year rusher. The former Charlotte 49er has developed into a force on the defensive line for the yellow and black, recently earning a 68-million-dollar extension. Highsmith is undersized for an EDGE defender at 6\u20324, 242 pounds, yet he wins with extraordinary quickness and bend around the edge.\n\nHighsmith has played second fiddle to Watt throughout his time in Pittsburgh, yet if he can step up and put the front on his back to make Josh Allen uncomfortable and help force a turnover or two, the Steelers D may give their offense just enough opportunities to keep the game close and potentially steal a win.\n\nGreen Bay Packers vs. Dallas Cowboys: Packers wide receiver Jayden Reed\n\nNo two teams facing off this weekend could be more different from one another than the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys. On one sideline, you have an experienced Cowboys team in the final stages of its current build with a veteran quarterback, a fourth-year All-Pro level receiver reaching his peak, and a tightly-knit defense that has wrecked the NFL for three years straight. On the other, you have the Green Bay Packers, the youngest team in the league, fielding a first-year starter at quarterback, receiver and tight end rooms filled with rookies and second-year players and a young defense that has yet to find its footing. This Packers team is an exciting but mostly inexperienced group, and it will need another of its young stars to continue to step up to have any shot at a victory: rookie receiver Jayden Reed. With the rest of the Packers\u2019 receiving corps battling injuries \u2014 Christian Watson dealing with a hamstring problem and Romeo Doubs coming off a hospitalization after a scary chest injury against the Chicago Bears \u2014 it will be up to Reed to build off his career performance against the Bears last week and continue to step up as Jordan Love\u2019s No. 1 option. The Michigan State product has been reliable from the slot for the Packers, leading the team in receiving yards (793) and yards per game (46.9). For a rookie, he\u2019s shown high football IQ in his route running, displaying the ability to set up corners, and the athleticism to stretch the field both vertically and horizontally.\n\nIf Reed can continue his hot run and help mask his fellow receivers\u2019 banged-up state, ascending passer Jordan Love may have just enough to work with to go blow-for-blow with the Cowboys and send America\u2019s team home early for the 28th consecutive year.\n\nLos Angeles Rams vs. Detroit Lions: Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald\n\nRams vs. Lions promises to by far be the most cinematic matchup of Wild Card Weekend with quarterbacks Matthew Stafford and Jared Goff both facing their former teams. Stafford returns to Ford Field with the Super Bowl ring he never got close to sniffing in Detroit. Jared Goff takes the field hungry to prove to former head coach Sean McVay and the Rams organization that he has what it takes to lead a Super Bowl-winning team. Yet, in addition to the game\u2019s storytelling implications for both offenses, the matchup promises to be a points fest as it sees two of the league\u2019s best offenses go at it, with both units ranking in the top ten in yards per play and expected points added. On the flip side, the Rams and Lions\u2019 defenses have been unimpressive at best, with both failing to crack the top half of the league in yards allowed and points per game, thus setting up a wonderful duel between Stafford and Goff and their respective offenses. While the whole nation focuses on the offenses, the game will be decided by whatever defense steps up at the right time, and I have my money on Los Angeles because of one man: Aaron Donald. He may be having a quiet season by his standards, but make no mistake about it, Donald is still one of the five best defensive players in the league, able to beat any offensive lineman with uncanny athleticism and pass-rushing technique.\n\nThe Lions offensive line is one of the better units in the NFL, ranking fourth-best in sacks allowed (31), yet their weakest player happens to be fourth-year guard Jonah Jackson, whom Donald will be seeing plenty of. If Donald can put the Rams defense on his back and roll back the years to his playoff form from two years ago, the Rams will likely leave Detroit with a win.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Buccaneers wide receiver Chris Godwin\n\nIn what a month ago would have seemed like a sure-fire win for Philadelphia, Monday Night Football\u2019s Eagles vs. Buccaneers matchup could be much closer than previously anticipated, with the Eagles on a downward spiral and the Buccaneers getting hot at the right time, having won five of their last six. The Eagles have suffered greatly from their own success in 2022, with their new coordinators failing to live up to Jonathan Gannon and Shane Steichen\u2019s masterful work last year and the roster, particularly the defense, now regressing after losing most of its linebacking corps to free agency and the corners losing their step with age. On the other sideline, you have a frisky Buccaneers team that surpassed pre-season expectations to win the NFC South title and has quarterback Baker Mayfield playing the best football of his pro career \u2014 his 4,044 pass yards and 28 touchdowns are both career highs. With the Eagles\u2019 offense likely to get theirs due to the talent on their roster and the fact that the Buccaneers defense has been average at best on the year, the Bucs\u2019 key to victory will likely be with its offense keeping pace with its counterpart. This is where Chris Godwin comes in, who being more of the underneath-intermediate threat in the Buccaneers offense, could have a field day picking on the Eagles\u2019 second-string corner and linebacking corps, all of which have massively disappointed this year. Godwin may be the 1B to perennial Pro-Bowler Mike Evans\u2019 1A in Tampa Bay, yet he\u2019s still a formidable option who would be a wide receiver one on plenty of NFL teams. His nuanced route running and short-area quickness make him a devastating matchup against slot corners and safeties, as seen on this fourth-quarter rep of the Bucs\u2019 game against the San Francisco 49ers where he easily beats 49ers standout corner Charvarius Route on a dig route.\n\nWith the Eagles\u2019 number one corner Darius Slay on Mike Evans, struggling veteran James Bradberry will likely travel most with Godwin, a matchup he could feast on all game. When he lines up farther inside, picking on Shaquille Leonard and Zach Cunningham could allow the Bucs to march down the field and keep up with the Eagles.\n```"}

(AP/Eric Gay)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner and Sullivan Maley January 12, 2024 at 3:37 pm PST\n\nWashington\u2019s Kalen DeBoer, who took the Huskies from sub-.500 to contending for the CFP National Championship in just two seasons as head coach, has agreed to become the next head football coach at the University of Alabama, reported ESPN\u2019s Pete Thamel on Friday. Nick Saban has coached the Crimson Tide since 2007, winning six national championships and producing 44 first round NFL Draft selections. He announced his retirement following Alabama\u2019s 27-20 loss to Michigan in the Rose Bowl, and many names emerged as his possible replacement, including Ole Miss\u2019 Lane Kiffin, Texas\u2019 Steve Sarkisian, Oregon\u2019s Dan Lanning and Florida State\u2019s Mike Norvell.\n\nDeBoer started his head coaching career at Sioux Falls before transitioning to smaller roles at Southern Illinois, Eastern Michigan, Fresno State and Indiana over the span of a decade. In 2020, he got back into head coaching, accepting the job at Fresno State. Inheriting a lackluster team amidst the COVID-19 pandemic wasn\u2019t easy, but DeBoer rapidly improved the Bulldogs to be a winning squad. In 2021, Fresno State went 10-3 and won its first bowl game since 2018.\n\nDeBoer\u2019s success at Fresno State attracted the attention of Power 5 teams, and in 2022, DeBoer became the Washington Huskies\u2019 next head coach. DeBoer instantly turned Washington into an elite team, following a disappointing 4-8 season the year prior. In 2022, DeBoer led the Huskies to a stout 11-2 record and a Valero Alamo Bowl win over Texas. In 2023, the Huskies took the college football world by storm, going undefeated before falling short to Michigan in the National Championship game. DeBoer took home the Associated Press College Football Coach of the Year award, once again displaying his resilience at the helm of such an elite team.\n\nNow, his focus shifts to the Crimson Tide, a team that has had plenty of buzz surrounding the transfer portal since the season\u2019s end. While both Kiffin and Sarkisian have had stints at Alabama and have experience within Saban\u2019s system, DeBoer\u2019s long-lasting success embodies the Crimson Tide\u2019s long standing culture of winning at all costs. DeBoer may not have NFL coaching experience or a lengthy head coaching resume like some other candidates, but he\u2019s proven that his intelligence on the sidelines can produce wins immediately.\n\nNonetheless, Saban\u2019s shoes are big ones to fill. At 72 years old, Saban has seen it all, and while his retirement marks the end of a dominant era for Alabama football, it also is the start of something new and refreshing for the Tide.\n\nSophomore wide receiver Isaiah Bond, who etched his name in Bama football history with a last-minute 4th-and-31 touchdown to defeat Auburn in this year\u2019s Iron Bowl, was the first Alabama player to enter the portal following Saban\u2019s retirement. Without any commitment decision from Bond yet, it is possible that he could stay in Tuscaloosa following the news of DeBoer\u2019s hire. Bond had the second-most receiving yards for the Crimson Tide in 2023 with 668.\n\nNumerous other impact players for the Tide have entered their names into the transfer portal, including Alabama\u2019s second-leading rusher, senior running back Roydell Williams, as well as senior star offensive lineman Seth McLaughlin, who has committed to Ohio State.\n\nAs for Washington, star junior cornerback Jabbar Muhammad, who is coming off of a breakout season for the Huskies, entered the portal soon after news broke of DeBoer\u2019s hire. This would be a huge addition to the Alabama defense especially considering the departure of one of the nation\u2019s top corners, Kool-Aid McKinstry, for the NFL Draft. However, there is speculation that Muhammad would want to join his cousin, Malik Muhammad, at Texas.\n\nWhile Saban\u2019s retirement briefly saw the Crimson Tide in a coachless, declining position, the hiring of DeBoer should breathe new life into Alabama football, especially on offense.\n```"}

Collier sustained the injury trying to steal the basketball in the second half of Wednesday night\u2019s loss to Washington State. In 16 games this season, Collier has averaged 15.4 points, 2.6 rebounds, 4.1 assists (team-high) and 1.3 steals. Last Saturday, Collier had a career-high 26 points in a 93-79 win over Stanford.\n\nThe loss of Collier could not come at a worse time for the Trojans, who are trying to turn around their season. After Wednesday night\u2019s loss, the Trojans dropped to 8-8 and sit tied for sixth in the Pac-12, with their March Madness hopes slowly slipping. The injury bug has plagued the Trojans all season, affecting the rhythm of practices and games.\n\n\u201cWe have had so many practices where we have six, seven, eight guys that are available because of the injuries and sicknesses throughout the season,\u201d Enfield said Wednesday night. \u201cIt really takes a toll on your efficiency on both sides of the ball.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Collier, USC is dealing with other afflictions from redshirt senior forward Joshua Morgan (illness) and fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis (hamstring). Morgan\u2019s timeline is unclear, and Ellis seems to be playing through a bad hamstring.\n\nWith Collier gone, head coach Andy Enfield will have to find someone to fill the shoes of a consensus top-five pick in this year\u2019s NBA Draft. His options are likely between sophomore guard Oziyah Sellers and freshman guard Bronny James. While Sellers has been with the program a year longer, James has shown more of an ability to be both a playmaker and scorer, affecting the game in many ways. In eight games, James has averaged 5.9 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 1.5 assists while providing great defense on the other end.\n\nAnd for the Trojans, the uphill battle gets even more challenging with the schedule ahead. On an upcoming three-game road stretch, USC will face two of the top three teams in the Pac-12 standings: Associated Press No. 8 Arizona and Arizona State. Trojans begin the road trip on Saturday with a clash versus the Colorado Buffaloes (11-5, 2-3 Pac-12) at 7 p.m.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/01/11/notes-on-a-dying-form/", "response": "```\nNotes on a dying form\n\nBy Lyla Bhalla-Ladd January 11, 2024 at 11:13 am PST\n\nMy first summer in New York, a professor of mine set me up to meet an old student of his, now a New York Times Editor, to chat about my journalism degree and her career path. After a tour of the newsroom, and some elbow-rubbing with the masthead, she sat me down in a conference room and advised me to pick a new career. It was Red Smog Day in New York, and journalism was dead.\n\nThe Current Temperature. My reaction around such industry cynicism was less shock and more disappointment. In my own undergraduate classes, I have been bombarded with other forms of apocalypse propaganda\u2014collapsing job markets, professors advising careers in corporate comms and PR over chasing reporting internships. I did not imagine working journalists, especially those at the Newspaper of Record, to be ready to jump ship themselves, and even be so sure as to advise the same to a young journalist.\n\nHowever, as I said, I was not shocked. Journalism, an already unpopular major, has become an even less desirable career path. The median annual earnings of a bachelor\u2019s of journalism graduate within three years of graduation is $40,800. It doubles for master\u2019s degrees, but only for graduates from the top programs. Of those undergraduate journalism majors, only about 15% become editors, news analysts, reporters, or correspondents early in their careers.\n\nThe evidence of a shrinking industry seems clear, but I always assumed that active professionals would be more optimistic about their own careers. With advice to jump ship from some of the most successful journalists in the country, I wonder where have all the journalists gone?\n\nAll Roads Lead to Tech. The sentiment around newsroom layoffs and newspaper closings offers one, bleak narrative about where journalism is headed: down the sinkhole of technological innovation. Since 2008, newsroom employment has sunk by 26% in the US. Of those, midcareer news workers (those ages 35 to 54) were hit the hardest. But while newspapers have steep job losses, digital news and broadcasting companies have actually grown, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nAlongside digital news, freelancing is the growing trend. From 1987 to 2016, the number of journalists hired as freelancers increased from 5% to 17% of the total group, thus permanent contracts are fewer and farther between. With AI\u2019s invention and exponential progress, the future looks even darker. The AP uses AI for \u201cevent detection.\u201d A study by Young and Hermida in 2015 found that the LA Times was engaging in what the authors called \u201ccomputational journalism\u201d, the use of the newspaper\u2019s Homicide Report and Data Desk to generate material for news stories, if not always the final copy.\n\nAs audiences flock to online forums, journalists seem to follow them. Whether through reimagining physical newspapers to online articles, or actually changing the writing styles to reflect attention economies, and therefore click-bait culture, the industry is rightfully panicked about the slippery slope of writing for the sake of growing readership rather than protecting, informing, and empowering a readership.\n\nThe panic ensuing is reminiscent of the 2016 election cycle and calls of the death of democracy. Journalism\u2019s new business model, supported heavily by freelancers, paired with the threat of robot-journalists formulating news briefs is too easy of a dystopian fantasy for us to fall for. AI has the most powerful implications for the entire industry of journalism since the invention of the internet. Its research capabilities will maximize production and speed, and revolutionize what it means to write clean copy.\n\nA news startup, Semafor, is using AI to proofread stories, a job typically reserved for a copy editor. Journalists, especially student journalists, are wondering what happened to that copy editor. However, while AI will effectively replace many intern duties, it will not replace true reporting. Some may call the advent of AI the death of print. Others, like Pulitzer-Prize finalist Les Zaitz, call it an \u201cevolution.\u201d\n\nZaitz maintains technological advancements will strengthen journalism\u2019s reach and quality. This new assistant will help create the modern format, but we will always need solid community reporting, done by people who understand the human need for communication. We are social beings. We live on the stories we tell ourselves, and those we tell others. Journalism serves to scale this human need, and thus it has to adapt as we do.\n\nVictor Pickard wrote for the Columbia Journalism Review, \u201cWe need a paradigm shift so we\u2019re not just seeing journalism as a business, but we\u2019re seeing it as an essential public service, which democracy absolutely requires regardless of whether the market will support it.\u201d Truly, the modern format is a dynamic idea, and will adapt as our society and systems grow. Tech is just another tool, and it won\u2019t replace us, not even interns.\n\n\u201cI reject the premise that there aren\u2019t journalism jobs,\u201d says Zaitz. \u201cI think people who are making those kinds of assessments aren\u2019t out in the field.\u201d Zaitz mentions how many papers, including his own, Oregon Capital Chronicle, regularly scout for young talent. \u201cThe newspaper business has been its own worst enemy when it comes to recruiting,\u201d says Zaitz, and he\u2019s right. Publications simultaneously report on AI\u2019s capabilities to replace itself while putting up job postings.\n\nAll that this catastrophizing coverage does is confuse audiences, and push them away\u2014a lesson we should have learned after the last election cycle.\n\nLack of Trust in the Media\n\nWhat we cannot expect out of readers is to be avid and motivated patrons of the press after the 2016 election cycle. Since news media shifted to 24-hour news cycles, there has been a lean towards a narrativization of facts. Narrativization occurs when a journalist injects a more fantastical, more digestible, more marketable story onto a news piece that simply does not have that tone in reality.\n\nIt sensationalizes reality in an attempt to elicit emotional responses from audiences, and ultimately promote views. One paper even called this as \u201cmanufactured hysteria.\u201d This is largely due to a business model relying on constant views and constant clicks, to fund stations and publications. While it is natural to storyline, doing so motivated by what will get readers to open a story or stay on a channel creates a subtext of dramatization due to the \u201cif it bleeds, it leads\u201d methods left over from the 1890s.\n\nThis method seeped into the political coverage of the presidential elections because the news media overemphasized each fact in order to keep readers engaged, but rather hooked, on each step of the primaries, debates, and election nights. Narrativization is also seeping into journalistic writing as the debate around objectivity arises.\n\nGenerations of journalists have been raised on the idea that articles should simply be collections of verified, relevant facts, presented to the public to help inform them as citizens. However, my generation of journalists has been taught that objectivity can be the guise underneath real bias and both-sides-ism lives.\n\nThe reality is that many facts can be valid, and yet not properly contextualized, or representative of larger themes. Journalists can also report quotes from both sides of a debate, and weigh them equally in an article, leaving readers to believe that equal footing is representative of the support behind each view.\n\nPopular in the 2016 election, giving journalistic coverage to certain underground opinions, becomes a tactic for gaining free press if one\u2019s voice is inflammatory enough. It is a journalist\u2019s job to pursue information beyond the quickest, easiest expression. Beyond facts, there is truth.\n\nThese years muddied the waters of what it means to trust your local and national broadcast and paper. With trust gone, even fewer have faith in journalism\u2019s longevity. But to examine trust, is to examine truth, and that should be the larger concern of journalists.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a Journalist?\n\nThe first thing you learn in journalism school is that fact is king. Facts, objectively provable, are the touchstones of any good story, and should anchor every piece. What the most recent election, alongside the internet revolution, proved to journalists and audiences alike is that fact and truth differ.\n\nFacts are numbers, names, places, and dates. Facts are confirmable, searchable, or undeniable. Truth, however, is a much larger burden on a writer to find. Truth requires knowledge, context, compassion, and humility to find.\n\nWhat we have come to know now, is that facts have a shelf-life. As the internet expands, the possibility to collect and manipulate data has left journalists susceptible to lazy research and one-dimensional coverage. Any single idea can be proven with dozens of reference links to support it, so how can truth ever be found in the noise?\n\nFinding truth among all of the facts and perspectives is about having a broader understanding of people and how they work. Journalists must be uniquely prepared to see people for their motivations and flaws. Truth must be accomplished out of a duty to inform, not a cash-grab at headlines.\n\nTruth is not easily found, and requires due time to parse. The 24-hour news cycle convinces writers and readers alike that any news now is better than quality news later. In many facets of modern life we are impatient, but in our news cycle, for our own sake, we must prioritize getting the story right before letting it falsely fester within the culture.\n\nA correction is never heard as loud as the story. The burden of truth is a heavy weight to place on any one group, but this is why the journalists have an exceptionally noble profession, one we should not take likely to being laid off by the hundreds, replaced by robots, or completely mistrusted.\n\nWith Journalists Gone, Who\u2019s Going to Remember You?\n\nWith all of these perceived threats to journalism, I wonder if we are aware of the necessity of cultural communication and reporting. Journalists, whether they are all laid off this year or not, are important to society. We have a core skill beyond simply gathering information and making it digestible.\n\nJournalists are the keepers of history which is alive. The privilege and responsibility to note history as it unfolds is valued beyond pendulum swings that favor business models over cultural needs. Journalists help people matter. Writers expose, afflict, comfort, and aid those whom otherwise may become forgotten.\n\n\u201cA well-functioning democratic society is always going to be hungry for credible sources of information,\u201d Zaitz added. I argue, even a poorly-functioning anything is hungry for credible, relevant information to keep wheels turning. Communication is the modern currency because the knowledge is power. Without knowing, we are unimportant.\n\nWhere to?\n\nIn my own journey to understand the value of my journalism degree, I have sought guidance from older peers and inspiring alumni. While some encouraged me to jump head first and deny the cynicism, others were content with assuming their journalism career would be short-lived and were soon preparing to enter corporate comms or PR.\n\nThinking back to my meeting with the editor at the New York Times, I wonder how lost we may be if even the Newspaper of Record has hopeless editors. I have found I disagree with this editor. Journalism is important whether or not the New York Times closes. Even if every paper shut down, journalists are needed.\n\nThe business model is uncertain, but do not fold underneath capitalist or even modernist pressures that the world will never be the same. Human beings need to communicate, and now that we are older, we will find new ways to do it. Set soft goals for humanity. We may not always have the paper hard copy, but we will always have muck-raking, eager, good-willed writers trying to tell you what you need to know.\n```"}

But, without air \u2014 bread will never rise. That\u2019s how the artisanal sourdough bakery Out of Thin Air got its name in early 2022. Founder Alessandro Jang said his wife let him transform their kitchen into an industrial bread commissary with their life savings. \u201cOne loaf turned into two... three, four \u2014 and then I outgrew that little oven,\u201d said 32-year-old Jang, who only advertises by word of mouth. \u201cPeople just kept buying it.\u201d\n\nHis unique Korean-Argentinian fusion flavors caught on; the sesame gochujang loaf almost always sells out first at farmers markets. The hearty, sesame-topped sourdough is enriched with garlic confit, green onion and gochujang, a fermented Korean chili paste that adds a pleasant, subtle kick of spice. A typical workday starts at 3 a.m. Loaves are kneaded, shaped and baked before 8 a.m. to ensure only the freshest product is sent out to restaurants, hotels and farmers markets across Los Angeles.\n\nBesides the sesame gochujang, Out of Thin Air boasts three other sourdough flavors: black sesame, rosemary polenta porridge and a classic country loaf. Not to mention, an olive oil-laden Fougasse, crisp Ciabatta and Baguette, which is Jang\u2019s current favorite. But, bread is simply an apparatus for Jang. Jang said his company\u2019s true mission is to raise awareness and address the challenges of substance abuse, addiction, and recovery in Los Angeles.\n\nAs a recovering addict himself, Jang found purpose in baking sourdough loaves for his friends and family during the pandemic. Recovery \u2014 like baking \u2014 takes time, patience, and community to lean on for support. At Out of Thin Air, Jang only hires people recovering from alcohol addictions, who can learn to better take care of themselves. \u201cThat kind of discipline takes more than just one job,\u201d said Jang. \u201cIt takes a community of people looking out for you.\u201d\n\nAfter apprenticing with several bakeries across Los Angeles \u2014 like Clark Street, where he worked up from being a cashier \u2014 Jang decided to branch off and start his own business. He turned to the place that saved his life before: his former rehabilitation center. There, Jang met 38-year-old Anthony Kang, who is now Out of Thin Air\u2019s market manager. He oversees the weekly farmer market booths at the University of Southern California, Altadena, Atwater Village, and other Southern California locations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s come a long way in a very fast time,\u201d said Kang. \u201c[Jang] started out literally baking from his living room, with a tiny three-deck oven. Now, we\u2019re in a commissary kitchen.\u201d Kang said it\u2019s essential for people recovering from substance abuse to learn basic responsibilities such as time management and achieving financial independence after rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cBread is just an avenue for us because we\u2019re bakers by trade,\u201d said Jang, who spent a decade battling drug addiction before starting Out of Thin Air. \u201cBut, our trade doesn\u2019t define what we do or who we are.\u201d Jang works alongside one or two other bakers every morning in a rented, commercial kitchen space, shared with a few other small businesses. The Out of Thin Air team is small, but mighty \u2014 five total, including Jang. While he hopes to expand soon, Jang\u2019s top priority remains paying his employees a liveable wage.\n\n\u201cHave you seen \u2018The Bear\u2019?\u201d Jang jokes as opens the walk-in refrigerator. I\u2019ll admit, the resemblance between Jang and award-winning chef Carmy is uncanny. However, unlike Carmy\u2019s destructive inclinations, Jang won\u2019t get stuck, and the Out of Thin Air team will always be there for each other.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/01/11/the-queer-hooligans-of-las-rugby-scene/", "response": "```\nThe queer hooligans of L.A.\u2019s rugby scene\n\nRebellion Rugby prides itself on being inclusive \u2013 and on not being the only ones\n\nIt is a balmy fall evening in Los Angeles. The Griffith Park Ferraro Fields are ever so slightly damp, field soft enough that the rugby players putting on their cleats won\u2019t have to worry about hitting the ground too hard in a tackle. The sky is orange-gray with light pollution and big mosquitoes flit over the pitch. A low hum of chatter animates the square of grass while on other fields in the park, separated by a tall chain link fence, soccer and softball teams finish up their own practices. It\u2019s eight p.m. and these players are just getting ready to start. They\u2019ll be here for two hours, well after most of the other pitches off of this little loop of parking lots by the Los Angeles Zoo are dark and empty.\n\nA few dozen players have gotten their boots on and sweatshirts off. They begin to stretch, rolling out ankles and tossing a couple of rugby balls around. The difference between this practice and that of hundreds of other rugby clubs across the state isn\u2019t the time, or the field, or the plays they practice \u2013 it\u2019s the team itself. The L.A. Rebellion rugby club prides itself on being inclusive of all genders, all sexualities and all levels of experience.\n\n\u201cIt was the year 2000,\u201d said club founder Gabriel Galluccio, recalling the formation of the team. That was a tumultuous year for queer rights. Following waves of forward movement in the previous three decades, the United States began to see social, political and legislative limitations on LGBTQ+ progress. Legislation was on the ballot in multiple states, most notably California, where Galluccio was in 2000. In March of that year, Californians voted to enact Proposition 22, a measure affirming the belief that marriage could only be between a man and a woman. Voters in states like Mississippi solidified homophobic legislation. It would be 15 years before same gender marriage was legalized across the United States.\n\nThere was also a response to this backlash from the LGBTQ+ community at the time: in April of 2000, the Millennium March on Washington saw tens of thousands of people flocking to the nation\u2019s capital. Queer people found joy in community, Pride celebrations and \u2013 in the case of Galluccio \u2013 rugby.\n\nLooking out over the players who have finished kitting up and are starting warmups, Galluccio continues, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel comfortable coming out \u2013 I wanted to play rugby and I didn\u2019t feel that if I was going to be out that the guys on the team would be comfortable with me playing.\u201d Galluccio was playing soccer at the time, winning medals with his team, and he wanted that experience for a rugby team where no one on the team would have to be in the closet.\n\nBy fall of 2001, the L.A. Rebellion had enough players to register as a club. One day before 9/11, they registered the club; the next day, a San Francisco Fog player named Mark Bingham died crashing the plane into the fields of Pennsylvania to thwart the terrorism plot. \u201cAlmost immediately, all the clubs start to get in touch. We\u2019re about eight clubs in the world at that time, and really organize a new tournament under his name,\u201d said Galluccio. Out of this tragedy, the Bingham Cup was born. That year, the gay-inclusive rugby teams marched in Pride holding photos of Bingham.\n\n\u201cMark was a national hero. And there was a great euphoria about it in the community because it validated it \u2013 it actually was a great doorway to start the community of gay rugby.\u201d More and more clubs formed: San Francisco, London, New York, Dallas. The organization International Gay Rugby has about 180 rugby clubs around the world now, Galluccio said.\n\nThe inspiration for an inclusive rugby team \u2013 not to mention a gay rugby league \u2013 lies in Galluccio\u2019s past. He grew up in Argentina under a dictatorship. He says he had no concept of being gay, that he didn\u2019t even know the words for it other than as a joke or an insult. \u201cWhen I was growing up ... culturally in Argentina at that time, we were during a military rule. People were getting killed for political ideology,\u201d said Galluccio. \u201cThere was no visibility of an option of being homosexual, other than being a comedic drag queen. And so I have no reference of the possibility of an athletic man being attracted to another man.\u201d\n\nHis experience of being a gay was a \u201cphysical reaction,\u201d one that he says was entirely biological. Galluccio holds himself as proof that being gay isn\u2019t a choice or a decision \u2013 if it were, how would he have chosen it when he didn\u2019t know the choice existed? As a young boy, Galluccio was always athletic, playing rugby and practicing judo. After he left Argentina, he found himself first in Brazil and eventually in San Francisco. Even as he became more comfortable with himself and more understanding of his own experiences, Galluccio felt for a long time that he could not share this part of his life with his rugby mates.\n\n\u201cStill, I wasn\u2019t able or I didn\u2019t feel that I could tell my rugby mates that I played rugby with that I was gay,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt I had to keep it in the closet, because it was something that I wasn\u2019t sure I could do. If they knew that I was gay ...\u201d He shrugged, helpless.\n\nThe \u201cirony\u201d of it, Galluccio said, was that when he played a former team with the Rebellion in 2003, his old rugby mates were simply overjoyed to learn that he had started this new club. He hadn\u2019t felt safe coming to them just a few years before, but their reaction was positive, accepting, one of true rugby camaraderie.\n\nThe year 2000 was a different time, for all that it wasn\u2019t that long ago. The Rebellion is seeing to it that the future of rugby looks different for people of all orientations, gender identities and experiences. One of those people is Charli Gross, the incoming organization development and inclusion chair for the Rebellion. Gross is relatively new to rugby, having only started playing the sport when the pandemic began to ease.\n\n\u201cI was in a period of my life where I was trying to build more community, especially with like, queer men,\u201d Gross said. \u201cI have always loved working out and being physically active and stuff like that. I really wanted to do something that kind of held me accountable to some regular physical activity and that allowed me to be in the community at the same time.\u201d\n\nAfter Googling \u201cgay sports los angeles,\u201d Gross found the L.A. Rebellion. \u201cI looked at the website, because one of my big concerns is gender inclusivity \u2013 I identify as a trans man,\u201d said Gross. \u201cThis was also my first kind of soiree into gay male community.\u201d\n\nGross isn\u2019t the only player who has found a home with the Rebellion. They also form a community for players who are queer, questioning or allies to be themselves in a space where they won\u2019t feel judged. And for all that they have a well-earning reputation for inclusivity, the Rebellion are first and foremost a rugby team. That means that they play games, and spend a lot of time training for them. Incoming fundraising chair Andrew Ortiz said that the Rebellion plays a range of western teams, from Vancouver to Phoenix. They play in two tournaments in alternating years; they had the North American Cup last year so it\u2019ll be the Bingham Cup in 2024, which is being hosted in Rome, Italy.\n\n\u201cWe may not be the most winningest IGR team. But we f\u2014ing have fun,\u201d said Ortiz, laughing.\n\nBryce Henderson is going on his third year with the L.A. Rebellion and his eighth year playing rugby. He plays center, often labeled a pretty-guy position by other ruggers. \u201cIt\u2019s not all just like, check our hair and make sure our uniform looks nice,\u201d Henderson laughed \u2013 and welcomed the camaraderie of the team.\n\n\u201cI think, because so many of us share so many experiences and a lot of us come from certain ideologies of what sports are, I feel like we created a very safe space for people to sort of explore their opportunities with sports,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cI can be my most authentic self here.\u201d\n\nGalluccio gestures to the brand new players, ones that just started playing the game. They are lying on their backs, tossing a ball around, separated from the rest of the practice. There are quite a few of them circled around in the corner of the pitch, collecting grass stains. One of the newbies is Kiko Suura. He\u2019s been coming to practices since the end of the Rebellion\u2019s last season and loves the sport.\n\n\u201cBut I haven\u2019t played a real game yet,\u201d Suura, who is a trans man, said. He said he has moments of doubt (what if he passes the ball forward accidentally? Will he be injured in a tackle?) but he\u2019s mostly excited.\n\n\u201cThe rugby community has an inclination to camaraderie no matter where you are,\u201d said Galluccio. \u201cIn fact, we have two halves in the game. And we have what\u2019s called the third half, that is when we get together with the opposing team and we just drink beers and sing songs. And this is after the game, where we were really trying to hurt each other.\u201d\n\nSuura said, \u201c[Rugby] has this kind of brotherhood that I always kind of wanted, because I grew up playing women\u2019s soccer and it just always felt off to me. So it was \u2013 yeah, it just kind of felt right.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not the only one who feels the companionship of the team. \u201cFor me, I was in the Marines for eight years, and never did I think I would find another group of misfits that I would get along with like I have with this group,\u201d said Ortiz.\n\nThe Rebellion offered these men a community within a community \u2013 becoming both ruggers, dedicated to the team and the sport, as well as being out queer, gay and trans men. When Gross joined the team, he was looking for a way to join the queer male community as well, having only experienced being in queer female and nonbinary spaces before.\n\n\u201cBecause, you know, I had transitioned just a couple of years before the pandemic started and in that period of time, I wasn\u2019t really exploring that community. I didn\u2019t really feel part of that community yet, or, like, ready to engage with that community,\u201d Gross said.\n\nHe also loves the physicality of the sport. The fact that a player can hit as hard as they like in a tackle without worrying about injuring another player is freeing. And the culture of rugby means that the atmosphere is not malicious or cruel, said Gross.\n\nAfter the game, during the third half, Gross will approach that player that he tackled and ask if they\u2019re okay and whether they want to share a beer with him. The level of sportsmanship in the game is comforting to many of the players, too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who thought I had to be \u2013 I didn\u2019t think I had to be toxic, but I thought that masculinity was a certain way. And so with that came the toxicity,\u201d Suura said.\n\nThere\u2019s still a long way to go in terms of acceptance and inclusivity, but things are changing, both in rugby and the greater world of sports. \u201cEspecially in the last three years [the tolerance] has kind of increased regarding the queer community because when I first started it was very misogynistic, very bro-y,\u201d said Phillip Khommarath, CFO and treasurer for the Rebellion.\n\nKommarath plays with the team as a utility player. He bounces around the forward pack but mostly sticks to prop and lock. He said he hopes that it is a sign that the \u201cclimate of the global landscape\u201d is changing to be more inclusive.\n\nThe Rebellion and other inclusive teams are making a marked impact. They provide a space for players to express themselves while playing a sport that champions camaraderie and, for lack of a better, gender-neutral word, brotherhood.\n\nRemembering the moment he realized he wanted to join the Rebellion, Gross recalled a crude joke he made during his first practice when another player asked about rugby balls: \u201cAnd I made the silly joke of, \u2018Oh, I think most of us probably have two balls.\u2019 And then someone else, of course, not knowing that I\u2019m a trans guy was like, \u2018Well, you know, not all of us are gonna have that. We\u2019re an inclusive team, and we include trans people on our team.\u2019\u201d Gross laughed. \u201cIt called me in at that moment. And that was the moment where I was like, \u2018Abso-f\u2014ing-lutely.\u2019\u201d\n\nBeing part of the Rebellion has settled well with Suura, as well. He feels that the toxic masculinity present in a lot of male sports is absent on this pitch.\n\n\u201cWhereas, because I think with, let\u2019s say football, American football,\u201d said Suura. \u201cThere is kind of like this toxicity. Maybe it was just in high school or whatever. But we\u2019re just like, you\u2019re kind of striving to be really tough and like just getting in these fights all the time. And I feel like I haven\u2019t sensed that at all here.\u201d\n\nThe Rebellion, although it was the first inclusive rugby team, is not nearly the only team to lack this toxicity that Suura describes. Neither is it the only rugby team to encourage camaraderie \u2013 far from it. As a culture, rugby creates a supportive community for its members. That\u2019s one of the reasons Galluccio was so drawn to form an inclusive rugby team in the first place. He can see that inclusivity now.\n\n\u201cI can see people in [this practice] that have been playing with the club for almost a decade and I see people that are just starting,\u201d Galluccio said. \u201cBut it\u2019s lovely to see how many people from different generations come. Then at our events we also have a lot of people that are from prior times who have stopped playing that come and join us and are still with us.\u201d\n\nThe level of intergenerationality that he can see in the rugby league makes a world of difference, especially given that in the not-so-distant past, an inclusive team like the Rebellion would be a pipedream.\n\nGalluccio was politically active during the AIDs crisis, during which he said queer people had fewer options in terms of expressing their identities. \u201cWe have a diversity of choices that I would have never imagined that would have happened at that time,\u201d said Galluccio.\n\nEven in the arguments that the LGBTQ+ community is having now, Galluccio sees hope and progress. In the last 40 years, he believes the community has come so demonstrably far, especially considering how little queer life was even acknowledged, let alone accepted. The progress, he said, is \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\nGalluccio believes that progress is important and should not be forgotten. One way it can be measured is just by looking at Galluccio\u2019s Rebellion and the success of the International Gay Rugby league. In the last quarter century, the movement has ballooned into an enormous accomplishment, all rooted right here in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cThe movement has grown so big. We have trans players, we have nonbinary, we have people of color, we have everything,\u201d said Galluccio. \u201cAnd for me, it\u2019s a great joy to see that because honestly, my motivation to start it was that gay people didn\u2019t have to hide any longer, and we have grown past anything that I\u2019ve ever imagined that it could have.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2024/01/11/soul-restoration/", "response": "```\nSoul restoration\n\nGraphic designed by Midori Jenkins\n\nBy Maya Broomfield\nJanuary 11, 2024 at 11:12 am PST\n\nI wonder what it feels like to be buried alive. That was my thought as I pushed the tiny yellowish chili pepper seed into the moist and dense dirt. My nose filled with the oddly refreshing musky smell of my grandparents\u2019 yard. Beads of sweat formed on my forehead as the sun forced its presence through the shade of sky-scraping Oak Trees. The cool feeling of grass on my bare feet refreshingly contrasted the temperature as I stood and watched my grandfather plant this year\u2019s batch of plants. No words were spoken between the two of us while we worked to plant and repot plants. But it\u2019s one of my favorite memories.\n\nNow as a young woman, it is these moments that I reminisce when I think about being happy or my favorite parts of childhood. My question was \u201cWhere are the young Black people who garden?\u201d I knew this was something I enjoyed but I felt conflicted about. Like most young adults, I don\u2019t own a house with a backyard, and for the last four going on five years, I have spent most of my time moving in and out of student housing. Sadly even in businesses full of beautiful plants winding down up and down the show cases. Some multiple colors of orange, yellow, and green somewhat like a fall day. Others sharp and pointy. I felt disconnected. They were all nice of course but I was disheartened when I noticed that no one that worked at or owned these small mom and pop shops looked like me.\n\nWhen I first started my plant journey I wanted to understand why I always had a strong passion and connection to plants and gardening. So I start my journey with my own family history. My mother often talks about her memories of growing up in San Antonio, Texas with peaches, pecan and plum trees in her family\u2019s backyard. If they wanted a snack they could just climb up and grab one. Her grandmother would cut pieces of the cactuses that are native to the region and salute them down for dinner. Even though she grew up poor she never felt like it because they had so many different types of food growing right in her backyard. Her eyes still light up like a five-year-old when she talks about her favorite great-aunt, Aunt Dora, who would cut off pieces of her plants to give to my mother to take back home and grow her own.\n\nMy dad told me the stories of his father who was born the son of a sharecropper and spent his youth in rural Mississippi picking cotton. My favorite story was how his father had figured out a way to trick the people he worked for by adding rocks to the bottom of the bag of cotton so when it was weighed at the end of the day he would get paid more. I listened in horror as my dad described his first time picking cotton. My grandfather had worked hard and went back to school and was now a professor at a local college in Mississippi. He took my father along with him and his students to show them first hand how harsh the conditions of picking cotton were. My dad discovered quickly that picking cotton was torture to all the human senses. His fingers were raw and bloody from the sharp edges of the cotton plant. His nose and eyes are on fire from a mixture of loose pieces of cotton, dirt, and pollen. His skin blazing from the heat of the sun that sat high in the sky without a single cloud in site.\n\nMy second step was researching gardening and plants in the Black culture. It would be impossible to understand Black culture and its ties to gardening and plants without talking about slavery. It is no secret that millions of Black people were stolen from their homelands in Africa and forced into chattel slavery for over 400 years. Enslaved people were forced to work and tend to crops from sun up until sundown, sometimes on hundreds of acres of land. Bones aching and fingers raw from hours of endless picking and pulling. While facing the horror and torture of slavery, Black people still held onto cultural practices of gardening and farming from back home. Some popular dishes brought to America during the Transatlantic Slave Trade are rice, black-eyed peas, yams, okra and watermelon. Blacks both enslaved and free also used herbs and plant based remedies for a wide variety of things from religious to medical uses and as a form of pesticides.\n\nAccording to a piece written by Colin Fitzgerald \u201cAfrican American Slave Medicine of the 19th Century\u201d it states \u201c... plant-based remedies by slaves of the early to mid-nineteenth century were equally as effective in treating ailments of the body when compared to commonly practiced white medicine of the same time era...\u201d The article even states that there were cases when African American herbal remedies were more effective than traditional white medicine of the time.\n\nWhen slavery was legally ended, sharecropping forced many formerly enslaved Black people, who were not able to leave the South, financially dependent on the people who formerly enslaved them. For some newly freed Black people, growing crops helped them gain economic prosperity. According to Nation Park Service \"About thirty percent of black homesteaders filed on federal lands as individuals remote from other African Americans. They had to overcome severe challenges in the harsh climate just to survive. Many persisted and succeeded.\u201d\n\nUniversities like Tuskegee University, Florida A&M University and of course my alum Prairie View A&M University were created with the intent to educate newly freed slaves on working and profiting off the land. An often undiscussed part of Black history and the Reconstruction Period is the prosperity many Black people found in growing and selling their crops. In fact watermelon, a crop that has had a long history of being used as a racial stereotype against Blacks was a cash crop for many. Watermelon was a sign of freedom. But white people threatened and angered by this newfound freedom took this new sign of freedom and used it to chastise and mock Black people.\n\nFast forward to the Great Migration when thousands of Black people migrated out of the racist and violent south moving West and North. During this migration Black people took their culture with them. With limited access to land many turned to Urban Gardening. Many Black people ended up in the concrete jungles of places like Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, far from the vast open landscape of the rural South. While now out of the South, Black people were met with a new form of racism like Redlining, lack of jobs, and over-policing. With a lack of resources and access to land, Black people did what they have always done: Made something out of nothing.\n\nWhile urban gardens have been around for centuries now, Black communities used them as a means of survival in low-income neighborhoods. Black people were able to provide a cheap and efficient source of fresh fruits and vegetables for their families and neighborhoods during a time when it seemed the government and those in power could care less about the well-being of their communities. An article by the Economic Policy Institute \u201c...historical record demonstrates that residential segregation is \u201cde jure,\u201d resulting from racially-motivated and explicit public policy whose effects endure to the present.\u201d\n\nSucked into a new way of life and possibly home sick. The comfort of back home was found in the plants they brought with them. When talking to Julia Jackson who was born and raised in Tallulah, Louisiana and moved to Los Angeles in her early 20s in the late 1960s. She explains \u201c I was so happy when I found collard greens and green tomatoes\u201d. These plants that are bitter and tough are delicacies in the south and for those like Julia sense of comfort and a reminder of home that was now thousands of miles away.\n\nMichael, who proudly proclaims himself still an urban gardener, explains \u201c It was my grandmother who introduced me to gardening. We lived in Michigan and she would go outside and pick food out of the garden to make dinner. I enjoyed spending time in the garden helping her.\u201d Proudly he talks about the different things that he was able to grow in his home garden. You can often find Michael in his garden kicked back smoking a cigar admiring his garden like he just won an NBA championship.\n\nAfter reflecting on all this information I was inspired and determined to keep this part of my culture alive. African Americans who have been stripped of our culture for centuries and are constantly chastised for not having what some believe is an actual culture. I feel even more determined to make sure that these cultural practices and connections to our ancestors are preserved.\n\nWhile trying to find my way through my plant and garden journey I had the privilege of speaking with Paris Hannon who is the owner and creator of Planting with P. Hannon created the business after struggling with the stress of her job. The business not only sells plants but teaches one-on-one and group classes about taking care of your plants. She too got her introduction into taking care of plants while spending time with her grandmother. When talking about the representation of Black planters and plants business owners Hannon says she feels the disconnect as well. Even as a Black person when she first started her company she assumed that most of her audience would be white people \" You really don\u2019t see a lot of people of color. Black, Spanish, Indian. You don\u2019t see them planting a lot because if they are, it\u2019s something that\u2019s personal that\u2019s happening behind closed doors.\u201d\n\nAfter getting her business up and going she discovered that her customers were very diverse coming from all ethnic backgrounds including Black. Despite constantly battling as a Black business owner to make sure her content is seen on social media platforms like Tiktok or Instagram. Paris says that business is still good and Black people are still planting and gardening.\n\nGardening and planting has a history in Black culture that goes back centuries before we first stepped foot on American soil. But since being here it has played such an important part of helping us document and tell our history. From documenting the will to survive during the dark and torturous years of slavery. To the will to overcome the years of the Reconstruction Period and Jim Crow Era. The sense of home and comfort it provided to those thousands of miles away from home during the Great Migration Period. Down to the warm feeling it gives a girl as her mom smiles retelling her stories from her own childhood.\n\nAs I sit in my small college apartment and stare at my once tiny plant that I bought on sale at the 99cent store. I am reminded despite what narrative is shown on social media and the internet planting and gardening is very much a part of Black culture. Like plants we are constantly growing and climbing. Bearing fruits despite being neglected and placed in the most hostile environments.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/01/11/brother-to-the-night/", "response": "```\nThe club is dark, the music is jazzy. Acoustic bass harmonizes with saxophone. Swirls of cigarette smoke are silhouetted by the spotlight cast over Darius, a smooth-talking poet from Chicago played by the enigmatic Larenz Tate. \u201cWho am I?\u201d he asks the crowd, \u201cit\u2019s not important, but they call me Brother to the Night.\u201d Young Jackson was mesmerized by it all. Growing up in the projects of Indianapolis, Kevin Jackson II didn\u2019t know that poetry could look like that; saucy, provocative, and Black. Love Jones, an R-rated movie Jackson snuck into at the age of seven, sparked a fascination with words. It is a distinct memory. He found kinship with Darius, a midwesterner with the same complexion as himself who became a successful artist. He also got the girl, which helped sell Jackson on the coolness of poetry. Jackson kindled this love in secret, afraid to embrace the vulnerability required to share his writing publicly. He was always in close proximity to poetry by way of music. From the gospel his grandparents played to the Usher and Aalyiah albums his older sister belted out in her bedroom, strings of lyrics and fragments of melodies were constantly swirling in Jackson\u2019s head. An innate rhythm translated into skill as a dancer. It wasn\u2019t until he peeked behind the music industry curtain as a backup dancer on a world tour that he saw the feasibility of a career in music. He\u2019s been striving to make that vision his reality ever since.\n\nIn sixth grade English class, Jackson felt his first rush of inspiration. The assignment was to write a haiku. After years of listening to rap music with his dad, pouring over episodes of Mos Def Poetry Jam and obsessively watching Love Jones, Jackson was already familiar with poetry. He spent all of his time in school, whether in math or science or history, scribbling down phrases that sounded \u201cdope\u201d \u2013 poems about Ninja Turtles or girls or his mom. When he was tasked with writing this haiku, it poured out of him with ease. He wrote about his mom, Regina. The poem\u2019s elegant simplicity took his teacher by surprise, as she had no idea of Jackson\u2019s capability as a writer. She immediately shared it with his parents and suddenly Jackson\u2019s secret skill was no longer entirely his own. \u201cWith Black parents, once they found out you can do something, you have to show everyone,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cThe grocery store, dentist\u2019s office, doctor\u2019s office... wherever we went, they made me show this poem.\u201d\n\nFrom that point on, his parents helped nurture his love for words. His dad, Kevin Jackson Sr., is his namesake and hero. \u201cMy dad\u2019s biggest goal in life was for me to succeed him. If I was going to be good at words, he was going to make sure I was the best.\u201d And so, they read the dictionary together. They\u2019d discuss the new words they discovered and how they could use them. Jackson focused on phonetics, studying the individual syllables of each word, noticing the way he had to shape his mouth or move his tongue to form the sound. He learned how words could be syncopated to match beats and make music. He started to hear those same patterns in the music his dad played. Sitting in a beat-up white truck with the windows cranked all the way down and the music cranked all the way up, Jackson Senior played his son Me Against The World by Tupac for the first time. The guttural aggression of 2pac\u2019s voice juxtaposed with the poetry of his lyrics ignited something in Jackson. The smile it brought to his dad\u2019s face is cemented in his memory. He was seven years old, but even then, he related. He\u2019d listen to JayZ and Nas in the shower, mesmerized by how their music described complex emotions in such relatable words. He listened to his CDs on repeat, working to memorize each syllable of every lyric. He felt the words of the greats roll off his tongue, mimicking their cadence and vocal intonation. In the blur of hot water and soap suds, those lyrics became his own and he transformed into the artist behind the mic. It made him feel invincible, even if only for a moment.\n\nGrowing up in Indianapolis, Jackson says his childhood was \u201cpretty unsupervised.\u201d He\u2019d go to friends\u2019 or cousins\u2019 houses and witness plenty of drug consumption. Early on, he says, he could tell when someone drank too much by the slightest slur of their speech. He saw fights break out at corner stores and learned to recognize the outline of a gun in a man\u2019s pants pocket. He also saw the strength of community, describing his childhood friends as \u201cboys for life.\u201d When Tupac sings of a \u201cgangsta party,\u201d Jackson can still picture it. It\u2019s the duality of life in the projects; poverty and crime juxtaposed with vibrant celebrations of life, faith, and resilience. This is exactly how rap music felt to him; a sonic representation of his simultaneously celebratory and bleak reality. Inherently, even at 7 years old, he felt the power words could hold. That power, that talent, gave him an outlet to masquerade as superior to the kids around him. He constructed worlds outside his own where he wasn\u2019t limited by his upbringing.\n\nDespite his love for rap, he never considered it a viable career. He was aware of the negative connotation that came with rap \u2013 it was the music of \u201cgangbangers\u201d that didn\u2019t live long enough to raise their children. He heard it under the breath of his mother or in the side-comments of his teachers. It rattled windows and disrupted classrooms with bass heavy low-end that boomed out of retrofitted Toyota Camry stereo systems. Rap was a phase, a genre that would burn out as quickly as it rose to popularity. Forging a career as a rapper was a silly, childish goal, not rooted in reality. The same year, 1996, Jackson Sr played his son Tupac for the first time, the rapper was murdered at 25. The case of his murder was recently reopened in Las Vegas, but it remains unsolved. Many people have believed since early on that the person who ordered his death was rap rival Notorious B.I.G, who was gunned down less than a year later at 24. Longevity as a rapper didn\u2019t seem common.\n\nJackson continued to hide his talent as a writer out of self preservation. He describes his hometown as a place \u201cwhere people don\u2019t express themselves artistically.\u201d Jackson\u2019s lyrics were deep expressions of self; poems about mental health and family and struggle. By sharing his writing he knew he\u2019d open himself up to ridicule. By maintaining a hard, emotionless exterior, he avoided painting a target on his own back\u2013 perhaps both figuratively and literally.\n\nIn his teens, Jackson had a preoccupation with two things: financial stability and girls. One thing he knew girls liked was a guy that could dance. He started playing around with the dance trends of the time \u2014 the heel-toe, the chicken head, the pancake, all fairly simple moves you\u2019d see on VH1 or MTV \u2014 and quickly realized he had rhythm beyond the norm. He skipped basketball practice to attend his first dance class and never went back. Not only could he dance freely, he also got to listen to music at the same time; two things he loved. What started as an inroad with a crush became a porthole to a whole new world. The dance scene in the midwest was vibrant. As Jackson continued to take classes as a dancer, he attended local dance competitions that brought in diverse people from across the region; judges from Chicago and choreographers from Detroit, all of whom had distinct perspectives on the world. Jackson recalls starting \u201cto see a lot more diversity, not just in race. I would meet other Black dudes that were so different from me that didn\u2019t come from the projects and had been dancing their whole lives. They were making good money from dancing.\u201d\n\nAfter grabbing the attention of a talent scout, he signed a contract with LA-based talent agency The Movement and started auditioning. The path towards financial stability was clearly paved for dancers and a career started to form. Jackson relegated his poetry to a hobby and packed his bags for a world tour as a backup dancer for Will.I.Am. The Black Eyed Pea was embarking on a two-year-long world tour as a solo rapper. Touring with Will.I.Am was transformative for Jackson. It was like boot camp for life skills\u2013 the tour was in a different city every day. He learned to travel, fight jet lag, keep up his stamina and perform nightly, all while being away from home for the first time. He saw the pressure of fandom and the expectations of an artist. He learned to not be star-struck by celebrities. He saw them as human, like himself. Jackson describes Will.I.Am as being very \u201cfuture thinking\u201d and constantly \u201cstriving to break out of the box the industry puts Black artists in.\u201d He quickly became a mentor to Jackson, even if from afar. Jackson studied how he moved and how he thought, from the way he treated staff to how he approached creating new music. Will \u201ccared about what his dancers had to say\u201d and spent time while on tour \u201chearing their views about the world.\u201d He made Jackson feel like his thoughts, and thus his writing, mattered. He saw Will.I.Am\u2019s success as a rapper as a product of hard work, talent and passion intersecting \u2013 not some divine, unreplicable, accident.\n\nK.LOV3, the moniker Jackson went by at the time, was inspired by his smooth, and sensual signature dance style. This distinct style helped him gain recognition of his own and he became known amongst fans of dance. Leading up to the 2010s, a person could achieve real celebrity as a dancer and parlay it into his or her own career as an artist. Big names like Mariah Carey and J.Lo got their start as backup dancers. Even Tupac had a brief stint dancing behind Digital Underground. TV shows like America\u2019s Best Dance Crew and So You Think You Can Dance, both of which K.LOV3 appeared on, provided dancers with opportunities to make names for themselves. When Jackson began the #willpower tour with Will.I.Am his recognition grew amongst fans of the musician. A windy night in Amsterdam, performing at the Ziggo Dome, would shift Jackson\u2019s perspective on his career forever. December 10, 2013 \u2013 three fans, hours before the show, stood at the stage door waiting for Will and his dancers to arrive at the venue. When the group deboarded the tour bus, Jackson saw their signs. Emblazoned in thick black marker was his name: K.LOV3. They were waiting for him, in the cold, with no tickets to actually attend the show. Jackson got them front row seats. The concert went on and he could see their signs from the stage. While Will.I.Am connected with 17,000 people as a rapper, Jackson had connected with those three people as a dancer. That felt like a whole world to him. For the first time, he knew he was the artist and that music had to be his outlet. His first tour as a dancer would be his last.\n\nNascent Youtube videos of rap battles became Jacksons\u2019 testing ground for new bars. He\u2019d recite his \u201cfavorite lines\u201d from a newly released rap battle video, telling his friends this rapper or that rapper had penned them. In reality, they came from his journals, written in secret. By pretending he didn\u2019t write the lyrics, he felt like he got an objective opinion and could avoid both the negative and positive bias of his friends. If his friends reacted well, he knew he had something. Rap is a game of proving yourself. Jackson began to earn his stripes in the LA music scene through live performances at cyphers \u2014 a collaborative evolution of battle rap where artists consecutively rap one after another, progressively changing the melody as they go. As opposed to Mos Def Poetry Jam, where poets performed written solo pieces that read more like spoken word than music, the poetry he heard at cyphers in basements of North Hollywood homes, seemed to emerge from nothing\u2013 \u201coff the dome,\u201d as Jackson described it. Each rapper picks something up from the person before them, evolving the story to speak individually while smoothly transitioning out of the flow that came before. The crazier your bars, the more cache you gained as a rapper. Jackson steadily improved and began to gain some respect. He developed his own style; quick, syncopated and rhythmic. He credits his ability to rap with speed and clarity to the years he spent reading the dictionary with his dad. As if by instinct, with each tick of a syllable, his body moves ever-so-slightly to mirror the imagery of his words. The unique intersection of dance and lyricism became his signature.\n\nWith a little bit of buzz among his dancer-turned-musician community, he decided to independently produce his debut album, Speak. He found a producer, another dancer-turned-musician Wyatt Starkman. Jackson quickly moved into Starkman\u2019s home and became part of his family. They spent months holed up in a small childhood bedroom piecing together what they thought would be a life-changing record. They were so focused, Starkman\u2019s mom would have to remind them to eat. They were locked in on their common goal; produce an album that would take them both out of momma\u2019s house. Speak never saw the light of day. In retrospect, the album was all over the place. It jumped around subject matter, instrumentation, and personality. Jackson likens it to cooking a frozen pizza; \u201cwe were so excited to be making an album that we took it out before it was done. In some places, it was delicious. In other places, it was still underbaked\u201d he said. Jackson went into this album intending to put it out under K.LOV3. The name, which was better suited for the crooning voice of Brian KcKnight or Barry White, didn\u2019t necessarily fit the music he wanted to create. He also felt like the name was still too personal, too self-serving. It never felt right.\n\nGiving up on Speak untethered Jackson. Creating and releasing that album was a guiding force in his life for several years. Without it, he had no reason to be living with Starkman, no goal to achieve, no driving purpose. The post-dance life he had established was dissolving and he found himself starting over yet again. As a means of supporting himself, Jackson began working with other artists as a ghost writer. Def Jam would call him into writing sessions with R+B artists and rappers on their label. He spent time with 5th Harmony, wrote frequently with Dani-Leigh, collaborated with Kaash Paige and worked on arrangements for the BET Awards. He had accomplished his goal of financial stability through music but had to quiet his own voice to do so. It wasn\u2019t the career he envisioned back in Amsterdam.\n\nGrowing up, Jackson was self-conscious of \u201cdoing too much\u201d or trying too hard. As a kid, this was borne out of his fear of vulnerability. As an artist, this manifested itself as trying to fit into a box. The same conversation he had with Will.I.Am over ten years prior was the same concept he was struggling with in his own artistry. Once the pandemic hit, Jackson refocused. He went back to the beginning; poetry. He formed a collective of artists, titled \u201ctheir p.o.e.t.s.\u201d \u2013 an acronym for \u201cpurpose overcame each torn story\u201d \u2013 and stories started to pour out of him. He also started going by Jackson II, a return to his family name and a commitment to expressing his unique, authentic experience. The addition of II is an homage to his father, Kevin Senior. Gone was smooth talking K.LOV3 and the dated inspiration he pulled from Love Jones. He stopped trying to force a type of music or an image or a name. Instead, he decided to let inspiration come to him, in the same way it did in his sixth grade English class.\n\nSitting at a spoken word poetry event, inspiration struck like a tidal wave. A few hours later, he had the beginnings of a new song, \u201cGod Eyes;\u201d \u201cA pack of them packing pistols probably plotting to pack you in // I valued the vicious cycle that the people would trap me in // But trapping me only freed my mind to see the big trap I\u2019m in // I\u2019m thanking him, it\u2019s God eyes on me.\u201d Two years later, Jackson is in the final stages of polishing what will actually be his debut album \u201cMy Demon\u2019s Demon.\u201d It\u2019s a return to his roots, a discussion of his childhood, a love letter to his family, and an examination of racial disparity; An ode to the artist who came before him and a cautionary tale for the artists who will come after him. \u201cMy Demon\u2019s Demon\u201d is a culmination of all the lessons Jackson learned in order to still be here, making music. He\u2019s okay with taking his time and is pushing for that longevity that has eluded so many rappers\n\nAs for his hesitancy to share his music, those days are long gone. Just like Brother to the Night, he knows he has sauce. \u201cI\u2019m the greatest rapper alive,\u201d he states proudly, \u201cyou just haven\u2019t had the pleasure of finding me yet.\u201d And now you have.\n```"}

I know their beloveds wander their pandemic rooms, pass through their sudden ghosts. I know their loss burns their beloveds\u2019 throats like acid. Their families will speak, I thought. Ask for justice. And no one will answer\u201d \u2014 On Witness and Respair: A Personal Tragedy Followed by Pandemic, Jesmyn Ward\n\nI remember how Papa grilled hot dogs on Father\u2019s Day. It was the first time his blistered fingers made the American delicacy. He didn\u2019t know what a hot dog was and preferred traditional Armenian barbeque, which he found tastier, but he knew my sister and I wanted our hot dogs. I watched from a distance as I waited. He didn\u2019t see me, but I saw him throw away some trash. When he went upstairs for more buns and vegetables, I took a peek inside the bin and saw four burnt hot dogs. In that trash bin, I learned how my father loved. He never wanted us to see what he burnt. He shielded us from every form of burning you could ever imagine. For example, he knew his lungs were burning from cancer. But he kept it in a distant bin away from us - just like those burnt hot dogs.\n\nI miss him on that Father\u2019s Day, when I didn\u2019t think about lungs or cancer, and when coughing only came after laughter. While he was Papa to me, he was Aleksandr Kevorkov: an Armenian refugee from Azerbaijan, a dental technician, and a funny immigrant father. He was a healthy man who loved to smoke. He was generous, humble, and hysterical; if you met him once, you would be friends for life. And he struggled with saying \u2018no\u2019 because he always cared for everyone but himself, working from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., occasionally for free. Papa was a selfless immigrant who was all about family and work.\n\nPapa was screaming and coughing with all his breath for the first time. He had pneumonia and could not go to work for the first time in decades. His coughs became drier. He was beginning to feel a type of tiredness he never felt before. He was always tired because he worked every holiday, every birthday, every anniversary, and every weekend. But, his exhaustion felt odd this time. His eyes were hazy these days, filled with tears whenever he looked at me. He would say his eyes were irritated, and that he needed to shed some tears to clear his vision. Papa lied to me for the first time.\n\nMy mom was resilient, sure that it was just his typical January cold. She made him warm tea with drops of lemon and overfilled his favorite mug with ripe ginger roots all day. For the first time I saw them hold each other tight; my parents were seldomly affectionate with each other, but in those quiet days, their love was tainted with a fragility and delicacy that told me that it was always there but cleverly hidden from us. She made him his favorite borscht, rubbed his pale feet, and consistently reassured him it would all be okay. Papa smiled and talked more when she was around and when the sun was bright and fresh. The second part of the day he would lose all his progress, coughing up blood, complaining about the heaviness of his chest, screaming with rage. He said he felt something was eating his chest. We thought he was exaggerating.\n\nMy mom went to the pharmacy at 12:30 p.m., and she brought him all sorts of colorful liquids and gel pills, hoping it would sleep away the pain. She rubbed the VapoRub-Vodka hybrid mixture on his chest right before he went to sleep, and he told her that it made him feel better. He did not want her to worry. He knew that if he spoke the truth, she would run to the pharmacy again, maybe in her pajamas, find him another bottle of cold chest rub, and pray the green one would work better than the blue one at home.\n\nPapa went to bed quietly that night and my mom fell asleep next to him with a smile, proud of her efforts as a makeshift nurse. Papa\u2019s heart felt warm when I hugged him, like an oven, but his chest was burning like never before: he could no longer eat, walk, or speak. He would wear the same clothes: a red shirt with plaid pants. Things shifted fast, and I can only remember the image of Papa standing in our living room right before mom hurriedly took him to the hospital. It would be the last time my sister and I would see him, too. None of us knew that.\n\nRight after they left for the hospital, I had a moment to sit by the piano after weeks of being separated from it. I was excited to revisit my favorite hobby, but I also felt guilty about it. I decided it would be okay to play one piece: Chopin\u2019s Revolutionary Etude\u2014only the first page. Papa loved how I played it with a breathless speed. But to me, it wasn\u2019t fast enough. Allegro Con Fuoco. That was the dream. In my overdue practice session, I played the Etude with a ferocity like never before. I was panting and sweating and out of breath. My piano was on fire. I broke every key with my hot fingers. I felt like a fierce warrior. I felt like I could survive anything. I felt like after Papa returned home from the hospital, he would feel what I felt.\n\nPapa would feel as if he heroically won his battle, too. Mom called from the hospital, so I quickly closed the piano and ensured it looked untouched. She whispered to me that the doctors were running lots of tests on Papa, and he would be staying overnight. One night became two weeks, and then, Papa was fighting for his final breath. On March 6, 2018, we lost him to terminal Stage IV lung cancer. I wasn\u2019t woken up at 7 a.m. for school that day, so I went downstairs confused until I saw my sleep-deprived mom, aunt, and grandma, who gave me the news. I felt numb for a long time.\n\nPapa was 55, I was 16, my sister was 14. My memories of those days are blurry. But I remember how I held my mother, my sister, my aunt, and my grandmother. I remember the sacrifices, too. I went to the first half of my father\u2019s funeral while spending the second half in a locked car with my 85-year-old grandmother Nelly, who never wanted to acknowledge that her son left this world before her. I remember dodging the rain and sitting in a cold car, and her saying, \u201cPapa left for a long-term vacation.\u201d I nodded, repeating he was surely having a good time wherever he was. As her granddaughter, I knew I was doing the right thing. I devoted all my care and attention to her because I knew that day was the worst of her entire life. I held her hands, making sure that she was warm enough, and I hoped my father was proud of me.\n\nAccording to Armenian traditions, after 40 days passed, we could watch TV again or very quietly listen to music with our headphones on. I forgot we had a piano at home. I was a junior in high school, studying hard to avoid everything and everyone. I stayed home all the time. A few friends asked how I felt. They empathized as much as they could. They didn\u2019t know how to give hugs, but they thoroughly explained complex math problems I couldn\u2019t understand to me. They didn\u2019t go to prom that year to accompany. They cared in their own nerdy, beautiful ways. But, the stiffness in my chest wouldn\u2019t fade with time. I cried myself to sleep every night. Asked my mom how she felt every second of the day. Stared at my grandmother to make sure her breathing was consistent. The inability to remember my past self before my father died was relentless. Grief challenges hope. It\u2019s not linear, and it leaves one breathless.\n\nIn January 2022, I lost my grandmother Greta to COVID-19 as she developed pneumonia. I relieved the traumas of my past. The same loss of breath, of love, and home hit me again. I was powerless and angry. It was my lowest since I lost my father in 2018. For the 10th time, I returned to therapy to treat my depression and anxiety. I hoped it would give me peace. But through trial and error, I\u2019ve learned that therapy doesn\u2019t fix me. Yet, I found comfort in hearing the stories of grieving people.\n\nFernando Acuna, an international graduate architecture student from Mexico, told me his resilient story - the grief of losing a father too soon. Since he lost his father to pancreatic cancer a little over a year ago, his tears are fresh. While sharing how his father\u2019s tragic death gave him \u201cdepression all the time,\u201d Acuna says, \u201cburying the wounds won\u2019t heal them with time.\u201d With tears in his eyes, he describes his late father as a generous and compassionate man who gave them everything they had. He remembers his heart sinking when he got the horrifying call, learning his father was no longer breathing on his own. Taking pauses in breaths and thoughts, Acuna remembers his favorite memory as a 5-year-old in Manchester, where he would run with his father and brother. Those were simpler times when breathing was easy, when being breathless meant you won a competitive race between siblings.\n\nDealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and his father\u2019s cancer diagnosis simultaneously, Acuna\u2019s perspective is inspiring to me. He says, \u201cCOVID got me a lot of quality time with my family because we managed to stay together - I\u2019m grateful for it allowing me to get closer to my dad.\u201d His story shines a light on what breathless illness does to your mind, yet it doesn\u2019t take the soulful memories with your loved ones.\n```"}

What\u2019s a girl to do? Study at Leavey Library? No, the best cup of coffee doesn\u2019t lay at the Annenberg Cafe Feat Illy or the School of Cinematic Arts Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf (although, I must say I love both). And, it\u2019s definitely not at the USC Village Starbucks \u2014 consistently overrun with elbowing freshmen and PhD students hungry for their next caffeine fix.\n\nI ventured outside campus, into University and Exposition Park, for my quest. I evaluated the cafes according to three criteria: 1. Caffeination (Or, do I feel the buzz?) 2. Affordability (Not trying to spend a pretty penny on lattes) 3. Overall Vibes (The \u201cLady Bird\u201d effect. Can I see myself studying here and meeting the love of my life?) Bonus points if it\u2019s quiet and relatively unknown \u2014 especially if it\u2019s a small business. USC has a history of shutting down staples like Nickii Park\u2019s Keck Hospital coffee stands and the beloved Ground Zero Performance Cafe in favor of corporate chains. Support these unique, local coffee shops instead; all within walking distance of campus.\n\n1. With Love Market & Cafe\nBy far, this cafe was my favorite discovery. Located at South Vermont Ave just north of the freeway, With Love Market & Cafe boasts a wide variety of Mexican-fusion coffees, freshly pressed ginger shots, and even an on-site market that accepts CalFresh EBT. The shop possesses an alluring, vintage charm to it with its bright, orange decor and secluded outdoor seating. What\u2019s not to love? I tried one of their most popular drinks: the horchata latte. It did not disappoint. The latte was a perfect blend of cinnamon, espresso, and vanilla \u2014 yet, it wasn\u2019t too sweet. I can\u2019t stand it when the flavorings overpower the natural coffee flavors. Needless to say, I felt buzzed.\n\nOther standout beverages include the Cafe de Olla, a traditional Mexican beverage spiced with piloncillo sugar and cinnamon; The Fuego, a mango, pineapple, and citrus smoothie paired with a kick of cayenne and tajin; and the Charlie Brown, a distinctive half-lemonade, half-cold brew blend. With Love Market & Cafe also serves all-day breakfast, from the hearty three-egg \u201cThe Beast\u201d breakfast burrito to the spicy ham & egg breakfast sandwich \u2014 which features a homemade olive tapenade. The Cubano is also quite excellent: tangy pulled pork, pillowy ciabatta, and a healthy dose of pickles (my favorite). Their on-site market is stocked with a wide range of fresh produce, grains, and canned goods that can all be purchased with CalFresh EBT. In fact, With Love Market & Cafe runs a promotion where if you spend $10 on groceries, you get $20 back to spend on produce.\n\n2. Eruta Nature\nYou might have seen Justin Solomon\u2019s peculiar ivy-clad coffee cart parked outside the Trousdale Parkway campus entrance. I certainly have \u2014 on my way to class 12 minutes late. This time, I decided to stop and smell the roses (fake ivy). Justin, a junior studying business administration, started Eruta Nature just over two months ago. He didn\u2019t expect to create a coffee brand \u2014 instead, Eruta Nature was initially marketed as a sleek, organic and sustainable clothing company. However, Justin needed alternative methods to fund his venture. And so, the coffee cart was born.\n\nEruta\u2019s specialty lattes are no joke. For $6.50, you can select from Justin\u2019s handcrafted catalog of decadent, luscious flavors: Maple French Toast, Orange Mocha, Pumpkin Pie, S\u2019mores, and even Cookie Monster. However, the Snickerdoodle latte is undoubtedly the fan favorite. Its sweet vanilla and cinnamon syrups will make you forget that you\u2019re even drinking coffee. Known non-coffee drinkers swear by it. The Mocha Hazelnutty is also a classic. Justin marketed the drink as a Ferrero Rocher chocolate in a cup. And let me tell you, he was right. If you know me, you know that those little gold-foiled chocolate nuggets are my weakness. There\u2019s something about a coffee-hazelnut-chocolate combo that makes me swoon. It\u2019s a beautiful blend \u2014 silky, smooth, and nutty.\n\nSmall batches of fresh coffee beans are roasted less than five days prior to Eruta Nature\u2019s pop-ups, while each latte flavor is delicately innovated from Justin\u2019s family recipes. Each drink feels special; crafted with tender love and care. Justin personally oversees the entire operation, with a couple of friends assisting on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 9-2 p.m. He promises exclusive, winter-themed drinks following his successful Halloween launch of the marshmallow-pumpkin Witch\u2019s Brew and strawberry-chocolate Sleepy Vampire. I can\u2019t wait. Although there is no physical cafe, the coffee cart experience is one not to be missed. Who knows? Maybe I\u2019ll meet a handsome stranger outside of Trousdale one day.\n\n3. Nature\u2019s Brew\nI\u2019ve been a longtime self-proclaimed Nature\u2019s Brew connoisseur. Stepping into the cafe feels like a warm hug, erasing all the sins committed yesterday at Bacari West Adams just next door. Their signature lattes are decadent and tasty \u2014 definitely for the sweet tooths out there. The USC latte combines caramel, english toffee syrup, and grey salt into one ultimate blend. The lavender latte and Vietnamese sweet coffee are acclaimed, but I must say my favorite drink has to be the Snickerdoodle latte. It\u2019s the perfect cinnamony, sugary fix to trick your brain into feeling the autumnal spirit amidst sunny palm trees. I sure do miss the changing leaves and murky fall skies of the Midwest. Alas, iced coffee it is.\n\nI can easily spend an entire, \u201cproductive\u201d morning at Nature\u2019s Brew, especially with fuel from a smoked salmon Brooklyn bagel or Nana\u2019s sandwich \u2014 a zesty, well-seasoned combination of fried eggs, balsamic onion, and organic mixed greens. At $9 - $13.50 per omelet or breakfast sandwich, Nature\u2019s Brew is definitely on the pricey side. Not to mention, their lattes start at $5.50 without any drink customizations applied. But, the vibes are unmatched \u2014 Nature\u2019s Brew is always bound to be bustling with the latest hipster wannabes and art majors.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/01/11/this-would-never-happen-in-real-life-professionals-on-fake-professionals/", "response": "```\nAgainst real life: Professionals on fake professionals\n\n\u2018\u2019This show was really awful to watch. Thank you for making it.\u201d For comedian and actress Ayo Edebiri, this is the general praise (or criticism?) she randomly receives from chefs she encounters on a day-to-day basis. \u201cI\u2019m just like, \u2018You\u2019re welcome?\u2019\u201d Edebiri says. A compliment and confrontation wrapped into one, Edebiri jokes to the Hollywood Reporter about the conflicted reception she receives from the chefs she emulates on The Bear (2022-). Real-life chefs who tune into the television series are both scarred and awed by how accurately the show presents their everyday hardships, where tensions are high and blood is boiling, documenting what really goes down at a restaurant prior to the setting of a customer\u2019s plate.\n\nFrom the officers and lawyers of the Law and Order cinematic universe, to the finance bros of The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), The Bear is just one of many in a long line of entertainment that make the workplace their backdrop. However, The Bear\u2019s haunting replica of the restaurant industry didn\u2019t happen spontaneously; it reflects the exhaustive behind-the-scenes work of producers, consultants, and actors. Spearheaded by chefs turned producers, Matty Matheson (who plays Neil Fak in the series) and Courtney Storer (sister of series creator Christopher Storer), the show\u2019s cast and crew works hard to ensure that the profession is presented as honestly as possible.\n\nLead actors Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri spent two weeks at Pasadena\u2019s Institute of Culinary Kitchen, working with some of the best chefs in LA, Chicago and New York, according to the L.A. Times. White would even find himself working at the Michelin-starred French bistro Pasjoli in Santa Monica. Writers participated in virtual Q&As with real-life chefs, and Courtney Storer handed over her past journals documenting her own experience with restaurant burnout, allowing their production team to understand the mental hardships that come with the profession.\n\nSome could say The Bear is the pinnacle of media-representation for a single profession, hitting too close to home for chefs to consider it a comfort show. But as a viewer of the series who has never once worked in a restaurant, I still get glimpses of the same anxiety chefs viewing the series might receive. As I watch Michelin-starless, I still pick up on the show\u2019s attention-to-detail and say to myself, \u201cI feel like they\u2019ve nailed this.\u201d\n\nHowever, some professions aren\u2019t awarded the luxury of seeing themselves accurately reflected in entertainment. Susan Gavigan, a longtime attorney, feels law is one of the worst professions portrayed in the media. While she admits to indulging in shows like Suits and How to Get Away with Murder, watching these shows with others involves her holding her tongue to not ruin their experience. Gavigan explains most television shows and films get the typical \u201cdramatic\u201d personalities of lawyers right \u2013 the grit, dedication, and fierceness. However, more often than not, show runners emphasize entertainment over accuracy, showcasing a fictional criminal justice system on steroids.\n\nFor example, the average lawyer could only hope to defend a celebrity or participate in a case with intense media coverage. \u201cA lot of people engage and watch [celebrity cases], but that doesn\u2019t mean that the average trial in America is like that,\u201d Gavigan says. The average trial is much more mundane, with standard procedures and longer timelines.\n\nOne study attempts to understand how professions are depicted in media and the effects it may have. In 2022, researchers Sabyasachee Baruah and Krishna Somandepalli of the Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory (SAIL) analyzed the changes and trends of professional representations. Shikanth Narayanan, the university professor who helped facilitate the study, says that media \u201cis very powerful and compelling in shaping people\u2019s experiences and behavior.\u201d\n\nAs much as we joke about the inaccuracies in media, these depictions simply correlate with our world at large. For example, depictions of congresswomen and policewomen have increased in recent years as more women enter these professions. Using the OpenSubtitles database, the researchers were able to examine over 70 years of English entertainment. In doing this, the study was able to evaluate how professions were portrayed. For example, they found that STEM professions had the most positive portrayals of media, while manual labor had the most negative portrayals.\n\nBaruah, the lead author of the study, explained his fascination with how the language trends of media reflected changing times. \u201cThese words came up in the earlier years, like the 1950s, but did not come up in later years. So it was interesting to see how the usage of a word evolves overtime,\u201d Barauah said. Gender-neutral terms, for example, like principal (over headmistress and headmaster), massage therapist (over masseuse and masseur), and flight attendant (over steward and stewardess) have increased over time, paralleling the more progressive world we live in today, that is less defined by gender roles.\n\nProfessionals on Fictional Professionals\n\nMedia representation does hold real-life consequences. Which is why real-life professionals are sought out for consultation on some of our favorite productions. Michael Metzner, physician turned producer for ABC studios, uses his expertise to assist the production of medical shows like Grey\u2019s Anatomy (2005-) and Ratched (2020). His work on Grey\u2019s Anatomy started with a flier sent out by the series to every general surgeon program in the country. What was supposed to be a three-month gig for Metzner, turned into a new, life-changing career with ABC Studios.\n\nNo day is ever the same for Metzner. When he\u2019s not seeing patients on the weekends, he is working 15-16 hour weekdays on set. Hours can be spent in the writer\u2019s room working through storylines, or directly on set, helping actors to mimic what he spent years studying for. Though he doesn\u2019t work alone; he is just one piece in the working machine of medical-practitioners and experts who drive the show\u2019s accuracy.\n\nPast the dynamic characters, messy love triangles and insane storylines, these films and television shows can hold the key to the next generation of professionals. ZenBusiness, a popular business formation service, surveyed 1,005 working professionals on the influence media had on their careers. 58% said their career path was at least slightly inspired by a book, TV show, movie, podcast, or video game. Shows can be aspirational, showing us \u201ccool\u201d jobs like astronauts, ballerinas, or horseback riders. However, as we approach young adulthood, shows become research, providing us options for what we want to do for the rest of our lives.\n\nThis is seen in the stack of letters Grey\u2019s Anatomy receives from individuals who say the show inspired them to become doctors. But Metzner emphasizes that the show\u2019s influence is shown in more ways than one. In one instance, Metzner recounts receiving a text from one of his former colleagues. An episode of Grey\u2019s Anatomy that covered the rare condition of median arcuate ligament syndrome \u2013 a condition where a ligament in the lower part of your chest presses on a main blood vessel, causing it to not function properly \u2013 just aired. The former colleague \u2013 who Metzner hadn\u2019t spoken to in five years \u2013 began the conversation by asking about his role in the storyline. Metzner reluctantly admitted his involvement, anticipating criticism of the condition\u2019s reenactment. What Metzner heard instead was quite the opposite: \u201cCongratulations, I\u2019m seeing a patient in two hours who was diagnosed because they watched your episode,\u201d Metnzer recalls.\n\nAt times, entertainment is our only lifeline to the things we are unable to comprehend in our daily lives. We only have access to our own perspective, so our viewership of these shows and films, whether knowingly or unknowingly, is our attempt at grappling with what\u2019s outside our personal experiences or expertise. Metzner, like many others, understands the weight these portrayals can have on how society maneuvers the moment they premiere on people\u2019s screens.\n\nIt is why Grey\u2019s Anatomy treads carefully when doing storylines on transplants, never wanting to give the false impression that the process is quick and easy, considering the real-life patients undergoing the grueling wait on the transplant lists. It is why a 2015 study conducted by Washington State University professor Stacey Hust found the Law and Order franchise \u2013 which Gavigan and some of her peers consider one of the more accurate portrayals of the criminal justice system \u2013 is linked to an increased acknowledgement and practice of sexual consent. It is why educators who teach in Philadelphia\u2019s underfunded and under-resourced public schools hold hope following the release of Abbott Elementary (2022-), as it addresses the many issues teachers confront for the sake of their kids.\n\nThe beauty in tackling these portrayals is prioritizing accuracy where it counts. When a production decides to take a step back from storyline and put real-life impact at the forefront of its mind, a leisurely show can turn into a memorable statement piece. \u201cYou can truly have an impact on people both by inspiring them to go into medicine, or actually teaching themselves about their own bodies, without them even realizing that they\u2019re learning,\u201d Metzner explained.\n\nMetzner acknowledges the doctors who mercilessly critique the legitimacy of medical shows, but in his unique position of being on both sides of the coin, he has more understanding when shows don\u2019t get details completely right. Having worked on a production that can have anywhere between 100-200 people on set and a multitude of tasks going on at once, Metzner admits details are bound to \u201cslip through the cracks.\u201d These cracks are sometimes formed intentionally, sacrificing authenticity for the sake of the story.\n\n\u201cThere is a balance between amazing storytelling and the accuracy of the medicine...\u201d Metzner said. Accuracy is tossed aside (or gently placed in the recycling bin), in circumstances of omitting structure to prevent confusion, adding more instances of \u201cfree-time\u201d to incite dialogue and further storyline (\u201cWhy are they just sitting around? Don\u2019t they have jobs to do?\u201d), or heightening the rates of malpractice (instances that would be shut down way more often in the real-world), to promote drama and make a show more intriguing.\n\nBoth Gavigan and Metzner agree that where entertainment distorts their profession the most is in the time it takes to successfully work with a client/patient. \u201cA prospective client comes in and the next day they\u2019re in court.. Lawsuits don\u2019t happen that quickly. I would hope people would not wait till the last minute... hiring a lawyer and [then expecting] that lawyer to be prepared to represent them,\u201d Gavigan said. However, they understand that viewers wouldn\u2019t want to watch the dragged out process of their day-jobs, where much of it is playing the waiting game.\n\nIt\u2019s much more exciting to have a case solved every episode, or a patient miraculously up and running minutes after their life-saving procedure. \u201cWe have only 43 minutes to tell a beautiful story,\u201d Metzner explains. But how much accuracy are we willing to sacrifice? How much can a film or television show get wrong before it becomes comical? Does making a film or television series too truth-telling defeat its purpose, taking the entertain out of entertainment?\n\nAs I sit here and write this piece as an aspiring journalist, I realize that newsroom-based film and television never gave me the inkling to pursue the profession. In fact, it almost turned me away. As I applied to journalism programs across the country during my senior year of high school, I questioned whether or not I was even cut out to succeed in this pressure-cooking career that seemed so daunting on my television screen. Would I be able to handle the wrath of a ruthless and fierce editor like Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada (2006)? Could meditation ever successfully aid me through the stress-inducing stakes presented in All the President\u2019s Men (1976), a film centered on the very-real breaking of the Watergate Scandal. Would I really be willing to put my life on the line for the sake of a story?\n\nHowever, it didn\u2019t take me long to realize that the profession didn\u2019t have to be as all or nothing as the media had made it out to be. While harsh deadlines might keep me up every once in a while, I\u2019ve never felt like I have a target on my back (not yet at least). And the entertainment I consumed failed to display that the life of a journalist can be, and is, often boring, where sending and receiving interview requests and adhering to AP style is half of the job.\n\nWhile the attention-to-detail in portraying a profession can sway public perception of a career field, the goal of keeping people entertained still remains at the core of television and film. We as average viewers must remember this when consuming this genre of media, deciphering from what depictions can be added to our general perceptions, and what show runners intentionally placed to keep us watching \u2013 fibbed, overdramatized, and all. Not every show will be as meticulous as The Bear or have the resources to tell the most authentic story. And at times, maybe that\u2019s okay.\n\nMetzner, comparing his life as a surgeon to helping actors pretend to be one, gives himself grace if he is unable to achieve 100% accuracy. \u201cI just remember \u2013 no one\u2019s going to die.\u201d Because at the end of the day, it\u2019s just pretend.\n```"}
{"key": "/2024/01/11/the-tragedy-in-the-games-we-play/", "response": "```\nThe tragedy in the games we play\n\nDigital art by Shenshen Zhang\n\nBy Nina Moothedath January 11, 2024 at 11:08 am PST\n\nThere are not many cases where saying something made you miserable is high praise. Yet, whether it\u2019s reading a sad book for a good cry or waiting for the season when horror movies flood the box office, many are drawn to media that leaves them angry, scared or sad. As far back as Ancient Greece, philosophers have studied the genre of tragedy, with Aristotle using the term catharsis to describe the release of emotion people felt after watching characters face unhappy endings. By watching these stories, he believed people were able to feel and then find relief from difficult emotions.\n\nWhile plays are still a well-loved form of storytelling, there are types of tragic entertainment that have evolved far past what Aristotle could have imagined. One of them has a unique way of delivering misery to its audiences, or rather, its players.\n\nWhat are games? There are many definitions of a \u201cgame,\u201d but one way to describe it is when play with a goal has rules that lead to an uncertain outcome. For example, in a game of catch, the goal is to get the highest number of passes back and forth. The rule is that you stand a certain distance apart, which makes the outcome uncertain because you don\u2019t know how many passes you\u2019ll make. The challenges created by rules are important in making any game fun to play.\n\nAccording to USC Interactive Media & Games Division Professor Tracy Fullerton, players can\u2019t feel the joy of victory without challenge. \u201cWhen you\u2019re designing a game, you want to take a player on a journey of emotions,\u201d Fullerton said. \u201cThat journey may include parts where we have to work hard and we have to learn and we have to retry things. In order to do that, we challenge the player.\u201d\n\nI most recently felt the effects of challenge while playing a gaming journey, \u201cThe Return of the Obra Dinn,\u201d a mystery adventure where each wrong answer had me wanting to scream at my screen. Hours would pass and I\u2019d feel only slightly closer to my goal. Yet despite running into failure time and time again, I look back on the finished game as an incredible experience. I\u2019m not the only one; other players online report feeling the same frustrations but still rate the game highly. Even The Guardian\u2019s glowing review of the game calls it \u201carduous but captivating\u201d.\n\nPlayers need a challenge, but why would games that create real frustration not make them turn away? One theory is that failure in games is designed to motivate players. In his book, The Art of Failure, Jesper Juul explores why people who generally try to avoid failure play games that include just that. According to Juul, one important factor is that games test a mix of general skills, like problem-solving, and ones specific to the game, like knowing how pieces on a chess board move. Having weak game-specific skills doesn\u2019t hurt motivation because you\u2019re not expected to be an expert yet. The pain of failure is still real, but it\u2019s easier to brush off.\n\nAnother aspect of game design that keeps players willing to face obstacles is the careful planning that makes it possible to succeed. For the creators of the cosmic horror fishing game Dredge, it was important to keep their game as accessible as possible. They paid close attention to where challenges added to players\u2019 experiences or took away from it. \u201cDredge has a very limited inventory, and a lot of players say \u2018I wish my boat was bigger...\u2019 but that\u2019s kind of the point of the game, and it\u2019s why it can be compelling,\u201d said game programmer Joel Mason, \u201cbut if one person gets stuck on something and it ruins their experience, we\u2019ll probably fix it. It\u2019s all a balancing act.\u201d\n\nWhile the Dredge developers worked hard to limit frustration, they also wanted to create tension and unease in their players. Just like having the chance to confront failure can be enjoyable in games, facing fear can make a great experience. \u201cWe deliberately pull the camera above you so you lose your peripheral vision and you can\u2019t see what\u2019s under the water, you can\u2019t see what\u2019s coming from the distance. You\u2019re left with the sound of the ocean and your own thoughts,\u201d 3D artist Michael Bastiaens said.\n\nIn addition to creating a sense of danger, the developers made sure players had ways to overcome the horrors they faced. From being able to get upgrades to being able to skip some quests, these allowed players to feel capable of surviving the game\u2019s dangerous nights. \u201cWe really drive home the fact that you shouldn\u2019t be out at night... and eventually players start conquering that fear,\u201d Mason said. \u201cI want them to feel like they\u2019ve grown in confidence.\u201d\n\nOne way that games make overcoming fear especially satisfying can be seen in The Last of Us franchise. The first game and its TV adaptation both tell the story of zombie apocalypse survivors Joel and Ellie, but from a slightly different perspective. \u201cWhen I watch the show I\u2019m always focused on the relationship. I\u2019m watching their faces...I\u2019m hoping for things, but I don\u2019t have any agency to make them happen.\u201d Fullerton explained. \u201cWhen I\u2019m playing the game, I\u2019m hoping for things but I\u2019m also in a position to try to make them happen\u201d\n\nYou can still feel powerful emotions for a character in a show, but in a game your skill and choices determine your character\u2019s fate, making fear (and overcoming it) more personal. As Fullerton explained, neither is necessarily better, but they\u2019re each unique forms of storytelling.\n\nHaving this agency also means that when characters face defeat, you can reach out for real help. Maya Dhanani, a freshman Game Art major at USC, experienced this in the game \u201cSky: Children of the Light\u2019'. In the game, players interact with others and explore different realms of a magical kingdom. When Dhanani encountered The Golden Wasteland, a more difficult section, she realized that she didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201cBecause I was so scared to go in, I found a veteran player to help me go through it, and we ended up becoming friends,\u201d Dhanani explained. \u201cThen she introduced me to other people and [now] I have all these online friends that I still talk to.\u201d\n\nStrong communities are a key part of any type of game, with many players offering each other support as they face and overcome the challenges games present. \u201cIn The Stanley Parable, that\u2019s entirely a single player game, but there\u2019s still online forums,\u201d Dhanani said. \u201cCommunity has always been a part of games, even ones that aren\u2019t inherently collaborative.\u201d\n\nFeeling fear and failure can be unpleasant at first, but there\u2019s generally a clear path forward. Once you move past it, you can breathe easier and continue on. That\u2019s not true for all difficult emotions that games explore. Take NORCO, a 2022 adventure game where the main character returns to her hometown to face the death of her mother and the effects of pollution on her community. Although there are various endings of NORCO, you can\u2019t solve all the problems of the town and its inhabitants. There\u2019s no full answers or resolutions for the complex feelings it creates.\n\nAs Tim Hutchins, a game developer and professor, explained, the difference between \u201ctype one\u201d and \u201ctype two\u201d fun can help explain the draw of games like NORCO that draw on complex emotions. Originally used in the outdooring community, the term \u201cType one\u201d fun describes activities that are enjoyable while you\u2019re doing them, like listening to music. \u201cType two\u201d fun includes activities that are enjoyable to look back on, like going on a difficult hike. Games like \u201cGetting Over It\u201d and \u201cDark Souls\u201d that are designed to be difficult can bring players type two fun as they look back on their hard work. That being said, games typically avoid \u201ctype three\u201d fun, which is when something isn\u2019t fun at all, not when playing or looking back.\n\nTo keep their games away from type three fun, some game developers use safety tools. One form of game that commonly uses these are role playing games, or RPGs, where players take on characters. For game developer Rachel Rudy, having safety rules to make sure players know they can take a break were a priority in her game, \u201cDenatured.\u201d In it, players act as clones who are \u201cdenaturing\u201d and will all die, except for the original. Rudy explained that she was inspired to create the game after the process of college applications, where she and her friends felt pressured to pick a single future they wanted to pursue. \u201cThe game was a way that I could work through those fears that I had about choosing an identity and growing up, and it didn\u2019t fix me. That\u2019s not the point. But it\u2019s a safe environment where we [could] let ourselves feel those feelings,\u201d Rudy said, \u201cThat\u2019s that cathartic experience that can be really overwhelming, but it\u2019s safe and it\u2019s controlled and it\u2019s understood.\u201d\n\nExploring hard emotions can be stressful, some players agree to it as part of a game experience. In those cases, safety tools can be used if someone starts feeling hurt or uncomfortable in real life. It\u2019s similar to how in football it\u2019s fine to have hard tackles and hits, but if someone gets actually injured, play stops. \u201cIn roleplaying games, because they can be so nebulous and so personal, it\u2019s very important to establish safety,\u201d Rudy said. \u201cYou can feel that what you\u2019re going through is intentional.\u201d\n\nIn his game One Hundred Year Old Vampire, Hutchins has players explore themes of loss as they play an aging vampire trying to hold onto their memories. He described how when players let themselves be vulnerable with each other, they can create stories that are uniquely impactful. \u201cIt can be dark and miserable because it\u2019s ours,\u201dHutchins said. \u201cIt\u2019s you and me doing this thing right now, and it can be much more than it is as a story...It\u2019s not a script...it\u2019s natural and it\u2019s yours and it\u2019s special.\u201d\n\nBy creating environments where players can be vulnerable safely, games allow players to feel the depths of difficult emotions. Outside of gaining memorable experiences, learning to fully feel these emotions is an important life lesson. According to Linda Yaron Weston, an expert in mindfulness and well-being at USC, recognizing when your feelings can be the first step in managing them. \u201cWe are human and we\u2019re going to have all of these emotions come up. With them we have a choice: How do I show up around this emotion?\u201d Weston said. \u201cOften we might stuff that emotion down somewhere and ignore it or become overwhelmed by it.\u201d\n\nThe ability to deal with hard emotions like failure has been called emotional literacy and emotional responsiveness. According to Weston, it can be strengthened, whether through practices like mindfulness or through playing video games. \u201cWe can learn to become better at resilience. We may have heard of post-traumatic stress, but post-traumatic growth is when we can learn to become human,\u201d Weston said. \u201cWe can learn and grow from our challenges.\u201d\n\nEven if feeling something in a game isn\u2019t the same as real life, the emotions players have are still real and powerful. These might not be immediately pleasant, they stick with players and offer a chance to process and work through them. \u201cCatharsis is not to actually have an experience with grief. It is to practice an experience with grief. It is to rehearse our reactions to grief,\u201d Fullerton said. \u201cThe grief is real, but it\u2019s also part of this pretend...That\u2019s what the arts can do for us.\u201d\n\nIn roleplaying games, video games, board games, sports or any other form of game, you can work through the failure, fear and hurt that comes with being human in a safe way. From guilt and helplessness to anger and grief, the tragedy in games can help players connect with how they experience the hardest parts of life.\n```"}

Nearby, another crowd comes forth, waves blue placards above their heads, chanting demands for change lined with frustration and gut-wrenching despair. Both groups have come all the way out to respond to the same court decision. The majority of both groups of people look similar in appearance, but beneath the skin, they bear fruit to two different minds. They look at each other in disdain. Ironically enough, both say they are fighting for one thing: Asian American rights.\n\nJust before July 2023, the Supreme Court raised the hand of Students for Fair Admissions over the Presidents and Fellows of Harvard. They held that \u201cHarvard\u2019s and UNC\u2019s admissions programs violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d\n\nIn middle school Spanish class, the teacher had us form groups of three to do an in-class activity. One person was assigned to be the artist and, as a kid who enjoyed doodling as a hobby, I volunteered to draw for this assignment. A tall white boy with flat brown hair, who was in high school at the time, said matter-of-factly, \u201cOf course she\u2019s good at drawing, she\u2019s Asian.\u201d\n\nA few years later, sitting in our calculus class in the senior year of high school, the topic of college enrollment naturally came up. We were discussing which universities we wanted to attend and how we were studying for the ACT or SAT, and I distinctly remember a friend of mine \u2014 a freckled white boy with long, wavy brown hair \u2014 letting out a scoff as his lips curled up in annoyance. \u201cI know I probably won\u2019t get into the school I want because I\u2019m white,\u201d he said.\n\nThirteen-year-old me wasn\u2019t completely ignorant. I had already known that people referred to people who look like me as the \u201cmodel minority\u201d and had a vague idea of how race-based compliments weren\u2019t good. But I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t flattered. After all, I had confidence and pride in my drawing skills. It felt better than when people would call me derogatory, stereotypical nicknames for being Asian, or stare at me with contempt.\n\nThe issue of college admissions felt like a whole different subject. Asian Americans hold a precarious position in the United States. We are certainly not white, nor are we representative of the struggles of many other communities of color, at least on a surface level. The model minority myth asserts that Asians are role-model citizens who were able to find socioeconomic stability despite their skin color. According to the media and to white people, we are demure, humble, hard-working, intelligent, skilled, polite, quiet, organized, and on and on and on.\n\nAlso the L: Asians are too smart, they\u2019re unfairly dominating the Ivy League. Same day: Asians are too dumb to realize they were just a tool of the white supremacists behind the SCOTUS aff action case.\n\nThe Mother of All Race-IQ Graphs. Shows the percentage of persons within each IQ range which belong to a particular group. In the highest-IQ ranges, blacks disappear, and Asians dominate. In the very lowest-IQ ranges, Asians almost disappear, and Hispanics and blacks dominate.\n\nAsians are humble, respectful, hardworking, successful,Not criminals and best of all they don't carry a race card. That's why black africans hate them\n\nWe are the supposed proof that racial minorities can climb the ladder in the colorblind American society, as long as we work hard on an individual level. This sentiment derives from the American Dream, defined as the national ethos of the United States that emphasizes opportunities for individuals to prosper and succeed, often characterized by diligence and the upholding of a capitalist society. However, scholars have recently been criticizing the effects of capitalism rooted in the American Dream as they lead to extreme wealth disparities in the U.S. The increase in deaths in communities caused by \u201cfatal drug and alcohol poisonings, suicide, and deaths resulting from chronic liver disease,\u201d dubbed as \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d by economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton, were found to be co-occuring with economic insecurity.\n\nBut for supporters of American capitalism, Asians\u2019 climbing of the socioeconomic hierarchy is seen as something to be praised. Some even go as far as to claim that Asians are honorary whites. \u201cThe idea would be that, in this case, the population that\u2019s more in control or that sits on the top would be whites on top of a racial hierarchy,\u201d USC Professor of Political Science Jane Junn said. \u201cAnd they would say, well, okay, we can always keep Asians out by ... always creating them as an outsider ... But we can say instead, \u2018Oh, Asians have rules [and] deny gratification in order to make progress. So you\u2019re a model minority. And if Asians can do it, why can\u2019t Blacks?\u2019 So there\u2019s a story inside of the model minority myth.\u201d\n\nThese complexities surrounding the model minority myth and the identity of Asians in the U.S. become the most explicitly noticeable in education. Affirmative action, which is a set of policies meant to increase opportunities in the workforce or education for minorities and women, has been the center of media attention in recent years, quickly fueled by race-related discussions. Some have accused these policies of covertly discriminating against some Asian students who score the best academically, such as in standardized tests.\n\nAccording to the National Education Association, \u201cDecades of research demonstrate that Black, Latin(o/a/x), and Native students, as well as students from some Asian groups, experience bias from standardized tests administered from early childhood through college.\u201d\n\nAs standardized testing persists as a dominant method of judging students\u2019 academic capabilities, the ambiguous narratives around affirmative action are leading to divided opinions among Asian Americans. According to the Pew Research Center, despite 62% of Asian American registered voters leaning Democrat and 53% of Asian American adults saying affirmative action policies are good, about three in four Asian adults also said college admissions should not rely on the applicants\u2019 racial or ethnic background.\n\nAffirmative action broadly refers to the set of policies that intend on providing more academic and labor opportunities for marginalized communities, but it has recently found itself in the center of academic controversy in American higher education. It brings up an interesting question: Why are Asian Americans, who are mostly left-leaning, having mixed opinions on race-based admissions?\n\nWai Wah Chin, the conservative founding president of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York, has fought against several high schools in New York for discriminating against Asian students in their admission processes. Chin said she believes affirmative action is the biggest example of systemic racism in the U.S. that is targeting Asian Americans.\n\n\u201cI know that a lot of Asian families feel that education is one thing that we have always loved and cherished,\u201d Chin said. \u201cAnd so it comes with the understanding that that is a part of history. We know it means hard work, it means sacrifice ... If this is good for the country, and we believe that education is good, and there are families [and] children who are willing to sacrifice for that, they should not be punished for them.\u201d\n\nConnie Chung Joe, the Chief Executive Officer of Asians Americans Advancing Justice Southern California (AJSOCAL), agreed that education is culturally important to many Asian Americans. However, she warned of the danger that comes from lumping all Asian Americans together under the model minority label.\n\n\u201cThere is a group of Asian Americans who really love that we are portrayed as successful and smart and hardworking, and don\u2019t get into trouble, \u2018cause those are usually compliments,\u201d Chung Joe said. \u201cWhen you look at other groups like Southeast Asian groups like the Hmong community, the Vietnamese community, and then when you add in Pacific Islanders, who are not Asian American, but they\u2019re often categorized together with Asian Americans, you see so many challenges and barriers to education.\u201d\n\nAnd this is true according to research done by the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center (SEARAC). They found that about a quarter of Southeast Asian American adults don\u2019t have a high school diploma and \u201c26 percent of Cambodian, 24 percent of Hmong, 31 percent of Lao, and 20 percent of Vietnamese Americans\u201d have not attended college for any period of time.\n\nAll of these statistics show that there are more difficulties in pursuing education for these groups when compared to all Asians.\n\nAccording to its website, AJSOCAL is the largest independent nonprofit organization in the country that works to improve political participation and availability for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, as well as educating themselves and their allies about Asian American civil rights. AAJC has recently denounced the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to strike down affirmative action.\n\n\u201cIn our ever-changing global economy and platform, we must continue to give all students the opportunity to fulfill their potential and shape a future built strong on our biggest asset: our diversity,\u201d Chung Joe said in her statement.\n\nRegardless of what the majority of Asian Americans believe, the narrative against race-conscious admissions has found success through putting Asians forward as the face of the movement. Students for Fair Admissions, the nonprofit group that challenged the admissions procedure at Harvard University, argued that the school was violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment \u2014 and ultimately succeeded in getting the Supreme Court to rule the use of affirmative action as being unconstitutional.\n\nThe first photo you see when you click on their website is a photo of a male Asian American student, along with the white captions in bold saying, \u201cHelp Us Eliminate Race and Ethnicity from College Admissions.\u201d\n\nThis tactic is not new. Conservatives have circulated the striking photos capturing \u201cRooftop Koreans,\u201d the Korean immigrants in Koreatown, Los Angeles who waited on the roof of their businesses with guns during the LA Uprising of 1992, using them to emphasize the apparent importance of the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cThere are two models to which Americans can aspire,\u201d an article on Townhall, a conservative website, argued. \u201cOne is to be citizens, armed and sovereign. The other is to be serfs, disarmed and obedient to their liberal elite overlords. Choose wisely. Choose to be a Rooftop Korean.\u201d\n\nIn the months that followed after I learned of the results of my college applications to different schools, I thought about my friend\u2019s passive-aggressive jab at affirmative action in high school more than once. Frankly speaking, my brain wandered off into that territory for a few days, considering the possibility of whether I got rejected from my top choices of universities because of my identity as a Korean.\n\nI did get over this notion rather quickly. I focused on maintaining my grades alone over participating in extracurricular activities, as I have always been wary of being around other people. It was no surprise that the more elite schools didn\u2019t appreciate this, regardless of my academic achievements. Ambitious students who graduate summa cum laude, score high on the admissions exams and stay active in several sports and clubs are a dime a dozen.\n\nAs such, I felt that I had no reason to feel wronged by the system. But others \u2014 certainly the minority, but a loud one \u2014 think differently.\n\n\u201cIf the halls of our greatest universities and our education and our public schools are saying it\u2019s okay to tell Asians that they are excluded because they\u2019re Asians, what sort of message does that send out?\u201d Chin said.\n\n\u201cAnd from your very top institutions that are saying that it\u2019s okay to exclude Asians, why is it not okay for people to go on the streets and say you don\u2019t belong here?\u201d\n\nChung Joe said she believes people and groups like Edward Blum or SFFA are using the model minority myth to appeal to the small number of Asian Americans in order to use them as spokespeople for their message.\n\n\u201cI think [Edward Blum and SFFA are] capitalizing that ... there is a minority of Asian Americans who really do believe in that,\u201d Chung Joe said. \u201cYou really embrace that model minority myth. And they wanna just see Asian Americans or their communities benefit.\u201d\n\nAsian Americans on both sides of the affirmative action debate are, ironically enough, fighting for Asian American rights. Chin was one of the most passionate people I have ever spoken to, and she genuinely believed the battles she fights would improve the lives of Asian students and their families.\n\nBut these arguments are built on sand castles called resentment, specifically against other minority groups, the stereotypes as building blocks that ultimately frame the oppressed as our enemies. The conservative reasoning scratches at Asians\u2019 insecurities, all of our desperation for acceptance and assimilation into American identity.\n\nBut adopting a white mentality by sympathizing with the privileged and demonizing the others will never change how society ultimately views Asian people.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as January 11, 2024 at 10:14 am PST\n\nIn the final minutes of an intense conference game against Washington State (11-5, 2-3), USC men\u2019s basketball (8-8, 2-3) had a chance to win, yet a 9-0 run from the Cougars in the last two minutes sealed a 72-64 victory for Washington Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cWe got to get on the right side of winning,\u201d fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis said. \u201cNo pressure, we just got to go win.\u201d\n\nCougars senior forward Isaac Jones notched his fourth double-double of the season with a game-high 26 points and 11 rebounds. Ellis scored a team-high 18 points and had four rebounds while battling a hamstring injury for most of the game. USC senior forward DJ Rodman, who transferred from Washington State, scored eight points and grabbed eight rebounds.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t get the opportunity to play against their old school,\u201d Rodman said. \u201cI had fun competing with my friends from there.\u201d\n\nAvailability was the night\u2019s story for the Trojans, as several key players were dealing with injuries. Two hours before the game, Enfield discovered that starting junior center Joshua Morgan was out of tonight\u2019s game due to an illness, causing a shift in the starting lineup. Sophomore center Vince Iwuchukwu got the green light to replace Morgan.\n\nThe Trojans felt Morgan\u2019s absence, as the Cougars attacked the paint effectively, scoring 34 points in the paint on the night. In addition, Collier left the game in the second half after a bang-bang play, resulting in a right-hand injury that kept him out for the rest of the contest. Although Collier\u2019s backcourt partner, Ellis, played the whole game, he could be seen visibly limping in and out of possessions.\n\nThe Trojans entered the game riding a two-game win streak, looking to make it three against Washington State. However, the Trojans\u2019 performance in the first half did not mirror that statement. In what seems to be an ongoing issue for the Trojans, another poor shooting night from the field had them trailing by one going into halftime.\n\nIn the first half, the Trojans shot 32% from the field, barely finding any rhythm from three. \u201cI thought we were playing well enough offensively in the first half to have a six, eight or ten-point lead,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t shoot the ball well.\u201d\n\nWhile Washington State did not perform much better in the first half, the Cougars benefited heavily from junior forward Jaylen Wells\u2019 shooting from beyond the arc. Wells was nearly perfect from three, converting on 3-of-4 beyond the arc, and he ended the first half with a last-second layup to put the Cougars up one heading into halftime, 29-28.\n\n\u201cGive credit to them; they defended us well and took us out of our game,\u201d Rodman said.\n\nAfter a sluggish first half from both squads, each found their rhythm, assembling strings of runs. Collier was aggressive in the second half, scoring six early points to start, getting into the paint, and finishing around the rim. However, his night would end with 12:12 left in the second half.\n\n\u201cIt hurts not to have him out there in those final minutes,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nThe second half was a back-and-forth battle with the Trojans and Cougars trading buckets. The Cougars\u2019 Jones started to dominate the inside, scoring at will, scoring 17 of his 26 points in the second half. On the other end, Ellis fought heavily, hitting multiple tough shots while Rodman came alive, converting two big threes to keep the Trojans in the game.\n\n\u201c[Ellis] is such a great offensive player, but when you\u2019re injured and you play that many minutes, it takes a toll on your body,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nYet, in the end, the season-long defensive issues for the Trojans showed their face. The Cougars outscored the Trojans 13-6 in the final five minutes of play. Wells and Jones continued to be the key factors in helping secure the Cougars\u2019 first win in Galen since 2015.\n\nThe win marked only the second time Washington State has beaten USC in their last 10 matchups.\n\n\u201cI feel like we have been pretty bad defensively. I feel like defense creates offense. We get stops, we\u2019re allowed to play in transition and play faster, and that\u2019s when we are at our best.\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWhen we are talking the ball out the net, it slows us down.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans hit the road for a three-game stretch starting this weekend. USC begins the road trip at the Colorado Buffaloes on Saturday at 7 p.m.\n```"}

Photo by Jaelyn Gonzalez of Ampersand LA.\n\nBy Jaelyn Gonzalez\nJanuary 09, 2024 at 1:00 pm PST\n\nBefore entering \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own,\u201d I noticed a flood of young women in ballet flats and white dresses. All of them exuded sophistication yet playfulness as they smiled and laughed through their phone cameras. I followed the bunch down Fairfax Avenue in Little Ethiopia and into the small exhibition space as soft 1960s folk music engulfed the place. Among the crowded room was curator Orion Carloto, fashioned similarly to the other young women in the crowd with a simple yet elegant black dress. As Carloto walked through the space, all eyes became glued on her. It makes sense why, as she told me, \u201cEverything I do has always been for women and for girls.\u201d\n\nCarloto is a Los Angeles-based writer and Internet personality. Bouncing between cities in the U.S., she eventually landed in L.A. in 2017. Her following started on a YouTube comedy show and her Tumblr page in the early 2010s. The online appeal for her writings and photography grew into an actuality with her 2017 poetry book, \u201cFlux,\u201d and 2020 photography book, \u201cFilm for Her.\u201d She has always been a curator online, yet never in a live form. Her gentle manner and grace mirrored the first exhibit she curated, \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own.\u201d It was named after what Carloto calls \u201cthe spirit of Virginia Woolf\u201d \u2014 in other words, parroting Woolf\u2019s 1929 book of the same name.\n\n\u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own\u201d was a two-day exhibit held at Exhibit A Gallery on Dec. 9 and 10. It was an assembly of mixed-media pieces. From a bed centered in the middle of the room to a mounted quilt from the Joan Didion Estate, Carloto curated a whimsical and feminine forward assortment of artworks. Woolf\u2019s book was an essay she wrote in response to the treatment of women of her era. At the time, Woolf lived in a society where women were discouraged from investing in a life of their own. It was a woman\u2019s duty to take care of her husband and children. The essay was an important addition to the women\u2019s suffrage movement and the ongoing wave of feminism following the electoral equality legislation of the late 1920s. Within \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own,\u201d Woolf stressed the importance of a woman\u2019s space for creative freedom. A room to birth the individual expression to write, fuel education and ultimately be free.\n\nCarloto reimagined Woolf\u2019s words into a space. The collection radiated feminine elegance as lace details were intertwined in almost every work displayed. The creative components Woolf preached were also implemented in the form of books and poetry in a few installations. Hanging at the very back of the room was the Didion quilt, which once hung in the room of the writer\u2019s daughter, Quintana Roo, in New York City. To have a piece from Didion\u2019s home adds a layer of awe to the idea of creative expression.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the pieces in the auction that I was able to get my hands on,\u201d Carloto said. \u201cIt feels unreal, like I should not have this piece. But I\u2019d like to assume that the spirit of Joan has approved because it\u2019s in my hand. I thought the whole time [while bidding for the quilt], If it gets in my hand, that means she approves. If it doesn\u2019t, it is a show-and-tell sign that she hates everything that I do. And that\u2019s just my only way of coping with her death,\u201d she chuckled slightly.\n\nHowever, the true essence of Carloto\u2019s vision was seen in one of the central pieces of the exhibit \u2014 a replica of \u201cA Young Woman Sleeping in a Chair\u201d by the 18th-century artist Pietro Rotari. The oil painting is a Baroque-style portrait of a woman \u2014 typical for Rotari. The soft-featured woman is asleep with a bonnet on her head and a ribbon tied around her neck, depicting a leisurely life. Despite the painting being a replica, the work does its job as the driving force behind the exhibit theme. It is melodic, comfortable and graceful.\n\nA replica of \u201dA Young Woman Sleeping in a Chair\u201d by Pietro Rotari on view. Photo by Jaelyn Gonzalez of Ampersand LA.\n\nHowever, at times Carloto\u2019s curation feels a little lifeless and derived only from inspiration, rather than originality. While its meaning is beautiful and comes from profound revolutionary women, it feels as if it is not coming from Carloto at all. Aside from Woolf, the collection is closely put together with direct inspiration from Sofia Coppola\u2019s feminine imagery and designer Sandy Liang\u2019s creative direction. While no art is original, Carloto\u2019s curation acts as a Pinterest board of images rather than a passionate arrangement of pieces.\n\nHer Internet visions translated offline beyond the artwork on display. Walking through the exhibit, groups of young women would pose in front of the artwork. So much so, it became irritable for exhibit-goers who did not come for an Instagram photo. While it is not Carloto\u2019s fault for her online followers immersing themselves in a real-life Instagram page, it was ultimately distasteful. When I asked her for an interview, Carloto herself even paused to \u201ctake a picture for Instagram because the lighting is good.\u201d However, she avoids using labels like \u201cinfluencer\u201d as she tries to move away from an Internet persona and into creative roles. She calls herself a writer first and has more plans as a curator.\n\n\u201cI would love to do more,\u201d she said. \u201cI have been curating my world for so long, but it is only lived online. As much as I love the online world, I love the ability to have something tangible in your hand or [before] your eyes. I feel like that\u2019s the best way I could get my point across. And a photograph could only do so much. I hope moving forward, whether it\u2019s more exhibitions, or the dream to do a film one day. I feel like it feels right for me.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Carloto redefined the bed. Images of beds since 1998, notably due to Tracey Emin\u2019s \u201cMy Bed,\u201d have been associated with depression. However, Carloto\u2019s imagination takes the mattress to a new meaning. Instead of beds fostering the struggles of mental health, she finds them to be a source of creativity. A glimpse of the display is captured in Carloto\u2019s zine, \u201cBeds I\u2019ve Slept In.\u201d The zine is a collection of photographs including beds and bedside table items: ashtrays, pill boxes and rosaries \u2014 most of which were archival discoveries by the curator that she photographed. Her zine will soon be sold on her website for those who missed the exhibit.\n\nZine on display. Photo by Jaelyn Gonzalez of Ampersand LA.\n\nThe zine was available on-site for display and as I flipped through, a lack of spirit through the photos was noted. Carloto would\u2019ve benefited from a narrative or some poetry, although it does end with a poem, titled \u201cMaidenhair Lullaby.\u201d The poem does not glue the photos together. But, for the exhibit\u2019s short time, a zine is the perfect addition as it acts as a souvenir or a supplement for the collection. Orion Carloto has set a release date, Jan 11 at 10 a.m. for the sale of \u201cBeds I\u2019ve Slept In\u201d and will be self-publishing the zine on her website, OrionCarloto.com.\n```"}

Whether it\u2019s the Green Bay Packers having a quality quarterback, the Pittsburgh Steelers fielding a terrifying defensive line, or the Bengals boasting Pro Bowl-caliber talent at receiver, defined organizational philosophies and effort toward stacking specific areas of rosters have yielded perennial dominance for certain teams. One of these is the Dallas Cowboys offensive line, a formidable group that ranks top five in sacks allowed (480) and sack rate (0.47) since 2010. Fielding premier talent over the years like Travis Frederick, Zack Martin, and Tyron Smith, the Cowboys have developed a reputation as the premier NFL franchise for drafting and developing offensive linemen, a trend that has continued with the emergence of guard Tyler Smith.\n\nNow in his sophomore season, the Tulsa product has grown into one of the best guards in football, ranking second in pass-blocking efficiency rate (98.4), a metric that measures pressures allowed on a per-snap basis, and sixth in PFF run-blocking grade (79.7). And with the Cowboys\u2019 best offensive linemen entering the twilight of their careers (both Zack Martin and Tyron Smith just turned 33), Smith is in prime position to cement himself as the crown jewel of America\u2019s team.\n\nOn this week\u2019s edition of Tape Talk, we\u2019ll break down Tyler Smith\u2019s path to becoming one of the league\u2019s premier linemen, delving into his journey from raw tackle prospect to dominant guard, his strengths, and where he needs to improve to elevate himself into All-Pro consideration.\n\nBorn in Fort Worth, Texas, Smith played defensive line his entire life before being moved to left tackle during his junior high school season. He excelled despite his inexperience, earning All-District and All-State honors, yet was still overlooked by the major Texas programs throughout his recruitment, leading him to sign with the University of Tulsa.\n\nAfter a redshirt season in 2019, Smith started 21 games for the Golden Hurricanes from 2020-2021, earning freshman All-American and First Team All-AAC honors during his redshirt freshman season, and a place on the All-AAC Second Team as a sophomore. Smith developed a reputation as a freakish, volatile run-blocking force who dominated opposing ends with athleticism and aggression.\n\nDespite his clear athleticism and run-blocking ability, Smith was still seen as a developmental prospect by draft analysts and scouts alike due to his uncontrolled aggression and unrefined pass-protection technique. Smith\u2019s belligerence proved a trademark part of his game in Tulsa, yet it also led him to commit a whopping 16 penalties during his redshirt sophomore year, including 12 holding calls.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Smith was still incredibly inexperienced come draft time, having entered the draft as one of the youngest eligible players at 20 years old and with only four seasons of playing offensive line under his belt, two of which were at the high school level. Furthermore, the fact that his skill set projected better as a guard (due to his run-blocking prowess and sloppy pass-pro technique), yet he never played a snap at either guard spot in college, made his fit and profile tricky to decipher for NFL teams.\n\nAltogether, it was clear that Smith had huge upside, but his success hinged on a team with exceptional coaching formulating a detailed plan for his development. It therefore came as a surprise when the Dallas Cowboys selected him No. 24 overall in the 2022 draft, with offensive line not seen as a position of need in Dallas and the flag-happy Smith being an odd fit for a Cowboys team that led the league in penalties in 2021.\n\nYet despite the widespread criticism, Smith rapidly became a crucial asset for the Cowboys. With franchise left tackle Tyron Smith suffering a serious knee late in training camp, Smith was slotted as the team\u2019s left tackle two weeks before Week 1 despite practicing at guard all offseason. For most offensive line rookies with minimal experience at the position, being thrown into the fire as the left tackle of America\u2019s team with barely any rapport with his teammates would be a disaster, yet Smith stood up to the challenge.\n\nHe played solidly in Tyron Smith\u2019s absence and even proceeded to start at right tackle and play some left guard after the former Trojan returned from his absence in December. With Tyron Smith staying healthy this year, Smith has been able to develop at left guard, the position the Cowboys originally envisioned him at when they drafted him. And despite it being his first real go at the position, he\u2019s been phenomenal.\n\nWith the combination of his freakish athleticism and improved technique, he\u2019s ascended into one of the best young linemen in football. Let\u2019s start with his run blocking, where Smith can dominate on any type of run scheme due to his athleticism, power on contact, and physicality at the point of attack.\n\nWith short area blocks used on gap schemes like power, counter, and trap, Smith is able to win with good positioning due to his initial quickness and low pad level, and then execute and dominate the block with freakish functional strength and physicality at the point of contact.\n\nSmith can also dominate on more athletic, movement-based blocks like reaches and cutoffs used on zone runs or blocks in space where he has to climb to the second level or pull. Take this outside zone play during the Cowboys\u2019 Week 8 matchup against the Los Angeles Rams. Smith is on the backside of a zone run, meaning his assignment is to reach the defender nearest to him and cut him off from penetrating into the backfield.\n\nSmith\u2019s nearest defender in this instance, Kobie Turner, is aligned half a gap over, yet he displays the elite short area quickness to teleport to Turner\u2019s midline and position the block, and then execute at the point of contact with good hand placement inside and the upper body and grip strength to rotate Turner\u2019s behind to the sideline and cut him off from the play.\n\nSmith can also thrive on movement blocks in space, as seen in this second-quarter rep during the Cowboys\u2019 Week 4 game against the New England Patriots. The Cowboys are running a \u201cdart\u201d run with right tackle Terence Steel pulling across the formation to kick out the defensive end and create a free lane for running back Tony Pollard.\n\nSmith and the rest of the line are tasked with down-blocking the rest of the defensive line to create a wall for Steele to pull parallel to and for Pollard to weave through. With nobody occupying his gap, Smith helps out his center by nudging the nose tackle and then shows very good change of direction and short area quickness to bolt toward the second level, engaging his nearest linebacker with good positioning and very good power on contact to help generate a 16-yard Pollard rush.\n\nSmith has excelled as a run blocker, yet he\u2019s also held his own against the very best in pass protection, showing the ability to win against power rushes while also neutralizing more advanced pass rush combinations.\n\nWatch this fourth-quarter rep against Defensive Rookie of the Year candidate Jalen Carter during the Cowboy\u2019s Week 13 matchup against the Eagles, for example, where Smith halts the former Georgia Bulldog\u2019s bull rush. Carter gets off the line quickly and tries to generate power with his freakish functional strength, yet Smith matches the physicality.\n\nHe shows good hand placement inside and elite grip strength to assert control under Carter\u2019s pads, and then the flexibility necessary to sink his weight and anchor to prevent pressure.\n\nSmith can win against straight power, yet he\u2019s also shown the ability to neutralize more advanced pass rush moves like conversions or counters. Watch this rep versus future Hall-of-Fame defensive tackle Aaron Donald during the Cowboys\u2019 Week 8 matchup against the Los Angeles Rams, for example, where he smoothly neutralizes Donald\u2019s power to speed move inside.\n\nDonald fakes a bull rush by initially attacking Smith at his midline, yet quickly tries to swat his hands and attack inside. Smith doesn\u2019t budge. He reworks his body with very good lateral agility and quickly latches inside Donald\u2019s pads with rapid hand placement, proceeding to wash Donald out of the play with the functional strength and physicality to finish the rep.\n\nSmith excels against both power and other advanced pass rush combos, yet what cements him as a top-tier guard in pass protection is his ability to recover and win from losing positions. Take this rep against former Pro Bowl defensive tackle Javon Hargrave during the Cowboys\u2019 Week 5 matchup against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nHargrave explodes off the line and wins the hand placement battle inside, asserting control. Yet where most guards would lose the rep here, as hand placement is crucial in trench play to assert dominance over the opponent at the point of contact, Smith shows good hand usage to rework his hands inside Hargrave\u2019s breastplate and then anchor with flexibility, sinking his weight, and exceptional core and lower body strength to stonewall Hargrave and prevent movement.\n\nAltogether, Smith\u2019s ability to dominate in the run game, win consistently in pass protection, and recover from disadvantageous situations make him a formidable force at guard, although he still has some quirks he must iron out to ascend to an elite level, particularly in better controlling his aggression and hand usage when facing highly agile defensive tackles.\n\nWatch this early second-quarter rep against 49ers defensive tackle Javon Kinlaw, for example. Smith shows very good initial quickness off the line, yet he\u2019s so focused on rapidly engaging his opponent and winning with his elite grip strength that Kinlaw is able to easily swerve around him inside on the speed rush and pressure the quarterback.\n\nNow let\u2019s look back at the Rams game on another rep against Aaron Donald on a play-action pass. Smith is supposed to fake a reach block (similar to the cutoff rep we saw earlier in the piece), yet his aggressiveness leads to him lunging forward, missing his hand placement, allowing Donald to beat him outside and get to Dak Prescott for the sack.\n\nReps like these are a result of the uncontrolled aggressiveness scouts and analysts saw in college, which, for the most part, Smith has been able to clean up. But these habits still give him trouble against twitchy defensive tackles who can make him pay for his hot-and-cold positioning and hand placement.\n\nFurthermore, Smith\u2019s hyper-aggressiveness and inconsistent discipline have hurt the Cowboys heavily in the penalty department \u2013 through eighteen weeks, he ranks first among all linemen in penalties (13), a problem we\u2019ve seen continue from his days at Tulsa.\n\nOverall, however, Smith has still played like one of the best guards in football this season, cementing himself as a franchise cornerstone for the Cowboys and potentially as one of the best linemen in the league for the next decade. He can execute any run scheme and hold down the league\u2019s best interior rushers in pass protection due to his athleticism and freakish power.\n\nAlthough his aggression may get the best of him at times, making him vulnerable against agile rushers and prone to penalties, we must remember Smith is only a second-year player and probably has less offensive line experience than most college linemen.\n\nSmith was recently snubbed for the Pro Bowl, but make no mistake \u2013 he\u2019s a rapidly ascending force who looks to be in prime position to become the premier player of the storied Cowboys offensive line for the next decade.\n```"}

(Photo by Robert Westermann)\n\nBy Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as January 07, 2024 at 7:53 pm PST\n\nUSC women\u2019s basketball (12-1, 2-1 Pac-12) completed the weekend sweep of two Oregon universities to begin the New Year with a 68-54 victory over the Oregon Ducks (9-7, 0-3) on Sunday at Galen Center. In the win, USC tied a season high with 25 assists and committed just six turnovers.\n\nUSC freshman guard JuJu Watkins had a team-high 17 points, along with nine rebounds and six assists in 37 minutes. Watkins\u2019 point total was a season low, yet her impact was felt beyond just scoring.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a winner more than anything else,\u201d head coach Lindsey Gottlieb said. \u201cShe can hurt you in a number of ways. And we\u2019re just glad she\u2019s a part of our team, because it\u2019s leading to a lot of winning along with her teammates.\u201d\n\nOregon sophomore forward Grace VanSlooten had a game-high 18 points, plus six rebounds. USC junior center Rayah Marshall and graduate guard McKenzie Forbes added 16 points each.\n\nThe Trojans came into the game undersized compared to the Ducks \u2014 who started 6-foot-8 junior center Phillipina Kyei and 6-foot-7 sophomore forward Kennedy Basham \u2014 forcing USC to find different ways of neutralizing the Ducks\u2019 bigs.\n\nAt the start of the game, the size was an apparent problem for the Trojans. Marshall had no answer for Kyei, who had eight early points and dominated the paint with her height advantage. The Ducks had the lead for most of the first quarter, but a three from USC redshirt sophomore guard Taylor Bigby (a transfer from Oregon prior to last season) allowed USC to take a one-point lead into the second quarter.\n\nGottlieb turned to 6-foot-6 junior center Clarice Akunwafo over Marshall to begin the second quarter, rejuvenating the Trojans\u2019 defense. Akunwafo\u2019s impact was instantly felt, making two blocks in her first three minutes of play.\n\n\u201cI think we just have to figure out the best way for us to be the most effective basketball team we can be,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe have a lot of depth and versatility options.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 defense held the Ducks to only ten points in the second quarter, closing out the first half with a 30-23 lead.\n\nThe third quarter became a back-and-forth between both offenses as Oregon regained a presence in the paint, outscoring the Trojans 10 to four in the area. However, USC still ended the quarter with a six-point lead.\n\nThe Trojans broke away in the fourth quarter with significant scoring contributions from Marshall in the post and Forbes\u2019 shooting, closing the game with a double-digit win at home.\n\nAfter slow starts, Marshall and Forbes found their rhythm, with both of them scoring double digits in the second half, and offering another option on offense beyond Watkins. Marshall came alive in the paint, providing her strong rebounding ability; she grabbed six of her nine rebounds in the second half.\n\n\u201cI am proud of my teammate Clarice. When I came into the locker room for halftime, she told me to play better defense,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cI did that when I came out, made that [defensive] adjustment. I was like, wow.\u201d\n\nUSC is back in action next Sunday in a rematch versus the No. 2 UCLA Bruins (14-0, 3-0) at 2 p.m. at Galen Center. The Trojans suffered their first-season loss against the Bruins just a week ago.\n\n\u201cThe game plan doesn\u2019t change: box the heck out, go be the tougher team, and try to keep them off the boards. That\u2019s what we have to do,\u201d Gottlieb said ahead of the rematch. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to beat UCLA unless you\u2019re willing to do the dirty work on the boards.\u201d\n```"}

{"key": "/2024/01/06/mens-basketballs-3-point-barrage-takes-down-stanford/", "response": "```\nThe Trojans are finally starting to feel it. USC men\u2019s basketball (8-7, 2-2 Pac-12) has now won two straight games, dominating the Stanford Cardinal (7-7, 2-2 Pac-12) 93-79 Saturday at Galen Center. It was obvious from the jump the game was going to be filled with 3-pointers, as both teams knocked one down in the opening minute of the game. The Trojans came out on top of that battle, knocking down 14 threes on 56% shooting from range, both season highs. Fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis led the charge from downtown, hitting on six of his eight attempts beyond the arc and scoring 22 points in the process. Ellis is shooting 45.7% from three this season, which would be a career best by over 7% if the season ended today.\n\n\u201cI felt pretty good in warmups, had a good pregame workout,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really happy with the way I shot the ball the last game, so I definitely fine-tuned some things. ... I feel like I still got a lot of things to improve on, I\u2019m still not happy about it. When this year started, I said I wanted to shoot 50[%], so not quite there yet.\u201d\n\nEllis was not without help, though. Freshman guard Isaiah Collier scored a game-high 26 points \u2014 his first game with more than 20 points since November 19 \u2014 and junior guard Kobe Johnson added 21 points of his own. The trio of Ellis, Collier and Johnson combined for 74.2% of USC\u2019s points on the day. But, as Ellis puts, the three of them need to be more than just scorers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to have a different approach, as I\u2019m not just a scorer \u2014 I\u2019m a basketball player \u2014 so just trying to make winning plays,\u201d Ellis said. Johnson epitomized that against Stanford, adding five assists, five steals and two blocks to add to his season-high point total.\n\nEven though it was Johnson, Collier and Ellis who led the charge, it was truly a team win with 11 players seeing time on the court. It was a win for a team that had lost five of its last six games before heading home to beat Cal on Wednesday and Stanford on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing a lot more unselfish,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOffensively, I say we\u2019re moving the ball around a whole lot. Everyone\u2019s touching the ball, we\u2019re moving it side-to-side multiple times before putting up a shot. It\u2019s no more one pass and then shoot it.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans have seemingly put those rough six games behind them; despite averaging 20.5 fouls per game in that stretch, USC has only committed 10 fouls in each of the last two games, matching a season low.\n\n\u201cWe just fouled at an alarming rate before and put teams on the foul line,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cPart of that is position defense. Part of that is just keeping your hands off people and playing with your chest and keeping your hands up or out.\u201d\n\nStill, USC scored 93 points and only beat Stanford by 14 points, albeit a Stanford team coming off of a road win against UCLA and an 18-point drubbing of then-No. 4 Arizona. Despite forcing 18 Cardinal turnovers, the Trojans still allowed Stanford to shoot 52.7% from the field, already the third time this season a USC opponent has shot 50% or better. However, this was the first of those three games that the Trojans ended up winning.\n\n\u201cStanford\u2019s a very good basketball team,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThey\u2019re good shooters and they made some tough shots. ... We\u2019re a work in progress. As you know and as I\u2019ve stated, we\u2019re not as good defensively this year as we have been the last four. We\u2019re going to keep trying and improve.\u201d\n\nDespite the defensive struggles, USC still put out one of its best offensive performances of the season against a conference opponent, and the Trojans have their first winning streak since November. If they can tighten up their defense, they might be able to leave their 2023 struggles behind in 2024.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had much better practices, we\u2019ve played much better since those long road trips,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt was really hard for us, especially when you\u2019re not playing well, we had all those injuries in November. ... I\u2019m very hopeful this team can keep improving. I think they\u2019re bought into what we\u2019re trying to accomplish.\u201d\n\nUSC will look to continue that streak against Washington State this Wednesday at Galen Center, with tip-off scheduled for 7:30 p.m.\n```"}

After trailing at halftime for just the second time this season, the Trojans fought back to gut out their first Pac-12 conference win of the season following a loss to No. 2 UCLA in a top-10 matchup last weekend.\n\nFreshman phenom guard JuJu Watkins led the Trojans with 28 points, while graduate guard Kayla Padilla contributed 14 points and matched her season-high of four 3-pointers. Junior center Rayah Marshall tacked on seven points along with 14 boards, six of which came on the offensive end.\n\n\u201cThis conference is really tough, [so] any win is something to be proud of,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cIt felt more like their kind of game than ours, which is not what we intended, but to be able to pull out a win when it felt like that and when we were kind of stuck in the mud a little bit, I think it showed a lot of grit.\u201d\n\nOregon State got off to a quick start, as junior guard AJ Marotte hit a three in its first possession. After the Beavers took a 5-0 lead nearly three minutes into the contest, Watkins responded with a step-back jumper to get the Trojans on the board and would go on to score the team\u2019s first nine points. At the end of the first quarter, USC found itself trailing 15-11 and would remain behind for the majority of the game.\n\nOregon State sophomore forward Raegan Beers, who was averaging nearly 20 points and 12 rebounds per game coming into Friday night, was a main concern for USC. When Beers received the ball underneath the basket, USC would immediately double-team her, forcing her to either throw up a bad shot or pass the ball back out. But by leaving a player open at those moments, USC\u2019s aggressive defense often allowed wide-open 3-pointers, which led to five Oregon State triples in the first half.\n\nBeers\u2019 influence on the game was somewhat limited, however, as she got into foul trouble early on and had to sit out most of the first half. Marshall\u2019s physicality against Beers limited her to just nine points and eight rebounds, well below her normal numbers.\n\n\u201cWe knew we wanted to double [Beers] when she caught the ball,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cShe\u2019s a terrific player, and I think Rayah\u2019s defense on her, the combination of the team defense and the pressure we tried to put elsewhere and the doubles, I think were fairly effective.\u201d\n\nLate in the third quarter, USC found itself down 42-36 and was desperate to get back into the game. After the Beavers converted on a three-point play, a steal by graduate guard Roxane Makolo led to a three-point play from Watkins, which marked the start of a solo 7-0 run. Following a series of steals and forced turnovers by USC, the Trojans found themselves up 43-42 at the end of the third quarter.\n\nWatkins followed this up by continuing her run early in the fourth quarter, putting the Trojans up by three, their largest lead of the game at the time.\n\n\u201cWe were down pretty much the whole game, so it was important that we had some momentum going into the fourth [quarter] and making sure that it was zero to zero,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cJust trying to even out the field and making sure that when we came in for the fourth [quarter] we had some confidence going into it.\u201d\n\nAs the game came down to the wire, USC found itself up 56-51 with just over two minutes remaining thanks to a pair of threes from Padilla and a put-back from Marshall. Then, with a minute and a half to go, OSU\u2019s Beers managed to complete a three-point play and cut the lead to two. In the final possession, the Beavers had several chances to tie or even take the lead, but Beers\u2019 last-second attempt was met with a block from Marshall, who grabbed the rebound to seal the game for the Trojans.\n\nLooking ahead, the Trojans\u2019 schedule does not get any easier. As it stands, the Pac-12 has five teams ranked in the top 15 of the most recent AP poll. USC has six matchups against those opponents, three of which are in the month of January, including a rematch against UCLA at home.\n\n\u201cI think overall for this conference ...

These are our strengths, this is how we can adjust people, and simultaneously put in a game plan for the other team.\u201d\n\nUSC will finish the weekend off with a game against the Oregon Ducks on Sunday, with tip-off set for 12 p.m. at Galen Center.\n```"}

Before a ball was dribbled or a basket was made, many Pac-12 members considered USC one of the best teams in the conference, only behind the defending Pac-12 champion Arizona Wildcats in the conference preseason media poll. Highly-touted recruits, including the No. 1 player in the country, had fans buzzing to get to Galen Center this season.\n\nEntering the 2023 season, a pair of young, explosive freshmen \u2014 guards Isaiah Collier and Bronny James \u2014 and experienced upperclassmen \u2014 fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis, junior guard Kobe Johnson and redshirt senior forward Joshua Morgan \u2014 had USC head coach Andy Enfield excited and ready for a final year in the Conference of Champions.\n\nThe \u2018dynamic duo\u2019 of Collier and Ellis led the Trojans to a hot 5-1 start, but the sunshine and rainbows didn\u2019t last forever. Collier showcased his athletic and play-making ability early on, punishing smaller guards when attacking the rim. His counterpart, Ellis, didn\u2019t miss a beat from his senior campaign, where he lit it up from 3-point range and made the difficult shots look easy.\n\nHowever, after the Trojans\u2019 fifth win on November 23 versus Seton Hall in San Diego, they dropped four of their next six games to end non-conference play. Fast forward to January, and unexpected non-conference losses to begin the season and a 1-2 start in Pac-12 play have the Trojans unranked at 7-7.\n\nThe early struggles for the Trojans have shown holes in the team that Enfield must fix if he wants to have any real success in the Pac-12 and March Madness.\n\nTurnover Bug\n\nThe Trojans have caught the turnover bug, which has them falling behind by double digits in some games and preventing them from closing out opponents. In its seven losses this season, USC has produced an average of 14.8 turnovers, a mix of poor judgment from the guards, a lack of chemistry and sloppiness.\n\nChemistry takes time to develop, but the connection between USC guards and bigs will prove pivotal against solid defensive teams \u2014 UCLA, Arizona, Colorado and Washington State \u2014 in the Pac-12. While Collier has undoubtedly proved to be an engine for the USC offense, the bug has hit him the hardest. He leads the team in turnovers and has an assist-to-turnover ratio of 4.4 to 3.7.\n\n\u201cWe have allowed him to play through some mistakes,\u201d associate head coach Chris Capko said December 17. \u201cHopefully, the experience allows him to continue to get better.\u201d\n\nThe blame doesn\u2019t fall solely on Collier. His explosiveness lets him beat defenders with his first step and instantly get into the lane. Collier\u2019s court vision, which Enfield raves about, and strong passes almost hurt him more than help him because of the lack of trust. Once in the paint, the lack of chemistry between Collier and his big men \u2014 Morgan or sophomore forwards Vince Iwuchukwu and Kijani Wright \u2014 shows its face. Collier has made brilliant passes to the low block multiple times in a game this season, and in return, one of the big men proceeds to fumble the ball out of bounds. Collier gets registered for that turnover.\n\n\u201c[Collier] is just a young player, still trying to figure it out,\u201d Capko said. The coaching staff still trusts Collier and the front court to turn things around in the turnover department. USC ranks second-worst in the Pac-12 in turnovers, making this a necessary fix if the team hopes to make any real push heading into March.\n\n\u201cIf we can continue to take care of the ball, we can be a really good team,\u201d Capko said.\n\nDefensive Woes\n\nEnfield and USC have prided themselves on their ability on the defensive side of the ball, with elite shot blockers and great perimeter defenders in the past. \u201cEverybody knows if they don\u2019t play hard on the [defensive] side of the ball, they come out of the game,\u201d Enfield said at Pac-12 Media Day.\n\nTo start the season, the group was optimistic as their two Pac-12 All-Defensive Team guys, Johnson and Morgan, returned. Enfield preached man-to-man defense at Pac-12 Media Day as the team\u2019s main philosophy for the defensive side because of the length and speed Johnson, James and Collier have at the perimeter, in addition to the size in the front court between Iwuchukwu and Morgan.\n\nHowever, in 14 games, USC ranks in the bottom half in Division 1 with 74.8 points allowed per game (269th). \u201cI feel like we are lackadaisical on defense, including myself,\u201d Ellis said after a loss to Long Beach State on December 10. \u201cWe just got to be better talking on defense, finishing with box outs and rebounds.\u201d\n\nIn Ellis\u2019s defense, rebounding has been the main culprit for opposing teams generating offense. Too often this season, opposing teams have outmuscled USC\u2019s bigs in the post, creating those second-chance points that no level of basketball coach likes. USC allows an average of 35.4 rebounds a game this season, including 11.5 offensive rebounds. The rebounding problem cost the Trojans a win against the now-No. 11 Oklahoma Sooners in San Diego.\n\nGetting outrebounded by the opposing team means poor effort on USC\u2019s end. As a coach, you are responsible for igniting that fire in the team to be more aggressive in rebounding. Players feed off that energy, and you can see how top teams in the country \u2014 like Arizona, Gonzaga, Duke and Purdue \u2014 have this \u2018always go\u2019 mentality every game. And for all those teams, their defensive aggression generates better offense and easier buckets on the other end.\n\nIf the inconsistent energy trend continues into the Pac-12 for USC, the Trojans can only hope for a spot in March Madness. \u201cWhen we have gotten punched in the mouth, we haven\u2019t always responded,\u201d Capko said.\n\nOn the flip side, in moments of games when the tenacity is high, USC has been able to force opposing offenses into bad shots and sloppy turnovers. The active hands of the guards have generated 6.8 turnovers a game. In addition, Morgan has provided elite shot blocking that Trojans fans are used to, ranking top-20 in the country in blocks with 2.3 per game.\n\n\u201cWe take care of the ball, we defend at the level we need to, and there is definitely a higher ceiling to this team,\u201d Capko said.\n\nConsistency\n\nTalent wins you regular season games, but staying consistent from game to game builds a championship team. Due to injuries and erratic performances, USC hasn\u2019t had a steady starting lineup, as Enfield hasn\u2019t found a dependable pair of forwards to open alongside its talented backcourt trio of Collier, Ellis and Johnson.\n\nAt the fourth spot, graduate transfer forward DJ Rodman \u2014 son of NBA Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman \u2014 has shown enough to continue starting from here on out. Rodman progressed every year from beyond the arc at Washington State and has carried the efficiency over to USC, where he is shooting 39.5% (second-highest on the team) and has become a reliable catch-and-shoot guy.\n\nBut at times, Rodman can become a stranger in the offense, disappearing from the play as a whole. \u201c[Rebounding] is where Rodman can really impact this season ... without making shots,\u201d Capko said.\n\nThe debate truly lies at the center position between Iwuchukwu and Morgan. Iwuchukwu came back from a cardiac arrest situation two summers ago, similar to the one Bronny James suffered this July. This allowed Iwuchukwu to mentor James as he worked his way back onto the court this season.\n\nOn the court, Iwuchukwu\u2019s year has been filled with bumps in the road. A 15-point and six-rebound performance against Long Beach State finally saw Iwuchukwu flash the offensive versatility that ranked him as a five-star center out of high school in 2022.\n\n\u201cA lot to improve on. ... Just going to keep building,\u201d Iwuchukwu said.\n\nHowever, he has often struggled to find a rhythm on both sides of the ball, allowing opposing bigs to push him around even at his 7-foot-1 size. Morgan\u2019s early season campaign has been highlighted by his elite shot-blocking ability, rebounding and touch around the rim. His play has carried over from a solid junior year.\n\nMorgan recorded a career-high 10 blocks versus Seton Hall, letting nothing come close to the rim. On the offensive side, Morgan has shown the most development as a scorer compared to everyone else on the frontcourt. Like Iwuchukwu\u2019s flaws, he plays smaller than his size at 6-foot-11, which is a needed area of improvement.\n\nCollier, Ellis, Johnson, Rodman and Morgan should be the starting lineup entering conference play. There is undoubtedly a lot that the Trojans have to fix and figure out, yet this season has some positives to look forward to.\n\nThe team ceiling rises when Collier and Ellis hit shots and orchestrate a fluid offense. Johnson and Morgan have continued to provide their defensive prowess, leading the charge and effort on the defensive side.\n\nUSC began conference play last Thursday with an eight-point loss against the Oregon Ducks in Eugene. The Trojans headed 50 miles north to Oregon State on Saturday, and similarly, turnovers and rebounding problems resulted in a 16-point loss.\n\nUSC has not won the Pac-12 tournament since the DeMar DeRozan days in \u201809, and this is the program\u2019s last chance to finish on a high note in the Conference of Champions. Winning the tournament might also be the only way the Trojans make it to March Madness with seven losses already.\n\nHowever, college basketball is a long season and should be treated more as a marathon than a race. \u201cI\u2019ve been through the fire. So, a couple of losses doesn\u2019t really affect me,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cThere are going to be ups and downs in this, but at the end of the day, just got to keep getting better. Every time you take a loss, just use it as a lesson.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2024/01/04/the-x-factor-for-usc-mens-basketball/", "response": "```\nThe arrival of freshman guard Bronny James to USC in the summer brought more eyeballs to the USC basketball program than ever before, raising the expectations of the team\u2019s success for the 2023 campaign. USC basketball is not a stranger to highly touted freshmen and has seen its fair share of NBA talent \u2014 Evan Mobley, DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic \u2014 rep the Cardinal and Gold. Yet, there has not been quite a player to step foot on campus like Bronny James. His reputation preceded him the minute he was born as LeBron James Jr. From his travel ball middle school days with  Strive for Greatness  (founded by his father) to his final season with Sierra Canyon High School, the cameras and spotlight have always followed Bronny. A standing ovation erupted across the sold-out Galen Center at 12:58 in the first half of an early December non-conference game versus Long Beach State. James was checking in for the first time as a Trojan  since suffering cardiac arrest in the summer.  The crowd turned to a sea of lights, with every fan pulling out their cameras to memorialize the moment in USC basketball history. James came to USC as part of the  No. 3-ranked recruiting  class in the country, according to 247Sports, featuring fellow five-star McDonald\u2019s All-American guard Isiash Collier. Head coach Andy Enfield once again demonstrated his strong recruiting ability, landing another top-10 recruiting class for the second consecutive year. To start the season, the Trojans have struggled to find any sort of success beyond the arc outside of fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis. Defensively, USC has given up 80 points or more in three \u2014 Auburn (91), Oregon (82), and Oregon State (86) \u2014 of its last five matchups. A slow start at 7-7 is not what many Trojans fans hoped to see in a year headlined by highly-touted recruits and experienced upperclassmen. Every great team has one X-Factor that can improve various aspects of the team when they steps on the court, creating efficiency where there is inefficiency. In order for USC to turn this season around, the Trojans need to involve their X-Factor more, allowing him the space to grow with more minutes and opportunities. For USC, James is the X-Factor and his progression in his freshman season could pay dividends for the team\u2019s success. Through five games, the two things that have stood out about James\u2019 game are his defensive IQ and 3-point shooting. \u201cEverybody wants a guy like that on his team, \" Ellis said. \u201cHe defends at a high level.\u201d His defensive ability and IQ add another player for Enfield to put on the opposing team\u2019s best players. \u201cHe guarded the quick ball handlers for the other team pretty well,\u201d Enfiled said after the game versus Long Beach State on December 10. James\u2019 3-point shot has continued to progress each game, as he looks more comfortable getting to his spots. In five games this season, James has registered the team\u2019s fifth-highest three-point percentage (31.6%). His shooting motion is very fluid, which puts excellent rotation on the ball. James becoming a consistent 3-point shooter for the Trojans will be valuable for the primary ball handlers, Ellis and Collier. Back-to-back threes from Bronny James and he's got a career-high 15 points on the night. \ud83d\udcfa:  @Pac12Network \ud83d\udcf1:  https://t.co/sun5jxIL31   pic.twitter.com/Hpf1P9jJB5 \u2014 USC Men's Basketball (@USC_Hoops)  December 31, 2023 \n\nRecently, James had a career-high 15 points in 20 minutes off the beach in a loss versus Oregon State. He showcased his ability beyond the arc and his finishing skills around the rim. Multiple times, his defensive tenacity led to a Trojan basket on the other end. The next step for James to improve is his finishing around the rim. Understandably, after suffering cardiac arrest just five months ago, the comfort on the court will take time. As his confidence grows, his minutes should also increase, because he is too intelligent of a basketball player not to be on the court for 20 to 25 minutes a game. Already under a huge spotlight, James not only has pressure from himself, but also from the millions who look to glimpse the next James family member heading to the league. \u201cBronny handles the spotlight extremely well,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cHe is a passionate young man about playing basketball.\u201d \n```"}

The Trojans actually shot the ball well, shooting nearly 51% from the field and 75% from the free throw line. Fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis led USC with 20 points, while freshman guard Bronny James added a career-high 15 off of the bench. However, rebounds and turnovers doomed the Trojans. USC turned the ball over 20 times, and was outrebounded by the Beavers 28-18.\n\n\u201cObviously the turnovers on the offensive end have hurt us numerous times this year,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said following the loss. \u201cTo have 20 [turnovers], 14 in the first half, is really frustrating. A lot of those turnovers we get sped up, or we just make poor decisions.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 defense was also poor, allowing Oregon State to shoot nearly 60% from the field and 47% from behind the 3-point line. Sophomore forward Tyler Bioldeau led the Beavers with 26 points, while sophomore guard Jordan Pope added 20 and senior guard Dexter Akanno racked up 18.\n\n\u201cWe have to get better defensively,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so good defensively the past four or five years, top 10 in the country, actually.

The matchup was historic; it\u2019s the first time the two schools have played each other as top-10 teams since 1981 and as unbeatens since 1985.\n\nThe hype built up all throughout the week, with Pauley Pavilion being sold out for the first time in program history to see these two teams compete, and both delivered. USC got off to a slow start in the first quarter, trailing 14-2 with about two minutes left in the quarter. Freshman guard JuJu Watkins was plagued by shooting issues, going 1-for-5 from the field, but she was able to drive her way inside and get to the line to get the Trojans to within striking distance in the second quarter.\n\nWatkins opened up the second on a mission, converting a three-point play, then draining a 3-pointer to give USC its first lead of the game. The Trojans\u2019 lead was ousted quickly with USC and UCLA exchanging jabs at each other throughout the quarter, leading to 10 different lead changes.\n\nWith a combination of Watkins getting to the foul line and graduate guard McKenzie Forbes\u2019 midrange game, the Trojans were hanging in tough with the well-rounded Bruins. UCLA also had a poor offensive first quarter, shooting 27% from the field, but its offense stepped up in the second quarter.\n\nUCLA had a big physical mismatch inside with 6-foot-7 sophomore center Lauren Betts, who exploited USC on both offense and defense. Betts was able to bully her way inside and, when USC put more pressure on her, she would kick it out to one of her teammates for a 3-pointer. Sophomore guard Londynn Jones became the main beneficiary from this, drilling three 3-pointers in a row after UCLA kept scoring inside during the second quarter to give the Bruins a slight one-point edge at halftime.\n\nBetts\u2019 defense really came into play in the third quarter, when she had two of her six blocks. She was able to stuff a shot inside, then get to the foul line to energize the Pauley Pavilion crowd. Just a few plays later, she was able to get a piece of a jump shot from Watkins to start another fast break.\n\nFacing UCLA turned out to be a challenge for the freshman phenom Watkins, as she shot 7-for-24 from the field and 2-for-6 from deep. Still, she put up an impressive double-double of 27 points and 11 rebounds. Even if the shots weren\u2019t falling, the nation\u2019s second-leading scorer contributed by drawing the attention of the defense and pushing the tempo of the Trojan\u2019s offense.\n\nThe shots were falling for Forbes, however, as she went 8-for-18 and finished with 23 points. Those two were the main sources of offense for USC, while UCLA had four players with double-digit points. Jones led the way with 21 points and hit two clutch 3-pointers late in the fourth quarter to distance UCLA\u2019s lead and force USC to take bad shots.\n\nThe matchup of the Bruins was a physically demanding one, as UCLA outrebounded USC 48-37; the Trojans were worn down by the end of the game. Watkins had to exit the game due to an apparent injury with 1:10 left and received an applause from the UCLA crowd.\n\nEven though USC couldn\u2019t end its now nine-game losing streak against its L.A. rivals, it put up a fight and will be able to challenge the Bruins at home on January 14. For now, USC will look to bounce back at the Galen Center against Oregon State on Friday, January 5.\n```"}

Forbes\u2019 parents and Padilla\u2019s parents were also present, as was the rest of the USC women\u2019s basketball team.

But much less is known about the process of transferring as a student-athlete. What are the eligibility requirements? How do student-athletes get recruited? What does the actual transfer portal even look like?\n\nEven as a student-athlete herself, Padilla had little idea what she was getting into as she entered the portal. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many student-athletes saw their seasons cut short, or even completely canceled. In response, the NCAA approved a rule change in 2021 that gave college athletes an extra year of eligibility, effectively ruling that seasons during the 2020-21 school year did not count against a student-athlete\u2019s four years of eligibility.\n\nThis \u201cCOVID year,\u201d as it\u2019s come to be known, was a helpful addition for the majority of student-athletes. They could play an extra season while also earning a graduate degree, still on their athletic scholarship. It was especially valuable to Forbes and Padilla, two Ivy League women\u2019s basketball players who weren\u2019t able to play at all during 2020-21 because of the conference\u2019s decision not to play any sports during that school year.\n\nThere was just one issue. Graduate students are not allowed to play sports in the Ivy League. So if Forbes and Padilla wanted that additional college season, they would have to find a new home to do so. That\u2019s where the transfer portal comes in.\n\nGranted, it\u2019s easier to transfer as a graduate student. Players don\u2019t have to worry about transferring credits to a new school in addition to their athletic abilities to a new team. However, there\u2019s still a stigma attached to the transfer portal, despite the fact that many players, such as Forbes and Padilla, have no other choice in order to continue their athletic careers.\n\nTaylor Bigby, a redshirt sophomore guard for USC, transferred from Oregon prior to the 2022-23 season and found the process to be stressful due to outside noise. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about, \u2018Well, what are people going to think of me?\u2019\u201d Bigby said. She described how many people \u2014 fans, media, even some coaches \u2014 look down on student-athletes who didn\u2019t \u201cpick the perfect situation\u201d entering college and end up transferring.\n\nCommon criticisms of the transfer portal are that athletes don\u2019t learn to wait their turn or confront their problems. But that\u2019s not how Gottlieb operates her program. In fact, she\u2019s brought in 11 transfers over the last two offseasons by making players like Bigby feel confident in their decision to switch schools.\n\nDespite their different backgrounds and paths to USC, many of these transfers have spoken to the importance of arriving alongside other transfers and sharing that experience together.\n\nA native of Torrance, California, Kayla Padilla frequently made the 20-minute trip with her family to Galen Center to watch USC basketball growing up. Not highly recruited out of high school, the sharpshooting Padilla chose to attend Penn after failing to receive any Power Five offers. But after three record-setting seasons with the Quakers, in which she set multiple program records for 3-point shooting, Padilla said she was much more coveted as a grad transfer.\n\nPadilla knew she would enter the transfer portal after her senior season but was still focused on completing the task at hand \u2014 making sure her career at Penn finished as smoothly as possible. However, when Penn made the trip to Galen Center last November for a non-conference matchup, Padilla couldn\u2019t help but feel that the game was an audition for where she would play her final season.\n\nThough Padilla struggled in that matchup with USC \u2014 she missed all seven of her 3-point attempts \u2014 her overall body of work still spoke for itself as she was recruited by coaches, Gottlieb included.\n\nNavigating the transfer portal itself wasn\u2019t easy for Padilla. Information about the process is limited and can be hard to find, so many players have to pick the brains of others who have already gone through it to gain a better understanding.\n\n\u201cI asked my coach, \u2018What goes on in the transfer portal?\u2019 She was telling me how she checked it after we had practice, and 30 minutes later, there were like 1,000 more people in the transfer portal,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a lot of ways people can sort of get lost in this gigantic list.\u201d\n\nPadilla has friends from other schools who she said were overwhelmed by the portal, and it didn\u2019t do them any good because of how crowded it was. Luckily for Padilla, she was able to stick out to the coach of the school where she had wanted to end up since her childhood.\n\nGottlieb, who was a player and student assistant at Brown in the late \u201890s, shares the same Ivy League roots as Padilla. She understood how Padilla\u2019s Ivy League success could translate to the Power Five.\n\nPadilla describes herself as a big family person as well, so USC\u2019s proximity to home also made it an obvious choice. But there was still some uncertainty late in her transfer process. Padilla was anxious about whether she was simply making her decision to be close to her family, so she was conscious of ensuring that she wasn\u2019t just taking the easiest solution \u2014 she wanted to maximize every possible aspect of her decision-making process, from academics to athletics to family.\n\n\u201cUSC proved itself to be a plus in every single thing I was looking for,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just being home. It\u2019s also going to one of the best business schools and being a part of a program that\u2019s going to be highly ranked.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to Padilla\u2019s steadier rise, McKenzie Forbes\u2019 journey to USC was a bumpier ride. Forbes was a five-star recruit in 2018 out of Folsom High School, located near Sacramento. A versatile wing rated as the No. 35 player in the nation by ESPN, Forbes committed to Cal, where Lindsay Gottlieb had built a solid program and was just a few years removed from a Final Four appearance in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nBut Gottlieb was hired away by the Cleveland Cavaliers after Forbes\u2019 freshman season. Like Padilla, Forbes found a new home in the Ivy League at Harvard, but the process wasn\u2019t smooth. Her decision to transfer came after the university\u2019s transfer deadline, forcing Forbes to take a gap year and attempt to enroll the next spring. As an undergraduate transfer, she would have had to sit out the 2019-20 season anyway.\n\nForbes took classes at a local junior college to maintain her NCAA eligibility. Then the Ivy League canceled its 2020-21 season due to COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time in my life where I was like, \u2018Oh my God, I don\u2019t have teammates,\u2019\u201d Forbes said of her two seasons away from basketball.\n\nWhen Forbes finally returned to the court in 2021 at Harvard, she averaged just under 14 points per game. The next year, she converted at a 40% clip from three, the only Ivy League player to hit that mark (Padilla ranked second in the conference at 38.6%). Encouraged by her coach, she made the decision to enter the transfer portal midway through the season, way back in December.\n\nDespite being in the portal, she was still eligible to finish the year with her team, helping the Crimson reach the quarterfinals of the Women\u2019s NIT tournament. Forbes is thankful to have had the extra time to go through the recruiting process, though things were a bit awkward.\n\nFor example, just a month after playing Florida State early in the season, the Seminoles\u2019 staff started to recruit her, wishing her luck before conference games in January.\n\n\u201cIt was weird,\u201d Forbes said of those interactions.\n\nThe transfer portal process ahead of her graduate year was much more direct than the first time around.\n\n\u201cGoing through the process was a lot more clear-cut. When you\u2019re coming out of high school, it\u2019s a lot of fluff,\u201d Forbes said. (Padilla calls it glitz and glam.) \u201cWhen I was a grad transfer, it was like, \u2018OK, what are you looking for?,\u2019 which I appreciated.\u201d\n\nGottlieb also acknowledged the importance of authenticity in attracting graduate transfers like Forbes.\n\n\u201cIf I understand where a player is coming from, I hope to be able to then provide those things they said that they wanted, and I don\u2019t promise things that I can\u2019t deliver,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nForbes says Gottlieb told her that she didn\u2019t want to coach her former player again at USC simply because Gottlieb knew Forbes\u2019 family. It was deeper than that. Gottlieb knew Forbes could contribute to the program with her versatility on the court and her personality off it, while she could earn the business degree she wanted, too.\n\nThey had different paths to USC, but McKenzie Forbes (center) and Kayla Padilla (right) have become close friends since coming to Los Angeles. (Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nJust as they supported each other in their commitment to Gottlieb, Forbes and Padilla have continued to be almost inseparable since arriving at USC. The pair are roommates and lean on each other as they acclimate to their new school and environment. Whether it\u2019s providing feedback about mutual struggles or simply sharing good news about their lives, Forbes and Padilla have found a connection in each other, a sisterhood of sorts.\n\nAnd, in fact, the support goes even further. Gottlieb brought in two more graduate transfers for the upcoming season: Kaitlyn Davis, another former Ivy Leaguer arriving via Columbia, and Roxane Makolo, who played at Purdue and TCU. Forbes, Davis, Padilla and Makolo are all currently working toward their master\u2019s degrees in entrepreneurship and innovation at USC. So not only do they get to work together on the court in the upcoming year as veteran additions, but also in the classroom at the Marshall School of Business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been nice because they literally almost lived an exact identical experience, but just at another school,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful to have people who understand what we went through and can apply that to what we\u2019re going through now.\u201d\n\nAnd with USC undefeated through ten games and ranked No. 6 in the nation, that shared experience is escalating onto the national stage. Freshman phenom guard JuJu Watkins is garnering much of the public attention, but both Forbes and Padilla have been paramount to the Trojans\u2019 perfect start as the only players to start in all of the team\u2019s contests.\n\nIn the absence of Watkins and two other starters for USC\u2019s December 21 matchup at Long Beach State, Forbes dropped a career-high 36 points to lift her team to a gritty win. Meanwhile, after a rather slow start, Padilla has gotten hot as of late, putting up her two best performances of the season in the Trojans\u2019 last two games.\n\nAs a highly-anticipated showdown with No. 2 UCLA awaits USC on Saturday, Gottlieb and the Trojans will need these two veterans to step up again. And after everything they\u2019ve been through to get here, you better believe Kayla Padilla and McKenzie Forbes will be ready for this moment.\n```"}

(Photo by Wesley Chen)\n\nBy nikki thomas\nDecember 28, 2023 at 10:07 pm PST\n\nComing off of a December 19 win at Alabama State, USC men\u2019s basketball started off Pac-12 play with a matchup at Oregon on Thursday night. It was the third game in the Trojans\u2019 four-game road trip; USC has hosted only one home game in the month of December.\n\nThe Trojans (6-6) struggled generating offense and ultimately fell 82-74 to the Ducks (9-3), who remain undefeated in seven games at home this season. Oregon got out to an early 12-2 lead behind back-to-back 3-pointers from freshman guard Jackson Shelstad. Threes from USC freshman guard Bronny James and graduate forward DJ Rodman brought life to the offense, but scoring droughts kept the Trojans from keeping up with Oregon. USC shot only 32% from the field in the opening 20 minutes.\n\nUSC struggled with turnovers in the first half as well, and the Ducks\u2019 lead ballooned to 28-15 with 4:46 left before halftime. Back-to-back turnovers by junior guard Kobe Johnson (USC\u2019s ninth and tenth turnovers of the period) allowed Oregon to stretch its lead to 18 with three minutes to go. With 1:30 to go, Oregon freshman forward Kwame Evans Jr. hit two free throws to give the Ducks a 20-point lead, their largest of the night. They ended the half up 42-25 on the Trojans, having scored 14 points on 10 USC turnovers while committing only three.\n\nFreshman guard Isaiah Collier, usually a strong offensive presence for USC, took only two shots in the first half. \u201cOur starting guards have to play better,\u201d USC head coach Andy Enfield said after the game. \u201cThey were 2-for-14 in the first half with a bunch of turnovers and made some defensive mistakes. They\u2019re in the starting lineup for a reason, and they have to play like Pac-12 veterans.\u201d\n\nA 3-pointer from fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis and a layup by sophomore forward Vincent Iwuchukwu revived the Trojan offense to start the second half. The two defenses battled, but a 7-0 USC run made it an eight-point game and forced a Ducks timeout with just over 16 minutes left. Redshirt senior forward Joshua Morgan came alive in the latter half, tipping the ball in on back-to-back possessions. Later, a couple of dunks and a hook shot from Morgan kept the Trojans in the game. A Morgan assist to Rodman made it a seven-point game; Oregon hit back on the next possession, but a Rodman three cut the Ducks\u2019 lead to just six points with 10:36 to play.\n\nBack-to-back buckets by Oregon, aided by a Trojan turnover, brought the lead back to 11 points. USC tried to battle back against the Ducks but struggled to close in through the middle of the period. The issues in the Trojan backcourt continued, as Collier\u2019s second made field goal came with just over seven minutes left in the game. Ellis, who averages just under 20 points per game, shot only 4-for-15 from the field for 11 points. And although Johnson contributed a team-high nine assists, he shot only 3-for-11 from the floor and 0-for-5 from beyond the arc.\n\n\u201cWe supposedly have some all-league first-team, second-team guys in the preseason,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotta play like it. We love them, we believe in them, and now it\u2019s time to step up because we\u2019re in the Pac-12.\u201d\n\nUSC fought hard at the end of the second half; a Johnson jumper and a Collier layup cut Oregon\u2019s lead to six points with just over a minute left in the game. Morgan and Shelstad exchanged free throws, and a deep three from Ellis made it a four-point game with 0:39 left to play. USC fouled in the hopes of getting the ball back but wasn\u2019t able to generate any offense, and Oregon senior guard Kario Oquendo sank all four free throws to ensure a Ducks victory.\n\nAside from turnovers, USC\u2019s defensive woes kept victory out of reach. The team gave up 43 points to Oregon freshmen (Shelstad and Evans Jr.). Through the first 11 games this season, USC has held its opponents to 41.3% shooting, but it allowed Oregon to shoot 46.2% from the field on Thursday. The Ducks won the battle at the free throw line as well, shooting 26-for-32 (81%) from the line. USC went only 10-for-15 (67%) from the stripe.\n\nThe showing wasn\u2019t completely negative for the Trojans. Rodman and Morgan led the team with 14 points apiece; it was a season high for Morgan, who also contributed a team-high seven rebounds. \u201c[Morgan] dominated the paint with his offensive rebounding,\u201d Enfield commented. \u201cOur guards got him the ball in good positions and he finished, and we need that from him. He\u2019s a big part of our team, he\u2019s a really good defender and he leads our league in blocked shots.\u201d\n\nOverall, it was a tough loss for USC men\u2019s basketball to start out Pac-12 play. There were a few bright spots offensively, but the team is going to need to dig deeper in order to win some of the more competitive matchups this season. The Trojans close out their road stretch at Oregon State on Saturday at 7 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo Courtesy of Orlando Ramirez, USA Today Sports)\n\nBy Madison Hogue\nDecember 28, 2023 at 11:26 am PST\n\nSAN DIEGO, Calif. \u2013 Miller Moss had a record-breaking night as the Trojan\u2019s took home the Holiday Bowl trophy in a 42-28 victory over Louisville at Petco Park on Wednesday night. With USC sitting out over 20 players for NFL draft preparation, the transfer portal or other reasons, the Trojans were playing with a different roster than the rest of the season.\n\nA main concern coming into this game was USC playing their third string quarterback, Miller Moss, after Caleb Williams opted out and Malaki Nelson announced his entering into the transfer portal. This was Moss\u2019 first start for the Trojans that put him in contention for starting quarterback next season.\n\nMoss got himself comfortable in the first quarter and settled into a rhythm. In the first half, he tied the Holiday Bowl record with four touchdown passes. He broke the record a little over 10 minutes into the 3rd quarter. Moss ended the game with six touchdown passes on the night, throwing for 372 yards. He broke the USC record for the most touchdown passes in their first start as a Trojan. He set the record for most touchdown passes by a Trojan in a bowl game, as well as tying that same record for Pac-12 quarterbacks. All of this was against a top-20 defense in Louisville.\n\n\u201cFrom a leadership standpoint, we have a very strong senior group that came back for this game,\u201d said Moss. \u201cThey set the example and it was easy for me to fall in behind them.\u201d\n\nWill Miller Moss have a shot to take over the starting quarterback spot next year? After tonight, the answer better be \u201cyes\u201d. The transfer portal remains open and there are talks of USC picking up Will Howard from Kansas State. To his teammates, they believe Miller\u2019s won the job. Kyron Hudson, sophomore wide receiver, said that Moss\u2019 performance tonight secured him the QB1 spot for next season.\n\n\u201cWhat he did out there is something special,\u201d said Hudson. \u201cFor me personally, yes [he won the starting spot]. I\u2019m super excited for Miller.\u201d\n\nAnother offensive standout, as always, was Tahj Washington. A 29-yard touchdown pass to Washington secured his first 1000+ yard season. Washington had seven receptions for 99 yards and two touchdowns for his last game with the Trojans before he enters the NFL draft. Opting out of this game was not an option for Washington.\n\n\u201cAnyone who knows Tahj knows there was a zero-percent chance he was going to sit out of this game,\u201d said USC head coach Lincoln Riley.\n\nThe third and final offensive standout for the night was Ja\u2019Kobi Lane. Lane had only three receptions, with two being touchdowns. After only having four receptions on the season, Lane was put to the test and executed in tonight\u2019s game.\n\nA pleasant surprise for the Trojans was their defensive performance. Before tonight\u2019s game, USC\u2019s total defense was ranked 120th out of the 130 teams in the FBS. Louisville hit the ground hard with 239 rushing yards, but USC\u2019s defense halted their momentum at key points. USC kept Louisville to 6 of 12 on third-down conversions. With that being said, the Trojans held the run game more efficiently than they had the rest of the season and their pass defense had improved. The defenders were swarming the ball and sticking the tackles, a trend that hasn\u2019t been seen by USC\u2019s defense this season.\n\nJaylin Smith, USC junior safety, recorded 12 solo tackles which earned him the defensive MVP for the game. This defensive performance sparks hope for USC football looking ahead, especially with the hiring of a new defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn.\n\nOne common theme among the players and coaches: this win was fun. This was USC\u2019s first bowl game victory since 2016 and the guys loved every second.\n\n\u201cHonestly, in all the years and all the wins, this was as fun a win as I can remember in my time as a head coach,\u201d said Coach Riley.\n\nEnding the night with a firework show and an eggnog bath for Coach Riley, 2024 is looking up for USC football.\n```"}

He threw for 372 yards and six touchdowns to lift USC to a 42-28 victory, Wednesday over Louisville at Petco Park. USC moved to 8-5 in their final game as members of the Pac-12. This victory improves USC\u2019s all-time post season record of 35-20. This was also the first time these two teams ever met on the gridiron.\n\nMoss tied the Holiday Bowl record with four touchdowns before halftime, senior wide receiver Tahj Washington caught two of them. Washington\u2019s final performance as a Trojan will help his draft stock as he declared for the NFL Draft. \u201cThese last six weeks have been very memorable being on this team and we have been through so much adversity lately,\u201d  Washington said . \u201cHow we just came together it made a huge difference, you could see it tonight how everyone showcased that brotherhood we talk about.\u201d\n\nAt halftime, USC led 28-14. Louisville running back Isaac Guerendo scored a one yard touchdown early in the third quarter to pull within seven. The touchdown was keyed by an interception by Quincy Riley who ran it back 61-yards, setting the record for the longest interception return in Holiday Bowl history. USC answered with an 11-play drive down field, ending in a 12-yard Moss pass to Ja\u2019Kobi Lane for the touchdown. Louisville scored early in the fourth quarter, Isaac Guerendo ran for a two-yard touchdown. Moss fired back with a 17-yard touchdown pass to Duce Robinson to put USC ahead two scores, 42-28.\n\nFor USC, Moss was 23 of 33 for 372- with six touchdowns and an interception. For Louisville, Jack Plummer was 21 of 25 for 141 yards with no touchdowns and no interceptions. Louisville entered the game as 7-point favorites with an over/under of 59 points via SportsLine consensus. The Trojans came into this game without 20 players including Heisman quarterback Caleb Williams. Running back MarShawn Lloyd and wide receiver Brendan Rice declared for the NFL draft. For the defense, two notable losses to the transfer portal were linebacker Tackett Curtis and cornerback Domani Jackson.\n\nWith USC\u2019s season coming to a close, they have a lot to look forward to going into next year in the Big 10. Miller faced adversity in his first years of college, as opportunities to play were few and far between, but he persevered and believed in the Head Coach Lincoln Riley\u2019s quarter back development system. I asked Moss in the post game press conference if he was aware of his nickname \u201c It\u2019s Miller Time,\u201d he responded, \u201cI\u2019ve heard it before, it\u2019s cool, we can get a little more creative.\u201d \n```"}

(Photo by Wesley Chen)\n\nBy Dylan Luden December 28, 2023 at 8:19 am PST\n\nIs it Miller time at USC? With all the buzz surrounding who will quarterback USC\u2019s offense next season, redshirt sophomore Miller Moss may have silenced the noise surrounding that conversation. His historic six-touchdown performance led the Trojans as they claimed a 42-28 Holiday Bowl victory over Louisville Wednesday night at Petco Park in San Diego. It was Moss\u2019 first career start in college football in his third year at USC. It may go down as one of the best debuts in college football history.\n\n\u201cThese six weeks weren\u2019t about any individual, they were about us and the people that wanted to be here and wanted to play this game and wanted to come together,\u201d Moss said of the team\u2019s break between its final regular season game to the bowl matchup. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll watch the film and there will be a ton of stuff I need to clean up. Personally, it\u2019s a good step in the right direction, but definitely a lot to improve on, a lot to accomplish.\u201d\n\nAlong with his six touchdowns, Moss completed 23 of 33 passes for 372 yards. It was a record-breaking performance from the alumnus of Bishop Alemany in Mission Hills. He broke the record for passing touchdowns in the Holiday Bowl and the record for most touchdowns in a USC debut.\n\nThe start of the game couldn\u2019t have been worse for USC. The Trojans went three-and-out on their first drive; Louisville scored on its first possession. Moss started to settle on on the Trojans\u2019 second drive, but a missed field goal kept USC off the scoreboard.\n\nUSC played with a different ferocity on defense compared to how it has played this season by attacking players in open space and limited the Cardinals\u2019 passing success. The momentum completely shifted towards USC after redshirt senior safety Max Williams punched the ball out of quarterback Jack Plummer\u2019s hands, forcing a turnover on Louisville\u2019s 19-yard line in the first quarter.\n\nThe Trojans capitalized on great field position, as Moss threw short to redshirt senior wideout Tahj Washington, who put two defenders on skates on his way to the endzone to even the score at 7-7. As the game progressed, so did Moss\u2019 ability to hit his wide receivers in stride deep down the field and spread the ball around. He hit freshman receiver Makai Lemon for 35 yards, then Washington for a 29-yard touchdown with 8:07 left in the second quarter.\n\nWashington\u2019s seven receptions and 99 yards secured his first ever 1,000-yard season, joining recent Trojans Drake London, Amon-Ra St. Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster in doing so.\n\nUSC\u2019s offense received great field position again on its next drive after redshirt sophomore wide receiver Kyron Hudson blocked a punt. Just three plays later, Moss found Hudson on a quick slant for a nine-yard touchdown to make it 21-7.\n\n\u201cThat whole week, I was getting blocked on that play. Like (redshirt senior center) Justin (Dedich) said, you have to be ready on every play. On that play I was open and I was able to get my hand up and block it.\u201d\n\nLouisville kept fighting back thanks to their ground game. Led by senior running back Isaac Guerendo, the Cardinals rushed for 220 yards. Guerendo accounted for 161 of them and totaled three touchdowns.\n\nMoss completed a 31-yard touchdown to freshman receiver Ja\u2019Kobi Lane to make it four touchdowns in the first half, tying the Holiday Bowl record and giving USC a 28-14 lead.\n\nLouisville came out of the second half looking to turn the tide. USC marched down the field, but cornerback Quincy Riley intercepted Moss at the goal line and returned it for 61 yards. Guerendo was able to punch it in to bring the game back within a score.\n\nAfter the interception, Moss remained ambitious on the following drive with his passes, continuing to push the envelope. He lofted a ball over the top to Lane for a 12-yard touchdown for Moss\u2019 fifth and Lane\u2019s second touchdown of the day. Lane\u2019s two scores were his first trips to the endzone of the season and his career.\n\nTo put the icing on the cake of a historical performance, Moss showcased his arm strength one more time by finding freshman Duce Robinson in stride for a 44-yard touchdown on his last pass of the day, cementing the Holiday Bowl trophy and the new tradition of an eggnog shower for the winning coach, Lincoln Riley.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really proud of this group, proud of the leadership,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThis is significant for the guys that have been here in the beginning of this journey, and there\u2019ve been a lot of great moments in the first two years.

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Lily Coleman\nDecember 27, 2023 at 10:09 am PST\n\nThe USC Trojans (7-5) will take on the Louisville Cardinals (10-3) Wednesday in the DIRECTV Holiday Bowl at 5 p.m. PST at Petco Park in San Diego. This will be USC and Louisville\u2019s first time meeting, with both teams coming off losses. The Trojans lost to UCLA 38-20 on November 18 and the Cardinals lost to Florida State 16-6 on December 2 in the ACC Championship Game.\n\nLouisville is entering this matchup after a much more successful season than USC. The Cardinals\u2019 7-1 ACC record this season matched their all-time best, and they are currently ranked No. 16 in the AP Poll and No. 15 in the College Football Playoff rankings. The Trojans are unranked and went 5-4 in the Pac-12.\n\nIn total defense, according to the NCAA, Louisville is ranked No. 16 in the country, while USC is No. 120. Offensively, however, USC is ranked No. 11 and Louisville sits at No. 42.\n\nBoth teams come into the game with top players missing from their lineups. The Trojans are missing 20 players, including reigning Heisman Trophy winner junior quarterback Caleb Williams. Redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd and senior wide receiver Brenden Rice both recently declared for the NFL Draft, and junior wide receiver Mario Williams recently entered the transfer portal. Defensively, USC had eight players opt out of the game, including two starting defensive players who entered the transfer portal \u2013 freshman linebacker Tackett Curtis and sophomore cornerback Domani Jackson.\n\nRedshirt sophomore quarterback Miller Moss will be USC\u2019s starting quarterback. In the three games he played this season for the Trojans, he completed 23 of 32 passes for 309 yards, threw for a touchdown and added two rushing touchdowns. Over the 11 games he has played across his three seasons at USC, Moss has gone 43 of 59 for 542 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had a unique journey in his time ... he\u2019s a guy that has really hung in there [and] he has continued to put in work, even though he wasn\u2019t the starter,\u201d USC head coach Lincoln Riley said about Moss. \u201cHe\u2019s learned our offense as good as any player on a roster and I think really earned the respect of the team. ... You could argue he\u2019s been waiting three years for an opportunity like this.\u201d\n\nOn the other side, the Cardinals will be without 11 players, with only three of them on the offensive side. However, two of the opt-outs are the Cardinals\u2019 strongest assets \u2013 redshirt junior running back Jawhar Jordan and redshirt junior wide receiver Jamari Thrash, who both declared for the NFL Draft. Jordan and Thrash were Louisville\u2019s top rusher and receiver, respectively, in both yards and touchdowns.\n\nLouisville will be led by graduate quarterback Jack Plummer who, in his first season with the Cardinals, completed 235 of 370 passes for 3,063 yards and 21 touchdowns, in addition to 12 interceptions. Plummer began his college career at Purdue, where he played three seasons, before transferring to Cal Berkeley for his senior year. Plummer is familiar with USC given his Pac-12 experience, as he threw for over 400 yards and three touchdowns at the Coliseum as a Golden Bear in 2022, though the Trojans won that game 41-35.\n\n\u201cIt is a unique game in terms of the new players, the different players that are going to be available, how you piece it together [and] how you handle these last several weeks,\u201d Riley said.\n\nAdditionally, these teams share a common opponent from the 2023 regular season. Louisville beat Notre Dame 33-20 in October, while USC fell to the Fighting Irish 48-20 just a week later.\n\nThis will be USC\u2019s fourth time competing in the Holiday Bowl and Louisville\u2019s first. The Trojans\u2019 last Holiday Bowl appearance was in 2014, when they beat Nebraska 45-42. However, USC is coming off of a loss in their most recent bowl game; they lost last year\u2019s Cotton Bowl to Tulane 46-45. Louisville competed in the Fenway Bowl last year, defeating Cincinnati 24-7.\n\nOverall, Louisville\u2019s postseason record is 12-13, while USC\u2019s is 34-20. Louisville is favored to win the game by a touchdown, but it is expected to be an intriguing matchup given the absence of key players on both teams. Kickoff is at 5 p.m. PST, with an eggnog bath at stake for either Louisville\u2019s Jeff Brohm or USC\u2019s Lincoln Riley.\n```"}

(Photo by Jude Oca\u00f1as)\n\nBy Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as\nDecember 21, 2023 at 7:57 pm PST\n\nOn National World Basketball Day, No. 6 USC women\u2019s basketball (10-0) wrapped up non-conference play with an 85-77 victory over Long Beach State (5-5) Thursday afternoon at Walter Pyramid. USC was without its two leading scorers, freshman guard JuJu Watkins and junior center Rayah Marshall, both due to illness for the matchup.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for us that we had to go through some adversity and figure some things out,\u201d head coach Lindsey Gottlieb said. \u201cI think that\u2019ll help us with what\u2019s coming in the Pac-12. But I never wavered in our confidence.\u201d\n\nUSC graduate forward McKenzie Forbes had a career-high 36 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Gottlieb labeled the performance a \u201cflu game,\u201d as Forbes had missed the week of practice and shootarounds due to an illness.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to get back this morning, and we were kind of playing [my status] by ear,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cBut just a huge credit to this group. We came out and got it done, missing a lot of big pieces.\u201d\n\nUSC graduate guard Kayla Padilla had a season-high 16 points, leading the team with four made 3-pointers.\n\n\u201c[Padilla] is a big-time player who we knew was going to come out and make plays,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nWith Watkins \u2014 and her 26.8 points a game \u2014 out on Thursday, USC was forced to find offense elsewhere beyond its talented freshman. USC succeeded early from beyond the arc, converting on six threes in the first half. Padilla was the spark plug that USC needed from deep, finishing the first half with three triples.\n\n\u201cThe coaching staff and my teammates have really been wanting me to shoot the ball,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cIt helps when you have the encouragement of others.\u201d\n\nEven with USC\u2019s success from three earlier, Long Beach established an immediate presence in the paint, out-rebounding the Trojans 28 to 18 in the first half. The inside game for the Beach allowed them to stay neck and neck with USC through the first half. Yet, 15 turnovers in the half from the Beach helped USC maintain a nine-point lead heading to halftime at 40-31.\n\n\u201cTonight was a really good example of how we have a lot of length and try to use that to be disruptive on other teams,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nThe third quarter was a different story for USC. Its early success from three had gone cold, shooting 3-for-11 from range in the third quarter. Outside of Forbes\u2019s nine points in the third, the offensive production of USC dwindled. Long Beach junior guard Lovely Sonnier had eight points on 4-for-4 shooting in the third quarter, creating a rocking atmosphere in Walter Pyramid. Sonnier\u2019s buzzer-beating layup to end the third quarter helped the Beach outscore the Trojans 21 to 19 in the frame.\n\nBut despite the boost in momentum for Long Beach, the Trojans didn\u2019t waver, still holding a seven-point lead heading into the final period.\n\n\u201cThe message came from Kenzie ... \u2018Let\u2019s get our s\u2014 together,\u2019\u201d Gottlieb said after a poor third-quarter performance. \u201cWe got to stop the run, but also get back to ourselves and what we need to do.\u201d\n\nLong Beach didn\u2019t go down without a fight. Junior guard Savannah Tucker had herself a quarter, with ten points to keep her squad within single digits for the latter part of the fourth. Forbes\u2019s 14 points in the fourth quarter kept USC atop Long Beach. A couple of trips for Forbes to the free throw line in the final minutes sealed the win for the Trojans.\n\nNo. 6 USC now enters Pac-12 conference play, and its first test will be the No. 2 UCLA Bruins next Saturday. It will be the first time in USC-UCLA matchup history that both teams are undefeated in the top 10 of the AP poll.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t shy away from the excitement around it,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cTo have the rivalry game be so close and have both teams be so good and exciting is just really good for women\u2019s basketball.\u201d```"}

The transfer portal giveth and the transfer portal taketh away. And it has been much more of the latter for the USC football team. So far, the Trojans have lost 17 players to the portal, three of which are former five-star recruits according to On3. However, two of those players \u2014 sophomore cornerback Domani Jackson and junior defensive lineman Korey Foreman \u2014 only received a three-star designation as a transfer, while freshman Malachi Nelson comes into the portal as a four-star.\n\nWhile departures on the defensive side \u2014 there have been eight of those so far \u2014 can be partly attributed to a new defensive coaching staff coming into the fold, the nine offensive departures have started to raise alarms. The Trojans have lost three wide receivers, leaving only seven at the position who caught a pass this year heading into next season. An additional two receivers declared for the NFL Draft.\n\nWith the loss of Nelson, it leaves redshirt sophomore quarterback Miller Moss as one of only two scholarship players at the position for next season \u2014 and the only one who has taken a college snap \u2014 assuming junior quarterback Caleb Williams officially declares for the NFL Draft. It leaves certain position groups either dangerously thin, or with too much inexperience to play at a high level heading into Big Ten play next year \u2014 four of the seven previously mentioned pass catchers are true freshmen.\n\nThe Trojans will look to their newly-signed freshman recruiting class to help fill those holes. But for more experienced players, USC will look to the transfer portal. Luckily for the Trojans, it has head coach Lincoln Riley, who previously has been described by former USC head coach and current Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin as the \u2018Portal King.\u2019 Riley helped bring in the No. 2-ranked transfer class in 2022 and the No. 3-ranked class in the last cycle.\n\nThe Trojans have earned commitments from six players \u2014 including two just yesterday from Mississippi State \u2014 and are off to a similar start as last year. At this point in the 2023 cycle, USC also had six transfers committed to the school, closing its class with 14 transfers.\n\nWhile senior cornerback DeCarlos Nicholson is only rated as a three-star, the transfer from Mississippi State could be one of the most important players currently committed. Nicholson played in 25 games across the last two seasons for Bulldogs and could end up similar to both redshirt senior cornerback Christian Roland-Wallace and former-Trojan cornerback Mekhi Blackmon. Both of the players led USC cornerbacks in interceptions the year they transferred to the school.\n\nThe other Mississippi State Bulldog is senior running back Jo\u2019Quavious Marks. The Trojans have had success bringing in transfer portal running backs, most recently redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd. Marks only played in nine games, but still led the Bulldogs in rushing with 573 yards. He should get more touches next season though, with Lloyd declaring for the NFL Draft and redshirt senior running back Austin Jones likely doing the same.\n\nThe Trojans also brought in junior inside linebacker Easton Mascarenas-Arnold and redshirt junior defensive back Akili Arnold, both from Oregon State. Mascarenas-Arnold is only rated as a three-star, but he earned a spot on the All-Pac-12 First Team earlier this month and should improve USC\u2019s tackling in 2024.\n\nIf past trends carry over into this year, the Trojans are likely not even halfway done with their transfer class. So, multiple players currently in the portal are candidates to end up at USC in the coming weeks.\n\nAccording to Riley, the Trojans are looking to take two quarterbacks, one older and one younger, before next season. While there are many high-level quarterbacks in the portal, the most buzz has been around Kansas State senior quarterback Will Howard. Four different On3 experts have predicted that Howard will end up a Trojan.\n\nHoward would be a good get for USC, throwing for 2643 yards and 24 touchdowns this past season. The veteran also showed an ability to run with the ball, rushing for 351 yards and nine touchdowns. He had an interception problem this season with 10 picks, but Riley will hope to fix that problem to prevent Howard from becoming the first Trojan quarterback to throw double-digit interceptions since JT Daniels did so in 2018.\n\nThere could also be some crosstown movement, with defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn likely trying to poach some players from his previous post at UCLA. Redshirt freshman defensive back Kamari Ramsey and senior defensive back John Humphrey were Bruins last season, but both entered the portal. Ramsey has already received a prediction to transfer to USC and Humphrey has received an offer, but neither have announced their commitments yet.\n\nThe transfer portal is an ever-moving object in this day and age of college football. Annenberg Media will continue to make updates about USC adding and subtracting players.\n```"}

(Photo by Will Simonds)\n\nBy nikki thomas\nDecember 20, 2023 at 9:43 pm PST\n\nWednesday marked the first National Signing Day for the incoming 2024 college football class. During the Early Signing Period, which ends on Friday, incoming high school recruits have the opportunity to sign their letters of intent for college play. So far, USC has reported that 19 players have signed with the Trojans for the upcoming season.\n\nOverall, the Trojans brought in 10 four-star recruits and eight three-stars in this class, according to 247Sports\u2019 Composite rankings. The team looked to address a struggling defense from the 2023 season, adding a score of new defensive players. Carlon Jones, Jide Abasiri, Lorenzo Cowan and highly-recruited Kameryn Fountain join the Trojans\u2019 defensive line, backed up by linebackers Elijah Newby and Desman Stephens II.\n\nUSC also got a boost in the secondary with the addition of cornerbacks Marcelles Williams and Braylon Conley, as well as safeties Marquis Gallegos and Jarvis Boatwright Jr. Head coach Lincoln Riley had plenty of praise for his incoming defensive recruits on National Signing Day, particularly Fountain and Newby.\n\n\u201c[Newby and Fountain] were two kids and two families that are about the right thing, all the way,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThey never looked back, they never wavered, not for one second. ... We feel like those are two future difference-makers, and [assistant coach] Roy [Manning] certainly deserves a ton of credit for that.\u201d\n\nIt was an impressive incoming defensive class for the Trojans, who lost their defensive backs coach, Donte Williams, to Georgia this weekend. USC\u2019s coaching staff has undergone a full revamp lately: most notably, former UCLA defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn stepped into the role for USC, who fired defensive coordinator Alex Grinch during the 2023 season.\n\nThe Trojans are also bringing in North Dakota State head coach Matt Entz as an assistant head coach for the defense as well as the linebackers coach, and Riley recently named Doug Belk as USC\u2019s new secondary coach. Belk formerly served as the associate head coach/defensive coordinator at Houston.\n\n\u201cOne of the non-negotiables for me in the defensive coordinator hire was somebody that wanted to play bigger on the defensive front and shared that vision,\u201d Riley said. \u201cAnd we certainly have.\u201d\n\nOn the offensive end, USC added five new linemen: Makai Saina, Kalolo Ta\u2019aga, Justin Tauanuu, Hayden Treter and Jason Zandamela. Zandamela is the top get for USC in the offensive line class, ranked as the No. 100 overall recruit and second-highest rated interior offensive lineman in the nation according to 247Sports.\n\nJoey Olson, Walter Matthews and Walker Lyons joined the tight end room. Lyons signed with the Trojans last winter before embarking on his Mormon mission in Norway this year, but will join the team for the 2024 season. Wide receiver Xavier Jordan and running back Bryan Jackson round out the current offensive recruiting class.\n\nGiven the timing of the day, players have the option to finish high school early and enroll at USC in the spring, giving them an entire semester of practices before next season starts. Abasiri, Boatwright Jr., Cowan, Fountain, Gallegos, Jackson, Jordan, Newby, Olsen, Stephens II, Ta\u2019aga, Tauanuu, Williams and Zandamela all decided to do so, and will start at USC in January.\n\nNotably, USC hoped to sign receiver Ryan Pellum, who switched his commitment to Oregon early Wednesday. Riley commented on recruiting and changing commitments during his media availability later in the day.\n\n\u201cThe guy that wavers on signing day is gonna waver when something doesn\u2019t go his way here,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna waver when he\u2019s not the starter as a true freshman coming right out, he\u2019s gonna waver when somebody on the outside tells him that he should look somewhere else.\u201d\n\nDo instances like these stand independent of the influence of NIL and the ever-expanding transfer portal? Looking at the past few days of recruiting for the Trojans, it\u2019s hard to tell. USC freshman quarterback Malachi Nelson, sophomore running back Raleek Brown, sophomore cornerback Domani Jackson and junior defensive lineman Korey Foreman \u2014 all former four or five-star recruits \u2014 entered the transfer portal after the end of the regular season.\n\nBut Riley is optimistic about the Trojans\u2019 potential going into next year. The Trojans finished 7-5 (5-4 in conference play) in their last season in the Pac-12 and have the No. 18-ranked freshman recruiting class, according to 247Sports, going into their first season in the Big Ten.\n\n\u201cThe commitment level of these guys to understand the opportunity we all have here at a place like USC, the opportunity to help bring this program back to where we all want it to be, it\u2019s shared across this class,\u201d Riley said.\n\nUSC is still awaiting an official letter of intent from four-star cornerback Isaiah Rubin, who verbally committed to the Trojans in October. Rubin, however, did repost a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, which stated \u201cIsaiah Rubin has signed with USC.\u201d```"}

They read \u2013 \u201cPoland abortion: Top court bans almost all terminations,\u201d \u201cIstanbul hospitals refuse abortions as government\u2019s attitude hardens,\u201d \u201cHungary tightens abortion access with listen to \u2018foetal heartbeat\u2019 rule,\u201d and \u201cPutin\u2019s Next Target Is Russia\u2019s Abortion Culture.\u201d These headlines capture the increasingly dreadful reality threatening abortion access, spanning the years from 2015 to the present.\n\nDr. Rebecca Gomperts, Dutch physician and unwavering activist-artist for human rights took to the podium. An atmosphere charged with anticipation enveloped the audience. The Visions and Voices team organized this event, which included a Q&A session facilitated by Roski School of Art and Design professor Amelia Jones. It was also co-sponsored by the InterArts Council.\n\n\u201cI think fear is the most killing thing. Fear is causing self-censorship and it\u2019s killing every advancement,\u201d said Dr. Rebecca Gomperts reflecting upon how she was able to always carry a degree of playfulness throughout her activism.\n\nDr. Gomperts studied medicine and the visual arts in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Her steadfast credentials as a doctor, combined with the daringness of a creative, propelled her abortion access campaigns forward.\n\nIn an insightful moment during the Q&A session, when Professor Jones questioned whether the fight for abortion access consists of many \u201cmicro strategies of a specific place and time,\u201d Gomperts replied promptly, \u201cI don\u2019t think so, to be honest, I think you need systematic change.\u201d\n\nThe pathway to systemic change unfolds as multidimensional activism persists forward, presenting alternative, better-functioning societies to the public.\n\nThroughout the years, Gomperts founded numerous platforms to provide women with abortion access, these include Women on Waves in 1999, followed by Women on Web in 2005, and Aid Access in 2018. The ingenuity and tactfulness of campaigns undertaken by these platforms serve as inspiration for activists of every stripe, demanding careful study.\n\nThese were highly visual campaigns that reached those seeking abortions worldwide. Markedly, the series of abortion ship campaigns as they became known took place between 2001 and 2017.\n\nIn the first of the Abortion Ship Campaigns by Women on Waves, Gomperts, along with an almost entirely female crew sailed a Dutch ship for two days into the international waters of Ireland, which as a country had the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe then. Gomperts had converted the ship into a complete reproductive health clinic, providing medical abortions as well as the abortion pill.\n\nWhile in the Netherlands abortion became fully legalized on November 1, 1984 \u2014 allowing selective abortion care up to 24 weeks of gestation \u2014 the legal landscape looked more dire in many other countries. Ireland, at the time, had just added an Eighth Amendment to the Republic\u2019s constitution recognizing the life of the pregnant individual and the unborn as seen as equal, which meant a near complete ban on abortion.\n\nThough there had been challenges to the amendment throughout the years, they saw minimal progress. To the surprise of all, during this first attempt, the number of patients requesting services far exceeded the supply of mifepristone pills onboard. The team ended up not providing any abortion pills, but they kept their hotline open, providing counseling services and accurate information about clinics abroad.\n\nWhile Gomperts dismissed her Ireland campaign as a semi-failure in her talk, the lessons learned from the trial aided subsequent campaigns in Poland (2003), Portugal (2004), Spain (2008), Morocco (2012), Guatemala (2017) and Mexico (2017), providing so many patients with safe, medical abortions on board.\n\nIt was in the 1980s when French researchers first developed mifepristone (also known as RU-486) to be taken days apart with misoprostol, an existing drug used to treat stomach ulcers, for medical abortion care. Mifepristone, taken first by mouth, dilates the cervix and blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed to sustain a pregnancy. Then Misoprostol is taken 24 to 48 hours later. The pill would dissolve when placed between the gums and teeth or in the vagina. This makes the uterus cramp and contract, causing bleeding and expelling pregnancy tissue.\n\nDespite the safeness and effectiveness of the two-pill regimen, as confirmed by more than 100 scientific studies, spanning continents and decades, both were immediately banned in many countries. In the U.S., for example, the FDA only approved mifepristone for medication abortion as of September 28, 2000. Even then, many people face obstacles in accessing the pills.\n\nTo tackle doubts and stigma associated with abortion pills, Gomperts organized other campaigns in tandem. There was the Abortion Pill Train (2014), the Abortion Drone (2016) and the Abortion Robot (2018). Internationally, these moments of fierce defiance and transgression fixed the visuals of women swallowing the pill into the public memory.\n\nGomperts used any platform possible. \u201cIt was only through doing [these campaigns] that we really started questioning the enormous revolutionary power of the abortion pills. With the pills, it\u2019s so safe. You don\u2019t need any providers, you\u2019re not dependent on anybody,\u201d said Gomperts.\n\nImagine a world where abortion privacy and abortion pill access are fundamental human rights. Dr. Gomperts engages the notion that individuals are entitled to more than a single abortion. In the future, as people with a uterus gain control over their reproductive choices, they will have the freedom to choose abortion pills over contraception and reclaim the right to safe DIY abortions.\n\nWhen the conversation opened up to the audience, Halo Starling, a first-year PhD student in the Media Arts and Practice program in the School of Cinematic Arts shared their experience of having gone through an abortion in 2015 and then coming out as a trans person in 2016.\n\nIn 2015, Starling had been living in New York City. Two weeks into their pregnancy, a missing period alerted them to get a pregnancy test. They shared with me over a later conversation how emotionally challenging the whole process was. Taking the NYC subway to Planned Parenthood, he was informed of all the abortion options. Between the options of Misoprostol or anesthetized surgical suction, he chose the former.\n\n\u201cAt the time, I was very interested in rituals and sacred spaces, and I wanted to do something more sacred,\u201d said Starling. They express gratitude for having the company of their friend who promptly took on the role of an abortion doula, as they took the first pill. \u201cShe had dressed in white and got me a pink hot water bottle. Then the next day, I took the [next pill] at my place and pretty immediately it started working. She timed all my medications \u2018cause it was a very painful process. We prayed over the medicine,\u201d said Starling.\n\nWhile much of the discussion on abortion has been brought up in the context of \u2018women\u2019 reclaiming control over their bodies, abortion is not an issue bound to a gender definition. \u201cThe reason why I talk about being trans is because that\u2019s another abortion taboo,\u201d said Starling, \u201cNobody wants to think about trans people getting pregnant. It really freaks people out.\u201d\n\nStarling resonated deeply with Gomperts when she spoke about the importance of mail-in pills and the privacy they give individuals in controlling the environment of such a personal moment. \u201cI had to walk past people with protest signs. They\u2019re on their knees and praying with rosaries and stuff. And I had to have a security guard walking in. And that\u2019s just a very, very challenging thing to deal with,\u201d shared Starling.\n\nRepeatedly, the deeply personal matter of abortion is politicized. Kim Gibson, a Mississippi native and cofounder of We Engage, reflects upon her work at We Engage, a pro-choice clinic escort since 2017. \u201cThroughout the work I have done supporting Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization and its patients, I have tried to be as public as possible in showing people what people have to go through to access abortion care,\u201d wrote Gibson in a statement.\n\nOn June 24, 2022, a seismic shift in American reproductive rights occurred as the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The repercussions of this decision have been profound, leading to a sharp decline in abortion access across the country.\n\nNow it has been more than one year since that day. As of the latest update on December 8, 2023, The New York Times reports that 21 states have either banned abortion or imposed severe restrictions on the procedure earlier in pregnancy than the standard set by Roe v. Wade.\n\nHowever, binding abortions with legislative measures neglects the emotional and autonomous rights of pregnant individuals. Starling, reflecting on the situation, recalled the looming threat during the Trump administration in 2019, anticipating the possible overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nAmid this uncertainty, Starling engaged in a significant media project, aiming to destigmatize abortions, with a particular focus on the often overlooked aspect of trans abortions. In one of their video media projects, with a friend, Starling made a Julia Child cooking show teaching people how to make different abortifacient herbal remedies.\n\n\u201cMy friend Anita Revolution Now, who was a trans drag queen, performed in drag as Julia Child,\u201d said Starling. The film was shown at Vox Populi\u2019s Black Box 4th Wall film and video program in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cI think some people do their healing in public so that other people can do it in private, and I think that\u2019s very important,\u201d reflected Starling.\n\nGomperts encourages the audience to work towards alternative better realities\u2013one in which we bring public abortion issues but give individuals the rightful privacy during the actual procedure.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Will Simonds\nDecember 18, 2023 at 11:21 pm PST\n\nOn a night when USC women\u2019s basketball was without two starters and a key bench contributor, the Trojans still put together an impressive win that showcased the team\u2019s depth and versatility. No. 6 USC shot the Galen Center lights out Monday, making 53% of its 3-point attempts during a 93-44 demolition of Cal State Fullerton.\n\nFreshman guard JuJu Watkins has been the story of the undefeated Trojans\u2019 season thus far \u2014 and for good reason, as she entered the game second in the nation in scoring at 27.3 points per game. Yet USC hardly needed her production to stomp the Titans, as several teammates put up their best performances of the season.\n\n\u201cThis team is worth watching, and I think people are figuring that out,\u201d USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cI loved how that ball moved and people stepped up.\u201d\n\nJunior center Rayah Marshall and redshirt sophomore guard Dominique Darius both missed the game due to illness, while graduate forward Kaitlyn Davis did not play due to injury. Redshirt sophomore guard Taylor Bigby started the game in Davis\u2019 place, and junior center Clarice Akunwafo entered the opening lineup for the first time this season.\n\nAkunwafo made a mark in the absence of Marshall, the Trojans\u2019 top rebounder and second-leading scorer this season. Not only was she perfect from the field with 10 points, but she also filled the massive shoes left behind defensively. Akunwafo contributed six rebounds, two steals and two blocks in 26 minutes, making life in the paint difficult for the Titans all game long.\n\nFullerton shot just 2-for-15 from the field in the opening quarter, as the Trojans used a 20-0 run to open up an early edge with Kevin Hart sitting courtside. Making her fifth consecutive start, Bigby has clearly settled into her expanding role on the perimeter. She set a new career high by sinking four 3-pointers ... before halftime. Bigby added another triple in the second half to finish with 15 points \u2014 her second-most as a Trojan \u2014 on just eight shots.\n\n\u201cWe always practice as if someone was out, like what would be your position, your role on the team,\u201d Bigby said. \u201cWe knew we were down, so knew everyone was going to have to give more effort than what they normally give.\u201d\n\nBigby wasn\u2019t alone in her success from range; graduate forward McKenzie Forbes added a pair of threes during her 13-point first half to lead the team. USC made nine of 13 3-point attempts in the opening 20 minutes, including 5-for-5 in a 30-point second quarter. The Trojans\u2019 50 points as a team was their most in a half this season.\n\nTurnovers also helped spur USC to a 30-point lead at the break. The Trojans capitalized with 14 points on nine Titan giveaways in the first half and finished the game with a 29-5 advantage in points off turnovers.\n\nWith USC missing two forwards, its offense demonstrated its ability to succeed with its jump shooting \u2014 an area where the Trojans struggled last season. With more shots to go around without Marshall and Davis, graduate guard Kayla Padilla put together her best offensive game in her nine appearances with USC. Padilla scored a season-high 13 points on 5-for-7 shooting, dropping back-to-back threes in the second half as the Trojans continued to pull away. She also led the team with a plus/minus of 40 in 27 minutes.\n\n\u201cObviously, we were smaller tonight ... so we were playing multiple shooters, which allowed us to stretch the defense,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cBut credit to our players who knocked down shots. Taylor was on fire starting us off, and we got really good scoring contributions from virtually everybody.\u201d\n\nFreshman guard Malia Samuels and graduate guard Roxane Makolo provided notable contributions as well; the pair had six rebounds each to supplement a collective effort on the boards for USC sans Marshall.\n\nSeven points in the final frame for senior guard Kayla Williams sealed a 49-point win and secured her a significant personal milestone of 1,000 career points.\n\nOh, and this article wouldn\u2019t be complete without an obligatory recap of Watkins\u2019 performance. The freshman star has (perhaps unfairly) raised her expectations so high that a statline of 23 points, six rebounds and six assists \u2014 each of which led her team \u2014 was somehow a bit underwhelming. However, Gottlieb noted that Watkins was also bothered by a stomach bug that forced her to leave the court multiple times in the first half, possibly the same illness that kept Marshall and Darius out of the contest.\n\nWatkins started only 5-for-16 from the field with five turnovers, but a pair of fourth-quarter threes helped her close out the night on a high note. Still, even when she isn\u2019t shooting or feeling her best, Watkins\u2019 ability to consistently impact every other facet of a game, evidenced by her three blocks and two steals, is incredible for someone who hasn\u2019t yet played 10 college basketball games.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff getting thrown at her in every which way,\u201d Gottlieb said of Watkins. \u201cShe\u2019s human, she\u2019s not going to be perfect, but I think what we all know is she\u2019s going to adjust in real time and then also watch the film and adjust as well after that.\u201d\n\nAfter playing its last home game of 2023, USC (9-0) heads south to play at Long Beach State on Thursday at 2 p.m. That matchup will close out the Trojans\u2019 non-conference schedule for the regular season, with a massive showdown looming at No. 2 UCLA on December 30.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Lily Coleman\nDecember 17, 2023 at 5:54 pm PST\n\nAfter a disappointing loss to unranked Long Beach State last weekend, the Trojans fell short again to Auburn 91-75 at Neville Arena in Auburn, Alabama on Sunday. The atmosphere was electric, with a packed crowd of energetic Tigers fans that filled all 9,121 seats of the arena.\n\nBoth teams started strong in this highly-anticipated non-conference matchup, with freshman guard Isaiah Collier scoring seven points in the first four minutes of the game. Freshman guard Bronny James entered his second game as a Trojan nine minutes into the first half. He played for eight minutes and only scored one basket. However, when he came back in the second half, he made three of four free throws for a total of five points in his 15 minutes on the court.\n\nGiven that this is only Bronny\u2019s second game with the Trojans, head coach Andy Enfield shared his thoughts on the young player. \u201cWe expect him to continue to get better on both sides of the ball, understand our system, our plays,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cBut we\u2019re very proud of him, he\u2019s a hard worker, [has] very high basketball IQ and is a good teammate.\u201d\n\nEnfield explained that he finds it unfair to judge each of Bronny\u2019s possessions this early in his college career. \u201cHe\u2019s a freshman, and he\u2019s been out for five months,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very challenging for him, but we anticipate that he\u2019ll be a much better player by the middle of the season than he is now.\u201d\n\nFreshman guard Aden Holloway and graduate forward Jaylin Williams led the way offensively for Auburn, scoring 15 and 14 points, respectively. Additionally, senior center Dylan Cardwell was a force for the Tigers on both ends of the court. He led the Tigers with three steals and five rebounds to go along with two blocks and a career-high 11 points.\n\nBy halftime, the Trojans were down 49-35. Fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis led USC in points with 10, and Collier trailed right behind him with nine. The Trojans couldn\u2019t get their rhythm back in the second half, never getting within single digits of the Tigers.\n\nUSC\u2019s associate head coach Chris Capko commented on the team\u2019s defensive struggles. \u201cAt some point, we\u2019ve got to guard somebody, and I wish I had a better answer as to why we\u2019re not,\u201d Capko said. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re not guarding, and we haven\u2019t been guarding for sustained periods.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans had 15 turnovers to Auburn\u2019s eight, and they made only 40% of their shots from the field. Capko brought up some of the challenges that the team faced offensively. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a better job taking care of the ball,\u201d Capko said. \u201cBetter shots on offense I think is the biggest thing. ... We\u2019ll get better at it, but right now we\u2019re not where we need to be.\u201d\n\nEllis led both teams in points with 22, followed by Collier and sophomore guard Oziyah Sellers each scoring 13 points for USC. However, Auburn played extremely tough, put consistent pressure on USC, and had five players end with double-digit points. The Tigers\u2019 lead grew to 23 points midway through the second half. Despite the Trojans putting up 40 points in the final half, it wasn\u2019t enough to come close to a win.\n\n\u201cThere were quite a few instances where we\u2019re not reacting quick enough, we\u2019re not anticipating quickly enough, like [we have] the last four or five years,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe\u2019re developing a team on defense, and we have to get better quickly.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans (5-5) are now headed to Montgomery, Alabama to take on Alabama State on Tuesday at 4 p.m. PST.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Melissa Molloy Jackson)\n\nBy Taylor Marie Contarino\nDecember 15, 2023 at 11:21 am PST\n\nHere, on Bridgeton Pike in this small suburb just outside of the city of Philadelphia, a community of health and wellness lovers come together in 105 degree heat to share their love for all things fitness, holistic healing, wellness and, perhaps most important, one another. Every day, Tribe Hot Yoga offers a diverse array of challenging classes ranging from Hip-Hop Yoga to Pilates to HIIT to Galaxy Yoga and more. The jam-packed schedule starts at 5:30 a.m. Things don\u2019t let up until close to 10 p.m. Every workout is meant to encourage a new side of the yogi.\n\nOn Wednesday evenings, Galaxy Yoga begins around 8 p.m., when the lights inside the studio flicker off and are replaced by a colorful projector shining stars and solar systems onto the ceiling as the yogi becomes entranced with soothing music and slow, calm breathing powered by cohesively smooth moves. Wednesdays are for the soul, but Monday mornings are for the body. On Monday and other weekday mornings, yogis are encouraged to sign up for more powerful, fitness-focused courses such as HIIT and Hip-Hop Yoga, a heavy blend of powerful movements with core and ab workouts intertwined.\n\nWhen thinking of yoga, one might assume she or he is in for a calm, relaxed series of stretches and poses. Tribe rejects all of these stereotypes.\n\n\u201cMy face is getting red just admitting this, but I used to say things like, \u2018I\u2019m too high strung for yoga,\u2019 and, \u2018It\u2019s just not enough of a workout for me.\u2019 I\u2019ve had to take lots of breaks in some of these not-so-tough classes,\u201d Maureen Morrison, a high school English and middle school ESL teacher, said. Morrison travels 26 miles to get to Tribe, but she says her long commute isn\u2019t uncommon.\n\n\u201cI used to be unique in my 26-mile drive to Tribe, but word is spreading and more people are passing by other hot yoga studios to get there,\u201d she said.\n\nTribe Hot Yoga opened in May 2018. Owner, Melissa Molloy Jackson, had been practicing yoga for years, but did not decide to open the studio until a huge life change triggered a need to find community and solace. Jackson is an inspiring fitness fanatic, business owner, wife, daughter and mother.\n\n\u201cMy reason for taking the leap of faith to open Tribe came after I lost my dad suddenly in December 2017,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI needed a place, a community to heal, and didn\u2019t have one at the time. I had already been a yoga teacher and was in love with the practice. Even before my dad\u2019s passing, I dreamt of a place where people could come to practice yoga and feel included no matter their background or experience. A place where you would absolutely leave feeling better than when you arrived.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce I began practicing yoga in 2012, I fell in love quickly and deeply. The dream of Tribe was there for years, but pursuing it took my dad\u2019s death to give me the push to do it,\u201d she said.\n\nJackson decided to start Tribe in honor of her father, Francis Molloy, 61, who she says \u201chelped a lot of people in his life, even despite his own struggles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to do the same after he died. I looked at life differently at that point,\u201d she said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t guaranteed tomorrow, so I decided to go for it and open a place to help people - mentally, physically, and emotionally - it was what I needed at the time and what I wanted to gift to the community around me.\u201d\n\nTo Jackson, Tribe\u2019s story is \u201ca special one\u201d and \u201ca dream come true.\u201d Entering Tribe, you would never know just how much went into its existence. Everyone is thrilled to be there and overjoyed to celebrate community through fitness. But the story goes deeper than just fitness and friendship.\n\n\u201cThe type of community and space that I envisioned has come to life,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt took a lot of work, blood, sweat, and tears, but when I receive feedback from members saying how much Tribe helps them, I have to pinch myself. I know my dad would be proud.\u201d\n\nLauren Keiper, a data analyst for the small business lending department at TD Bank, has been teaching yoga at Tribe for three years now. Tribe is where she received her certification training after being a yogi and feeling compelled to engage further with the practice.\n\n\u201cAny time you walk through those doors you are greeted with smiles, hugs, compliments, and genuine love, even if they are strangers. Everyone there is truly rooting for each other,\u201d Keiper said.\n\nFor her, the atmosphere and sense of community is what keeps her coming back again and again.\n\nMelissa Molloy Jackson, owner and founder of Tribe Hot Yoga, adjusting a yogi student during class. (Photo courtesy of Melissa Molloy Jackson)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been to a place like Tribe. The workouts are challenging and yet healing. The people within the community are all so kind and supportive. There is truly no place like it and no place I will ever want to be,\u201d Keiper said.\n\nAt Tribe, there are healing opportunities for all, even those who may never have been previously disposed to fitness. Jenn Mancuso, an administrative assistant at Gloucester Terminals, never had a passion for fitness until Jackson opened Tribe.\n\n\u201cTribe has helped me so much with my anxiety and to just be a better human all around,\u201d said Mancuso. \u201cI mean, I have my moments of struggle, but I always leave feeling better.\u201d\n\nTo Mancuso, Tribe is a \u201cplace she can go when she\u2019s happy or sad, somewhere she knows she will be welcomed with open arms\u201d every time she returns.\n\n\u201cTribe has given me so much more confidence in myself and has helped me find myself. I\u2019ve made some great friendships along the way and I can\u2019t thank Melissa enough for the space she has created,\u201d said Audrey Spence, a senior project manager of e-discovery.\n\nTribe is currently home to 15 instructors, all certified yoga teachers; each is required to have a Yoga Teacher Training certificate. Tribe hires both experienced and new yoga teachers, and every year, they offer a 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training certification program.\n\n\u201cTribe is like a piece of my heart detached from my body,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI am unsure of the future, but I am committed to spreading the Tribe\u2019s love to more people.

(AP/Ryan Sun)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nDecember 14, 2023 at 4:52 pm PST\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Last week, the Kings stood just behind the Golden Knights in the Pacific, and looked like the team to beat in the division. But recent woes have set Los Angeles back to third in the division and nine points adrift of first-place Vegas.\n\nThe Kings\u2019 perfect road winning streak was snapped against the Islanders after Los Angeles allowed three unanswered goals and lost in overtime. The next two games, though, were regulation losses. LA posted just one goal against the red-hot Rangers before going home to face the Jets, where the Kings allowed five straight Winnipeg Jets goals in a frustrating game. Los Angeles now finds themselves on a three-game losing streak.\n\nWhile the Golden Knights have created separation in the Pacific Division lead, the Kings only trail the Vancouver Canucks for second place by three points. The Canucks are on a three-game win streak, so the Kings\u2019 recent losses place them firmly in third.\n\nNonetheless, the season is still young and Los Angeles still looks like a solid team despite recent woes. One team fans should keep on the radar, however, is the Oilers. Edmonton is fourth in the division, but winners of its last eight games. While the Kings are still ahead of the Oilers by 12 points, LA must avoid complacency as the season progresses.\n\nContrary to the result, the Kings\u2019 3-2 overtime loss to the Isles started out well for Los Angeles. Right wing Adrian Kempe put the Kings on the board on a second-period power play, followed by a missile from defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov to double the lead. The Kings went into the second intermission confident that they would extend their road winning streak to 12 games, until New York did the improbable.\n\nThe Islanders\u2019 Mathew Barzal first picked up a Kevin Fiala turnover that led to a goal from Isles captain Anders Lee goal almost midway through the third period. Lee would score his second goal off of a rebound to tie the game moments later. The Kings\u2019 defense slowly collapsed, and momentum was on New York\u2019s side heading into overtime. Center Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored the game-winner on a breakaway chance for the Isles, ending LA\u2019s historic road run.\n\nA day later, the Kings saw a familiar face at Madison Square Garden against the Rangers. Jonathan Quick, who won two Stanley Cups with Los Angeles, got the start in net against his former team. Quick was nearly perfect, as the Kings only managed to score one goal in a lackluster game offensively for them. Phillip Danault\u2019s power-play goal from a beautiful Kempe pass in the second period looked promising, as it reduced the deficit to one goal for Los Angeles, but the Rangers responded accordingly. New York went on to win, 4-1, as goaltender Pheonix Copley struggled to contain the electric Rangers offense.\n\nThe Kings capped off their dismal week with another blown lead, this time against the up-and-coming Jets. Another former King, Gabriel Vilardi, earned his revenge against his old team, assisting on the Jets\u2019 three goals in the second period after Winnipeg found itself down 2-0 at the first intermission. The 24-year-old added a goal in the third, helping solidify a 4-2 win for the Jets.\n\nTurnovers and poor defense hurt the Kings this week, especially against the Islanders and Jets. While Los Angeles did a fine job of establishing early leads in these games, the team would go quiet down the stretch and allowed comebacks that easily could\u2019ve been prevented with stronger defense around its netminders.\n\nNext week, the Kings will take on a pair of Pacific Division rivals, the Kraken and Sharks. Seattle has struggled so far and has not been not the story it was last season, while the Sharks have been one of the NHL\u2019s worst teams thus far. Los Angeles has a golden opportunity this week to get back on the horse and into the win column with some easier matchups. The first two games will be at Seattle and San Jose, respectively, before the Kings return home to host the Kraken as part of a three-game homestand.\n\nWhile the Kings struggled this week, they did play some very competitive teams. With a lighter schedule on the horizon, Los Angeles can take each matchup one game at a time to find its winning ways again. A lot can happen in the division race, so the Kings must put on their A-game to contend for the crown.\n\nThe Kings will head up to the Pacific Northwest to face the Seattle Kraken at Climate Pledge Arena at 7:30 p.m on Saturday.\n```"}

Among these subjects, Fairey interlaces his own \u201cOBEY\u201d campaign faces. Using the proximity to cultural icons, Fairey elevates his works, specifically in their street art form. The OBEY face becomes iconic once it has lived as a poster in the street, torn and weathered, among us.\n\nMonoprints by Shepard Fairey on view at Subliminal Projects. Photo by Lyla Bhalla-Ladd of Ampersand LA.\n\nSubliminal Projects in Echo Park hosted the new series of hand-embellished \u201cmono-engravings,\u201d screen prints on wood and metal, hand-painted multiples (HPMs) and modular works. Fairey utilizes his same primary color palette with black and white to construct the entirety of the silkscreen prints. His use of shape and collage layering forms a background and subtle underlayer made of newspaper clippings, headlines and slogans beneath each icon\u2019s gaze. The viewer faces off with the icons, each surrounded by their respective legacy. In the company of the portraits lies the OBEY face in different states and forms. Six OBEY mono-engravings all depict the same face in an alternate setting. One lights the face in concentric triangles, another depicts the poster torn and scratched. One piece in particular, \u201cEnhanced Disintegration,\u201d hangs on the long gallery wall that spans the whole of the Subliminal Projects gallery. Between a Frida Kahlo and a \u201cPeace is Radical\u201d print, this OBEY face is the same, classic, silkscreen print from 1989 reimagined out in the world. The face lies just barely detectable underneath and around a layer of lifted paint and battered edges, depicted as torn halfway from the top right corner. It stands center while the thick frame around the stark expression continues the tears and scattered other marks. In \u201cEnhanced Disintegration,\u201d Fairey weathers the face in a combination of natural erosion and human interaction. The piece even steps back in perspective so the poster does not take up the whole frame, allowing its surroundings to be a part of the art.\n\n\"Enhanced Disintegration\" by Shepard Fairey on view at Subliminal Projects. Photo by Lyla Bhalla-Ladd of Ampersand LA.\n\nIn his manifesto, \u201cManufacturing Quality Dissent Since 1989,\u201d Fairey describes his OBEY sticker campaign as an \u201cexperiment in phenomenology,\u201d a philosophical study that German philosopher Martin Heidegger defined as \u201cthe process of letting things manifest themselves.\u201d Within his manifesto, Fairey encourages viewers to interpret the OBEY symbol as they see fit as it \u201chas no meaning but exists only to cause people to react, to contemplate and search for meaning in the sticker.\" In prioritizing the viewer\u2019s interpretation, Fairey raises the art\u2019s position once it has been seen. The viewer is a key player in the purpose and being of these prints. In another mono-engraving, part of a series of over 30 pieces, he dares the viewer to buy it and give into \u201cthe propaganda,\u201d even writing \u201cthis is a con.\u201d Continuously quoted for bringing art to the people, rather than expecting people to come to the art, Fairey taunts the viewer to admit the power that symbols have \u2014 particularly when they implicitly do not have meaning.\n\nFairey also explains that beyond embracing many interpretations, \u201cthere\u2019s a relationship between the creativity and the destruction that are part of a healthy symbiotic cycle. It\u2019s... a necessity when you\u2019re working in street art because a lot of what you do is going to disappear.\u201d Within street art, the expectation of wear and tear on stickers and posters is typical. Fairey pushes this norm by cherishing the poster\u2019s new physical form, post-original display. Embracing its life cycle, \u201cEnhanced Disintegration\u201d takes on new life that brings its years of exposure with it. In letting these images \u201cmanifest themselves,\u201d the torn-down poster becomes more iconic because it has been interacted with \u2014 seen and acted on. Simultaneously amongst the greats and in the street with the people, OBEY is a mirror, reflecting its audience and their reactions. Fairey takes OBEY\u2019s controversy and puts it back on the canvas, giving the face new life, and now, icon status.\n\n\u201cICONS\u201d is on view at Subliminal Projects in Echo Park, Los Angeles through Dec. 30 of this year.\n```"}

Photo courtesy of Jennifer Yonda.\n\nBy Elise Hernke December 11, 2023 at 1:21 pm PST\n\nVenice Ale House sits right against the L.A. beach landmark boardwalk where people-watching is at its ultimate prime. The last time I was there, an Amazonian Cindy Crawford-looking girl skated up to the edge of the bar and began chatting up a young man. The entire bar got slightly quieter as everyone looked on, pretending that they weren\u2019t. As she got his phone number, I flagged down her friend and noted how impressed I was: \u201cThe ultimate cool girl,\u201d I thought. Her friend told me that they were part of a skating community called VibeRide LA, which partners on Tuesday nights with LA Skate Hunnies. Both groups intend to bring people together with the common interest of getting on wheels and cruising. I was in awe.\n\nLA Skate Hunny Talking to a man at the Venice Ale House. Photo by Elise Hernke of Ampersand LA.\n\nAfter the two skater girls glided away, the whole bar, all of us eavesdropping patrons pretending to mind our business, suddenly erupted in applause. The lucky bloke turned and laughed at the support, saying he was glad he had witnesses because otherwise, no one would have believed him. I was left feeling wonderstruck and curious about this club, full of women who seemed to be soaking in the best that life had to offer, oozing with confidence, freedom and self-possession. I wanted to know more. That\u2019s when I sought out Jennifer Yonda, the founder of LA Skate Hunnies.\n\nAs expected, Yonda is a lively adventurer, always wearing vibrant colors and an infectious smile. She started LA Skate Hunnies, a female-founded skate community that welcomes \u201call humans on wheels.\u201d Yonda\u2019s preferred method of transport is roller skates, but she encourages people on all types of wheels to join the Hunnies at their various events, including skateboards, rollerblades and bikes. It is all about building a community of like-minded people. When I got the chance to speak with her, she proudly confirmed, \u201cOur community is open, inclusive, kind, nurturing and supportive.\u201d\n\nYonda started LA Skate Hunnies about four months into the pandemic because she was desperate to find other women who skate. This was a time when, after being in forced lockdown for several months, everyone seemed to place a higher value on human connection. She was new to Los Angeles, and in an attempt to cast a wide net of potential new friends, she took to Facebook to announce her first event. She had expected the worst: to be alone with no takers. To her surprise and delight, four people showed up. It felt like a victory and she was encouraged to stay consistent to nurture that small group.\n\nFor months, the group remained small but dependable. After a while, the numbers started to explode. Each week the number of skaters multiplied by about 10 people, until she was seeing roughly 50 regular skaters by the year\u2019s end. She reflected on how this motivated her to continue and to take on the growing pains she would come to face in the following months. \u201cPeople kept coming and saying that the time was really meaningful to them,\u201d she said.\n\nJennifer Yonda in her skates. Photo courtesy of Jennifer Yonda.\n\nOne of the most difficult aspects of this level of growth was managing a group of that capacity. She would lose her voice shouting information to the group and had to invest in a megaphone. It was also difficult to get the support of the city for such a large gathering and they would get kicked out of spaces that the community loved, which would be disheartening. But with each disappointment, the pivot forced them to find creative solutions, resulting in new spaces that worked better for their needs.\n\nEven after all this growth, it seems that this is only the beginning for LA Skate Hunnies, as it continues to expand and find partnerships to elevate the community experience. The next step, which Yonda has been reluctant to take, is to develop a membership program so that they will be able to monetize the events and use the funds to enrich the experiences for their loyal attendees. Keeping up with the community is a lot of work, so this year Yonda finally leaped to leave her nine-to-five and commit to LA Skate Hunnies full-time.\n\nShe applied her previous experience as an event coordinator for a Culver City park to her work at the Hunnies. Looking ahead to 2024, she intends to be more proactive with the events calendar, implementing quarterly or yearly events that were previously successful. The hope is that the advanced notice will allow more people to attend and will help make the logistics easier, such as acquiring permits for larger venues.\n\nWhen speaking about the process of scaling a company with no prior experience, she emphasizes the importance of being humble and asking for help. One of the expansions to the company is to provide opportunities for members to try different hobbies, such as rock climbing and hiking. The LA Skate Hunnies calendar was filling up: \u201cWe had \u2018Thursday Night Skate,\u2019 pop-up events on Saturdays and a lesson program. [Also,] some monthly events like \u2018Ladies Night\u2019 and \u2018Climb Hunnies,\u2019 which are bouldering meetups.\u201d This is in addition to the skate park meetups they had been doing.\n\nThese manifold meetups helped Yonda get partnerships that have fallen into her lap organically. Many like-minded people saw what she was doing and wanted to contribute their skills, expertise or even their own companies, to build up LA Skate Hunnies. She was more than happy to allow them. She considers herself grateful for the ability to learn to navigate partnerships with people who were already excited about her work. \u201c[It] gives you tidbits of practice with someone who is super stoked on you already,\u201d she explained, \u201c[and] to learn and grow in a safe space.\u201d\n\nJennifer Yonda on the street with her roller skating crew. Photo courtesy of Jennifer Yonda.\n\nAt the core of the company, Yonda says her mission is all about \u201cconnecting people with experiences that light them up.\u201d Her commitment to such an active lifestyle is inspiring. When I asked how she stays motivated, she thanked the \u201cpower of collective accountability\u201d and talked about the ways that people in a community can positively impact each other. That has helped her stay committed to the work. Even on her worst days, she knew that getting to see her friends would always make the activity feel worthwhile.\n\nLooking ahead, another initiative that she would like to roll out is a more robust lesson program. To help interested skaters get comfortable on their wheels, LA Skate Hunnies offers a variety of classes but for people who would rather \u201cbuild Rome in a day,\u201d they offer day camps.\n\nLos Angeles is the type of city where it is easy to get lost in the shuffle. People tend to isolate themselves to avoid traffic, the heat or the chaos. There is a massive need for people such as Yonda to come into this type of place and help others remember that they have neighbors and plenty of land to explore. Getting people together brings life back into a city that can feel so disconnected.\n\nIn conversation with ShoutoutLA earlier this year, Yonda inspired with her list of ideas for tourists visiting Los Angeles for the first time: devouring empanadas in Venice, hiking to the Rock Pools in Malibu Creek State Park or taking the Thousand Steps in Laguna Beach to hang by the water. It seems effortless the way she finds unique experiences to embrace the offerings of such a vast city, leaning into the exquisite environment that is so emblematic of California.\n\nOriginally from Boston, she understands the benefits of the Los Angeles weather. \u201cWhen I go out with friends I want us to feel expansive and free, to feel like we\u2019re seizing the day,\u201d she gushed. Yonda reminds us to do what we love and lean on others to make it happen. And maybe empower yourself with a set of wheels.\n\nLA Skate Hunnies meet weekly on Thursdays at 7 p.m. For more information, visit their Instagram page.\n```"}

The Trojans fell 84-79 in overtime Sunday at the Galen Center. (Photo by Wesley Chen)\n\nBy Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as December 10, 2023 at 8:21 pm PST\n\nFreshman guard Bronny James\u2019 debut for the USC Trojans was spoiled by Long Beach State, with the Trojans falling 84-79 in overtime Sunday afternoon at Galen Center, their second consecutive loss. It was James\u2019s first game back since suffering cardiac arrest in July during summer practices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not ideal. We did that to ourselves,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cThis team is developing, and we have to get better ways to get better in certain areas.\u201d\n\nLong Beach State fifth-year guard Marcus Tsohonis led all scorers with 28 points, hitting a clutch jumper with 3.9 seconds left to send the game to overtime. In his first start of the year, USC sophomore center Vince Iwuchukwu had a season-high in points (15) on an efficient 7-for-8 from the field.\n\n\u201cI thought Vince gave us good offense today,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cHe played hard and gave us great energy.\u201d\n\nIn his debut, USC freshman guard Bronny James had three points, three rebounds, and two assists, plus one chase-down block.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful for everything,\u201d James said. \" I want to give appreciation to everyone that\u2019s helped me through this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought he played well. He defended at a high level,\u201d Enfield said of James.\n\nFor the first time this season, the Galen Center was sold out, with fans arriving two hours before tipoff to get a seat. In attendance for Bronny\u2019s debut were his father, Lebron James, and Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka.\n\n\u201cIt felt like the UCLA game,\u201d fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis said.\n\nThe Trojans came out hot to start the game, establishing a solid offensive presence early. Iwuchukwu was a problem in the paint, scoring four fast points to get the offense rolling. A pair of steals from freshman guard Isisiah Collier (3) and junior forward Kobe Johnson (4) in the first half allowed the Trojans to get in transition and create 20 points off the turnovers.\n\nAt 12:58 in the first half, James stepped on the court for the first time in his college career and was met with a standing ovation from the crowd. The Trojans had all the momentum going into halftime, leading by 15 points.\n\nLong Beach found new life to open the second half with a 5-0 run. The Trojans couldn\u2019t answer the Long Beach offense in the second half, allowing the Beach to get back into the game.\n\n\u201cI was disappointed in our energy that we started the second half. ... We missed some wide-open shots to start,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThey were flat on defense, and [Long Beach] just had more energy to start the second half.\u201d\n\nLong Beach profited from the poor shooting from the Trojans in the second half, who shot just 36% from the field. At 7:23 in the second half, Long Beach took their first lead, 62-61.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re lackadaisical on defense, including myself. We had no resistance,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWe just got to be better.\u201d\n\nThe achilles\u2019 heel for USC in Sunday\u2019s loss was the poor shooting from the free throw line. They shot 55% from the line and missed some critical free throws in the final minutes.\n\n\u201cSome very good shooters missed free throws today,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very frustrating sequence when you keep missing free shots.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans had a chance to win at the end of regulation with the game tied at 74, but a blocked Collier shot attempt resulted in overtime. Ellis had a chance to take it himself but opted to pass it out to Collier for a 3-point attempt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why [Boogie] didn\u2019t take the ball to the basket,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t designed [for a pass]. It was for him.\u201d\n\nIn overtime, USC\u2019s offense struggled to find their shots, shooting 17% from the field. A few scores from Long Beach sophomore forward AJ George and guard Tsohonis sealed an upset win for the Beach.\n\nUSC has lost two of its four games to Big West Conference teams this season and now holds a 5-4 record in 10th place in the Pac-12. The Trojans head to the road for a four-game stretch, starting with a trip to Auburn to take on the Tigers next Sunday at 10 a.m. PST.\n```"}

(Photo Courtesy of AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill).\n\nBy Thomas Johnson\nDecember 10, 2023 at 7:56 pm PST\n\nWhen it seems like it can\u2019t get any better, USC women\u2019s basketball keeps looking more and more impressive on the court. In a game where 10 different players saw 10 or more minutes of floor time, the Trojans (8-0) put the UC Riverside Highlanders (4-4) to bed with a 85-53 victory at Galen Center on Sunday. The 32-point win was one of USC\u2019s more complete wins this season, as the Trojans got it done on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball.\n\nUSC jumped out to a 10-0 lead and never looked back, with Riverside not hitting 10 points until halfway through the second quarter. USC held Riverside to 16 first-half points, the least the Trojans have allowed in a first half all season and the least since the Washington Huskies could only muster 11 points across the opening two quarters at Galen Center this past February.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to learn each other, we have aggression,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cWe want to really learn the spots in which we can be aggressive within our game plan. And I think the more we understand all the schemes will just allow us to be ourselves on the defensive end as well. I think that\u2019s where you see the steals and the blocks come from.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans had 10 blocks and 10 steals as a team, the first time they\u2019ve been in double digits for both categories this season. The largest difference between this USC team and last year\u2019s edition, though, is that USC only scored 47 points against the Huskies during that February victory. The Trojans had reached that point total by halftime \u2014 with 48 points across the first two quarters \u2014 against the Highlanders.\n\nSo far this season, USC has proven itself to be a much more capable offensive force than last season\u2019s team. It averages 79.6 points per game, compared to 64.2 points per game last season. The Trojans have now hit 80 points in five of their eight games this season, a number they only hit twice throughout their last campaign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun, it\u2019s a lot more intense,\u201d junior center Rayah Marshall said. \u201cOur practices, I think, just translate a lot to our games. So when we\u2019re in practice grinding on this offensive set or scouting how this team guards defensively just really translates to the game, and we just try to trust our system.\u201d\n\nFreshman guard JuJu Watkins has been the leading offensive force for USC, and that continued on Sunday. She scored a game-high 27 points, breaking a streak of three straight games with 30 or more points. Despite the addition of Watkins improving the Trojan offense in a big way, USC\u2019s defensive intensity has not gone away. The unit is letting up 55.8 points per game \u2014 comparable to the Trojans\u2019 numbers from last year of 55.1 points allowed per game.\n\n\u201cWe go so hard defensively because we want to score the ball,\u201d Marshall said. Watkins was part of the impressive defensive performance against the Highlanders, with five of USC\u2019s 10 steals coupled with two blocks.\n\nHowever, the No. 6 Trojans will have to prove they can keep up their strong play in the upcoming months, with eight games against teams currently ranked in the AP Top 25 on the schedule. To make matters more difficult, four of those games come in a row in January.\n\n\u201cI just want our offense to keep evolving,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI think we\u2019re very hard to guard when that ball is moving and we\u2019re seamless, and I think that\u2019s coming along as well. But, I would say just continuing to grow our options on offense and really have a gritty defensive mindset where we can make life difficult for people no matter what they\u2019re bringing to the table.\u201d\n\nGottlieb said she was not thrilled with her team\u2019s second-half defense, as the Highlanders and Trojans both scored 37 points across the last two quarters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things we can get better at, and they know we\u2019ve been harping on things in the interim that are just more about us,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cOur connectedness on defense, our ability to execute whatever the game plan is at a high level, no matter how tired you might be or who subs in or out.\u201d\n\nBut the defensive shortcomings in the second half could be attributed to the fact that, because of the 32-point halftime lead, many bench players saw significant minutes down the stretch. Freshman guard Malia Samuels saw 17 minutes on the court \u2014 the most she\u2019s played since USC\u2019s second game of the season.\n\nThe Trojans have over a week off before their next game, as they take on Cal State Fullerton on December 18 at Galen Center \u2014 their last home game until 2024 \u2014 with tip-off scheduled for 7 p.m.\n```"}

Chances are, your mind probably just went to one of Christian McCaffrey, Brock Purdy, Deebo Samuel, or perhaps even George Kittle. Yet there\u2019s someone you\u2019re missing \u2013 the current fulcrum of the 49ers passing attack, Brandon Aiyuk. Amid a breakout season, Brandon Aiyuk is reaching his pre-draft potential and rapidly ascending as one of the league\u2019s most dangerous weapons through his refined route running, sure hands, and dynamic yards-after-catch ability.\n\nOn this week\u2019s edition of Tape Talk, we\u2019ll be talking all Brandon Aiyuk, delving into his background, his role in Kyle Shanahan\u2019s scheme, and how he\u2019s making his case for belonging among the league\u2019s top receivers.\n\nUnderrecruited throughout high school, Aiyuk only received offers from a few Mountain West programs before they dropped him due to poor grades. He went the JUCO route at Sierra College, a school with just over 18,000 students located on the outskirts of Sacramento. Clearly playing below his level, Aiyuk dominated as an all-purpose player, playing both receiver and corner while also returning kicks. He started and earned All-Conference honors as a true freshman, was named JUCO All-American after a stellar sophomore season, and finished his career at Sierra College with 2,499 all-purpose yards and 21 touchdowns.\n\nAfter two impressive campaigns at Sierra, Aiyuk received FBS offers from Mountain West programs again before committing to Arizona State after an offer just a few days before signing day. He spent most of his first year in Tempe on the bench yet burst onto the scene during his second year as a full-time starter, finishing with 1,192 yards on 68 targets and earning a first-team All-Pac-12 selection.\n\nCome draft time, Aiyuk had made a name for himself as an explosive, big-play weapon due to his YAC ability and vertical speed. Here he is, for example, catching a game-winning touchdown from Jayden Daniels (yes, LSU\u2019s 2023 Heisman winner Jayden Daniels) to help the Sun Devils overcome Oregon in 2019.\n\nDue to his ability after the catch, draft analysts quickly paired Aiyuk to the San Francisco 49ers and Kyle Shanahan\u2019s West Coast, YAC-centric offense come draft season, a prospective marriage that perfectly came to fruition during draft night after San Francisco traded up to No. 25 overall to select him.\n\nAiyuk was a reliable starter during his first three years in San Francisco, finishing all three seasons with over 700 pass yards and five touchdowns on 80-plus targets, yet he was never in the spotlight. Playing in a loaded offense chock-full of All-Pro level talent, he was relegated to a supporting role schematically by Kyle Shanahan and deemed an afterthought by the local and national media.\n\nThat\u2019s changed dramatically this season, with Aiyuk currently the 49ers\u2019 leading receiver. Through thirteen weeks, he leads the team in targets (72), receiving yards (927), and yards per reception (18.5), and is second in passer rating when targeted (128.2). Individually, he\u2019s also on pace for his most productive NFL season yet, projected to finish with a career-high 1,313 yards and nine touchdowns on 71 receptions, per ESPN.\n\nAiyuk\u2019s increased production has come as the result of Kyle Shanahan\u2019s reliance on him to serve as the team\u2019s primary receiving option. In years past, the 49ers\u2019 passing attack has been built around George Kittle or Deebo Samuel, with Aiyuk acting as a secondary option. This year, the roles have reversed.\n\nAiyuk is often tasked to win down the field as the primary read on passing concepts, while players like Kittle, Deebo, and Christian McCaffrey are schemed open underneath where they can get the ball quickly and create after the catch. This is not to say that players like McCaffrey, Kittle, and Samuel never run routes down the field, or that Aiyuk is never schemed open; the 49ers offense is an incredibly varied unit that thrives by using its personnel in different and innovative ways Sunday after Sunday.\n\nHowever, on average, Aiyuk has been deployed as the alpha, tasked with beating No.1 corners and getting open as the primary read on intermediate and deep passing concepts \u2013 through thirteen weeks, he has recorded the highest average depth of target and highest yards before the catch numbers among all 49ers skill players at 14.3 and 13.7 yards, respectively.\n\nBut this is Aiyuk\u2019s fourth season with the 49ers, and he\u2019s finally ascending into the premier player of the team\u2019s passing attack, so what\u2019s changed? His route running and hands.\n\nAiyuk has developed into one of the scariest route runners in the league, which, combined with the cleaning up of previous drop issues, has allowed him to become an incredibly reliable number-one option. Let\u2019s start with his route running, beginning at the line of scrimmage with his release and ability to deal with early contact from defensive backs and jams (a technique used by cornerbacks to press the receiver\u2019s chest and disrupt their release).\n\nMost critiques in Aiyuk\u2019s game in 2022 and prior came with his supposed inability to separate off the line when jammed, yet he\u2019s shown tremendous improvement this year, displaying the ability to beat most jams at the line of scrimmage either through excellent lateral agility and foot quickness or advanced hand-fighting ability.\n\nWatch this Week 11 rep against the Tampa Bay Buccanneers, for example. Bucs cornerback Zyon McCollum, lined up in press against Aiyuk, tries early contact, yet Aiyuk evades it with extraordinary lateral agility and foot quickness, proceeding to win on a dig route.\n\nOr how about this Week 8 play against the Cincinnati Bengals, where Aiyuk utilizes a swat move to neutralize Bengals corner Cam Taylor Britt\u2019s jam and push him off to pull away on the crosser?\n\nThose are two examples of Aiyuk winning early in the route, yet there\u2019s a myriad more of him winning afterward against both man and zone coverage. He thrives against man, both off and press, where he can beat defenders using his excellent athletic ability, technique, and physicality to create separation on all three levels on both speed and hard-cut routes.\n\nWatch this third-quarter rep against former All-Pro cornerback Stephon Gilmore in Week 5\u2032s San Francisco 49ers vs. Dallas Cowboys matchup, for example. Gilmore is ten yards back, in an off alignment, so Aiyuk explodes off the line with great speed, covering ground quickly and selling a vertical route with his eyes before showing tremendous foot quickness and burst to pull away from the Cowboys DB on the speed cut and finish the post route.\n\nHe can win when pressed, too, as we saw during those clips of him beating jams. His play strength and physical toughness have taken a jump from last season, and he is showing the ability to consistently fight off jams early, remain balanced through contact with good core strength, or win through subtle push-offs at the top of the route to create separation.\n\nAiyuk showcases the ability to use his athleticism, technique, and physicality to separate against Man coverage, yet he\u2019s also a fine separator against a zone, showing the football IQ to understand zones and settle at the appropriate depth.\n\nWatch him on this corner route in his matchup against the Bengals, for example. The Bengals are running a Cover 2 look, meaning the deep safety will backpedal to protect his half while the corner settles in the flat to cover any underneath routes. Noticing this, Aiyuk runs his corner route at perfect depth before willingly staying between the corner and safety to allow Brock Purdy to hit the honey hole shot (term used for a quarterback\u2019s throw between the corner and safety in Cover 2).\n\nOverall, Aiyuk has been a complete route runner this year, and it shows. Through thirteen weeks, he ranks fourth among all NFL receivers in receiving success rate (68.1%). His combination of athleticism, technique, physicality, and football IQ have cemented him as one of the best route runners in football.\n\nAnother positive trait that has elevated Aiyuk into elite consideration is his highly reliable hands. On tape, he shows the dexterity to extend for balls in front of him and the body control and flexibility to adjust to balls above and below his frame, enabling him to catch basically anything thrown at him \u2013 through thirteen games, his drop rate of 2.8% is the lowest of his career.\n\nFurthermore, Aiyuk has also shown improved concentration and play strength to make tough catches over the shoulder and hang on to catches through traffic, currently boasting a career-high 69.4% catch percentage, the highest of his career.\n\nWatch him on this rep in Week 12\u2032s Thanksgiving matchup versus the Seattle Seahawks, perfectly tracking a beautiful ball from quarterback Brock Purdy between three defenders and showing late hands before having the concentration and contact balance to hang on to the football through a hit from safety Julian Love.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about where Aiyuk has made money from his Sierra days to today: YAC. Aiyuk has been a notorious YAC threat throughout his career, yet this year, he\u2019s quietly outgrown that label as he\u2019s polished his route running and ascended to become the 49ers\u2019 wide receiver one.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Reference, his 13.7 yards before the catch this season is the highest number of his career, while his yards after the catch per reception has dropped by a whole point from where it was his Sophomore season (4.9 vs. 6.2 respectively). This is not a product of Aiyuk\u2019s ability but more about his responsibility in the 49ers scheme, as discussed earlier.\n\nWhen called upon to win after the catch, however, the former Sun Devil is still a formidable threat due to his smooth catching motion, which enables him to get vertical and eat up yards almost instantly, and extraordinary field vision in the open field to evade defenders.\n\nWatch him on this first-quarter rep during Week 1\u2032s 49ers vs. Steelers matchup. Aiyuk catches the ball on a dig route in the middle of the field, yet where most receivers would waste a second focusing on catching the ball and then turning upfield, Aiyuk shows the concentration and natural catching motion to haul the ball in as he\u2019s running and continue to do so through the catch, enabling him to get vertical quicker and add an extra five to seven yards to the play.\n\nLet\u2019s pivot to this second-quarter play against the Buccanneers. Aiyuk beats Bucs corner Carlton Davis on a dig route with physicality, flashes those smooth hands and easy catching motion which enable him to turn upfield quickly and then shows the field vision to take the play around the sideline rather than vertical, helping him add extra yards to the play.\n\nThis is how Aiyuk wins after the catch. He may not be a bulldozer and tackle-breaking monster like his teammate Deebo Samuel or an electric dancer in the open field like, say, Tyreek Hill or Zay Flowers, yet he wins through subtle movements and extraordinary field vision which perfectly position him to gain extra yards.\n\nThere really haven\u2019t been many holes to poke in Aiyuk\u2019s game during the 2023 season. The three most important attributes for a receiver are route running, hands and YAC, and Aiyuk has been elite in all three facets.\n\nWith that said, it should be noted that Aiyuk benefits from playing for a historic offense filled with All-Pro talent and one of the greatest offensive masterminds in football calling plays. Passing concepts are engineered to perfection, and with defenses having to account for the entirety of the 49ers\u2019 deadly lineup, Aiyuk is thus less double-teamed or schemed against than many of the elite receivers in the league like Tyreek Hill, Davante Adams, or Justin Jefferson.\n\nThere is that big question on how Aiyuk would fare if he were dropped in as the true No. 1 guy for a lesser team, yet this is purely hypothetical and shouldn\u2019t count against him, as it\u2019s something he can\u2019t control.\n\nMoreover, as we established, he\u2019s the engine of his elite 49ers\u2019 passing attack this year, enabling it to rank first in net yards per attempt (8.5) through the air and top ten in total pass yards (3061) and touchdowns (23).\n\nOverall, Aiyuk has completed his development this 2023 season as the premier receiver the 49ers thought they drafted in 2020. Through his refined route-running prowess and improved hands, he\u2019s evolved from being a mere \u201cYAC threat\u201d to one of the most complete receivers in the league and a potential franchise cornerstone for San Francisco.\n\nThe former Sun Devil has looked like a top-ten receiver this fall, and it\u2019s time for the media to give him his flowers. If the 49ers end up hoisting the Lombardi two months from now, Aiyuk will undoubtedly be a massive reason as to why.\n```"}

{"key": "/2023/12/09/the-cookbook-recipes-to-week-14/", "response": "```\nThe first NFL games of December bring the heat with big-time rivalry games.\n\nBy Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as\nDecember 09, 2023 at 6:48 pm PST\n\nIn the heat of my finals season, the last thing I need is another high-stress activity. The time has come for another civil war on Twitter between Cowboys and Eagles fans. I watched Prescott and the Cowboys blow a golden opportunity to steal a game in Philadelphia just a month ago. The loss even more questioned my team\u2019s ability to win big games after falling to both the 49ers and Eagles. Since that moment, Dak has played at an elite level, winning four straight games and scoring 33-plus points in each game. The Eagles have faced the most challenging part of the schedule over the last month and have an impressive 3-1 record over those last four games. The stage is now set: Sunday Night Football, Eagles at Cowboys, each team hoping to secure the division lead. The Cowboys need a win to stay in the NFC East race, and the Eagles are looking to guarantee an NFC East division title. And with that, I still have to worry about a final exam and project next Tuesday.\n\nAs my final exams are here, the NFL season is reaching its final stretch with more on the line than ever this season. At the beginning of the season, the AFC South was the most unproven division, featuring two teams starting new quarterbacks in week one. Fourteen weeks in, the division has three teams in the playoff picture. The Jaguars sit atop the division, holding the fourth spot in the playoff picture. An AFC battle between the Jaguars and the Browns looks like a must-win game for the Jags to keep first place. Yet, with still four weeks, don\u2019t count out C.J. Stroud and the Texans, who have been dicing up opponents in the last few games. And we can\u2019t forget Minshew Mania in Indianapolis, putting together a solid year with a first-year head coach.\n\nRegarding quarterback play, this week\u2019s Michelin Star Player of the Week is Brock Purdy. The more I watch him play, the more confident he looks slinging the ball. In a massive NFC matchup against the Eagles, Purdy showed out dominantly, tossing four touchdowns in a 42-19 victory. The 49ers are humming, and Purdy is leading the charge under center.\n\nThe waiter has arrived; what\u2019s first on the menu?\n\nFirst Course | Jacksonville Jaguars (8-4) vs. Cleveland Browns (7-5), 10:00 a.m PST, CBS\nFans of the Jaguars and Browns will probably learn who is playing quarterback for their team 30 minutes before the game. In a tough overtime loss last week, Trevor Lawerance left with a high ankle sprain, making his status \u201cprobably\u201d a game-time decision. It\u2019s funny to mention that the only other quarterback, C.J. Beatherd, was also limited in practice this week. Lawrence playing with a banged-up ankle could be more detrimental than not playing. The Browns\u2019 defensive team has single-handedly won games this season by beating down opposing offenses, led by defensive player of the year front-runner Myles Garret. And well, for the Browns, head coach Kevin Stefanski has to choose between 38-year-old Joe Flacco and the raw rookie Dorian Robinson-Thompson. If you are one of the few who can still enjoy a defensive-only game, this one\u2019s for you.\n\nFries - Dalvin Tomlinson, Browns\u2019 Defensive End - Let\u2019s give the big boys some love. Ever since Tomlinson arrived at this free agency, his impact has been instantly felt. A Browns rush defense ranking 25th last season is 12th this year, holding opponents to only 107 yards a game.\n\nDessert - DAWG POUND. If I have to trust a defense to win this game, it is going to the Browns.\n\nSecond Course | Buffalo Bills (6-6) vs. Kansas City Chiefs (8-4), 1:25 p.m PST, CBS\nThere have been BIG games between these two teams, yet none might be more significant than this one in Arrowhead. The teams\u2019 records are not as appealing as they\u2019ve been for matchups in past games. However, the Chiefs are one game back from the number-one seed in the AFC, and the Bills sit outside looking into the Playoffs picture, one game back from the seventh spot. Josh Allen has entered unfamiliar territory this season with the team\u2019s struggles. For only the second time since his second year, Allen has a record of .500 or below at 6-6 (1-1 record in 2021). The turnovers and chemistry continue to be the problem. The arm strength has always been there, yet his tendency to give the ball away has only worsened. He can\u2019t afford more mistakes, or the Bills will have to hope for more than winning their games to get them a bid into the playoffs. Mahomes might have to start putting out tryouts with fans for the receiver position because the group they have right now is not good. I can\u2019t believe a team like the Chiefs wouldn\u2019t want to help their franchise guy. Kelce can only do so much with everything that defenses throw at him.\n\nMac and Cheese - James Cook, Bills\u2019 Running Back - The Bills will have to look to their second-year running back to slow down the game\u2019s pace. Cook is tenth in the NFL in rush yards, putting up 731 yards in 12 games.\n\nDessert - CHIEF KINGDOM. As much as my thoughts about the Chiefs receiver room are problematic, we are talking about Patrick Mahomes here. The gun-slinging matchup between two of the best will see Mahomes prevail for the fourth in this head-to-head. A victory puts the Chiefs in prime position for the number one seed.\n\nThird Course | Philadelphia Eagles (10-2) vs. Dallas Cowboys (9-3), 5:20 p.m PST, NBC\nWaiting all day for Sunday Night is both the best and worst situation. Seeing my Cowboys on primetime this week and wearing their stylish all-white alternative uniforms is gold. Conversely, waiting all day for the Sunday Night game drives me crazy. Everything is on the line, starting with the NFC East division title. If the Cowboys win this game, things will look much better \u2014 for both the title race and quelling the criticism that they can only beat bad teams. Yet the Eagles can pretty much seal the title with a win. In moments like these, it comes down to the quarterbacks under center. Looking at the last seven games, Dak Prescott has dominated his opponents, while Hurts has played largely well but shown occasional struggles. Comparing the two, Prescott has a 21:2 touchdown-to-interception ratio on a 70.5% pass completion; Hurts has a 13:6 ratio on 66% completion. The legs of both quarterbacks have come in handy in crucial moments this season, yet the 49ers revealed a \u201cblueprint\u201d to containing Hurts in the run game. Put a spy and make him throw.\n\nGarlic Bread - Ceedee Lamb, Cowboys\u2019 Receiver - A Cowboys offense can never be complete without a star receiver wearing No. 88. Lamb has fully put himself in the top-five receiver conversation with his play this season.\n\nDessert - HOW BOUT THEM BOYS. Call me a homer, but Prescott and the offense are cooking, and it is exciting. The Cowboys have a new-found rhythm in the red zone, spelling trouble for an Eagles defensive unit that struggles in that part of the field.\n\nLast week\u2019s record: 2-1\nOverall record: 13-13\n\nRecipe of the week\nWhenever there are intense rivalry games \u2013 Eagles versus Cowboys and Bills versus Chiefs - going on in the NFL, I always feel like eating some really good American food. Burgers and a side is all I need. For this gameday recipe, I give you the All-American Sliders.\n\nIngredients\n1/2 cup breadcrumbs, soft white\n2 tablespoons milk\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1/2 teaspoon marjoram, optional\n1 tablespoon ketchup\n1 pound ground beef, 85 percent lean\n10 to 12 slices of American cheese\n\nFor serving (optional):\n10 to 12 slider buns\nTomatoes, sliced, optional\nLettuce, optional\nPickles, optional\nKetchup, optional\nMustard, optional\n\nDirections\nIn a medium bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, milk, salt, pepper, marjoram, and ketchup; mix well with a spoon and let this mixture stand for 5 minutes. Add the ground beef, crumbling it with your fingers as you add it; mix gently but thoroughly with your hands until combined. Form the meat mixture into about 10 to 12 mini burgers. At this point, you can cover the burgers and chill them for up to 24 hours. When you are ready to eat, prepare and preheat a gas or charcoal grill. Grill the burgers on a small rack placed over the regular grill rack, over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes per side, turning once, until the burgers are 160 F. Top each mini burger with the American cheese slices and cover the grill for 30 to 40 seconds to let the cheese melt. You can also fry these burgers in a hot pan over medium-high heat, turning once, until done to 160 F. Assemble the burgers with the buns, tomatoes, lettuce leaves, ketchup, mustard, and pickles.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/12/09/sc-unplugged-gabe-douglas-tells-a-story-of-betrayal-through-his-song-talk/", "response": " \nSC Unplugged: Gabe Douglas tells a story of betrayal through his song \u201cTalk\u201d\n\nThe USC student and singer-songwriter discusses the integral role TikTok has played in his career.\n\nGabe Douglas on the set of his music video for \u201cCity Dreams\u201d (Photo courtesy of SJ Spreng)\n\nBy Taryn Snyder\nDecember 09, 2023 at 5:33 pm PST\n\nAfter a viral TikTok video of his song covers, singer-songwriter Gabe Douglas\u2019 lifelong passion turned into a future career. Douglas first found his love for singing at two years old when he would join his siblings\u2019 singing lessons. Now, he boasts 1.4 million followers on TikTok. Through the app, he has been able to connect with collaborators, his management team, and fanbase. While creating content online and releasing new music, he is also a junior studying communication at USC.\n\nDouglas says he pulls musical inspiration from everything \u2014 from artists like Ruel to the film \u201cLa La Land.\u201d He discusses using the \u201csad pop\u201d genre as a creative outlet for his emotions. His recent release \u201cTalk\u201d tells a story of betrayal and the inner battle one experiences with the process of confrontation and forgiveness.\n\nAnnenberg Media spoke with Gabe Douglas to learn more about his experiences as an artist through TikTok, studio sessions, and releasing \u201cTalk.\u201d Full transcript has been edited for clarity. Editor\u2019s note: This episode was recorded in April 2023.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: So my name is Gabe Douglas. I\u2019m from Yucaipa, California, and I\u2019m a communication major at USC.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: Yeah, so I\u2019m a singer-songwriter and I would describe my style as, I like to use the terms like \u201csad pop\u201d - kind of intertwining, like the ballady emotional style with more pop-centered production, I would say.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: My inspiration stems from so many different artists. Every time I get asked this question, I struggle to respond because I draw from everything. But I would say I grew up listening to Adele. Adele is a huge influence on me. Everything from Adele to Journey to even more modern-day artists like Ruel, who\u2019s this really cool Australian artist. Bruno Mars. I just, I love drawing from so many different places and putting it into my music.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: So, the beginning for me with music starts when I was two years old. My mom loves to tell me this story over and over again. But when I was two years old, both of my siblings were in music lessons. They would have their music lessons at home. And when it was time for the recital, I was sitting in the audience with my mom. My siblings would go up to perform and apparently, I would be singing their songs along with them in the audience. And so from that point forward, my mom put me in music lessons when I was two, and I would just start doing singing lessons for like 15 minutes a week, which transitioned into a little bit more time each year up until I was probably about nine or ten years old. And I just fell in love with singing. You could not stop me from singing at the top of my lungs at every single hour of the day. So I definitely got a very early start into singing.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: I always knew that no matter what I did when I grew up, that music would be a part of it. But I never really, I guess, considered it to be my main thing until I started performing more at talent shows and things like that. I remember my eighth-grade talent show. I did a cover of \u201cUnsteady\u201d by X Ambassadors and this was my first time actually putting myself out there. I was homeschooled growing up actually until sixth grade, so K through six. I was homeschooled and then in middle school I threw myself into the classroom setting, met a whole lot of new people. And my eighth grade year was the first time I really put myself out there. And I just got overwhelming feedback from all of my teachers, all of my friends. It was crazy to me because that was something that I could actually connect with people on that level. Music was like a bridge that led me to, I don\u2019t know, just so many great things. And so from there on, I have continued to sing and continue to do all that. And then I think the moment that I started to think of it as a career and something I could really do would have been my junior year of high school. I started posting my singing on social media and got an overwhelming response. TikTok, such a weird app. We all know how that goes. But I started posting my singing on TikTok, and I remember I went to bed at night and woke up the next morning and one of my videos had like 30,000 views and it was just insane to me. I don\u2019t know. I just like, jumped with joy. I just remember waking up like, \u2018Mom, look at this. Look at the views, the numbers.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. And yeah, I just kept posting on TikTok, posting on Instagram, eventually just like growing my platforms. And yeah, I would say that it was like junior, senior year of high school that I really started to think of it as like my future.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: Yeah. So I started on TikTok junior year of high school at 16, and it just - I honestly just started it just like I wanted to post my singing covers. I loved covering other artists\u2019 music. And I would post maybe once or twice a week. And as my platform began to grow, I just stuck with it. And it wasn\u2019t until a year or two later that I really got into songwriting. It was hard for me to like - it wasn\u2019t hard, but it was like it was definitely a change for me to transition from like, \u2018Oh, I really like to sing covers to I want to be an artist.\u2019 And it was when I started songwriting that I tried to blend the two because everybody loves hearing stuff that they already know, but it\u2019s a whole new thing trying to introduce something new. Yeah, every person that I\u2019ve worked with so far, for the most part, has been a connection that I\u2019ve made through TikTok, either like reaching out to me through my DMs on Instagram or my entire management team that I work with has been through TikTok. They found me on TikTok and I definitely would not be here without TikTok paving my way for me. So yeah, I\u2019m very grateful for that app also.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: The craziest feeling was I did this cover of a song called \u201cArcade\u201d by Duncan Laurence and just posted it on my TikTok. I remember I hopped in my car, drove to my friend\u2019s house. I was 17, still in high school, and by the time I got to my friend\u2019s house, like 15 minutes later, the video already had like a million views. And at that point that was more likes than any other video I\u2019d ever posted before. And that video kind of just continued to go viral and I got to connect with so many people that I viewed as my idols. People started following me and I was able to communicate with people that I just looked up to for so long. And I think it was just like the craziest feeling. There\u2019s no words to describe that feeling of just like something - I don\u2019t know, just having that type of attention. Because like I would say that I\u2019m more of a shy, introverted person. So, to have that type of audience was just something that I never expected nor could comprehend at the time. I still can\u2019t comprehend that whole thing. It was insane.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: So I released my first song last July. So, July 2022. It\u2019s called \u201cCity Dreams.\u201d And it was actually not the style that I saw myself going down for my first release, but I wanted to release something uptempo, upbeat for my first song. And it\u2019s kind of like pop rock vibes, and it got a pretty good response and I\u2019m really happy with it. And that song\u2019s basically just about graduating high school and moving to USC basically. I wrote it directly after I graduated high school and it just encompasses every single feeling I was feeling at the time: being nervous to move on and leave all my friends behind, but also just being ready for something new and being an adventure seeker and always wanting to just have something to do. So that was that song.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: So it\u2019s interesting because I think my favorite part about writing music is that I get kind of a diary log of how I\u2019m feeling at every single stage of my life. And the music that I\u2019m putting out now is actually still from two years ago, even though I\u2019ve been writing ever since then, because it takes like a whole process for it to come out. But I think that, I don\u2019t know, I think my new music just shows the state of mind that I\u2019m in and how I\u2019ve changed from being in college for two years and I think the new influences that are influencing me, just from the new friends I have and the people I\u2019m surrounding myself with. I think that it\u2019s really cool to just have that music as a physical - well, not a physical thing, but just as something to show how much I\u2019ve changed over time.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: Challenges. Oh, my gosh. I think just the biggest challenge is just being confident in what I\u2019m putting out there and being confident in the music that I\u2019m making and releasing because people are jerks. You know, people are mean. They\u2019re going to say mean things and I guess just having the confidence to be like, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing. I know that I love what I\u2019m creating and I know that people out there love what I\u2019m creating.\u2019 And I can\u2019t let that get to me - just the few people that are being rude and the few people that are like, \u2018Why are you doing this? You\u2019re never going to be successful with it.\u2019 I think just like getting past that hurdle of trust in myself, you know.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: So I wrote the song - I wrote \u201cTalk\u201d with two of my friends in the music industry. Their names are Shayon and Nicci, and they were the first producers, the first people I ever worked with when I started writing. I started writing in high school, but the first thing that I ever created in a studio, anything like that, was with them. And so this session that we did to write the song, I believe was in March of 2021, and the song was inspired by a few different scenarios that I won\u2019t get too into. But yeah, we wrote the song. So the song begins with the voice memo of the very first time we started writing the song. So I thought that was a really cool way to start the song. That was my idea. I was really excited about it.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: So yeah, the song is kind of about a betrayal. Somebody very close to me doing me wrong, and the song was just inspired by that and then goes into kind of its own realm of part of it\u2019s made up, part of it\u2019s not made up. But my most intentional part about songwriting is making sure that it\u2019s relatable to multiple different situations. I\u2019m making it as much for me as I\u2019m making it for the people that are going to listen to it. And so I wanted to make sure that it was something that people could relate to, no matter what they\u2019re going through and to have for when they need a song that matches what they\u2019re going through. And so, yeah, the chorus is \u201cWe should probably talk about what we\u2019ve been through/Tell you all the things that I need to tell you\u201d and that kind of comes from I feel like it\u2019s so important to share experiences and just have somebody that we can tell what we\u2019re going through to. And I guess it\u2019s just kind of an encouragement to be like, we\u2019re all going through something and to not be scared to share it with other people.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: So when I\u2019m writing songs, the inspiration comes from everything. Sometimes it\u2019s from a specific situation that happened to me. Sometimes it\u2019s from a situation that a friend of mine went through. Sometimes it\u2019s from a movie I watched. Like I remember I wrote a song after I watched \u201cLa La Land\u201d one time because I was super inspired by the alternate endings. And I was like, I want to kind of incorporate this into a song. And so it comes from all different types of mood swings and feelings and situations. For \u201cTalk\u201d specifically, it\u2019s yeah, somebody very close to me did something that they said they wouldn\u2019t do and it really affected my friendships and relationships that I had with other people. And the overall message of the song was just like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m not mad at you, but what you did here was really uncalled for and we should talk about it.\u2019 And I\u2019m also just like a non-confrontational person in general. I hate creating conflict. I love just getting along with people and having a good time. But I was like, \u2018Hey, we need to talk about this. Why did you do this? What were your intentions behind it? I know you care about me. I\u2019m not questioning that, but I\u2019m just like, Why would you do this after everything we\u2019ve been through?\u2019 That\u2019s another lyric in the song. And yeah, that\u2019s what it was inspired by. In the bridge - the end of the bridge is \u2018I\u2019d probably forgive you.\u2019\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: I always forgive you because that\u2019s just who I am. I\u2019m going to forgive you, even if you do me terribly wrong. I will probably forgive you.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: So when I was writing the chorus of the song, I wanted to show how I was truly feeling at the time. And one of the lines - It\u2019s like the ABCs where I have to start from the beginning - \u2018And it\u2019s all my fault/I let you into my life.\u2019 That whole part about putting the blame on me. I feel like that was - I feel like I always tend to put the blame on myself in situations like these. And I guess I wanted to show that in the song. How I feel that\u2019s a very relatable thing. Like, \u2018Oh, this is my fault that everything\u2019s happening. It\u2019s my fault that the world\u2019s ending. It\u2019s my fault that this is happening.\u2019 And I guess I felt like that was a very relatable perspective, and I wanted to include that in there.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: So this whole song is honestly just about an inner battle. \u2018I\u2019m not really ready to have this conversation yet/But we should probably talk.\u2019 Is just me fighting with myself with the idea of, like, I really, really need to confront this head-on and talk about this, but I\u2019m also probably going to let it slide for another week because I don\u2019t want to have to deal with it yet, type of thing. And that\u2019s pretty evident all the way throughout the song. And yeah, it\u2019s really just a memento of like, \u2018I am really struggling with this and it\u2019s really tearing me apart and I don\u2019t know how to address it. But I know that I need to,\u2019 And this song is kind of there to be like, \u2018All right, get it together, pull through, get what you need to done and move on with your life.\u2019 And yeah, so the \u2018Every time I look at you, I\u2019m trying to forget/ The only time I can\u2019t is when I\u2019m breathing.\u2019 That line kind of deals with the whole like,\u2019 I will forgive you, but I\u2019ll never forget\u2019 kind of sentiment because I know I\u2019m going to forgive this person. I know that we\u2019re going to move on and we\u2019re still going to have the close relationship that we had before. But it\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m never going to forget what you did to me, even though I will forgive you and we will move on, I guess.\u2019 Yeah, it\u2019s like I\u2019m always going to have a little bitterness in my heart, but I am willing to overlook it for you. You know?\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: I think one of the biggest reasons I love songwriting in general and music in general is cause a lot of times I just feel so disconnected and discombobulated and it can be hard to really identify how I\u2019m feeling in a specific moment. And when I\u2019m writing these lyrics down or I\u2019m creating this music, it lets me actually analyze, \u2018Okay, how am I feeling? What do I think about this situation or what do I think about this?\u2019 And it lets me clearly play out my thoughts so that I\u2019m able to share that. I think even with songwriting in general, for me, that\u2019s my way of expressing emotion. I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019m the most emotional person in the world. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m super depressed or anything like that. But that\u2019s just my way of dealing with those emotions. You know, that\u2019s my outlet for it. So I think that\u2019s also like a lot of people ask me, \u2018Why do you say that you do sad pop music,\u2019 or \u2018Why do you always write the sad songs?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s just the avenue I choose to deal with those emotions.\u2019 I guess I could talk about them a lot or like, that could be my avenue, but my avenue is music. For me, I do like creating happier music too, and stuff like that, but I also express my happiness in other ways through conversations and things like that. But music is my one dedicated form of expressing sadder emotions. So that\u2019s why I yeah, that\u2019s why I create sad music. Yeah no, I love being able to create these emotional songs that people are able to relate to because it really is a really helpful way to cope with things. And music is just such a universal form of media that everybody consumes. And I think it\u2019s just as meaningful to me to be able to create this music as it is for people to be able to listen to it.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \u201cTalk\u201d by Gabe Douglas]\n\nDouglas: So I do sessions weekly - music sessions. Basically, usually every Friday, every Saturday, sometimes Thursday evenings I go and I just create music with producers that I work with. And I think for me, that works really well because I have so many just emotions and things and random things that"}

Dodgers players participate in STEM Day with 500 students. (Photo by Joel Robles) \n\nBy Joel Robles December 09, 2023 at 1:07 pm PST\n\nIn partnership with Science of Sport, the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation (LADF) hosted its annual STEM Field Day Tuesday. More than 500 students from the Compton and Inglewood Unified School Districts participated in activities that connected baseball with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The field day took place at Dodgers Dreamfields at Gonzales Park in Compton, home to Jackie Robinson Stadium and Kershaw\u2019s Challenge Training.\n\nDodgers outfielder Jonny DeLuca and retired Dodger James Loney were in attendance at the event, teaching kids about the game of baseball and participating in fun activities with students. During STEM Field Days, students engage in hands-on learning experiences that enhance the Science of Baseball curriculum. Every year, teachers are trained at Dodger Stadium and receive complimentary classroom kits to integrate these lessons into their classrooms throughout the school year.\n\nOver 26,000 students have benefited from LADF\u2019s Science of Baseball curriculum since 2018. Since 2019, STEM Field Days have taken place every year. Students are split into groups and rotate from station to station, learning about topics like geometry by calculating the area of their strike zone. Students also learned how to balance, how to run the bases, their vertical jump, and more.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re learning different subjects every day and you know you\u2019re always wondering how can I apply this to the real world?

The LADF Science of Baseball curriculum was launched in the Inglewood Unified School District in 2018 as part of LADF\u2019s STEM education program. Students are also exposed to STEM career opportunities in sports through LADF\u2019s collaboration with the Dodgers Performance Science team.\n\nDaniel Cornejo, a 5th grader who participated, said it was motivating to partake in the STEM field day. \u201cI feel very happy and very motivated. It\u2019s very good motivation to become a baseball player,\u201d Cornejo said.\n\nThere are many athletes who have a strong connection to one team they played for. Loney explained how special it is to be part of the Dodger family. \u201cObviously, the Dodgers\u2019 name carries so much positivity, I think any time you associate with them and also with the kids, to try to mold them into whatever that is they\u2019re going to become by giving them the tools and resources to do that.\u201d\n\nFor more information, visit the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation website.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/12/08/kings-los-angeles-is-making-history/", "response": "```\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Kings\u2019 offense is firing on all cylinders; L.A.\u2019s 3.87 goals per game is the second-highest in the NHL and has translated to consistent winning. The Kings went a perfect 3-0-0 since Dec. 1. They first took down the Central Division\u2019s best, the Avalanche, before going to Columbus to meet the Blue Jackets in a comeback thriller. Los Angeles overcame a 3-0 deficit to win in overtime, indicating the Kings\u2019 true resilience down the stretch. On Thursday night, the Kings trounced the Canadiens to win their 11th straight away game to start the season, the most-ever in NHL history. The Kings trail only the Golden Knights for the Pacific Division lead, but have played four fewer games than Vegas. L.A. sits neck-and-neck with the Canucks at 35 points, behind the Golden Knights by four. The difference between the Kings and these Pacific foes, though, is that Los Angeles\u2019 has had fiery momentum as of late. The Kings are 8-2-0 in their last 10 games \u2014 much more convincing than Vegas\u2019 4-2-4 record and Vancouver\u2019s 5-5-0 stretch. Nonetheless, the Pacific Division\u2019s top three are all Stanley Cup contenders and making noise in the West.\n\nGoing back to the beginning of their winning week, the Kings finished off a three-game homestand with a big 4-1 victory over the Colorado Avalanche on Sunday. Considering the Kings fell to the Avs on opening night and Colorado has emerged as a serious threat in the Western Conference, this game was crucial. Los Angeles initially found itself down 1-0 after defenseman Josh Manson scored for the Avalanche in the first period, but the Kings recovered seamlessly. 2020\u2032s No. 2 overall pick Quinton Byfield notched four goals this week and picked up half of them against Colorado. On an odd-man rush in the second period, he precisely tipped in a shot attempt from defenseman Mikey Anderson to tie the game. Byfield would also score the go-ahead goal minutes later off a dish from winger Adrian Kempe. The Kings\u2019 strategic spacing set up Byfield perfectly and has been a major factor in their offensive success. L.A. went on to win 4-1, thanks to scores from Trevor Moore and Drew Doughty. Goalie Cam Talbot only needed to save 20 shots and had a clean game.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 4-3 overtime win on the road against Columbus was indicative of the Kings\u2019 grit and heart. The game started out miserably for the Kings, who found themselves down 3-0 heading into the second intermission It could have been worse too, as they caught some breaks on a couple of Blue Jackets\u2019 goals that were called back. Poor defense and giveaways hurt the Kings \u2014 a second-period turnover in neutral ice that allowed Blue Jackets\u2019 Johnny Gaudreau to score on a breakaway, giving Columbus a 2-0 advantage. On defense, the Kings looked flat-footed, and also allowed goals from Kirill Marchenko and Mathieu Olivier. The third period was a different story. 23 seconds after the puck dropped, Phillip Danault deflected a blue line shot downward that hit the ice and ricocheted into the net. Five minutes later, on a strange play that saw the puck sitting on the goal line behind Columbus\u2019 goaltender Elvis Merz\u1d85ikins for a few seconds, Danault found the back of the net again for his second of the night. Down 3-2, Los Angeles was determined to force overtime, and did, thanks to a goal from Arthur Kaliyev. Overtime was short and sweet. 34-year-old Doughty sent a slap shot top-shelf to cap off the comeback, giving Los Angeles the 4-3 victory. Tuesday marked the Kings\u2019 first time overcoming a three-goal margin in the third period and winning since 2007. Defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov, who only had four assists coming into the game, tallied two against Columbus. The Russian was huge in the Kings\u2019 comeback.\n\nThe Kings finished off the week with a 4-0 rout over the Canadiens. Talbot continued to be a wall between the pipes and saved all 24 shots fired at him. The 36-year-old goalie has the lowest goals against average in the NHL at 1.84 and is second in save percentage at .933. Doughty put the Kings on the board first and the team fed off of his energy. Byfield scored a beautiful goal toward the end of the first period on a play where he went right and then shifted left at the last second, which absolutely fooled Habs\u2019 netminder Sam Montembeault. Byfield found the net again on a second-period power play, and Moore finished off the Kings\u2019 slugfest with a breakaway goal of his own.\n\nLooking ahead, the Kings will head up to New York this week to take on the Islanders and Rangers, before coming back home to host the Jets. While all three teams have been solid this season, the Rangers will be the toughest task \u2014 the Blueshirts have 37 points and lead the Metropolitan Division thanks to winger Artemi Panarin. Los Angeles has found a winning formula on the road and has etched its name in the history books because of its unstoppable run. The Kings haven\u2019t played either New York team yet this season but handled Winnipeg in a 5-1 drubbing earlier in October. Be on the lookout as the Kings\u2019 attempt to extend their record-breaking road winning streak tomorrow against the Islanders at 4:30 at UBS Arena in Elmont, NY.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Hiro Komae)\n\nBy Valerie Fang December 08, 2023 at 4:55 pm PST\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d is a column by Valerie Fang dedicated to the sport of figure skating. Note: This article was written on 12/7 when only the Men\u2019s Short Program competition had taken place.\n\nFigure skating is ending this year with an ultimate showdown featuring the top six single skaters or teams from each of its four disciplines. The 2023 ISU (International Skating Union) Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final is being held at Beijing\u2019s National Indoor Stadium, the same venue that hosted last year\u2019s Winter Olympics.\n\nThe lineup for this prestigious event truly reflects the status of the sport ever since Beijing 2022, with Sakamoto Kaori steadily maintaining her lead in women\u2019s single skating and a crowded, yet level playing field in the men\u2019s event.\n\nMy one disappointment about this season so far is the withdrawal of Kihara Ryuichi and Miura Riku from all of the Grand Prix competitions this season due to Kihara\u2019s back injury. I had high hopes for the history-making pair skaters after their unbeatable past season and witnessing in person how they brought Japan its first Four Continents gold medal in pairs skating.\n\nLet\u2019s wish Kihara a speedy recovery and hope to see the pair on ice for the second half of the season in the new year.\n\nIf you missed some of the six stops that have led up to the Grand Prix Final, here is a detailed summary of the results from each of the previous events.\n\nBefore the new champions emerge this Saturday morning, I present my predictions for men\u2019s and women\u2019s titles.\n\nThe gold for men\u2019s singles will most likely be snatched by either Ilia Malinin (USA) or Adam Siao Him Fa (FRA), and my best guess is that it will still go to Malinin. Yes, I understand that Siao was able to edge out the \u201cquad god\u201d with the free skate of his life earlier during the Grand Prix de France.\n\nBut that happened when Malinin stepped out on the triple salchow, a rare mistake for the young skater who is best known for his jumping prowess. It cost Malinin a positive GOE (Grade of Execution) and very likely the two points that allowed Siao to defeat him.\n\nI believe that this time, Malinin has done what he needed to do to get into his top shape, while it is still relatively uncertain if Siao can maintain his momentum through the end of the Grand Prix series.\n\nBy the way, have you noticed the coincidence? It was on the same ice when the first Olympic attempt of a quadruple axel happened last year.\n\nCheck out this clip from the press conference just after Ilia Malinin made history by becoming the first skater to land the sport\u2019s most difficult jump during a short program. He mentioned that he \u201cfelt the connection\u201d to what went down at the last Winter Olympics.\n\nI also think this really puts in perspective how fast figure skating has been progressing in terms of technicality \u2014 people marveled at the mere attempt at the quadruple axel just last year, but today, a 19-year-old teenager has managed to land the jump consistently.\n\nFor the women\u2019s single skating, my bet is on Sakamoto Kaori. Some of her best qualities as a figure skater are her stability, physical strength and positive attitude.\n\nEarlier this year, Sakamoto confessed that she feels the pressure from the ongoing \u201cquad revolution\u201d waged by the Russian skaters in women\u2019s skating. However, I admire how she is able to steadily improve her techniques without being risky and putting herself in danger.\n\nShe has already gained gold at the two stops she was assigned to. I think there is nothing in her way to do the same at the Final.\n\nAnd finally, let me talk a little about how my delight, Watanabe Rinka, is doing in this season so far. After finishing sixth at Skate Canada, her first assigned stop, Watanabe bounced back to silver at the Cup of China (only 0.75 points away from gold) with impressive tenacity.\n\nLook at this glorious double axel at the opening \u2014 so light, so far, so effortlessly done. It also almost shared the same GOE with Sakamoto\u2019s famous double axel.\n\nI hope Watanabe will keep working on the underrotations and height of some of her jumps, which would likely help her land the triple axel more consistently, as well as her spins.\n\nAlthough she wasn\u2019t able to make it to the Final, I look forward to seeing any improvements in the second half of the season.\n\nThat\u2019s a wrap on In the Loop for the fall semester! Thanks so much for staying with me until the end. I wrote this article while watching the free skate event of the Junior Grand Prix Final.\n\nSo, whenever you see the next edition of this column, I will probably discuss why junior competitions are often more interesting to watch than the senior ones, and why Shimada Mao is such a big deal.\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d runs every other Friday.\n```"}

This game is full of words we can\u2019t understand. To decipher them, all we have to do is talk to the people present and observe their behavior (similar to learning a language by communicating with people of different races in No Man\u2019s Sky). Do you want to feel like the first person who ever learned to speak a foreign language? Then try this game. We play as an outsider who wakes up in a strange tower, where people speak in ways we can\u2019t quite decipher. We observe their body language and surroundings to figure out what the different words mean, write down our guesses, and record them. This reminded me of when I was a kid playing indie games that weren\u2019t in English or Chinese, and I had to guess what each button meant. The more words you decipher, the more you can understand what others are saying, thus solving the problem of the language barrier. When you play Chants of Sennaar, you will find that it\u2019s no easier than a proficiency test. There are five different languages spoken by different races; not only their folk culture and architectural style are different, but also the grammatical structure of the language has great differences: subject-verb-object, inversion (like French verlan), superposition, multiple meanings of one word, root word deformation and many other grammatical structures you can observe throughout the game. Our \u201creading comprehension\u201d ability is not only tested, but the gameplay also requires us to master the \u201cadvanced interpretation\u201d skills \u2013 acting as a translator between the races.

(AP/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nBy Dylan Luden December 07, 2023 at 7:47 pm PST\n\nRemember when the internet blew up and had a field day over Austin Reaves being included in a \u201cbig three\u201d photo with Anthony Davis and LeBron James during media day? The more the season progresses, the more it seems like Reaves belonged in that photo \u2014 the guard hit a clutch step-back three late in the fourth quarter to help the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Phoenix Suns 106-103 Tuesday in the quarterfinal of the NBA\u2019s inaugural In-Season Tournament.\n\nThe matchup dwindled down to the spectacle of Durant vs. James once again, as the two were trading points left and right. The Lakers had no answer to Durant all night as he scored 31 points, shooting a ridiculous 71% from the field. James almost had a near triple-double with 31 points, 11 assists, and eight rebounds. He also had five steals becoming the oldest player in Lakers history to have that many.\n\nWhat was more impressive about his play was that he scored 15 out of the Lakers\u2019 first 19 points in that fourth quarter. The Lakers\u2019 role players had strong performances as well. Austin Reaves is finally starting to get into the groove of things, especially with this In-Season Tournament game meaning a bit more. Besides the clutch shot at the end of the game, Reaves finished with 20 points.\n\nAnthony Davis was a beast in the first half, dominating down low on Suns center Jusuf Nurkic causing him to get into foul trouble early. He finished with 27 points, 15 rebounds and two blocks. Davis also set the tone on the offensive board, something that the Lakers did much better than the Suns.\n\nAnother thing that the Lakers excelled at was forcing turnovers and capitalizing on them. One of the reasons as to why all eyeballs turned towards Durant vs James was because Booker was off all night. Besides shooting 38% from the field, Booker had seven of the Suns\u2019 22 turnovers.\n\nSticking to the Las Vegas theme here for this In-Season Tournament, author Lou Krieger said, \u201cMost of the money you\u2019ll win at poker comes not from the brilliance of your own play, but from the ineptitude of your opponents.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what the Lakers did Tuesday night in Los Angeles. They allowed the Suns to be aggressive and push all their chips in, but the Lakers were ready to take it all away thanks to sloppy passing and the controlling the boards.\n\nGranted, Krieger\u2019s quote also works for the Lakers\u2019 offense. They weren\u2019t entirely brilliant, as the whole team shot 37% from the field and 30% from three. It was also hard to find offensive contributions from anyone else besides James, Davis and Reaves, who combined for 78 of the Lakers\u2019 106 points.\n\nBesides the Lakers\u2019 poor shooting, their height on the boards and disturbance on defense are their greatest aspects. They played to those strengths in order to advance to the semi-finals of the In-Season Tournament.\n\nFor the semi-final matchup, the Lakers will travel to play at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas for Thursday\u2019s matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans.\n```"}

The aging jail survives protests, in-custody deaths and politicians\u2019 promises to shut it down\n\nBy Mohammed Zain Shafi Khan December 07, 2023 at 5:55 pm PST\n\nIn 2021, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 to shut down Men\u2019s Central Jail because of inhumane conditions that some describe as \u201cliving hell.\u201d Now, 26 months later, the jail still stands with no talk of closing it anytime soon.\n\n\u201cMen\u2019s Central Jail should have been closed five years ago, but it is still open due to politics, red tape, and government finances that prioritize funding for the Sheriff\u2019s Office,\u201d Eddie Jones, president of the Los Angeles Civil Rights Association, said. \u201cIt creates jobs for them, but it also fosters a harmful environment.\u201d\n\nJones said he saw incarcerated people sleeping on cold steel, receiving subpar meals, and unable to access the infirmary for medical check-ups during his last visit. Incarcerated people \u201care in pain, hurting,\u201d Jones said. Sheriff\u2019s deputies \u201cjust look at them as if they were nobody.\u201d\n\nOn September 12, a protest took place just before the Board of Supervisors\u2019 meeting, with a crowd rallied outside the Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration in downtown Los Angeles. They demanded the closure of the jail and an end to in-custody deaths. Thirty-two men died in the county jail system this year, with 13 occurring at Men\u2019s Central Jail, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said.\n\nAdvocates for incarcerated individuals have been urging the Board of Supervisors to address the unprecedented deaths and close down the 70-year-old jail. \u201cIt\u2019s like a seaman\u2019s slave ship. That\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s like,\u201d Helen Jones, a community organizer and mother of a person who died in custody, said. \u201cBuilt the same exact way. It\u2019s just a straight dungeon, and it\u2019s horrific.\u201d\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union reports that the Los Angeles Men\u2019s Central Jail routinely denies clean water, functioning toilets, showers, adequate food and essential medication to most incarcerated people, many of whom are awaiting trial and have not been convicted.\n\nDignity and Power Now is a Los Angeles-based grassroots organization founded in 2012 that \u201cfights for the dignity and power of all incarcerated people, their families, and communities.\u201d Ambrose Brooks, one of the group\u2019s organizers and policy analysts, believes that the jail tears communities and families apart.\n\n\u201cI think that if we are trying to build a world based on compassion and care for one another, we have to shut down the jails,\u201d they said. In 2017, the organization successfully pushed the County to cancel a $3.5 billion expansion of Men\u2019s Central Jail, according to the advocacy group\u2019s website. But that was six years ago.\n\n\u201cThere is a lack of political will on the part of the Board of Supervisors. There is also an insufficient budget allocation to fund the pathways that would facilitate jail closure,\u201d she said. \u201cIn L.A. County, there\u2019s an overinvestment in the Sheriff\u2019s Department, the district attorney\u2019s office, LAPD, and the jails themselves.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the LA County Board of Supervisors approved a $43.4 billion budget, with $4 billion going to the Sheriff\u2019s Department. \u201cThe Sheriff\u2019s Department is not interested in the jail closing because it gives them jobs,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nWhen asked whether potential job losses factor into decisions on closing the jail, Sheriff\u2019s Department Commander Paula Tokar said in an email, \u201cIt is difficult to predict what impact the closure of the jail may have on jobs. Currently, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department and our health care partners are experiencing critical staffing shortages.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in jail, you\u2019re supposed to receive rehabilitation, rejuvenation, restoration and revitalization of your life so that when you come out, you\u2019re a better, more productive citizen.\u201d Eddie Jones said. \u201cHowever, those things are not being done.\u201d\n\nJones said the money allocated to the jail could be redirected to educate incarcerated people, help them improve their academic qualifications and gain job skills.\n\nTwo men protesting for the closure of MCJ outside the LA County Board of Supervisors meeting on September 12, 2023.\n\nBrooks, of Dignity and Power Now, said the responsibility for closing the jail falls within the job purview of the elected supervisors. \u201cThe Board of Supervisors has passed the responsibility around. Some of them don\u2019t believe it\u2019s their duty to close the jails. But I think that\u2019s fundamentally false,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Board of Supervisors is the bottom line for the L.A. County budget, so they certainly have control over how the money is spent.\u201d\n\nWhen the board initially voted to close the jail, County Supervisor Hilda Solis, who co-authored the motion to shut down MCJ, said it was time to stop studying the issue and take action. Her office, when contacted after the September protests advocating for the facility\u2019s closure, declined to provide a comment.\n\nThe sole conservative vote came from Supervisor Kathryn Barger\u2019s office. Her primary argument against closing the jail centered on the need for a viable alternative to be in place before making such a decision. \u201cOur office is very persistent in believing that we will need a replacement facility, even if we\u2019re alone in that stance,\u201d Sandra Croxton, a justice deputy with Supervisor Barger\u2019s office, said. \u201cThere are a lot of moving pieces that need to be put in place.\u201d\n\nThe board of supervisors established an Alternatives to Incarceration Task Force to develop a plan to close the jail within one year. However, the task force made no concrete decisions and was absorbed into a newly created department under the county, the Justice, Care and Community Department.\n\nIn response to queries about the closure of Men\u2019s Central Jail, the office shared publicly available links and said it would provide \u201cno further comment.\u201d\n\nThe largest jail system in the world is just under six miles from the University of Southern California. It houses over 20,000 individuals, with Men\u2019s Central housing about one-fourth of this population, and the jail is facing a significant challenge of overcrowding.\n\nThe current state of the jail system reveals an operational capacity exceeding its limits, with an average approximately 2.8 percent and alarming spikes, reaching as high as 16 percent at certain points this year, according to the Vera Institute of Justice.\n\nThe Justice LA coalition demanded that the board shut down MCJ without a replacement facility by reducing its existing population of 13000 to 8500. The capacity of the jail itself is 5640 incarcerated people. Furthermore, their research revealed \u201csqualid and cramped conditions,\u201d with people who have passed through the intake facilities describing them as \u201ca living hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t deserve to be mistreated. They\u2019re human beings. They have civil rights, they have constitutional rights, and they have human rights,\u201d Jones said.\n\nJones believes that grassroots organizations and advocacy groups are doing more than elected officials to address the closure of Men\u2019s Central Jail. Brooks agrees.\n\n\u201cOne of the most meaningful things that has happened recently has nothing to do with the Board of Supervisors. It was a couple of lawsuits brought against L.A. County, one of which challenged what\u2019s called the pre-arraignment bail schedules,\u201d she said.\n\nMore than 40% of incarcerated people in L.A. County jails are pretrial detainees who have not been sentenced for any crimes. Many of them are held in custody because they cannot afford to pay bail.\n\nA lawsuit against L.A. County prompted changes to the bail schedule, which may lead to a reduction in the pretrial jail population, according to Brooks. This change took effect on October 1, 2023.\n\nThe change aims to address the inequality of money bail, replacing fixed amounts with release conditions based on an arrestee\u2019s risk factors, consistent with constitutional considerations and aligning with national precedents in pretrial detention reform.\n\n\u201cWe need to create a bill; all the grassroots organizations, Dignity and Power Now, the coalition, the Los Angeles Civil Rights Association \u2014 we can become a conglomerate, and what we do is create a bill,\u201d said Jones, president of the LA Civil Rights Association.\n\nJones said the governor and Congress also need to get involved. Regarding the Board of Supervisors\u2019 actions, Jones believes there needs to be a new facility to replace the existing one.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much land in Los Angeles, there are so many abandoned buildings and land. It\u2019s big enough to build this facility on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of the city and the county coming together and using those finances to build a new place.\u201d\n\nThis story is a part of the Justice Reporting Project, created through a Journalism class by student journalists in the Annenberg Media Center, with the goal of broadening traditional crime reporting. Edited by Professors Lauren Lee White and Alan Mittelstaedt.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this story referred to incarcerated people as inmates.

The U.S. government has filed an asset forfeiture complaint involving the mosaic where it was seized from a Southern California man. The Los Angeles U.S. Attorney's Office said Friday, May 25, 2018, that the 1-ton (0.9 metric ton) mosaic depicting Hercules is believed to have been created in the 3rd or 4th century and is consistent with mosaics found in Syria, particularly around the city of Idlib.\n\nBy Hali Mecklin December 07, 2023 at 4:00 pm PST\n\nIn August of 2015, art dealer Mohamad Yassin Alcharihi hired an importer to transport a mosaic from Turkey to his house in Palmdale. He sent the broker an image of the piece and described it as stones glued on polyester fabric, worth $391. The photo he sent showed a modern mosaic depicting a fish pond. Alcharihi neglected to mention that the actual item he wanted to import was not this contemporary piece of public art, nor the arts-and-craft project he described, but a looted Syrian antiquity he hoped to sell to the Getty for hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nAlcharihi was eventually arrested on one count of entry of falsely classified goods and was found guilty by a jury in June of this year. He faces a maximum sentence of just two years, but the harm of this crime is far more profound.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bigger problem with the Syrian material that\u2019s been being looted out of that country, and that is that some of the finances are used for terrorism. And that\u2019s the same thing that happened with the Taliban and Al Qaeda,\u201d said Robert Wittman, the former senior investigator of the FBI\u2019s rapid deployment Art Crime Team. \u201cSo that\u2019s where [the antiquities trade] enters the realm of international terrorist crime.\u201d\n\nDespite the international significance of art crimes like Alcharihi\u2019s, they rarely capture the attention of American news media. Unfortunately, this general disinterest discounts the fact that the Syrian antiquity trade threatens national security by funding what are, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace, the deadliest terrorist groups in the world.\n\nThe real mosaic Alcharihi imported \u2014 which US government investigators say was hidden behind dozens of vases in a metal shipping container \u2014 is roughly 2,000 years old. It depicts the moment that the ancient hero Hercules rescued the trickster Prometheus from a liver-eating eagle. It was likely looted from Idlib, Syria, a city that has been ravaged by conflict between President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government forces, resistance fighters and the Islamic State for well over a decade.\n\nIt was also purchased just months after the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution condemning the destruction of cultural heritage in Syria by terrorist organizations, according to a U.S. attorney\u2019s office press release.\n\nAlcharihi emailed the Getty about selling the mosaic after having it valued by an antiquity dealer at $100,000 to $200,000; a government appraisal expert later valued it at $450,000. When federal agents searched Alcharihi\u2019s home in March of 2016, he admitted that he had lied about the object\u2019s financial and cultural significance, saying it was \u201cnot [the broker\u2019s] business to know the details,\u201d according to court documents.\n\nA 2019 study attempting to quantify the value of lost Syrian antiquities found that from just two sites of the over 5,000 under their control, the Islamic State looted an estimated $20 million worth of the country\u2019s cultural heritage. Those further down the supply chain aren\u2019t innocent either; A 2023 report on terrorist financing in the art market found that art dealers like Alcharihi who knowingly participate in the laundering of \u201cblood antiquities\u201d are complicit in terrorist activity, and some are a willing part of the organizations\u2019 schemes.\n\nBecause these crimes rarely involve average citizens and few take the time to elucidate the seemingly abstract connection between the art trade and global conflict, the perpetrators largely evade public scrutiny. This allows them to fly under the radar, and the crimes to continue.\n\nRestorer Daria Montemagni shows a computer-rendered, 3D print-generated replica of a missing part of a limestone male bust, dated between the 2nd and the 3rd century A.D. that was damaged during the Islamic State occupation of the Syrian city of Palmyra, in Rome, Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017. Two damaged sculptures from the National Museum of Palmyra were restored in Rome and will be brought back to Syria at the end of February.\n\nDr. Rami Alafandi, a Syrian native and expert in Middle Eastern art and architecture, says that because of the volume of lost artifacts, it\u2019s difficult to determine which group to blame for stealing an individual object like the Hercules and Prometheus mosaic. This becomes even more muddied by the Syrian government working alongside ISIS. While this looting practice funds terrorism and Bashar al-Assad\u2019s totalitarian regime, Alafandi says that some Syrians experience a disconnect from their culture that prevents them from caring about the lost art.\n\n\u201cWith identity and culture and how people understand their culture, sometimes they don\u2019t feel connected to the culture because of how it\u2019s presented to them. So they don\u2019t care. They want the money. They don\u2019t care about [The government and ISIS] selling the artifacts,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Lydia Harrington is the senior curator of the Virtual Syria Museum, a project aiming to \u201cfill the obvious gap\u201d in the public record of Syrian cultural heritage. She says that a similar disconnect between American and Syrian culture results in a lack of conservation efforts on the US\u2019s end.\n\n\u201c[America\u2019s] attention span is unfortunately pretty short, in forgetting Syria. And followed by the Muslim ban from Donald Trump, you know, it\u2019s just a total rejection of Syria,\u201d Harrington said. \u201cA lot of people in the country don\u2019t think Syria\u2019s important or don\u2019t trust Syrians, even though Syria holds so much of what we consider Western culture, things that I think a lot of Americans feel are the history of democracy.\u201d\n\nSyria is roughly 90% Muslim, according to Harvard\u2019s Divinity School. While anti-Muslim sentiment isn\u2019t uncommon in post-9/11 America, former President Trump\u2019s travel ban on seven majority-Muslim countries, including Syria, reignited and condoned American Islamophobia. According to Hussam Ayloush, chief executive officer of the California chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, anti-Muslim hate crimes occurred on a \u201cmuch greater in scope than we saw after 9/11\u2032\u2032 following Trump\u2019s policies and comments on Islam.\n\nBetween Islamophobia stifling American conservation efforts and the chaos of war, incredible amounts of Syrian cultural heritage have been destroyed over the last decade. The lack of coverage that news media affords this issue has further contributed to the international ignorance of this loss of history.\n\nThis dilemma is not unique to Syria, either. Fine art and antiquities aren\u2019t often protected or highlighted in the media because, for most, there are seemingly bigger problems.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole broad spectrum of people who are really into their culture, to people who don\u2019t care because it\u2019s subsistence living. They\u2019re concerned with where their next meal\u2019s coming from. If you\u2019re a person on the streets, you don\u2019t care about your culture,\u201d said John Pollini, archaeologist and professor of art history at USC.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Art Crime Team, which investigated Alcharihi\u2019s case, recently expanded to two dozen agents and regularly uploads press releases about stolen art and artifacts. According to Special Agents Elizabeth Rivas and Allan Grove, this recent expansion is due to both an increase in thefts during the pandemic and a growing interest in the atypical nature of the cases. However, this intrigue remains contained to relatively niche audiences, relegating stories like that of the Hercules mosaic to the back burner despite their direct connection to the funding of global terrorists and the loss of humanity\u2019s heritage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame because the fact is that it\u2019s heritage crime. It steals the heritage of nations and cultures and boils it down to just the dollar value rather than the archeological, scientific and social value,\u201d Wittman said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what laws are made for.\u201d```"}

Where is all the money going?\n\nMrBeast, one of the most prominent \"charity\" YouTubers, has gained immense notoriety and views for the money he gives away in his videos.\n\nOn December 22, 2014, well-known YouTube prankster Josh Paler Lin uploaded a video entitled \u201cHow Does a Homeless Man Spend $100?\u201d The premise was simple, and followed a long line of social experiment style content that had been one of the main genres of the YouTube platform since its founding in 2005. Lin begins by going up to a homeless man, later introduced as Thomas Kenneth Nickel, or \u201cKenni,\u201d standing on an L.A. road median and offering him $100 cash. Nickel takes the money gratefully and Lin appears to leave. Instead, Lin goes back to his car and follows Nickel with his camera. Nickel enters a liquor store and emerges again with a bag full of what is presumably purchased alcohol. Lin continues to follow until Nickel reaches a park full of other homeless people, where Nickel reveals that in the bag he has food and necessities, which he shares generously with those around him.\n\nThe video touched hearts, gathering over 52 million views since its publication. Donations poured in to further help Nickel escape his situation, all towards a fund that Lin\u2019s channel set up after the video gained viral popularity. The money was supposedly wired to Nickel, jumpstarting a new life for a man down on his luck. It all seemed like a rare bout of good news that the public was more than happy to indulge in, until it soured all at once with the revelation that Nickel had died from \u201cchronic alcoholism,\u201d according to a 2015 NBCLA newscast.\n\nAfter the death of his son, Nickel\u2019s father, William, revealed in an interview with NBC that Lin had included a clause in the wire-transfer contract awarding himself almost $20,000 from Nickel\u2019s fortune to cover \u201cexpenses incurred in feeding, lodging, clothing, legal fees and other related costs\u201d upon signature. The clause had apparently sparked a feud between Lin and Nickel, who refused to sign due to Lin \u201cstealing\u201d from him. William Nickel believed that his son never actually signed due to the disagreement, and as a result believed that Lin still silently held on to all the money, even after his son\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like Josh Lin has been honest at all,\u201d William said when asked if he had anything to say to Lin. \u201cI\u2019m going to sue the tail off of him.\u201d\n\nThe resulting scandal zapped nearly all of Lin\u2019s reputation as a content creator on YouTube, even after he attempted to clear his name in an interview with Fox News. Fox\u2019s investigation also revealed that Nickel had a history of alcohol abuse, with nearly 20 misdemeanors relating to alcohol on his record.\n\nThe story of Josh Paler Lin is not unique. Charity content on YouTube and most recently TikTok has always been a formulaic and nearly surefire way to gain likes and views. Videos such as those from VitalyzdTv and FouseyTube and, perhaps the most recognizable, MrBeast, have all uploaded thousands of hours of generous but equally ludicrous content that shows the creator helping the less fortunate, usually around the metropolitan L.A. area.\n\nWhile these videos are praised for their clear attempts at making the world a better place, none are without disapproval. Critics have called this \u201cphilanthro-tainment\u201d uncomfortable, ungenuine and even sinister. Like all social media content, a large amount of views usually generates ad or sponsorship revenue, and in the case of charity content creators, a portion of this money is funneled back into making more charity content, and the cycle continues.\n\nHowever, with the case of content that is meant to help the unhoused or low-income population, it is easy to see how this process can easily turn into a cash cow scheme without the right caveats in place. FouseyTube, also known as Yousef Erakat, uploaded a video in 2013 entitled \u201cHOMELESS MAN GETS FRESH START!\u201d The video depicts FouseyTube walking up to a man named Matthew on the street and offering him a haircut, new clothes, a hotel and a hot meal.\n\nErakat inserts himself into the video multiple times, attempting to illustrate that he is \u201chomies\u201d with Matthew through an awkward secret handshake and a \u201cswag walk\u201d session. Erakat often is seen asking an uncomfortable Matthew invasive questions as he attempts to enjoy the mild luxuries he has been given, prompting Matthew to look at the camera and tell viewers how long it has been since he last slept in a bed before he can enjoy the one Erakat has given him.\n\nErakat\u2019s delve into the charity trend back when it was first gaining steam on the YouTube platform is fairly innocent overall, if at times naive or ill-advised. However, when compared with his other similar content with unhoused people, it is easy to see a bewildering and sometimes disturbing trend.\n\nHe does everything from pose as a caricatured version of a homeless man on the street, giving money to the people who attempt to give it to him; to filming a child actor posing as homeless to attempt to \u201cput a mirage in front of society\u2019s eyes and see how they handle it.\u201d\n\nWhile the videos mentioned are not recent content, they show that this content, while sometimes not as innocent as it seems, is fueled by sociological trends that can be identified in the same content today. Social Exchange Theory, or the theory that relationships between people are created through the lens of cost-benefit analysis, can be smeared all over many charity videos found nowadays across social platforms.\n\nHumans consider beneficial relationships, according to the theory, to be the ones that cost them the least. This cost is easy to measure with charity content, as it usually is flashed obsequiously before the camera in the form of cold hard cash before being given away. The benefits for these creators, however, are hypothetically infinite. The revenue gained from this process can be easily tracked on a YouTube or TikTok creators account details page, and the process subsequently becomes less about the people and more about the numbers.\n\nThese creators will always receive more than they give. It is their job to keep numbers up. Therefore, it makes sense why people like MrBeast are fairly unapologetic about the process. \u201cHomeless people don\u2019t care if I use them for views,\u201d MrBeast, whose real name is James Stephen Donaldson, said in a video addressing his controversial internet presence.\n\nPerhaps not, considering the line of willing participants he has for nearly all his content. However, he does not just use the homeless and less fortunate for views, he uses them to create branded clothing, an energy bar brand and burger franchises, profiting in infinite, hard-to-trace ways from one source: the poor.\n\nWhile MrBeast helped these people in a major way, they are hardly sharing equally in the profits. \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck, I\u2019m rich,\u201d said MrBeast, donning a full Gucci brand tracksuit to guest on the YouTube podcast TMG. \u201cAre you evil, MrBeast?\u201d Noel Miller, co-host of TMG and fellow Youtuber, flippantly asked the YouTube sensation. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he replied, chuckling and joking with the two hosts. \u201cFuck poor people.\u201d\n\nMrBeast, while only being facetious on the TMG podcast, topped the 2021 Forbes YouTuber list with a whopping $54 million in reported revenue. It is not a crime to end up on this list, but when much of your content is specifically geared towards helping the needy, it is questionable why $54 million is sitting in your bank account, waiting to be spent on perhaps another \u201cSquid Game\u201d reenactment video.\n\n\u201cSquid Game\u201d is a Netflix show meant to show the consequences of a society that does not care about its poor. Creating a way for poorer people to make money by making them reenact this dystopia for a cash prize is bad enough. However, it takes place as an example of a strict formula. MrBeast uses the money gained from these charitable videos to create more outlandish videos with bedazzled titles with buzzword amounts of money involved, like a $1 million prize.\n\nPeople participate for the chance to win the money, but as a result must do everything for the viewer\u2019s entertainment. MrBeast sacrifices some money to the winner, but gains infinitely more by profiting off the desire of all the other losing contestants, who, while sometimes given participation rewards, often end up with nearly nothing.\n\nThe important thing is that these videos are not philanthropy. Therefore the name \u201cphilanthro-tainment\u201d is misleading. Still, these videos are usually not clickbait and they usually do deliver on what they say they will deliver on, with the exception of Lin\u2019s case.\n\nAs a result, they are enigmatic and uncomfortably ambiguous displays of human nature that greet you every time you open your phone. Good is being done, which warms our hearts, but any dip of the toe into what lies beneath the surface of what these videos attempt to depict, and you are greeted with more complicated matters. Money, politics, ego and raw ambition towards growth drive what you are seeing, and you feel like you are not allowed to be offended that it is so, precisely because it does indeed do good.\n\nIt does so much good, in fact, that some attribute the \u201c-tainment\u201d part of \u201cphilanthro-tainment\u201d as a novelty act. Eddy Hogg, a senior lecturer in social policy at the University of Kent in the U.K. told CBC News that the phenomenon \u201cis part of a long tradition of the charity telethon, the idea that celebrities encourage people to give to causes often in quite spectacular ways, whether that\u2019s sitting in a bathtub full of baked beans or jumping out of an airplane.\u201d\n\nIt is true that modern charity content harks upon the cable-televised charity stunts of old. However, unlike MrBeast and other philanthro-tainers, these stuntmen and women never profited off their endeavors. These stunts were instead often sponsored by large, trustworthy charities who would responsibly manage donated funds, without the need for a camera to validate their actions.\n\nGiven the colorful history of content creators attempting to manage donating large amounts of money themselves, a similar solution could be considered today. Creators working in conjunction with real, experienced charities, could be what the philanthro-taiment needs: More emphasis on the actual philanthropy.\n\nThis philanthro-tainment is just an internet phenomenon, and there are many more subgenres of YouTube that warrant further questioning. None of these, however, are as popular and as influential as charity content. Without checks and balances, creators will always go for the bigger and more generous video, using more money and more life-changing charity on film. But we have seen where this leads, back to where the whole trend started nearly 10 years ago, with a young Josh Paler Lin walking up to a homeless man on the street, about to make the worst mistake of his life.\n```"}

On Monday night, the Desert Dogs became the first team in NHL history to beat the previous five Stanley Cup champions in a row. In an extremely close division, Arizona is winning at just the right time and sits just six points out of first place.\n\nIn my personal opinion, the most impressive part of the win streak from the Yotes is the fact that four of the five wins came at home. While home ice usually is an advantage for teams, the Coyotes are in a unique situation. In 2022, the team announced that it would be temporarily moving into Arizona State\u2019s 4,600-seat Mullett Arena until new arena plans were announced. The city of Glendale evicted the Coyotes in 2021 from their arena, as the team was far behind on payments, and the team has yet to find a true home.\n\nDespite financial turmoil and constant jokes about Arizona\u2019s legitimacy as an NHL market, the Coyotes are blocking out all of the noise. Arizona lost three straight games heading into its Saturday date with the defending champions, the Vegas Golden Knights. However, the Yotes didn\u2019t let the recent woes take a toll on its upcoming slate. Arizona went on to shut out the dynamic Vegas offense and take a 2-0 statement win thanks to goals from Clayton Keller and Lawson Crouse. Goaltender Connor Ingram made 34 saves in his perfect outing.\n\nKeller has been Arizona\u2019s best player thus far. The winger has been an assist machine, averaging one point per game through 24 contests. His backhand goal against the Golden Knights in the third period gave the Coyotes the momentum they needed to go on and win.\n\nThe Coyotes continued their winning ways against the 2020 and 2021 Stanley Cup winners, the Tampa Bay Lightning. Wing Michael Carcone, Arizona\u2019s leader in goals this season, lit the lamp twice and helped the Coyotes win 3-1. Ingram was stout once again in net, saving 30 of 31 shots. The 26-year-old\u2019s remarkable 11-3-0 record can be attributed to his outstanding .930 save percentage and 2.23 goals against average.\n\nArizona\u2019s next three wins were offensive masterpieces. The Avalanche, champions in 2022, fell victim to a Nick Bjugstad game-winning goal in overtime to snap Colorado\u2019s four-game win streak. Following the 4-3 win, the Yotes would next rout the 2019 Stanley Cup-winning Blues 4-1. St. Louis was the same team that defeated Arizona right before the streak began.\n\nMonday night\u2019s 6-0 win against the 2018 champion Washington Capitals could quite possibly be one of Arizona\u2019s best wins in franchise history. For the first time since 1986, The Yotes led 5-0 in the first period. For context, in 1986, the Coyotes played in Winnipeg and were called the Jets. Ingram was perfect between the pipes once again, and Keller kept up his goal-generating ways, notching three assists. Center Nick Schmaltz scored twice and 11 different Coyotes tallied points.\n\nThe Coyotes are rolling despite having a tough schedule against recent champions. The Desert Dogs are the epitome of the \u201cus versus the world\u201d mentality, and they are here to prove that narratives surrounding rink issues and annual losing can be combated with finding diamonds in the rough, such as Ingram.\n\nThe Coyotes will look to win their sixth straight when they take on the Flyers tonight at 6 p.m.\n\n\u201cCruel is the strife of brothers.\u201d - Aristotle\n\nFor just the ninth time in NHL history, three brothers were on the ice at the same time. In a thrilling 6-5 win for the New Jersey Devils over the Vancouver Canucks, Luke and Jack Hughes celebrated while their brother, Quinn, endured the agony of defeat.\n\nOn top of this unforgettable experience, all three brothers played well in the game. Jack picked up three points, with two assists and a score. His sweet goal toward the end of the first period showed his precise placement on the ice, as he was able to beat Canucks\u2019 goaltender Thatcher Demko on a backhand chance. Luke, the youngest of the trio, also scored for New Jersey. The former-No. 4 overall pick is looking to break out for the Devils alongside his older brother.\n\nRight off a faceoff on a second period power play, Luke received a pass from Jack and sent the puck to the top right corner of the net to extend the Devils\u2019 lead. Last but not least, Quinn picked up three assists and helped his team overcome a 5-2 deficit. Vancouver knotted up the game at five late in the third period but couldn\u2019t finish with the win. Quinn\u2019s 27 total assists are the most in the NHL.\n\nThe Hughes brothers are extremely talented and will certainly be must-watch players for years to come. While Quinn and Jack have already proven their value for years now, Luke is on the come-up and has extremely high expectations.\n\nSharks up, Blackhawks down\n\nTo pretty much everyone\u2019s surprise, the San Jose Sharks are no longer the worst team in the NHL. Following the Sharks\u2019 5-4 win over the Islanders on Tuesday, San Jose passed the torch to the Chicago Blackhawks, who only have 15 points through 24 games.\n\nAlthough center Connor Bedard has been a force in his rookie season, his team hasn\u2019t been able to back him up. Chicago is toward the bottom of the league for goals scored and allowed, and it looks to be contending for the first pick for the second consecutive season.\n\nIn the Blackhawks\u2019 defense, the season is still early, and there\u2019s plenty of time left to turn things around. But, the addition of Bedard raised expectations for the team, and it simply is not performing at a winning level.\n\nMake sure to keep up with the No. 1 pick sweepstakes as the season progresses.\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

Members of SCC created an art piece to raise awareness and protest the frequency of such violence on Denim Day, 2023. (Photo courtesy of the Survivor Support Community)\n\nBy Corinne Smith December 06, 2023 at 2:32 pm PST\n\nContent warning: The following story contains references to violence and sexual assault.\n\nThe shock and pain of being sexually assaulted \u2014 often by someone familiar, typically in a social setting and likely a complete surprise \u2014 is a gut-wrenching violation. And students and statistics say it\u2019s too common at USC.\n\nOne student group, Survivor Support Community at USC (SSC), is working to create a safe space for survivors \u2014 for healing, safety, community and to speak out against rape culture on campus. Rape culture is defined as an environment where sexual abuse and violence is normalized and downplayed.\n\nAt USC, an estimated one in three undergraduate women experience sexual violence, according to a 2019 survey by the Association of American Universities. This surpasses the national estimate of one in four women. Many students who are violated do not speak out. If they do, they typically experience huge obstacles in reporting, and the perpetrators face few consequences.\n\n\u201cOftentimes, they\u2019re not suspended, expelled, none of that. They\u2019re still here,\u201d said Linda Gist, a junior studying law, history and culture and vice president of SSC. \u201cSo now, not only are they walking around, but [survivors] have to see them, [survivors] have to have classes with them. And if [survivors] say anything to the professor, there\u2019s no paper trail to back [them] up.\u201d\n\nEvery Thursday evening, the group meets to foster a safe space for healing and community. They meet from 7 to 8 p.m. at the University Religious Center and host activities such as art-making, yoga and meditation. Most recently, they ran a workshop on healing and catharsis through sound. The themes of the weekly meetings are posted on their Instagram page. Sometimes there\u2019s discussion and group processing, sometimes it\u2019s just a relaxed gathering and about doing activities together. People of all genders are welcome.\n\n\u201cThe resilience of survivors is incredible,\u201d said Sammie Sorsby-Jones, a senior studying law, history and culture and co-founder of the group. \u201cPeople don\u2019t talk enough about how [being assaulted] affects your academics. College is already really hard, and we\u2019re trying to figure out our careers. And then imagine that you\u2019re sexually assaulted right as you\u2019re figuring out your career, especially when it\u2019s usually younger women in college who are the most affected.\u201d\n\nYounger students, usually women, can be targets for perpetrators, particularly at the start of the year. Violence prevention researchers and advocates refer to it as the \u201cRed Zone.\u201d It\u2019s the time period between orientation and Thanksgiving break, when an estimated 50 percent of sexual assaults occur, when students are acclimating to campus life.\n\n\u201cStories I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s like their first or second weekend at USC, they\u2019ve just moved to a whole new state, maybe from across the country. They\u2019re in L.A., and then they\u2019re sexually assaulted,\u201d Sorsby-Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, oh my god they just got here! Like, how is anyone supposed to get through that? But people do. And it\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nThe Survivor Support Community aims to provide a space for healing and support \u2014 whether an assault has just occurred or in years past \u2014 and works to counter isolation and loneliness.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that we hear people say, \u2018You\u2019re not alone.\u2019 But I think at SSC, that\u2019s something that you feel. You see it and you feel it,\u201d said Grace Miedziak, a senior studying music composition and the group\u2019s president. \u201cBecause everybody that I\u2019ve talked to as a survivor feels isolated in one way or another. So I think that that is one of the most critical parts of this whole thing.\u201d\n\nFounding the Survivor Support Community\n\nSorsby-Jones founded the Survivor Support Community group with her best friend Yi-Ann Li as a sophomore in the spring semester of 2022. She was still processing the trauma of being assaulted in high school and wanted to connect with other survivors on campus for community and empowerment.\n\n\u201cI remember scouring the EngageSC page looking for clubs that were exactly what I wanted SSC to be, and I couldn\u2019t find anything,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I was like, okay, well guess I\u2019m just gonna have to start it myself.\u201d\n\nNow in its second year, the group has grown. They\u2019ve organized healing and advocacy events such as Denim Day, demonstrated in protests to combat victim blaming and raise awareness around sexual violence, created a list of demands to increase safety and prevent sexual violence, assisted survivors in accessing resources, reporting and campus investigations like the Title IX process, and most importantly, make sure people feel supported and not alone.\n\nMembers of SCC paint as a healing practice.\n\nRape culture at USC\n\nThe incidents of sexual violence at USC are anecdotally well-known, though highly underreported. Since August 15, the USC Department of Public Safety (DPS) responded to 20 reported incidents of rape, sexual battery or assault on or near campus, according to the DPS Crime Analysis and Intelligence Unit as of November 21, 2023. These records are posted publicly on the daily crime and fire log. But statistically the true number is much higher.\n\nA record of the sexual misconduct at USC in fall semester 2023.\n\nIn 2023, there were four reports of drugging or \u201croofying\u201d to DPS \u2014 in February, March (reported to have occurred in November 2022), July (reported to have occurred in December 2022) and in August 2023. \u201cRoofying,\u201d or date rape drugging, can cause people who have had only one or two drinks to feel completely inebriated, with memory lapses, nausea, headaches and pain. The types of drugs a perpetrator uses to incapacitate a victim can vary widely. Commonly known date rape drugs are GHB or Rohypnol, which are tasteless and odorless. They act as a sedative to suppress the nervous system \u2014 especially when mixed with alcohol \u2014 and can include muscle relaxants, sleeping aids and anesthetics like ketamine.\n\n\u201cI know some people who ...went out to parties [over Halloweekend], and they were roofied,\u201d said Gist, the vice president. \u201cAnd they were like, \u2018Oh, that happens, I\u2019m fine. I was safe, I had help.\u2019 But that\u2019s very sad. To be, first of all, in that situation and then second of all, to be like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a holiday season. This happens around this time.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe number of friends that I know who\u2019ve been roofied is insane,\u201d Sorsby-Jones added. \u201cI think with the language that we use around sexual assault as a community, it\u2019s like we forget about the perpetrator. And we forget how intentional it is.\u201d\n\nPredatory behavior can look like anything from unwanted advances or touching behavior, to intimidation and coercion, to drugging and sexual assault. According to RAINN, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, nearly 40 percent of sexual violence incidents are committed by an acquaintance, and one third committed by a current or former partner or spouse.\n\nUSC\u2019s Department of Public Safety is required to report each incident to the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\n\u201cWhenever DPS is notified of a sexual assault, we must immediately report it to them, and they assume the investigation,\u201d said DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle. \u201cThe victim of a sexual assault is not required to speak with the LAPD if they choose not to. However, we by agreement, called the Memorandum of Understanding, must involve the LAPD. So we do keep statistics on the number of sexual assaults reported to us.\u201d\n\nNone of the reported incidents of drugging or sexual assault this year occurred at fraternities, according to Carlisle.\n\nAnnenberg Media made a public records request to LAPD for the number of reported incidents of drugging and sexual assault on campus and surrounding area. The LAPD has not yet responded.\n\nStudents walk across Hahn Plaza between classes.\n\nBut students say the majority of incidents of drugging and sexual assault go unreported. And, the SSC group says those attitudes are also seen in the culture around sex and dating at USC.\n\n\u201cRape is not an aberrant act. It is a direct extension of the patriarchy that already exists within our community. It is the most violent extension, but it\u2019s still a part of it,\u201d Sorsby-Jones said. \u201cAnd normalization,\u201d Miedziek added. \u201cIt\u2019s almost become like a normal thing for people to see those statistics.\u201d\n\nThe office of USC President Carol Folt declined an interview for this story but provided statements emphasizing the need for students to report incidents of sexual assault, and providing support and resources to do so.\n\n\u201cUSC recognizes that sexual assaults are often underreported, both at the university and historically across the nation...We are working hard to identify and remove anything that can be perceived as a barrier to reporting, and to ensure that students have a wealth of resources available in an effort to support students and encourage increased reporting.\u201d\n\nRape and sexual violence are pervasive in a culture of sexism, where men try to assert power over others through negative stereotypes, sexual competition, derogatory attitudes and enforcement through violence. While women are disproportionately harmed by sexual violence, there are men and vastly underrepresented populations of the LGBTQ+ community who are assault survivors as well.\n\nSexual assault includes any unwanted touching, coercion or forcing sexual acts, where ongoing consent is not given.\n\n\u201cSomething that a lot of people aren\u2019t aware of is that with rape culture, and rape in general, it\u2019s more than just a lack of listening to the word \u2018No,\u2019\u201d said Gist. \u201cI think people forget that it comes in a lot of different forms: it\u2019s not being enthusiastic, it\u2019s the fact that you didn\u2019t say yes. It\u2019s [that] you\u2019re inebriated, and you were not sober enough to actually consent. I think people don\u2019t realize that there\u2019s so much that goes into it.\u201d\n\nThey discuss how men need to take a more active role in preventing predatory behavior and sexual violence. In conversations with men about these issues on campus, SCC members say that often the response is defensive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not accusing you, I\u2019m just making you aware of what\u2019s going on and trying to really bring you into the conversation to prevent these things,\u201d Gist said, reflecting on her conversations with men. \u201cYou\u2019re saying it\u2019s not you. That\u2019s fantastic. But it can\u2019t just not be you. It can\u2019t be your friends. It can\u2019t be people you associate with. It\u2019s not enough to just not be doing these things, you have to be going further. Be a part of the conversation, actively play a part.\u201d\n\nFraternity scandal and disaffiliation\n\nSSC was founded in the wake of the Sigma Nu fraternity scandal in September 2021, which broke the silence on pervasive drugging and sexual violence at USC fraternity parties and drew national media attention and criticism.\n\nFrom September to October that year, the USC Department of Public Safety received at least 13 reports of drugging and nine reports of sexual assault at fraternities. After weeks of student-led protests, the USC administration admitted there was a \u201ctroubling delay\u201d in reporting the assaults. Admin later suspended five fraternities, citing a public safety hazard. Those fraternities were Chi Phi, Delta Tau Delta, Kappa Sigma, Phi Kappa Tau and Sigma Nu.\n\nStudents protest outside the Sigma Nu fraternity in October 2021.\n\nIn August of 2022, eight more fraternities joined the original five and disaffiliated from USC -- Beta Theta Pi, Kappa Alpha Order, Lambda Chi Alpha, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Alpha Mu, Sigma Chi, Tau Kappa Epsilon and Zeta Beta Tau. Collectively, they formed their own coalition, the University Park Interfraternity Council.\n\nTwo more joined later, Phi Delta Theta and Phi Sigma Kappa. Currently, 15 fraternities have ended their formal relationship with USC.\n\nThe University Park Interfraternity Council member fraternities are recognized and supported by their respective national chapters, as well as the National American Interfraternity Conference.\n\nAt USC, the fraternities manage their own safety protocols, prevention education and guidelines, according to an email the group sent to Annenberg Media.\n\n\u201cWhen I started SSC, it did feel easier to talk about sexual assault as a campus community, because that is what everyone had been doing that fall of 2021,\u201d Sorsby-Jones said. \u201cBecause there was a certain amount of assaults that triggered the Clery Act, and the university had to send out an alert about it. And so when that alert was sent out, people couldn\u2019t ignore it anymore.\u201d\n\nThe Clery Act is a consumer protection law that requires colleges and universities that receive federal funding share certain crime incidents in a publically available log, notify of ongoing threats, and campus policies to protect safety. Sexual assault is one of those crimes.\n\nAcademic institutions are required to enter the crimes into the log within two business days of receiving a report the incident occurred.\n\nStudents march in protest with a sign reading \u201cAbusers will be held accountable.\"\n\nWhile the Sigma Nu fraternity scandal and disaffiliation ignited serious campus attention, Sorsby-Jones says the outcry did not change the common occurrences of drugging and sexual assault, especially at fraternity parties.\n\n\u201cThe next Sigma Nu has already happened, it is happening,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was nothing particularly special about that fraternity or those instances of sexual assault. It\u2019s just that people found out about it. And so it\u2019s really hard to see the campus go back to apathy, when like, I know that things are still happening.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the office of USC President Carol Folt said they are committed to working with students and student groups, providing ongoing training and support for the reporting process.\n\n\u201cWe regularly communicate with the University Park Interfraternity Council advisor about the importance of holding trainings, although we are unable to require unaffiliated groups, including disaffiliated fraternities, to engage in mandatory trainings. We encourage community members to raise their concerns with the University Park IFC as well as to hold them accountable on this important topic,\u201d the university statement said, in response to questions from Annenberg Media about this story.\n\nAll USC students also are required to complete modules on sexual assault prevention, Folt\u2019s office noted. In addition, there were more than 100 prevention education trainings and presentations for more than 5,100 students in the last academic year.\n\n\u201cWe hold students and affiliated student groups accountable through investigative and disciplinary processes explained in the USC Student Handbook and policies managed by the Office for Equity, Equal Opportunity, and Title IX,\u201d the statement read. \u201cIndividual student members of both affiliated and unaffiliated groups can and will be held accountable for policy violations but we are not able to hold unaffiliated groups accountable under these processes.\u201d\n\nThe disaffiliated fraternities, now part of the student-led University Park Interfraternity Council (UPIFC) did not grant requests for an interview, but they did respond to questions via email.\n\nCharlie Neuenschwander, vice president of health and wellness for UPIFC, said the council works to promote the safety of their member community and guests and \u201censure members are educated and informed.\u201d\n\nHe said they have partnered with Real Talk, an organization which provides education on sexual violence prevention.\n\n\u201cEach chapter has had a workshop educating their members on what sexual assault looks like, how to prevent it, and how to keep their peers accountable,\u201d he said.\n\nNeuenschwander said UPIFC has not had any formal or informal reports of drugging or roofying incidents this semester from law enforcement or USC.\n\n\u201cIf we did, those would have been referred to USC Community Expectations or LAPD for investigation, as UPIFC does not adjudicate individual allegations of sexual violence,\u201d Neuenschwander said. \u201cIf they have such reports of drugging or sexual violence, they should immediately report to the proper authorities.\u201d\n\nSorsby-Jones made a point to say SCC is not anti-Greek and they have members who are active in Greek life. However, \u201cthe incidences of survivorship are higher in Greek life,\u201d she said.\n\nResearchers have found among undergraduates, sorority women are 74% more likely to experience rape.\n\n\u201cNow that [many fraternities have] disaffiliated, you can only hold a person accountable, which we already know often does not work out,\u201d Gist said. \u201cSo by holding the institution [fraternities] as a whole accountable, it\u2019s more recognition for survivorship.\u201d\n\nStudents protest outside fraternities in October 2021.\n\nBreaking the silence, again\n\nSorsby-Jones said that time period broke the silence for survivors, who were able to talk about where, when and how they were assaulted. She\u2019s concerned that this semester more and more students have been absorbed back into the party culture and are less willing to talk about such predatory behavior.\n\n\u201cWhen that was more public, people were more willing to talk about their experiences,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember people being like, \u2018Oh, I was roofied at that frat, and that frat, and that frat,\u2019 and it became this campus awakening. And to see that fade away, again, has been really sad.\u201d\n\nSorsby-Jones explains that, though the official university protocol is to report acts of violence, many survivors don\u2019t feel safe doing so, for fears of the reporting process, and facing social retaliation or isolation.\n\n\u201cAnd so not only have you been assaulted and violated, but you\u2019re also losing your social support system,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that is literally the worst possible thing that could happen. And so I think that\u2019s where a lot of the silence comes from, is that fear of social pushback, or victim blaming.\u201d\n\nReporting and support services\n\nOne tool for survivors who may be confronted with pushback is an encrypted online reporting database, provided by the non-profit Callisto. It allows survivors to document their experience, creating a time-stamped record of their assault in case they do decide to report. Ninety percent of campus assaults are committed by serial offenders, according to Callisto\u2019s website. They offer a matching tool where survivors can enter unique identifiers of their perpetrator, to help identify a serial offender. If two or more people from any college enter the same identifiers, the matched survivors receive free and confidential legal options counseling with a third-party attorney to help facilitate coordinated action.\n\nStudents can also opt to report sexual assault to USC in two categories: anonymous or private. Here is a detailed guide for survivors to report an assault, and to access resources including a 24/7 Confidential Advocates hotline, Counseling and Mental Health, Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services and the Office of the Ombuds.\n\nThe Confidential Advocates program offers 24/7 services through the Student Health Center. An advocate will accompany a survivor or arrange transportation to receive medical care, including a rape exam. They can arrange for aftercare services including reporting, counseling and campus accommodations.\n\nSurvivors can opt to file a report under Title IX, which legally requires college campuses to ensure that someone who experiences sexual violence or sex-based discrimination is given access to support services.\n\nAt USC, resources can include housing or parking accommodations, a Mutual Avoidance of Contact directive, academic accommodations and potential sanctioning if the accused party"}

Ron DeSantis and California Gov. Gavin Newsom took the debate stage on Nov. 30, and the USC Center for the Political Future hosted a watch party joined by students and political experts.\n\nOn Nov. 30, the USC Center for the Political Future (CPF) hosted a watch party for the much anticipated showdown between California Governor Gavin Newsom and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, with a post-debate discussion with industry professionals.\n\nThe shimmering guest list included Robert Hertzberg, the former California State Senate Majority Leader and former speaker of the California State Assembly; Kellie Hawkins, a Partner at Englander Knabe & Allen (EKA) and the former Chief Operating Officer of the National Health Foundation; Jeff Harris, the founder of JB Harris Consulting; and Effie Sanders, the Vice President of Civic Engagement and Economic Partnerships at USC.\n\nThe packed room was buzzing with excitement since its dinner reception. \u201cThe Great Red vs. Blue State Debate\u201d was to be a rare but interesting faceoff with DeSantis trying to hold together a  floundering  presidential run and Newsom being knee deep in  shadow campaign  rumors.\n\nThe watch party was kicked off with a brief discussion on what to expect in the debate. They expressed some initial thoughts and hopefulness for the event. Hawkins said that viewers would be looking at two very different sides of the political spectrum. She added that viewers were fortunate to have the ability to do so and said that \u201cthis is the beauty of this country \u2014 agree to disagree.\u201d\n\nHarris echoed this sentiment: \u201cThis is a chance for something new and to reset. The level of political discourse in this country is at an all time low.\u201d He added that he hoped to see discussions with evidence on the key issues Newsom and DeSantis divide on.\n\nHertzberg agreed that it would be a debate on very different ways of governing. Like Harris, Hertzberg highlighted the importance of evidence as well and hoped to see a civilized discourse. He also told the room that he knew Newsom \u201creally well\u201d and spoke with the governor\u2019s communications director before the debate.\n\nHe gave two reasons as to why Newsom wanted to do a public debate with DeSantis. First, \u201c[Newsom] is pissed that members of his party are not fighting.\u201d The second reason was that \u201che wants to be president.\u201d Noting the impact Newsom\u2019s recent trip to China had, Hertzberg added that \u201che loves the international stage. He will run.\u201d\n\nThe last question for the guests before the debate started was why people were interested in watching it. Hawkins pointed to the debate\u2019s rarity and how the stakes for them were different. \u201cNewsom is in a unique position because he has nothing to lose but putting forward his hopes and dreams. But it is still a campaign for DeSantis and he has to be more careful [with what he says],\u201d Hawkins said.\n\nHighlights from the first segment: The governors started taking jabs at each other right out of the gate. On the first issue of the increasing  out-migration  in California, DeSantis described Newsom as \u201cslick and slippery\u201d and someone who would \u201ctell a blizzard of lies.\u201d\n\nNewsom claimed he was here to \u201ctell the truth about the Biden-Harris record\u201d and to compare and contrast with DeSantis\u2019 record. Pointing to Florida\u2019s contentious legislation such as its abortion and book ban, Newsom fired back: \u201cYou and President Trump are really trying to light democracy on fire.\u201d He also quickly followed up with a witty remark. \u201cThere is one thing that we have in common. Neither of us will be the nominee for our party in 2024,\u201d Newsom said.\n\nDeSantis characterized California\u2019s economic policy as \u201cBiden-Harris agenda on steroids.\u201d Newsom responded that DeSantis \u201cjust celebrated Bidenomics this week\u201d with the  $28 million dollars  that went into Florida from the  CHIPS and Science Act . Again, he insisted that he was \u201cproud of the work Biden and Harris has done.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of unemployment rates, DeSantis accused Newsom as a \u201clockdown governor,\u201d saying that while he kept  Disney  open and saved a lot of jobs, Newsom \u201chad Disney closed inexplicably for a year.\u201d But, Newsom seized the opportunity to transition to the topic of COVID-19. He listed Florida\u2019s own lockdown policies and said to DeSantis: \u201cDonald Trump laid you out on this. You followed science. You followed Fauci.\u201d\n\nIt was an attack on  DeSantis\u2019 statement  made earlier this year at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library: \u201cWe refused to let our state descend into some type of \u2018Faucian\u2019 dystopia, where people\u2019s rights were curtailed and their livelihoods were destroyed.\u201d\n\nDuring each ad break, the Center for the Political Future invited students to share their thoughts on each governor\u2019s performance so far. One of the students said that \u201cNewsom is charismatic, but I don\u2019t think he is directly answering the questions as he should be doing.\u201d A second viewer echoed his critique on the Democrat: \u201cHe needs to be addressing the graphics more directly. He needs to be able to cite those numbers from the top of his head.\u201d\n\nAnother student noticed that Sean Hannity, an anchor at FOX News and the moderator of this debate, was letting DeSantis interrupt Newsom more and that when they were both talking, the camera focused on DeSantis. Considering how, during the pre-debate discussion, evidence was mentioned to be an important factor for the debate, one student said that \u201cit\u2019s a complete trainwreck because they can\u2019t even agree on facts. The biggest winner is Donald Trump and the biggest loser is the American people.\u201d\n\nHighlights from the second segment: Newsom argued that DeSantis did not have the credibility to discuss immigration policy when he tricked and gave  false promises  to Texas migrants and threatened to  invade Mexico .\n\nNewsom made another snap on DeSantis. \u201cYou are trolling folks and trying to find migrants to play political games. [You are] trying to get some news and attention, so you can out-Trump Trump. And by the way, how\u2019s that going for you,\u201d Newsom said. This is a reference to DeSantis  falling behind Trump  41 points in polls in his own state.\n\nDeSantis repeated \u201cthat\u2019s a lie\u201d and \u201cyou are just making things up\u201d six times when the Democrat pointed out that DeSantis supported amnesty, which has been fact-checked by The New York Times as  misleading . Hannity hurriedly cued the second ad break after this exchange.\n\nOne student observed that the question on immigration policy was a \u201cKennedy segment\u201d for DeSantis from the moderator. It was a reference to how  President John F. Kennedy  effectively used the medium of television to project a carefully constructed public image. Many others were worried about possible bias in the data presented by FOX News, such as the numbers on California\u2019s unemployment and COVID-19 death rates. However, another student countered this concern: \u201cThese are numbers and it is what it is.\u201d A third reaction pointed out that DeSantis \u201cdid not offer any specific policies.\u201d\n\nHighlights from the third segment: Newsom attacked DeSantis\u2019 stance on gun control by jabbing at the newly signed  HB 543 , which has legalized carrying concealed weapons without permits in Florida. He said he agreed with Fred Guttenberg, the father of Parkland shooting victim  Jaime Guttenberg , that \u201c[DeSantis] is weak, pathetic and small.\u201d\n\nOn the topic of gun control, DeSantis circled back to blue state migration losses. \u201cPeople are leaving California in droves largely because public safety has collapsed,\u201d DeSantis said.\n\nAfter Newsom said that Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa all had significantly higher murder rates, both governors once again started talking over each other with Hannity rushing them to move on. Their conversation became unintelligible.\n\nDeSantis argued that California has made it harder for law-abiding citizens to protect themselves but become easier on the felons, crediting it as another reason for people moving out of California.\n\nNewsom responded that it was \u201cinsulting\u201d for DeSantis to \u201ctalk down on the great state of California and the great city of Los Angeles\u201d when he was running for president.\n\nDuring the third ad break, the watch party had more discussions on Hannity\u2019s bias. A student noted that \u201cevery graphic paints Florida in a better light and they are way too broad.\u201d One student said that the numbers were from \u201cleftist websites\u201d such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the issues brought up by DeSantis indeed exist in the city. Another student found characterizing CDC as a left-wing website disturbing. Others argued that the questions never put DeSantis in a position where he needed to defend himself. An audience member was hoping that, when responding to California\u2019s \u201c higher crime rate, \u201d Newsom could mention the fact that his state also has a higher population. Another student followed up on the issue of perceived bias: \u201cDeSantis does not let Newsom defend by asking him a follow up question.\u201d\n\n\u201cNewsom is firm that gun control saves lives while DeSantis does not have a clear stance,\u201d noted another viewer before the debate resumed.\n\nHighlights from the fourth segment: On the issue of book ban, Newsom said that he did not like how DeSantis demeaned the LGBTQ community and the people he did not agree with. He also added that \u201cthis is a core value that distinguishes the values of my state and, frankly, the vast majority of Americans against the weaponization of education.\u201d\n\nHannity asked DeSantis whether the  book ban  was a state or local issue. When DeSantis answered that it was local, Hannity said \u201cthat\u2019s all I want to know,\u201d and quickly moved on.\n\nOn the issue of abortion, Newsom did not directly answer if he would absolutely stick with any restrictions on abortion. Hannity kept pressing Newsom on whether he would support \u201ca seven, eight, or nine month abortion ban if the mother\u2019s life is not in jeopardy.\u201d\n\nNewsom in turn asked DeSantis if he would sign a six week national ban. When DeSantis wouldn\u2019t answer, Newsom told the audience directly that \u201che will sign that  extreme six week national ban .\u201d\n\nHannity asked DeSantis to explain his \u201cthinking behind [the abortion ban]\u201d and whether it was for \u201creligious reasons\u201d or \u201cscientific reasons.\u201d\n\nHannity asked for the governors\u2019 responses to Biden\u2019s \u201csignificant cognitive decline.\u201d He wanted it to be a lighting round with one word answers. DeSantis claimed that Newsom secretly agreed as well and \u201cthat\u2019s why [Newsom] is running a shadow campaign.\u201d Newsom defended Biden by saying: \u201cI will take Joe Biden at 100 versus Ron DeSantis any day of the week at any age\u201d and that the decrease in inflation and increase in jobs are \u201cfacts you don\u2019t hear on FOX News.\u201d\n\nOne of the students said \u201cDeSantis is winning so far because everything is framed in his favor.\u201d Another student commented on Newsom\u2019s performance by saying that there was a missed opportunity for him to talk about clean air and emission policies. Others also said that it was better Newsom did not talk about public transportation because it is bad in LA.\n\nHighlights from the fifth segment: The two governors talked over each other for a long time when Newsom attacked DeSantis on his previous threat to  fine the Special Olympics  $27 million dollars over vaccine mandate. DeSantis concluded by creating another soundbite \u2014 describing his opponent as a \u201cliberal bully.\u201d\n\nDeSantis pulled out the viral \u201c poop map \u201d of human feces found on the street in San Francisco. As the streets in San Francisco were lined with  Chinese flags  when President Xi visited the city earlier, DeSantis noted that they were willing to clean up the streets for \u201ca communist dictator\u201d but not for their own sake.\n\nNewsom stressed that \u201cHamas is a terrorist organization and they need to be eliminated\u201d when DeSantis said that \u201cIsrael has every right to defend itself. Biden should not be knee capping them in any shape or form.\u201d\n\nDeSantis pressed Newsom again on his recent trip to China, saying he \u201cwould not go to China and grovel in front of Xi like Gavin Newsom did.\u201d\n\nNewsom asked when DeSantis would drop out and  give Nikki Haley a shot  at taking down Trump. He also insisted that he confronted Xi on human rights and fentanyl.\n\nAs the showdown concluded, the watch party dived into its post-debate discussion. The group first had a conversation on the statistics presented by FOX News throughout the debate. \u201cYou can say anything without context. Newsom fell into that trap without his own graphs and charts,\u201d Harris said.\n\nHawkins brought a different view on the data by saying that it would be a lot better if Newsom went beyond numbers and talked more about his governing philosophies. She said that he missed that opportunity.\n\nHertzberg noted that Newsom is intellectually curious and he wanted to understand different points of view. However, the California governor was in a tough position as there was also \u201ctension with Biden and Harris.\u201d Referring to the many times when Newsom supported President Biden during the debate, Hertzberg said \u201che is out there to show he is for the president.\u201d He also helped the group analyze some of the hesitations observed in his instincts while responding to questions. \u201cHe had both California and the president to protect, but DeSantis had less to consider,\u201d Hertzberg said.\n\nKamy Akhavan, executive director of the CPF, shared that it was \u201chard to say there is any winner\u201d and that \u201cin each candidate\u2019s mind, they probably felt like they did what they needed to do and that they were successful.\u201d According to Akhavan, DeSantis needed to display presidential potential. \u201cHe\u2019s speaking to a FOX News audience without any competitors on stage. For him, it was a moment to shine,\u201d said Akhavan.\n\nHe then pointed out that Newsom needed to come across as a defender of California values, such as pro-choice, pro-women and a supporter for Biden and his foreign immigration policies. Akhavan  said that DeSantis was able to use rhetoric and persuasion tactics that were effective with FOX audiences when talking about cultural and immigration issues. And Newsom performed his best when \u201che tried to be seen as the more civil of the two candidates and the champion of left-leaning values,\u201d  Akhavan  said.\n\nThe next notable debate featuring DeSantis is the  fourth Republican presidential debate  in Alabama, where the governor will vie with Nikki Haley for the second place in polling.\n```"}

(AP/Mike Stewart)\n\nBy Victor Kevorkian\nDecember 05, 2023 at  5:57 pm PST\n\nAlabama tops Georgia to win SEC Championship, 27-24\nThe Bulldogs came into this one winners of 29 straight, but Nick Saban\u2019s squad prevailed against his former assistant\u2019s powerhouse. Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe was precise in the biggest game of his collegiate career, making plays with his legs when needed and finding his receivers throughout. Milroe completed 13 of his 23 pass attempts for 192 yards and two touchdowns, adding 29 yards on the ground. Milroe\u2019s performance saw him winning the MVP of the game.\n\nRunning back Roydell Williams led the team in rushing with 64 yards and a score, while receiver Isiah Bond led the way with 79 receiving yards. Alabama jumped out to an early 17-7 lead, but Georgia did not roll over. The Bulldogs clawed their way back, cutting the lead to one possession multiple times throughout the second half. However, Milroe and the offense did a great job of sustaining long, methodical drives ending in scores, keeping Georgia off the field and holding on to win the SEC.\n\nGeorgia quarterback Carson Beck commanded a solid offensive effort, completing 21 of his 29 pass attempts for 243 yards. Beck found the endzone on a quarterback sneak early in the fourth but also lost a fumble. Running back Kendall Milton led the ground attack with 42 yards and two touchdowns, while tight end Brock Bowers caught five balls for 53 yards. The Bulldogs were in this one throughout, and Beck\u2019s fumble on a miscued handoff could be looked back at as the turning point.\n\nAlabama (12-1) wins the SEC and punches its ticket to the college football playoff. The Tide finish at No. 4 in the rankings and will face Michigan in the semifinal. Their big win against the back-to-back champions boded well in the committee\u2019s decision despite their early loss to Texas. Georgia (12-1) drops five spots to No. 6 in the rankings. In what seemed like another potential championship run for the Bulldogs, they seemed to catch Alabama at the wrong time. Georgia is set to face Florida State in the Orange Bowl.\n\nWashington escapes with win vs. Oregon in Pac-12 Championship, 34-31\nThe final Pac-12 Championship did not disappoint, as two conference powerhouses rematched for a potential spot in the playoff. The second matchup between these teams gave a sense of deja vu, as the Huskies prevailed by three points once again.\n\nWashington got major contributions from a multitude of positions, starting from its signal caller. Quarterback Michael Penix completed 27 of his 39 pass attempts for 319 yards, one touchdown and one interception. While Penix\u2019s stats aren\u2019t necessarily jaw-dropping, the Heisman candidate continuously made tight window throws to keep the Huskies offense moving, granting him the game\u2019s MVP award.\n\nPenix\u2019s favorite target on the day was receiver Jalen McMillan, who caught nine balls for 131 yards. Washington\u2019s best pass catcher Rome Odunze also eclipsed 100 yards, as the Huskies passing attack seemed unstoppable. Star running back Dillon Johnson also got in on the action, carrying the ball 28 times for 152 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nPenix and the offense were able to run the clock down late in the game, preventing any chance at an Oregon comeback. The Ducks also had an efficient offensive performance. Fellow Heisman candidate Bo Nix added to his impressive statistical season, throwing for 239 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. Nix also led the team in rushing with 69 on six attempts, while Tez Johnson led the team with 68 receiving yards.\n\nWhile Nix had a nice day and the Ducks were able to keep things close throughout, the difference in this one was time of possession and third-down efficiency. Washington out-possessed Oregon 37:08-22:52 and converted on 66% of their third downs compared to the Ducks\u2019 30%.\n\nWashington (13-0) finishes at No. 2 in the CFP rankings and will face Texas in the semifinal. A truly dominant season for the Huskies in the last year of the Pac-12 made for their first playoff appearance since 2016. Oregon (11-2) dropped to No. 8 in the rankings. An elite roster made for one of the most exhilarating teams in college football. But it seemed the Huskies had their number all year, handing them both of their losses. Oregon is set to face Liberty in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nFlorida State takes ACC crown in slugfest vs. Louisville, 16-6\nAn unfortunate stretch of injuries at the quarterback position made for a rocky end to the season for Florida State. The Seminoles were forced to turn to true freshman Brock Glenn in relief of Tate Rodemaker who suffered a concussion last week vs Florida. Glenn was put in a tough spot for his first true action at the collegiate level and struggled to get things going.\n\nHe completed eight of his 21 pass attempts for 55 yards, finding just three receivers on the day. The Seminoles\u2019 inability to throw the ball effectively forced them to turn to their ground attack, where they found success. Running back Lawrance Toafili ran for 118 yards and one touchdown on 18 carries.\n\nToafili was one of the only positives for the Seminole offense, resulting in him being awarded the game\u2019s MVP. Although the Seminoles failed to get the ball rolling, the Cardinals were even worse. Quarterback Jake Plummer completed 14 of his 36 pass attempts for 111 yards and an interception.\n\nRunning back Jawhar Jordan led the team with 52 rushing yards while receiver Jamari Thrash led all receivers with 57 yards. A sluggish day on offense saw the Cardinals fail to find the endzone. It was Florida State\u2019s defense that propelled them to this victory.\n\nThe unit put up impressive numbers across the board. They allowed just 188 total yards, 10 first downs, and sacked Plummer seven times. The Cardinals went a combined 3 of 21 on third and fourth downs.\n\nDespite the win, Florida State (13-0) dropped to No. 5 in the rankings and became the first undefeated Power Five champion to miss the playoff, an unfortunate end to the season, as the Seminoles were essentially a playoff lock had Jordan Travis remained healthy. The committee clearly took note of the offense\u2019s dip in production throughout the past couple of weeks and simply felt they were not a top-four team anymore.\n\nThe \u2018Noles are set to face Georgia in the Orange Bowl. As for Louisville (10-3), they finish at No. 15 in the rankings and will face USC in the holiday bowl.\n\nMichigan routs Iowa in Big Ten Championship, 26-0\nThe Wolverines showed why they are deserving of the country\u2019s top spot in Jim Harbaugh\u2019s return to the sideline. Michigan\u2019s offense did not have its greatest performance of the season, but did what was needed to escape Indianapolis with the Big Ten title.\n\nQuarterback J.J. McCarthy had an efficient showing in a game where not much was asked, completing 73% of his passes for 147 yards. McCarthy\u2019s top target was receiver Cornelius Johnson, who hauled in nine catches for 64 yards.\n\nRunning back Blake Corum was the Wolverines\u2019 most efficient playmaker, carrying the ball 16 times for 52 yards and two touchdowns. As for Iowa, this game saw its offense converting for just seven first downs and totaling 155 yards.\n\nQuarterback Deacon Hill completed 18 of his 32 pass attempts for 120 yards. His top target was Addison Ostrenga, who hauled in seven balls for 50 yards. The Hawkeyes\u2019 top rusher was Leshon Williams who rushed for just 25 yards.\n\nIowa\u2019s inability to run the ball led to seven punts and just 23 minutes of possession. Michigan\u2019s defensive efforts were led by Mike Sainristil, a receiver turned defensive back. Sainristil forced two fumbles and was flying all over the field to make tackles.\n\nHe was awarded the game\u2019s MVP. Michigan (13-0) finishes the 2023 season atop the college football world at No. 1 in the rankings. They will face a hot Alabama team in the semifinal. Iowa slides to No. 17 in the rankings and will face Tennessee in the Citrus Bowl.\n\nTexas takes care of Oklahoma State to win Big 12, 49-21\nTexas captured its fourth Big 12 title and its first since 2009 in the program\u2019s last year as part of the conference. Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers saved his best performance of the season for the championship bout.\n\nEwers completed 35 of his 46 pass attempts for 452 yards, four touchdowns and one interception. Texas had two receivers hit the 100-yard mark in this one. Adonai Mitchell led the team, catching six balls for 109 yards and one touchdown.\n\nTight end Ja\u2019Tavion Sanders followed suit, hauling in eight of his nine targets for 105 yards and a score. The Longhorns were able to establish a ground attack as well, rushing for 198 yards on the day.\n\nRunning back Keilan Robinson led the way with 75 of those yards and two touchdowns. Oklahoma State\u2019s offense failed to stay on the field, ending the game with under 20 minutes of possession.\n\nThat being said, Cowboys quarterback Alan Bowman put together a solid statistical performance. He threw for 250 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. Bowman\u2019s favorite target on the day was Brennan Presley, who hauled in nine balls for 93 yards and one touchdown.\n\nPerhaps the most disappointing aspect of Oklahoma State\u2019s offense was the inability to get Ollie Gordon going. Gordon is one of the most dynamic backs in the country, but was unable to make an impact on the ground. He rushed 13 times for just 34 yards, albeit he did find some success in the passing game with 54 yards through the air.\n\nTexas (12-1) find themselves ranked No. 3 in the final rankings. Although a one-loss team, the committee felt the Longhorns had an impressive enough resume throughout the season to net them a spot in the playoff over undefeated Florida State.\n\nThe Longhorns are set to face Washington in the semifinal. Oklahoma State finishes at No. 20 in the rankings, and will face Texas A&M in the TaxAct Bowl.\n\nLiberty beats New Mexico State in Conference USA Championship, 49-35\nWith the game knotted up at 35 apiece heading into the final frame, a 14-0 fourth quarter from the unbeaten Flames propelled them to a win over the Aggies in their inaugural season as members of the C-USA.\n\nLiberty quarterback Kaidon Salter continued his efficient 2023 campaign with a great showing. He completed 20 of his 25 pass attempts for 319 yards and two touchdowns. Salter was not done there.\n\nHe led the team in rushing with 165 yards, a season high, while adding another score on the ground. Receiver CJ Daniels led the team in receiving, tying his season high in yards with 157 and one touchdown.\n\nAs for the Aggies, they saw two quarterbacks in action on Friday. Diego Pavia started the game under center and was putting together a very solid performance. He completed 11 of his 16 pass attempts for 188 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nHe also added 45 yards and a touchdown on the ground, leading the team in rushing. Pavia was forced out of action in the third quarter after apparently reaggravating an elbow injury.\n\nBackup Blaze Berlowitz entered the game in relief of Pavia, and although he put up a solid statistical performance, there was a clear dropoff in NMSU\u2019s offensive pace. Berlowitz completed 10 of his 19 pass attempts for 134 yards, one touchdown and one interception.\n\nTrent Hudson was the Aggies\u2019 leading receiver with seven catches for 112 yards and two touchdowns. Liberty (13-0) finishes the year ranked No. 23, and is set to face Oregon in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nUnranked New Mexico State (10-4) will face Fresno State in the Isleta New Mexico Bowl.\n\nSMU upsets Tulane in AAC Championship, 26-14\nSMU cracked the College Football Playoff Top 25 rankings for the first time this season with an assertive second half in the American Athletic Conference championship game.\n\nMustang quarterback Kevin Jennings made his first career collegiate start in this one, putting up subpar numbers in the win. He completed 19 of his 33 pass attempts for 203 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.\n\nJennings added 63 yards rushing to his day. SMU\u2019s leading rusher was running back Jaylan Knighton, who carried the ball 15 times for 75 yards and one touchdown. Tight end RJ Maryland led the team with 56 receiving yards.\n\nAn opening play strip sack placed the ball on the 1-yard-line for the Green Wave offense, who quickly took a 7-0 lead. The offense would struggle from then on out, scoring just 7 more points in the next 59 minutes.\n\nQuarterback Michael Pratt didn\u2019t have the day he was hoping for, throwing for 238 yards, one touchdown and one interception. Pratt was sacked seven times and the offense was forced to punt nine times on the day, totaling only 12 first downs.\n\nTulane struggled to get anything going on the ground, rushing for just 31 yards. The only bright spot on the Green Wave offense was receiver Yulkeith Brown, who caught five balls for 90 yards and a score.\n\nSMU (11-2) entered the rankings this week at No. 24. They are set to play Boston College in the Fenway Bowl. Tulane (11-2) exits the CFP rankings for the first time this season. The Green Wave will take on Virginia Tech in the Military Bowl.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Terence Holton December 05, 2023 at  2:33 pm PST\n\nThere\u2019s a new sheriff in town for the USC defensive staff, and his name is D\u2019Anton Lynn. Formerly the defensive coordinator at UCLA under Chip Kelly, Lynn led UCLA to one of the top defenses in the country, including the No. 2 rush defense, No. 11 total defense and No. 3 in tackles for loss.\n\nIn his first media availability since being hired by USC last week, Lynn discussed his plans for the future with this USC team, and how he\u2019s excited for a fresh start across town. Lynn\u2019s schemes were a popular conversation point throughout the press conference, and he made it clear that it is about the team.\n\n\u201cFrom a schematic standpoint, my thing is, it\u2019s all about the players to put them in the best position to play fast and make plays.\u201d Lynn said. \u201cReally excited to get this next recruiting class in to see what this teams going to look like next spring and what is the best way to put this USC team in the best position to win.\u201d\n\nOne of the largest problems which has plagued the Trojans for quite some time is tackling. Lynn was keen to highlight the importance of bringing down the opponents.\n\n\u201cTackling is always the thing you have to emphasize. I\u2019m a big believer in [that] you have to emphasize fundamentals over and over again, and at all positions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that you have to do all throughout the year, whether it\u2019s drills or showing guys good examples and bad examples on tape, it\u2019s just something that has to be emphasized.\u201d\n\nLynn outlined that when looking for those guys to make those stops at all levels of the defense, he is looking for adaptable and all-around players \u2014 someone who can do more than one thing.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing across all positions is versatility. It\u2019s hard in the way the game is played now in college and the NFL to just do one thing,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cYou want versatile guys up front who can align in different spots. From a linebacker and secondary standpoint, same thing \u2014 versatility and football instincts, guys who are very passionate and love football.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest questions about Lynn as defensive coordinator is who he will keep on from the defensive staff. Lynn told the media he has yet to meet much of the staff; he has been on the recruiting trail the past couple days.\n\nWhile it is unclear which coaches will stay and which will go, Lynn has a very clear goal in mind for this Trojan team.\n\n\u201cI want to play the best defense possible. I think that we have every reason to, and one of the reasons I was so excited about this job is because I felt that, after my conversations with Coach Riley and Jennifer Cohen, they are passionate about playing really elite defense here at SC by any means necessary.\u201d\n\nWith the Trojans departing for the Big Ten in 2024, many questions are circling about whether USC will be able to handle the rough-and-tumble style the midwestern teams play with. Lynn is well aware and knows he has to put this defense in the best position to win.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see different styles in the Big Ten, and that\u2019s something where we have to do a good job in the spring, making sure we\u2019re seeing the stuff we\u2019re going to see in the fall,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cWe have to make sure that we\u2019re preparing our guys all throughout the spring, that way in Week 3 against Michigan, we\u2019re not showing them this for the very first time.\u201d\n\nThe Alex Grinch defense era is over, and D\u2019Anton Lynn has been handed all the keys to the defensive kingdom. While he has all of the offseason to prepare, Lynn\u2019s new philosophies and schemes may need to take shape quickly as in 2024, the Trojans take on LSU, Michigan, Penn State, Washington and Notre Dame, all strong opponents.\n\nLynn won\u2019t coach USC in its upcoming Holiday Bowl game against No. 15 Louisville; however, he will likely be watching, analyzing what needs to change on the defensive side.\n```"}

(Photo by Carly Rieger)\n\nBy Lily Coleman December 04, 2023 at 7:43 pm PST\n\nUSC football head coach Lincoln Riley held a Zoom press conference on Monday to discuss staff changes, the Trojans\u2019 upcoming bowl game and the team\u2019s future development. After a disappointing 2023 football season, USC football looks ahead to the future with a new defensive coordinator and a bowl game against Louisville. However, Riley announced that junior quarterback and reigning Heisman trophy winner Caleb Williams will not play in the postseason matchup.\n\nOn December 1, USC announced the hiring of D\u2019Anton Lynn as the team\u2019s new defensive coordinator following the firing of Alex Grinch. Lynn had the same role at UCLA this past season and previously spent nine seasons coaching in the NFL. \u201c[Lynn] stood out to me from the first conversation that we had and just his vision for, obviously the job he\u2019d done at UCLA, but for what this could be here,\u201d Riley said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for people that are going to come in and make us better ... but also people that have a shared vision of USC, what this program means, what it can be and what it needs to continue to climb. I think he\u2019s a rising star in this coaching profession.\u201d\n\nRiley explained that there will be a lot of philosophical changes implemented as the USC coaching staff works to rebuild the Trojan defense. \u201cI think from a philosophical standpoint, we\u2019re going to teach [and] we\u2019re going to develop in a different way to make sure that we fit exactly what we want to be defensively,\u201d Riley said. \u201cEverything here is going to be done with the defensive line first.\u201d Riley has high hopes for the future of USC\u2019s defense. \u201cSomething that we\u2019re staying focused on is building the best defensive staff in America here,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s somebody here or somebody outside the program, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to build.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the college transfer portal opened today, and Riley shared what that means for his team. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to be targeting a couple of positions in the portal. I think it\u2019s going to continue to taper down, and that has kind of been our goal from the beginning,\u201d he said of the program\u2019s strategy in utilizing the portal. Riley talked about his goals for developing the program as a whole, beginning two years ago with establishing team culture and a roster with championship potential. He explained that, overall, the team is focusing on signing high school players, continuing to develop current players, and supplementing with players from the transfer portal.\n\nRiley also expressed his excitement for the upcoming DIRECTV Holiday Bowl that will take place at Petco Park in San Diego on December 27. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for us that we\u2019re getting to be able to play the game here in our home state, [and] playing the game in an area that historically has meant very much to USC football,\u201d Riley said. Historically, USC has acquired some of its top players from San Diego, including names such as Heisman-winning tailback Marcus Allen, running back Reggie Bush, and linebacker Junior Seau. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity that we need to recognize and we need to be ready to take advantage of,\u201d Riley said.\n\nDespite having two bye weeks this season, this will be the longest gap between games for USC \u2014 the Trojans last played on November 18. Riley discussed the advantage of having an increased number of practices, which will be beneficial for not only the upcoming game, but also for the continued development of players for next season. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a handful of guys that don\u2019t play in this game, and the excitement for us is now that this game doesn\u2019t count in the redshirt rules for some of these players, it\u2019s going to be an opportunity in a lot of ways for these guys to really step up,\u201d Riley said. \u201cYou almost feel like, in a way, it\u2019s kind of halfway to the last game of this year and kind of halfway to the first game of next year in some ways, and a tremendous opportunity for these young guys.\u201d\n\nPutting the bowl game aside, Riley discussed what will go into looking for potential new quarterbacks as Caleb Williams has yet to announce whether he will stay at USC or go to the NFL draft. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look in the [transfer] portal at some quarterbacks, we\u2019ll see how that thing unfolds,\u201d he said. \u201cI like the guys that we have in the room, but also, you always have a responsibility to the team to continue to look at potential people that can come in and make our room better and make our team better. I\u2019m not ready to say that we would for sure do anything, we\u2019re just going to take a look and evaluate, and see how it all unfolds.\u201d\n\nLynn will address the USC media for the first time on Tuesday at noon in a Zoom press conference. Annenberg Media will have a story to follow.\n```"}

(Photo by Jonathan Martin)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nDecember 03, 2023 at 8:37 pm PST\n\nNo. 6 USC women\u2019s basketball kept its perfect streak alive following a 89-58 routing of San Diego Sunday afternoon at Galen Center. The Trojans were riding high after a 41-point victory over Cal Poly on Tuesday night and kept the momentum going against the Toreros.\n\nFreshman guard JuJu Watkins, the recipient of all three Pac-12 Freshman of the Week awards thus far, continued to shine with 30 points and eight boards. Graduate guard McKenzie Forbes also made an immediate impact with seven quick points right out of the gate. Forbes went on to tally 12 total points and had five assists.\n\n\u201cI was in the right spots, and I\u2019m encouraged to take those shots when I\u2019m open,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on pushing the pace, so I just felt like I was really trying to hone in on that, and I think that resulted in a couple of easy buckets.\u201d\n\nDespite Forbes\u2019 early success, the Trojans and Toreros were neck and neck in the first quarter. San Diego\u2019s fast-paced offense responded accordingly when USC would score, which kept the Toreros in the game in the first 10 minutes. At the end of the first quarter, USD only trailed by six.\n\nWatkins\u2019 electric start to the second quarter allowed USC to run away with the game. The Trojans went on a blistering 19-5 run to start the quarter, and Watkins\u2019 ability to score at all three levels gave USC the edge it needed to take a double-digit lead. Her scoring ability was complemented by her elite court vision, which helped her set up teammates for scores.\n\n\u201cThere really is not a lot that [Watkins] doesn\u2019t have. I think what we\u2019ve all been the most impressed with is to see her learn and adjust on the fly,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cMaybe her best gift is that people like playing with her, and she is a teammate that brings a lot of excitement and joy to the team.\u201d\n\nJunior forward Rayah Marshall had a double-double with 20 points \u2014 a season high \u2014 on top of 12 rebounds. Her defense in the paint was elite, as she was able to record four blocks, too. The Trojan defense, as a whole, flustered the Toreros. San Diego didn\u2019t score in the final 1:42 of the first half.\n\n\u201cOur team is really hungry and eager to win,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWe never underestimated the team and when they came up with that momentum, it was like a moment of reality for us, so we just embraced that and stepped up to the challenge to compete.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 key to success was scoring in the paint. USC\u2019s whopping 60 points in the key were generated by shiftiness and intelligent playmaking. Redshirt sophomore guard Taylor Bigby\u2019s punishing and-one with 7:18 remaining in the game was indicative of the Trojans\u2019 physicality inside.\n\nWatkins capped off her dominant night with a 3-pointer from the wing to achieve her fifth 30-point game of the season thus far.\n\n\u201cI thought we did a lot of the things we wanted to do,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously on a quest to be as good as we can possibly be, so there\u2019s a lot of things we can clean up. But, that was a good day for us.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s fast-paced offensive attack is showing no signs of slowing down and is constantly dismantling opposing defenses. The Trojans scored 17 points on fast breaks and fed off of the Toreros\u2019 18 turnovers. And, when USC\u2019s offense couldn\u2019t initially produce points, it used its size to grab offensive boards and rack up second-chance shots. Almost a quarter of the Trojans\u2019 points came off of second opportunities.\n\nThe Trojans (7-0) will have a week off before hosting UC Riverside next. The Highlanders will head west to take on USC next Sunday at 3:30 p.m. at Galen Center.\n```"}

The Cardinals had a stellar 2023 season, where they finished as the ACC runner-up after losing to No. 5 Florida State 16-6 in the ACC Championship Game and will enter Petco Park with a 10-3 record under first-year head coach Jeff Brohm.\n\nThe Cardinals also have the 16th-best defense in the country in yards allowed per game. This will be the first-ever meeting between USC and Louisville.\n\nUSC has taken part in the Holiday Bowl three times and has a 1-2 record in the bowl. The Trojans beat Nebraska 45-42 in 2014, lost to Wisconsin in 2015 by a score of 23-21 and lost to Iowa 49-24 in 2019. This will be Louisville\u2019s first time as a Holiday Bowl participant.\n\nThe Trojans started the season ranked at No. 6 in the preseason AP Poll and won their first six games of the season. However, they lost five of their final six, the lone win being a 50-49 win over the California Golden Bears in Berkeley on October 28. USC has been unranked since November 5 and has not received votes in either the AP or Coaches polls since November 19.\n\nIn addition to falling out of both Pac-12 and national championship contention, USC also fired defensive coordinator Alex Grinch on November 5 following the Trojans\u2019 loss to then-No. 5 Washington, who clinched a spot in the College Football Playoff after defeating Oregon 34-31 in the Pac-12 Championship Game on Friday. As the Huskies and Ducks played in Las Vegas, USC head coach Lincoln Riley introduced D\u2019Anton Lynn as Grinch\u2019s replacement at defensive coordinator.\n\nIn addition to questions about the defense, USC also has a lot of players who will likely opt out of the Holiday Bowl in order to avoid injuries and to prepare for the 2024 NFL Draft. Redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd announced earlier on social media that he will declare for the NFL Draft, while senior wide receiver Brendan Rice has accepted an invitation to the Senior Bowl. Junior quarterback Caleb Williams still has yet to decide whether or not he will take advantage of his final year of college eligibility or play in the Holiday Bowl, as he told the LA Times that he will make a \u201cgame-time decision\u201d when he is ready. The deadline to declare for the NFL Draft is January 15.\n\nThe Trojans look to end their disappointing season on a high note when the Holiday Bowl kicks off on December 27 at 5 p.m. PST on FOX.\n```"}

(Photo by Luis Perez)\n\nBy Keely Roy\nDecember 03, 2023 at 4:02 pm PST\n\nLast year, Cal took down the Trojans to clinch the National Championship at the Golden Bears\u2019 home pool. Last night, the Trojans finally had their chance to avenge that loss at Uytengsu Aquatics Center. As expected, emotions were high in the heated rivalry rematch. After a tough fought battle, the USC Trojans fell to the California Golden Bears 10-9 in the Men\u2019s Water Polo NCAA National Semifinals. Cal moves on to the Championship game where they will look for a chance to claim their third straight national title.\n\nThe Trojans had matched up against Cal three times this season already before the high-stakes rematch. The Golden Bears had come out on top their first two meetups, but the Trojans edged out the Golden Bears 13-12 in Berkeley to win the MPSF tournament less than two weeks ago. Both teams sailed through the first round of the tournament with their eyes set on this highly anticipated second round matchup. On Friday, No. 2 seeded California blew past Fordham in the first round while hosts, the third-seeded Trojans also advanced with ease in an 18-10 victory over San Jose State in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe National Semifinals kicked off on Saturday with No. 1 UCLA taking on No. 4 Princeton at Uytengsu Aquatics Center. The Bruins defeated Princeton 17-13 to secure a spot in the national title game. Then as the sun started to set, fans got ready for the most anticipated game of the day where the Trojans took on the Golden Bears in a heated rivalry match under the lights.\n\nThe match was an intense one from beginning to end, as the two teams battled it out in a high-scoring, physical match. The Golden Bears got on the board first, with junior attacker Max Casabella opening the scoring in the first period. Not long after, fellow junior attacker Jake Howerton joined him on the scoresheet. Casabella and Howerton would go on to combine for seven of the Bears\u2019 10 goals. On the other side of the ball, graduate driver Massimo Di Martire led the Trojans with three goals on the day.\n\nThe Trojan defense did a good job shutting down one of Cal\u2019s major offensive threats: reigning NCAA MVP, senior center Nikolaos Papanikolaou, who had racked up 37 goals in only 17 games played heading into the NCAA tournament. Both teams stepped up big on defense, with USC\u2019s redshirt freshman goalkeeper Bernardo Herzer totaling 10 saves and Cal\u2019s senior goalkeeper Adrian Weinberg coming up with 11 saves on the night. The intensity of the game was evident in the 26 total exclusions that kept fans on their toes all game. There was one controversial exclusion called on USC\u2019s sophomore utility Andrej Grgurevic with only 33 seconds left in the game that had Trojan fans particularly outraged.\n\nThe Golden Bears led 4-2 at the end of the first period, but the Trojans bounced back in the second period, bringing the score to a one-point differential. It was not until the final minutes of the final period of play that the Golden Bears were able to separate. With under two minutes to go and a National title match berth on the line, the Trojans and Golden Bears were at a stalemate \u2014 tied 9-9. Cal regained possession of the ball and it landed in the hands of Cal sophomore attacker Marci Szatmary. Instead of looking to pass the ball to a more senior player closer to goal, he decided to go for it and ended up netting the game winning goal on a deep shot. The last minute of regulation proved to be even more eventful as the Trojans had multiple attempts at an equalizer with time expiring before being added back onto the clock.\n\nThe Bears held onto their lead following Szatmary\u2019s late heroics, defeating the Trojans 10-9 to advance to the National Championship title match. Cal will go on to face No. 1 seeded UCLA in the National Championship game today at Uytengsu Aquatics Center at 3 p.m. Tickets can be purchased online or at the gate and the game will also be streamed on ESPNU.\n```"}

The Trojans battled early but ultimately let the Bulldogs run away with the game in the second half to win 89-76.\n\nThe Trojans put together an explosive offensive performance in their last showing against Eastern Washington, but they struggled to generate points early in Saturday\u2019s matchup. Gonzaga went on a 13-0 run for an early 15-2 lead, and USC seemed stunned. It took almost five minutes of play for the Trojans to score their second bucket of the game; they were 1-of-8 from the floor before that point.\n\nIn the middle of the first, USC struggled with shot selection and passing, but eventually began to find their footing. With the Trojans down 26-15, fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis took an offensive foul that provided a shift in momentum towards USC. On the next play, graduate forward DJ Rodman scored on an assist from freshman guard Isaiah Collier. Another stop led to a 3-pointer from junior guard Kobe Johnson on the next possession.\n\nUSC scraped its way back into the game, holding Gonzaga scoreless for 3:30. The Trojans kept it close through most of the first half, but a 5-0 Gonzaga run brought the Bulldogs\u2019 lead back to eight with 2:43 left. Collier assisted on back-to-back 3-pointers (one to Ellis, one to Rodman) as USC pulled closer. But, the Trojans struggled with their free throws, shooting only 1-for-8 from the line in the period. Gonzaga led by seven at the half.\n\nUSC got off to a slow start in the second half, and Gonzaga opened up a 15-point lead. Collier and Ellis brought the deficit to nine, but Gonzaga pushed the lead back up to 15 toward the middle of the half. The Bulldogs eventually opened up an 18-point lead with just over five minutes left in the game. It was their largest lead of the night.\n\nUSC showed some signs of life late, but the game was never close after that. The Trojans cleaned up their free-throw shooting in the second half, shooting nearly 78%. But USC\u2019s shooting woes from beyond the arc proved to be critical. The Trojans shot only 27% from 3 for the game and allowed Gonzaga to shoot 54%. USC was also outgained on fast break points, scoring only eight in comparison to Gonzaga\u2019s 21.\n\nThrough their first seven games this season, USC held opponents to 40% shooting from the field. Against Gonzaga, it allowed the Bulldogs to shoot 52%. Ellis had a team-high 28 points with seven rebounds and four assists. Collier led the team with six assists and contributed 14 points. No other Trojans scored in double digits.\n\nThe Trojans return to the Galen Center for a matchup against Long Beach State on Sunday, December 10 at 1 p.m.\n```"}

(Photo by Wesley Chen)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson\nDecember 02, 2023 at 8:51 pm PST\n\nUSC\u2019s matchup against the Pittsburgh Panthers on the Panthers\u2019 home court was emblematic of the last two seasons of women\u2019s volleyball for the Trojans. They ride and they die on the back of senior outside hitter Skylar Fields. It was the latter for USC against Pitt, as the Trojans fell in four sets to the Panthers to end their season in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nDespite a team-high 21 kills \u2014 no other Trojan had more than six \u2014 Fields also committed 10 attacking errors. USC was 1-3 this season when Fields had double-digit errors.\n\n\u201cI attack every game the exact same way,\u201d Fields said in the postgame press conference. \u201cI\u2019m gonna give my all to my teammates. And it\u2019s a team game, so I can\u2019t do everything. And we fought, we battled and we\u2019ve been doing that every single day.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans seemed in control of the game through early parts of the match, as they took home a hotly contested first set 25-23. USC went on a 5-1 run to close out the opening action with help from two of Fields\u2019 kills. Redshirt sophomore middle blocker Tyrah Ariail supplemented Fields\u2019 play with four of her six kills coming in the first set.\n\n\u201cClearly we can play at that level, we just have to sustain it,\u201d head coach Brad Keller said. \u201cI knew what we were going up against, we had a great game plan. They\u2019re the No. 4 team in the country right now. There\u2019s a reason, they\u2019re good. And I thought we responded really well to the beginning of it, we just didn\u2019t sustain it. But we can play toe-to-toe with anybody.\u201d\n\nPitt started out the second frame on a 4-0 run of their own, but the Trojans were able to claw back and take a 16-12 lead, poised to take a two-set lead. But the Panthers showed why they are the No. 4 team in the country to earn a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nPart of the reason Fields and the Trojans had so many attack errors was because of the height Pitt possesses on its roster, giving them the ability to contest and block USC attacks. The Trojans had 10 attack errors in the second set \u2014 seven of which came off of Pitt blocks \u2014 and the Panthers finished the set on a 13-4 run to take it 25-20. Three of Fields\u2019 attack errors came during that Pitt run.\n\n\u201c[The Panthers] responded well and we just didn\u2019t quite respond enough to get back and lost that rhythm,\u201d Keller said. \u201cIt can happen like that, it can happen pretty quickly and it did and we were trying to figure it out and we just couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPitt\u2019s graduate middle blocker Emma Monks, with eight blocks across the four sets, and freshman opposite hitter Olivia Babcock, with six blocks, led the way for Panthers as they were able to show off their height against a shorter USC team. Five different Pitt players are listed at 6-foot-4 or taller, compared to just two such players for the Trojans.\n\nUSC just could not match up to Pitt\u2019s height, as Monks and Babcock dominated the net for the Panthers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a puzzle,\u201d Keller said. \u201cWhen they start blocking you or they\u2019re taking your lines, you\u2019re gonna start hitting more across, you\u2019re gonna tip out the setter. You\u2019re just trying to create different scenarios.\u201d\n\nDespite fighting hard in the first two sets, USC could not keep it up in the final two as the Panthers won both 25-18. The third round of action was particularly devastating for the Trojans, as Pitt ran out to an 18-7 lead in the set, which was too much for USC to overcome.\n\nThe Trojans were able to close the gap to seven points by the end of the frame, but the 11-point deficit and Pitt\u2019s .481 hitting percentage was just too much of a hole.\n\n\u201cA team like Pitt, when you get on runs, they\u2019re not a team that you can just come back on,\u201d sophomore libero Gala Trubint said. \u201cThey\u2019re a good team, when they get on a run they\u2019re gonna keep that run going unless they\u2019re stopped ... I think we let off the gas a little in the third set and it might\u2019ve cost us in that one.\u201d\n\nIt was more of the same in the final set of the game, as Pitt took a 2-1 lead and never trailed again, although the Trojans did tie it up at multiple points.\n\nThe Trojans are likely losing Fields to graduation, but are still built for success in the coming years. 12 of USC\u2019s 19-person roster are freshmen or sophomores eligibility wise, with three of them starting out on the court in the first set for USC. The Trojans also signed four high school prospects in their most recent recruiting class, further bolstering the team next year.\n\nNow USC will try to improve on its success from this season, but in a new conference as the Trojans are moving over to the Big Ten in 2024.\n```"}

Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw four touchdown passes, running back Kyren Williams racked up over 200 all-purpose yards and two touchdown receptions, and Los Angeles outrushed Arizona 228 yards to 73 in a wire-to-wire win.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 37 points scored was the team\u2019s highest offensive output this season. Prior to Sunday, they had eclipsed the 20-point threshold just four times on the season, with the most recent instance coming all the way back on October 15.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, the Rams\u2019 defense also enjoyed a strong day, led by two sacks from rookie defensive lineman Kobie Turner. After surrendering 43 points in an embarrassing blowout loss to the Dallas Cowboys last month, Los Angeles has now held its opponent to 20 points or fewer in three consecutive games.\n\nOn Sunday, they will look to continue that streak against a Browns team that has major uncertainty at the quarterback position. After losing starter Deshaun Watson for the season, Cleveland has rotated between journeyman PJ Walker and rookie Dorian Thompson-Robinson over the past two months. This week, they also signed longtime veteran Joe Flacco to give them an additional option at the position.\n\nAccording to reports, it will be Flacco under center for Cleveland Sunday afternoon in Los Angeles. Flacco has not played since last season, when he appeared in five games with the New York Jets. The veteran quarterback is best known for his time with the Baltimore Ravens, whom he led to a Super Bowl victory in the 2012 season.\n\nKickoff between the Browns and the Rams Sunday is set for 1:25 PM PST on Fox.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Will Simonds December 01, 2023 at 8:05 pm PST\n\nAfter two dismal defensive seasons under head coach Lincoln Riley, USC football has found a new defensive coordinator to replace Alex Grinch. Former UCLA defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn will move across town to take the same role with the Trojans, Riley announced Friday. At just 34 years old, Lynn will manage a talented, but far too inconsistent USC defense as it transitions to the Big Ten for the 2024 season.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome D\u2019Anton and his family to USC,\u201d Riley said in a statement. \u201cWe simply couldn\u2019t ask for a better addition to our staff. His successful experiences in both college and the NFL make him the perfect fit for our program.\u201d\n\nIn his one season as the Bruins\u2019 defensive coordinator in 2023, Lynn oversaw a defense that led the Pac-12 in yards allowed per game and ranked second in points allowed per game. In comparison, UCLA ranked No. 87 in the nation in total defense and No. 92 in scoring defense the year prior.\n\nLynn now will be tasked with completing a similar turnaround of a USC unit that has been one of the worst in the nation in recent years. Notably, when UCLA trounced USC 38-20 at the Coliseum last month, the Bruins allowed just three rushing yards from an explosive Trojan offense.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 former defensive coordinator Grinch was the recipient of frequent scrutiny across two seasons on Riley\u2019s staff with USC, before being relieved of his duties on November 5 after a 52-42 loss to Washington.\n\nPlenty of top defensive recruits in recent classes have come to play at the Coliseum, but the on-field product hasn\u2019t lived up to expectations, especially compared to Riley\u2019s high-octane offense on the other side of the ball. USC currently holds commitments from two defensive players listed in the top 100 of 247Sports\u2019 recruiting rankings for the 2024 class: cornerback Marcelles Williams (No. 76) and edge rusher Kameryn Fountain (No. 85).\n\nBefore coming to Westwood, Lynn spent several seasons as an assistant coach in the NFL. He worked with the New York Jets, Buffalo Bills, Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans and Baltimore Ravens between 2014-22.\n\nAs a cornerback at Penn State from 2008-12, Lynn was selected as an All-Big Ten honorable mention three times, recording 162 tackles and four interceptions over four seasons. Lynn was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Jets in 2012, but he was cut during training camp. He is the son of Anthony Lynn, the former head coach of the Chargers and current assistant head coach of the San Francisco 49ers.\n```"}

The Trojans (25-18, 25-10, 25-12) put together a resounding sweep over UMBC and are now 34-5 all-time in the NCAA first round. It was win or go home for USC, who has a No. 8 seed in the tournament.\n\nThe Trojans brought that mentality to the match and seemed to be in control from the very beginning. UMBC was aggressive early in the first set, taking a 7-6 lead over USC. The two offenses battled back and forth for a few possessions, but the Trojans started to get an edge behind kills from redshirt sophomore middle blocker Tyrah Ariail and senior outside hitter Skylar Fields. USC pulled away, executing a 4-0 scoring run to end the set and win 25-18. Both Fields and Ariail finished the period with four kills, with Ariail hitting 75.0% for the match.\n\n\u201cYou have to come out firing in this tournament,\u201d head coach Brad Keller said after the match. \u201cWe had a little bit of a slow start, but once we turned it on, I was really impressed and really happy with the level of focus and execution that these young women had today.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans continued to push in the second set: a 5-1 run started things off, and USC never looked back. UMBC struggled to generate offense, and USC went on run after run, eventually winning out 25-10 in the set. The Trojans dug their heels in for the third; USC recorded 17 kills in the period. UMBC never led after scoring the first point of the second set.\n\nUSC hit 42.0% for the match and held UMBC to just 4.3%. \u201cWe\u2019ve really had an emphasis on defense in our gym, and defense is always going to help you win matches,\u201d  Field said. \u201cI think that that paid off tonight.\u201d\n\nThree Trojans tied for block leader with four apiece: Ariail, junior setter Mia Tuaniga and senior middle blocker Lindsey Miller. Tuaniga also contributed a whopping 38 assists. Freshman outside hitter London Wijay led the team in digs with 13, her ninth match with double-digit digs. Wijay was selected to the Pac-12  All-Freshman Team  this season. Fields and Tuaniga also received honors when they were both named to the Pac-12 All-Conference Team.\n\nFields played a strong defensive game, but was an offensive stalwart per usual. In Friday\u2019s match, she showcased her playmaking and floor spacing skills, eyes always on the next play.  Fields and her fellow Trojans created a virtually impenetrable wall of defense behind the net. And every now and then, she would rise up from the back row and slam home another kill in her signature style. Fields led the team with 10 kills and added on four digs and two blocks, hitting 40.9% for the match. She led the Pac-12 in kills and points, and is second in the country in kills per set.\n\n\u201cThey never back down,\u201d Keller said of his players. \u201cTheir level of communication has been super open and direct, and I like that.\u201d\n\nUSC moves on to the second round of the tournament to play Pittsburgh Saturday at 4 p.m. PST.\n```"}

Whether students were labeled a \u201cVampire\u201d by Spotify for listening to \u201cemotional, atmospheric music more than most\u201d or reached a new milestone on Apple Music, USC is divided over which platform is better.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a fun little thing people can bond over,\u201d said sophomore psychology major Camila Beresford-Redman. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s fun, it doesn\u2019t really mean anything.\u201d\n\nThe format, originally ideated by Spotify in 2016, was later adopted by Apple Music in 2019, bridging the gap for all kinds of listeners. This year\u2019s Spotify Wrapped featured new additions like \u201cSound Town,\u201d a pixelated map that displayed a city with similar listening patterns to each user in addition to unique genre distinctions like Darksynth, Dream Plugg and Compositional Ambient.\n\nAccording to the BBC, there are now over 6,000 genre distinctions on Spotify \u2014 which are used to sort each of the 100,000 new tracks uploaded every day. With 210 million premium users, Spotify still dominates the audio streaming subscription service charts compared to Apple Music\u2019s 88 million global subscribers according to Music Business Worldwide.\n\nMany USC students thought that Spotify was the clear winner, especially with its unique, colorful Wrapped format this year. Some even highlighted Apple Music\u2019s downsides. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in paying for the service and the phone,\u201d said junior Alani Smith, a film and television student. \u201c[Spotify] caters to me.\u201d\n\nOthers voiced their support for Apple Music. Freshman Ayana Gonzalez said, \u201cApple Music comes with my network carrier of choice, so I take advantage of that.\u201d\n\nAnother new feature on Wrapped was the \u201cMe in 2023\u2032\u2032 character, which \u201cdemonstrates a streaming habit that defined your music listening this year\u201d according to Spotify. Options range from Alchemist to Time Traveler to Mastermind. Smith said her Wrapped character was a Cyclops. \u201cThey said I\u2019m loyal... I stick to genres and artists like really long.\u201d\n\nOne USC student even stood strong by YouTube Music, which only has 8.5 million subscribers \u2014 and no end-of-the-year recap, according to Music Business Worldwide. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the YouTube music slander. Yeah, it\u2019s a little overpriced monthly, but I grew up literally listening to music off of the YouTube app because I didn\u2019t want to pay for it,\u201d said junior Faith Nguyen.\n\nNguyen also pointed out that you can listen to some edits on YouTube that are not accessible on other platforms. \u201cWhy go so close-minded as to use Spotify when you can literally access the world on YouTube?... I\u2019m going to be a lone wolf about it, all right.\u201d\n\nSeveral students were hesitant to share their top artists on their Wrapped or Replay, believing that the platforms did not accurately represent their listening history this year. Beresford-Redman said Spotify \u201cdid me pretty dirty\u201d this year in correlating the location of San Luis Obispo, California with her music habits. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t tell me anything about my listening pattern.\u201d\n\nGonzalez was hesitant to share her Replay as it features \u201csome of the most mainstream on this planet\u201d with Drake, A Boogie Wit da Hoodie and Beyonc\u00e9 at the top. Smith, on the other hand, was embarrassed to admit that Kanye was her number two artist even though she stopped listening to him this year. But, Smith confesses she knows why Kanye made the cut. \u201cWhenever I fly over to L.A., I keep Waves by Kanye on repeat and my flight is seven hours. But, I stopped doing that \u2014 like I did that for the flight,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the music-listeners demographic is divided by the streaming platforms, the year-long wait to the next rewind of their music choices unites them.\n```"}

The event will run from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and RSVPs must be submitted by December 8 for admission. If you are not going home for the holidays, or if you live in Los Angeles, the luncheon would be a great way to end the semester.\n\nEvery corner of L.A. has a holiday tradition worth loving:\n\nMarina del Rey Boat Parade\nThe Marina del Rey Boat Parade will flaunt the marina\u2019s best-decorated holiday boats on December 9 at 5:55 p.m. The 60-year-old tradition is a staple of Marina del Rey and typically draws thousands to see the fireworks and thoroughly lit boats. The best viewing locations are Burton Chace Park and Fishermen\u2019s Village. If you are willing to make a day trip out of it, the park is hosting booths, vendors and performances as late as 10 p.m.\n\nUniversal Studios\nLos Angeles is home to Universal Studios Hollywood. The park prepared itself for the holiday season last month and will be continuing the festivities into early January. Universal Studios Hollywood is hosting two major holiday events this season: \u201cChristmas in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter\u201d and \u201cGrinchmas.\u201d Potterheads can catch shows in Hogsmeade and take in the beautifully decorated castle, while the nerds of the world can immerse themselves in Dr. Seuss\u2019 \u201cWho-tacular\u201d Christmas creation.\n\nEnchanted Forest of Light at Descanso Gardens\nFor a more down-to-earth experience, you might want to take a late-night walk through the Enchanted Forest of Light at Descanso Gardens. The La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge location opens every day at 5:30 p.m. until January 7 and offers whimsical, Alice-in-Wonderland-esque environments for patrons to wander through. Tickets cost $45 for general admission.\n\nThe Grove\nThe Grove is an L.A. classic: it\u2019s a bustling outdoor mall that\u2019s filled with lights and decorations during the winter holidays. Open daily, it\u2019s most popular once the sun sets for the holiday lights. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of little pop-ups [people] can go visit for the holidays, and it\u2019s really beautiful. You should go check it out,\u201d said Olivia Dean, a sophomore majoring in psychology.\n\nHonorary mention: Disneyland\nAlthough it\u2019s not in L.A., Disneyland decked the halls with Christmas decorations. About an hour-long drive from USC, Disneyland is filled with fun holiday festivities. Visitors to the Anaheim park will see it lit up with festive lighting and may get the chance to catch Disney characters and other holiday figures in a parade. Tickets start at $96 for daily admission.\n\nAlthough L.A. may not be known for its winters, visitors and residents will have plenty to do during the cold holidays!\n```"}

Students gather around to watch those fights and then holler, chant, and pull out their phones to record the fight. The footage is later posted on social media by students.\n\nA recent study for the National Center for Education Statistics at IES titled Crime, Violence, Discipline, and Safety in U.S. Public Schools in 2019-20, analyzed this issue. The findings show that \u201c60 percent of schools reported at least one physical attack or fight without a weapon at school. Nine percent of schools reported such an attack with a weapon.\u201d Additionally, in schools where at least half of the students are from minority groups, \u201c69 percent reported involving students in restorative practices. Rates were lower at schools with lower minority enrollment, ranging from 40 to 58 percent,\u201d according to the same 2022 study.\n\n\u201cViolence is a form of survivalism to some groups. [In] some countries, they fight because there\u2019s no other option. But when it comes down to young people, I think it really comes back to them not having the words, not having the alternatives. They don\u2019t know how to be connected and how to have disagreements in a safe way,\u201d said Holly Priebe-Sotelo, a professor at the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and an expert in school crisis response, adolescent bullying, abuse, and diversity and equity.\n\nPriebe-Sotelo grew up in South L.A. and experienced violence in public schools herself, which pushed her brother to drop out of school. Due to this, she spent eighteen years in K-12 schools doing anti-bullying work by fostering connection between the students. Yet due to the violence and internalized trauma that she and her family experienced growing up in the South L.A. public school system, she decided to enroll her daughter in a private school so that she would have a better educational environment.\n\n\u201cFrom my experience in working in schools is that sometimes young people feel that there is no other option but violence. And so we have to teach young people alternatives to impulse,\u201d Priebe-Sotelo said. \u201cWe need to teach them safe ways to act out aggressions or anger or disrespect.\u201d\n\nThese fights are extremely harmful, yet the glorification and perpetuation of these on social media is where the deeper point of concern lies. In South L.A., where the majority of residents identify as either Black or Latinx, this violence is the product of other systemic issues.\n\n\u201cA lot of it comes back to internalized oppression. You know, a lot of kids have an internalized history of trauma where they don\u2019t feel like their voice matters,\u201d Priebe-Sotelo said. \u201cAnd so it starts really kind of with those internal messages in our own minds that tells us this is all I\u2019m good for.\u201d\n\nAccording to Priebe-Sotelo, the key to change is in learning and implementing new strategies that are more focused on empathy and human connection among students.\n\n\u201cWe always encourage our school community to follow the District\u2019s message: \u2018If you see something, say something,\u2019\u201d a Los Angeles Unified spokesperson said. Additionally, students and parents can also use the LAUSD LASAR mobile app which allows those in the school community to anonymously report any issues such as fights, mental health incidents, or drug consumption.\n\n\u201cLos Angeles Unified takes the safety and well-being of our students very seriously. To support students, Los Angeles Unified offers schools several tiers of support, including\u2013\u2013but not limited to\u2013\u2013strategies to prevent, respond to, and recover from instances of student misconduct,\u201d a Los Angeles Unified spokesperson said. \u201cWhen examples of this occur, school staff who supervise students are expected to intervene appropriately, which includes notifying school administrators. They will investigate and take appropriate administrative action. The safety of students and staff is our top priority.\u201d\n\nEssentially, it all comes down to the system and values that teenagers are inheriting.\n\n\u201cThe missing link here is to engage the parents,\u201d Priebe-Sotelo said. \u201cIn private schools, parents must participate. There\u2019s no question that they have to participate. So here in public schools, the parents and caregivers are almost nowhere to be found.\u201d\n\nAlthough social media plays a great role in perpetuating violence, it can be used as a tool to spread awareness and create change.\n\n\u201cMonitoring social media is a never-ending process where we\u2019re, you know, we can\u2019t police every single message that exists. It\u2019s impossible. So therefore, we need to empower young people to do this and be responsible for their own behaviors,\u201d Priebe-Sotelo said.\n```"}

No formal postponement of the building\u2019s demolition has been announced. The marketplace was scheduled to be demolished to make way for an affordable housing project for low-income residents.\n\nVendors gathered at an L.A. City Council meeting on October 25 to communicate their struggles via public comment. They criticized Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 absence from the meeting and asked for assistance in their relocation.\n\n\u201cWe will not stop fighting because like I heard earlier, L.A. is for all, yet we only see how support is only given for the affluent people.

She said the council \u201cfails to listen and help,\u201d stating that many vendors have not yet found an affordable relocation site because \u201cmost swap meets around the area have been displaced.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been in contact with representatives of Karen Bass but they only listen and do nothing for us.

Shootings. A lack of resources. For many, that\u2019s what first comes to mind when they think of South L.A. Despite negative stereotypes, pockets of passion, vibrancy, gathering, and impact exist within the community. The Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in Willowbrook is one of these. The university\u2019s brand-new medical school opened its doors this past July with a historic first class of 60 students\u2013\u2013mostly made up of people of color.\n\nDuring the fall blocks, the program has provided students with a myriad of opportunities, resources, and even community service activities in the wider South L.A. that are pushing them to grow both professionally and personally. \u201cThere are a lot more Black and Brown individuals that would like to get into medicine than people may realize,\u201d Aarin Huffman, a first-year medical student and member of the inaugural class, said.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by the American Association of Medical Colleges, 56% of active physicians identified as White, about 5.8% identified as Hispanic, and another 5% identified as Black or African American. This data demonstrates the lack of access into the medical field in specifically Black and Brown communities, which starts in high school or even earlier. Yet for residents of South L.A. who mostly make up those populations, having physicians who share similar identities can be transformative.\n\n\u201cMoving from high school to college, I think it was really just access to resources that would have helped to increase the minorities within health professions, such as the medical doctor track, that we didn\u2019t have. I think it boils down to the resources,\u201d Huffman said. Originally from Birmingham, AL, Huffman decided to become a doctor after seeing a lack of access to medical facilities and services in rural Lincoln, AL where she went to church. This, paired with her deep love for people, sparked a curiosity within her to ask herself how she could help.\n\n\u201cThis program opens up a wide array or wide door for the community to heal. I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s essentially broken down to the point of no return, but health care wise, it\u2019s broken because of the access that is not there for it,\u201d Huffman said. Providing all 60 students with access to basic resources, such as the school\u2019s library, a laptop, a stethoscope, a blood pressure monitor, a white lab coat, and a diagnostic kit, the university strives to help mitigate any financial barriers they may have.\n\nThis ideology is based on Dr. Charles R. Drew\u2019s values, an African-American physician who pioneered in blood preservation work. Following Drew\u2019s impact, CDU\u2019s mission emphasizes humanity and empathy before anything else. During Gateway, a six-week orientation, students were able to connect, get to know each other, and develop friendships with their peers as they transitioned into medical school.\n\n\u201cWe talked about or we had lectures that were around social justice matters, which is a big mission and value of the school,\u201d Huffman said. Then, classes kick off with a white coat ceremony. Instead of semesters, CDU\u2019s curriculum is structured around blocks of five to six weeks. Gateway is the first block. Anatomy and physiology represent the second block, the next block is genetics and embryology, and lastly comes biochemistry. This gives students a well-rounded understanding of the material and preparation to work in the real world.\n\n\u201cWhat makes that better also is the faculty and staff. They make us feel like we\u2019re winners. Like we can do this,\u201d Huffman said. Dr. Margarita Loeza, the Assistant Dean of Admissions and Student Affairs at CDU, enjoys working with passionate students in the inaugural class. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for students that are mission driven and mostly from the community and that want to serve the community of South L.A.,\u201d Loeza said. \u201cThey seem happy and engaged and enthusiastic and they seem very proud to be part of the first class.\u201d\n\nCDU\u2019s new medical school is just one of the many uplifting developments that are transforming the South L.A. area, bringing new hope and opportunities for growth. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just do it for LA County. It\u2019s starting in LA County, but it\u2019s starting a revolution. Not in a bad way. I like to use revolution, like John Lewis used to say, as good trouble,\u201d Huffman said.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Katherine Havens and Tobey Groome\nDecember 01, 2023 at 3:35 pm PST\n\nThe holiday season brings plenty of cheer but December also brings an increase in shopping, food, travel; and subsequently a surge in waste. Although these things can be unavoidable, conscious efforts by individuals can help prevent an overwhelming amount of waste produced this holiday season.\n\nShopping, sales and gifts\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, e-commerce sales rose by 43% in 2020 due to the pandemic, and have been on the rise ever since. Added packaging trash and increased carbon emissions are direct consequences of shipping online purchases to the consumer. To prevent this unnecessary added waste, shopping in-person at stores is the more sustainable option. Online purchases are more likely to be returned than items bought in person, according to the National Environment Education Foundation. In addition to the added emissions from shipping products back, most returned items end up in landfills.\n\n\u201cMore than 80% of returns end up in landfills or shipped to developing countries as garbage,\u201d said Hitendra Chaturvedi, an Arizona State University Professor. By shopping in-person, the risk of added waste is drastically reduced.\n\nShopping second-hand is another way to ensure that your gift is as waste-free as possible. According to Goodwill\u2019s website, thrifting causes less resource consumption, fewer things to be thrown away, and less chemical pollution. Consignment and thrift stores are widely available in L.A., and most cities in the U.S. Visiting one of these stores makes your gift more personalized and unique, as some recycled pieces can be unique and not found in stores that mass produce their items.\n\nIf you have time before heading home for the holidays, the USC Sustainability Hub is hosting a winter clothing drop \u2018n\u2019 swap and non-perishable food drive from now until December 5. Consider stopping by the Student Union building to donate lightly used winter clothing and/or add an item to your wardrobe. In addition, non-perishable food that is donated will be sent to the Trojan Food Pantry.\n\nFood: holiday edition\nGifts aren\u2019t the only environmentally unfriendly factor around the holidays, as food is another popular indulgence this season and a great perpetrator of waste. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, household waste increases by 25% around the holidays. The EPA has several tips on reducing food waste, including making a set grocery list to prevent overbuying, and storing leftovers in the freezer so they don\u2019t go bad.\n\nFinding new recipes to revamp your leftovers may encourage your family to eat the food from the day before and prevent the remnants of a large meal from being wasted. Upcycling food can become a creative way to both bring family and friends together as well as create a whole different and exciting meal. From sandwiches to soups to casseroles, the possibilities are endless.\n\n\u201cCutting down on your food waste is a really important thing to think about during the holidays when we do tend to have these really big meals,\u201d said Chelsea Graham, Experiential Learning Manager in the Office of Sustainability.\n\nLeisure and travel\nThe holidays also give people a break, allowing travel to pick up a lot this time of year. Transportation is a top source of carbon dioxide emissions due to individuals returning home for the holidays, according to NEEF. To keep your carbon footprint low, itineraries must be carefully planned. When possible, use a bus or train to return to your family. In cases where this is not feasible, driving should be the next choice. Only if all other alternatives have been exhausted should you fly on a plane, as flying has the largest carbon footprint.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t avoid taking that airplane, think about how you can reduce your carbon footprint once you get to your destination. So whether or not that\u2019s once you get home, you\u2019re doing more walking or taking public transit, doing more carpooling, all those things can really help, especially if you can\u2019t avoid that big air travel,\u201d added Graham.\n\nBecoming aware of the increased potential for waste around the holidays is the first step to contributing your bit to the environment. Being as thoughtful as possible when buying gifts, food supplies and planning your travel is important to prevent an excess amount of trash and unused items from building up in your local dump.\n```"}

George Santos was expelled from the House of Representatives Friday morning due to an ethics violation that included fraud, lies regarding his education and misuse of campaign funds, according to the New York Times. A controversial figure since his campaign for office, Santos had gained national attention for lying about a multitude of facts \u2014 some essential to his campaign \u2014 including saying that he was Jewish (while campaigning in a very Jewish district) and was the descendant of Holocaust survivors, that he had attended Baruch College and that that his mother had worked in the Twin Towers and survived 9/11.\n\nSantos became the first representative in over two decades to be expelled from the House and is only the sixth in history after the vote, which required a two-thirds majority to pass. More than one hundred members of his own party voted for his removal. A notable exception from this Republican vote to expel was Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who earned a rebuke for doing so from Republican freshman Rep. Max Miller.\n\nMoments before the vote, Miller announced to the legislature that Santos had personally defrauded him and his mother. \u201cMr. Santos took, not only my credit card personally, he took my mother\u2019s credit card personally and he swiped them both for an additional $5,000, marking it as an over donation,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI had to hire an attorney to fight it by the FEC that I think cost me 15 or $20,000. Altogether, this man has cost my family $30,000.\u201d\n\nPrevious attempts to remove Santos were unsuccessful. A House Ethics investigation released Nov. 9 found evidence that Santos was exploiting his candidacy for personal profit. The report revealed that he used campaign funds for credit card payments, botox and OnlyFans. The ethics investigation found that Santos\u2019 claim that he graduated with an MBA from New York University and a bachelor\u2019s degree from Baruch College could not be verified by either institution. Additionally, the report found that he was spending campaign money on personal vacations and that he owed thousands of dollars to creditors.\n\nSantos has pleaded not guilty to 23 federal charges which include Covid-19 unemployment benefits fraud and lying on House disclosure reports. His former campaign fundraiser did plead guilty two weeks ago to a federal wire fraud charge. Despite his expulsion, Santos has not been convicted of a felony which leaves him still eligible for the privileges of a former member of Congress, including access to the House floor.\n\nMeanwhile, the vacancy leaves the House Clerk in charge of Santos\u2019s office while New York Gov. Kathy Hochul schedules a special election to fill the seat. New York Law states the governor must proclaim an election within 10 days and the election must happen shortly thereafter. Gov. Hochul posted to X, formerly Twitter, after the vote, and said that she would take the \u201csolemn\u201d responsibility of filling Santos\u2019 vacancy. \u201cThe people of Long Island deserve nothing less,\u201d said Hochul.\n\nSantos is the first member of Congress to be expelled without being convicted of a felony since the Civil War, when three men were expelled for fighting the Confederacy. Since then, only two representatives have been expelled from Congress, both convicted of bribery. After the vote, Santos left the chamber and walked to a car, during which he told reporters that he had no intention of staying near the House. \u201cWhy would I want to stay here?\u201d he said. \u201cTo hell with this place.\u201d\n```"}

She passed away at home in Phoenix, Arizona, a state in which she grew up and lived most of her life, from a respiratory illness and complications of dementia. The former associate justice had announced in 2018 that she had received a diagnosis for the disease.\n\nO\u2019Connor was, among other things, the first woman to serve on the country\u2019s highest court. O\u2019Connor is well known for her prevalence as an associate justice during her 24 years on the Supreme Court, which was referred to as the \u201cO\u2019Connor Court\u201d despite William H. Rehnquist serving as chief justice during most of her time there according to the New York Times. She was nominated to the court in 1981 by Ronald Reagan as a promise to nominate a female justice. She retired in 2006 and was succeeded by Samuel Alito.\n\nDuring her tenure on the court, O\u2019Connor was often the center of a politically divided group of justices. Upon retiring, according to the Sandra Day O\u2019Connor Institute, she had been the deciding vote in more than 350. Some of these deciding votes included the 1992 vote to affirm the right to an abortion and a 2003 vote to defend affirmative action. On a perhaps more controversial note, O\u2019Connor tended to vote with her conservative colleagues on racial discrimination cases and cast the deciding vote that gave George W. Bush the presidency over Al Gore.\n\nNewsweek reported that O\u2019Connor had not been in favor of a Gore victory in 2000, doing so much as to make audible complaints at an election night party when he was pulling narrowly ahead. Her husband, John Jay O\u2019Connor, explained that she wanted to retire and be replaced by a Republican, but this account has been disputed by some, including legal scholar Richard K. Neumann, Jr.. Nevertheless, she joined the majority opinion that the Florida recount was unconstitutional and could not proceed, handing Bush a narrow victory.\n\nIn a comment to the Chicago Tribune\u2019s Editorial Board in 2013, O\u2019Connor expressed mild regret that the Supreme Court took the decision into their hands, saying that it \u201cgave the court a less than perfect reputation.\u201d Despite this, O\u2019Connor\u2019s story is a champion for women. She graduated top of her Stanford Law School class but only one out of the nearly 40 firms that she called for a job would offer her one. The position? Legal secretary.\n\nShe was made assistant state attorney general in 1965 and ran for a state senate seat in Arizona in 1969 and served there for five years, becoming the first woman Republican majority leader in 1972. In 1974 she won a seat on the Arizona State Court. And in 1981, she succeeded Justice Potter Stewart after the country\u2019s first televised Supreme Court confirmation hearing ended in a 99-0 vote in her favor. In 2009, then-President Barack Obama awarded her the presidential medal of freedom.\n\nO\u2019Connor had not only a political, but physical impact on the Supreme Court. Before her tenure there had been no women\u2019s bathroom near the courtroom; one was designated when she joined the bench. The Ladies Dining Room \u2014 designated for spouses \u2014 became the Dorothy Cornell Rehnquist Dining Room (named after then Chief Justice Rehnquist\u2019s wife). In the end, O\u2019Connor was a cowgirl. She grew up on her family\u2019s \u201cLazy B\u201d ranch on the Arizona-New Mexico border and championed anti-federalism in many of her court votes. In fact, that\u2019s what she called herself: at her induction ceremony to the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas, she said that she was \u201cthe first cowgirl to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d\n```"}

This year, even without captain Gabriel Landeskog, Colorado is standing its ground. The Avs have won four out of their last five games, and narrowly lead the Central Division.\n\nColorado\u2019s first line has been lethal on the offensive attack. Mikko Rantanen, who leads the team in goals, has been a force for the Avs at the wing. Rantanen is coming off his best season yet when he eclipsed 100 points. He has already carried last year\u2019s success over to this year\u2019s campaign, with 29 points already thus far.\n\nCenter Nathan MacKinnon has been one of the NHL\u2019s best for quite some time and, like Rantanen, is a threat on the first line. MacKinnon recorded a point in all but two games in November and has shown no signs of slowing down.\n\nDefenseman Cale Makar has the fourth-most points in the NHL with 34, including 25 in November alone. Makar is making a serious case for yet another Norris Trophy award and is breaking records at just 25 years old. In just 20 games played, Makar broke the team\u2019s franchise record for fewest games to reach 30 points in a season.\n\nColorado\u2019s netminders have been modest but are securing wins on a consistent basis. Starter Alexander Georgiev won 40 games last year, which put him in the Vezina conversation. The Bulgarian could very well replicate these numbers this season, especially with a strong defense in front of him. Backup Ivan Prosvetov has seen less time between the pipes but has posted a stout .919 in five appearances.\n\nThe Avalanche are eager to make another Stanley Cup run with their deep roster. Colorado will need to somehow edge the Dallas Stars, though, who almost stole the division crown last season. The Winnipeg Jets have also been winning and could be a threat, too. The Avalanche will take on the Ducks on Saturday at 7 p.m.\n\nCam Talbot, the King of the Net\n\nThe Kings parted ways with goaltender Jonathan Quick last season after almost two decades with the organization. Questions soon emerged surrounding Los Angeles\u2019 situation in net, but it seems like L.A. has found their guy: Cam Talbot.\n\nIn the offseason, Los Angeles acquired the injury-ridden, veteran goalie, and it has already paid off. Talbot has already defied expectations through 15 appearances between the pipes. Talbot is one of the best goalies in the NHL; his 2.02 goals against average is the third-lowest in the league and his .928 save percentage is in the top five.\n\nThe Kings\u2019 defense has been shaky through parts of the season thus far, but Talbot\u2019s crease awareness has allowed L.A. to contend in a competitive Pacific Division. Talbot thrives on the road. Los Angeles is undefeated in away play at 9-0-0, and the 36-year old has been in net for eight of those wins. He has shared time in the crease with Pheonix Copley but has taken over the starting role thanks to his stellar play.\n\nWith 29 saves against the Ducks last Friday, Talbot won his 10th game of the season. If he keeps winning at this rate, his name could very well be considered for the Vezina Trophy, something that no one would\u2019ve expected heading into the season. On top of this, don\u2019t count the Kings out as a serious cup contender. The Pacific Division is looking to be a three-legged race between Vegas, Vancouver and Los Angeles, and the spot on the throne is up for grabs. Talbot will need to keep performing at this level in order to give Los Angeles the edge.\n\nThe Kings\u2019 next test will be the Colorado Avalanche on Sunday at 5 p.m.\n\nFrankie V.\u2019s breakout show\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks might be struggling as of late, with losses in their last eight contests. However, Anaheim has awakened to a pleasant surprise this season \u2014 Frank Vatrano. Vatrano is currently in the thick of the Maurice Richard Trophy race with 13 goals already. Vatrano\u2019s career has been unconventional, to say the least. The winger started out with Boston in 2015 and has jumped around the league since.\n\nVatrano played his first season with the Ducks last year and contributed 41 points in Anaheim\u2019s dismal 23-win campaign. This year, though, through just 22 games played, Vatrano has over half of his 2022-23 point total and is on pace for the best season of his career.\n\nWhile the Ducks are on a skid, they sit just five points behind the Flames for fourth in the Pacific. Anaheim started out hot before recently slowing down, and have other valuable pieces like centers Mason McTavish and Ryan Strome. Vatrano is thriving on Anaheim\u2019s first line and could very well be drawing the attention of other teams willing to pay a pretty penny for a consistent wing. Vatrano is currently on the second of his three-year deal.\n```"}

(AP/Matt York)\n\nBy Dylan Luden\nDecember 01, 2023 at 8:10 am PST\n\nIt\u2019s been a very up-and-down start to the season for the Los Angeles Lakers. The team has had their struggles with injuries and playing on the road, where it has a 4-7 record. On the other hand, the Lakers went undefeated in the group stage games of the NBA\u2019s inaugural In-Season tournament to be the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference for the knockout rounds. They\u2019ll face off against the No. 4 seed Phoenix Suns, who they faced in the group stage.\n\nThe two Pacific Division rivals have already squared off twice, with the Lakers winning both games. But both were close affairs and the Lakers\u2019 122-119 win over the Suns was one of the In-Season Tournament\u2019s better games. These two teams have hefty payrolls and massive playoff expectations, but injuries currently plague both teams.\n\nFor the Lakers, guard Cam Reddish and center Jaxon Hayes are both day-to-day after not playing in Thursday\u2019s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, but could make a return for Tuesday\u2019s knockout game. On the other hand, forwards Rui Hachimura and Jarred Vanderbilt will play Saturday against the Houston Rockets. Vanderbilt will be making his long awaited season debut after being one of the Lakers\u2019 best defensive players in the playoffs last season.\n\nThe Lakers are a week or two away from being fully healthy, which should help lighten the load for forward LeBron James and center Anthony Davis while also allowing guard Austin Reaves get into a groove offensively. For the Suns, Devin Booker didn\u2019t play in Friday\u2019s game against the Nuggets due to an ankle injury. If Booker is not available against the Lakers, it would be a huge blow to the Suns as the former Kentucky guard was just named the Western Conference Player of the week.\n\nThe Suns\u2019 offseason acquisition of guard Bradley Beal meant that the Suns have two All-Star-level shooting guards, so one of them had to shift to the point. Even without Beal on the floor, Booker has leaped into that role this season, averaging 27.3 points per game, plus ranking 5th in the NBA with 8.5 assists per game which would shatter his career high. Besides missing Beal, Booker and forward Kevin Durant have played together in just eight of the Suns\u2019 18 games so far due to Durant\u2019s missing time with an injury as well. Much like the Lakers, it\u2019s been hard for them to find momentum.\n\nThe Suns will have to do a much better job at trying to contain James, who dropped 32 points on them last time the teams met in Phoenix. Guard D\u2019Angelo Russell just had a great November as well, shooting 50% from the field and 45% from deep. He capped off his month with a 35-point performance vs. the Detroit Pistons, who had the complete opposite of an excellent month, going 0-15.\n\nWith Reddish and Hayes potentially coming back Tuesday, the Lakers defense should vastly improve, helping slow down Durant and Booker. Even if Booker were to miss Tuesday\u2019s game, the Suns should still give the Lakers a good run for their money on the road. The Lakers, however, should continue their dominant ways in the In-Season Tournament against the Suns by making it to the Western Conference final, where they could face either another Pacific Division foe in the Sacramento Kings, or Davis\u2019 old team, the New Orleans Pelicans.\n```"}

It was his fifth of the 2023 NFL season. (AP Photo/Michael Ainsworth)\n\nBy Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as November 30, 2023 at 7:53 pm PST\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys had checked all but one box as the final minutes of a Thanksgiving\u2019s Day beatdown of the Washington Commanders were dwindling down. Before the final whistle the feast already started for the Cowboys, yet second-year cornerback Daron Bland still had a bone to pick with NFL history. Entering the game, the second-year cornerback was tied for the most interceptions returned for a touchdown in a single NFL season with four on the year. With 4:50 left in the fourth quarter, Bland got his chance.\n\nOn a 2nd-and-10 at midfield, Bland perfectly executed his coverage, breaking under a pass intended for Commanders receiver Jahan Doston. BLAND DID IT AGAIN!!! HISTORY!!! \ud83d\udcfa: #WASvsDAL on CBS \ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/N5H8Nc0xKc pic.twitter.com/tImqViPSlg \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2023\n\n\u201cThere it is, this is history if Bland can take it the distance,\u201d exclaimed CBS broadcaster Jim Nantz. 63 yards and a few juke moves later, the 24-year-old from Modesto, Cali accomplished what many young kids dream to do: be a part of NFL history. For Bland, it only took a grand total of 11 games to accomplish this feat.\n\n\u201cIt means everything,\u201d Bland said after the game. \u201cMy family is here, good to break the record in front of them.\u201d\n\nAfter a 45-10 victory on Thanksgiving Day, the Cowboys improved to 8-3. With Bland\u2019s performance last Thursday, a new conversation emerges: Should he win the Defensive Player of the Year? In a simple answer, yes. Bland has just broken an NFL record that has been held since 1994 by Eagles cornerback Eric Allen. If a defensive player, like Myles Garrett, T.J. Watt or Micah Parsons, broke the NFL sack record of 22.5 in a single season, I don\u2019t think there would be much of a conversation of who gets the DPOY award. With Bland, it is the same deal.\n\nCompared to Hall of Fame defensive backs, Bland has already tied the career touchdown totals of Dick \u201cNight Train\u201d Lane\u2019 and Ronnie Lott in only 28 games. And the type of trajectory that Bland is on right now could mean a few more scores by season\u2019s end. It would be robbery not to give Bland his deserved hardware at the NFL honors this year.\n\n\u201cDPOY Bland right now...It shouldn\u2019t even be a debate.\u201d Darius Slay, Eagles cornerback posted on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nIn his young career, Bland has offered a lot more than just touchdowns. Bland has the most interceptions among all defensive players over the last two seasons with 12. And on top of his ball hawk abilities, Bland has excelled in coverage. Through 11 games this season, Bland has only allowed a 49% completion percentage when targeted, ranking fifth-best in the league. He also has seven pass breakups, and all of this without even being a Week 1 starter.\n\nBland was third cornerback on the depth chart to start the season, behind All-Pro Trevon Diggs and former-DPOY Stephon Gilmore. In a tragic turn of events, Diggs tore his left ACL just two weeks into the season. The loss of Diggs was felt across the locker room, but cornerbacks coach Al Harris and the Cowboys instilled all trust into their second-year cornerback, elevating him to the number two role. What looked grim two months ago now looks like hitting the lottery for the Cowboys.\n\nFor Bland, a journey of trying to prove himself on the Cowboys roster is similar to his bumpy path to the NFL. Out of high school, Bland was hardly recruited and ended up choosing a small Division-1 FCS program in Sacramento State. In three seasons at Sacramento State from 2017-2019, Bland showed promise. His sophomore year, he earned first-team All-Big Sky and the team\u2019s Outstanding Defensive Back award.\n\nUtilizing his COVID year of eligibility, Bland got an opportunity to transfer to a better Division-1 program with Fresno State. Taking full advantage of the opportunity with the Bulldogs, Bland ended his senior year with two interceptions and five pass breakups, but still received little attention from any NFL scouts and didn\u2019t receive a combine invite in 2021. Regardless, Bland entered his name into that year\u2019s draft. Finally, with the 167th pick of the fifth round, the Cowboys made Bland\u2019s professional dreams come true.\n\nNow, just two years later, Bland is a top candidate for the most prestigious defensive award in the NFL. If Bland wins the award this year he would become the second player in Cowboys history to be awarded Defensive Player of the Year, joining defensive end Harvey Martin (1977). But for now, Bland is focused on the Cowboys tough stretch ahead, with all of the next five games against teams above .500: Seahawks, Eagles, Bills, Dolphins, and Lions.\n\n\u201cI hear people saying I should be in [for consideration]\u201d Bland said. \u201cIf it happens, it happens.\u201d\n```"}

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\n\nBy Kyle Frankel\nNovember 30, 2023 at 6:46 pm PST\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d is a column by Kyle Frankel about fantasy football. Here we are again. The final column of the semester, and of this fantasy season. After this, you\u2019ll be on your own, hopefully tackling the final obstacles en route to being crowned as your league champion. I hope everyone had a happy Thanksgiving and enjoyed the brief hiatus, but it\u2019s time to get back to business.\n\nIt\u2019s that time of the year when the waiver wire has just about been picked dry, well over-saturated after the numerous weeks it had every player with even the smallest semblance of value plucked away. That is why our attention is elsewhere today. Obviously, there are still injuries and surprise roster decisions that make for some hidden gems still being out there in certain leagues, but if you are still looking to the waiver wire to solve your issues, then I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re too late.\n\nThe playoffs are starting up in just a few weeks, so let\u2019s set our sights on the fantasy postseason. Fantasy playoffs aren\u2019t just about who has the better roster on paper, they\u2019re about who wins that week. With that being said, here\u2019s some very realistic names you could acquire in trades right now whose playoff schedules should treat them extremely well. And if you\u2019re not going to make the playoffs, maybe these guys can help you win the toilet bowl.\n\nJumping for Jaylen. Am I aware that last week was the first time Pittsburgh outgained their opponent all season? Yes. Does that make me fearful their offense could sputter and hurt these guys down the stretch? Absolutely not! Did you read that first sentence? The Steelers offense has been sputtering all year! Despite the scoring woes, fantasy scoring has not been a problem for running back Jaylen Warren. The second-year ball carrier finally broke out after showing constant flashes. He\u2019s an explosive runner and feels like he just brings a spark to a largely lifeless offense every time he steps on the field.\n\nWhile Najee Harris appears to still be edging him out on the depth chart as the No. 1 RB, Warren has been nearing an even split on touches with his counterpart over the last month. In the last four weeks, he\u2019s averaging 12 carries a game to Harris\u2019 14.75. He\u2019s capitalizing on his opportunities too, scoring 16 PPR points per game over that span, including a pair of touchdowns. Warren has gotten involved in the passing game as well, seeing three targets in three of his last four games, usually on quick screens outside the hashes.\n\nNow, is he going to be an RB1? That\u2019s unlikely. However, he does face the Colts, Bengals and Ravens in Weeks 15, 16 and 17. Those three teams all rank in the bottom half of the league in fantasy points allowed to running backs, with Seattle and Indianapolis sitting at six and seven-worst respectively. I know I said I wouldn\u2019t mention the waiver wire, but he is somehow available in 20.6% of ESPN leagues prior to claims processing this week, so there\u2019s still a slight chance you could get him for nothing. If not, though, he\u2019s not a blockbuster name, so you should be able to work a trade out that doesn\u2019t ship off any essential players.\n\nPuka\u2019s a priority. After being the darling of fantasy football for the first few weeks of the season, the hype for Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua has largely died down since Cooper Kupp returned to action in Week 5. In the first five weeks this year, Nacua eclipsed the double-digit mark in PPR points in all of them, surpassed 20 in four of five and even topped 30 in two of the contests. He was on an otherworldly tear to begin his NFL career, getting force-fed by Matthew Stafford with an astonishing 63 targets in the first five weeks! Since Week 5, he\u2019s only been over single-digit PPR points in two of six outings. His targets have died down with a more crowded receiver room, but he\u2019s still getting a hefty workload, averaging eight targets per game in that span.\n\nDespite hitting a bit of a slump, he\u2019s poised to explode in the fantasy playoffs. The Rams face Washington, New Orleans and the New York Giants in Week 15, 16 and 17. Now, New Orleans has been fairly stout against the air attack, but the Commanders and Giants allow the second and fifth-most fantasy points to wideouts this season. We know Nacua will get the opportunities, the question is whether or not he will make the most of them. The defenses he\u2019ll be facing make me think he\u2019s going to end the season akin to how he started it.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to find Nacua on waivers, and he\u2019ll be more expensive than Warren, but you should still be able to trade for him at a reasonable price.\n\nWell then, I guess that\u2019s it. I want to give a huge thank you to everyone who followed along this season. I hope some of my tips and leads were able to either help you bolster an already elite roster, salvage a once seemingly lost season or maybe even lead you to the fantasy promised land. Now go finish the job! \u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

The movie follows Lincoln, a filmmaker whose life takes a turn when he has difficulty handling the aftermath of his debut film\u2019s success. Lincoln\u2019s film, \u201cAccompany,\u201d begins to insert itself into his reality when the fictional entity, The Haunting, becomes a tormenting reality for the character, according to IMDB.\n\nThe movie stars producer Jordan Rice and writer Alex Nimrod, both seniors majoring in theater. More than 70 USC students also helped create the film. Nimrod said he came up with the idea for the film after writing the basis of the plot as a short film during his freshman year. Rice said the film was shot over 34 days beginning in June 2022, and Nimrod said the editing happened over the course of about two years.\n\n\u201cThis has been my magnum opus of my life thus far,\u201d said Nimrod. \u201cIt has been a project that has been both a blessing and a curse. It has consumed my life literally for the past three years.\u201d\n\nProduction of the film began during the COVID-19 pandemic and was completed using a limited budget of $15,000 acquired through fundraising. \u201cMaking a feature film for $15,000 is practically unheard of in the industry,\u201d said Rice. \u201cA lot of that had to do with timing, and a lot of that had to do with the USC Trojan network.\u201d\n\nThe extensive Trojan network brought the film to life, providing the creative team with a score made by Remote Control, sound editing by Emmy award-winning Jordan Aldinger and a Company 3 colorist. The teaser trailer for the film was officially released in January 2023, after an initial showing in December 2022 at a film festival hosted by 4085 Productions.\n\n\u201cWe pretended like the [event] was over and we were like, \u2018All right everyone, thank you so much for coming in,\u2019\u201d said Nimrod. \u201cAnd then someone in the sound booth cut the music, cut the lights and then we just played the trailer on the screen and it was kind of my first time actually seeing a live reaction to this thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople just ate it up,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the jump scare moment, the whole audience went back and it was an inspiring moment.\u201d\n\nRice said the team was working on applying to 36 film festivals for the film\u2019s official premiere, though he\u2019s hoping Monday\u2019s event will draw roughly 300 for a preview screening. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a beautiful night because everyone\u2019s going to get to come together after literally years of grinding on this project,\u201d said Rice.\n\nInformation for tickets to the private screening can be found here.\n```"}

(Photo by Paulena Edelman)\n\nBy Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as, Faith Curry and Paulena Edelman\nNovember 30, 2023 at 6:06 pm PST\n\nThe adrenaline of cramming for final exams begins as the final week of classes comes to a close. Students must now make the decision of where they want to hold down the fort and study on campus for the days leading up to their exams. USC has a variety of indoor and outdoor spaces for students to dive into the books and make their flashcards, and in hopes of helping you decide where to study, we surveyed students and visited the top study spots on campus.\n\nMost recommended: Leavey Library\nPros: On every floor, there are water fountains to keep you hydrated during this stressful time of year, and there\u2019s no drought of outlets either, making this a good option for hunkering down. There are also printers for student use and a variety of spaces for everything from sunlit naps to study groups with your besties. \u201cI like the spots by the window. You get a little sunlight,\u201d said sophomore Makai Singleton. \u201cIt\u2019s not just like a library in the dark. You sit by the windows, study, [and] get some sunlight.\u201d\n\nCons: Unfortunately, the late-night hours make Leavey a very popular study destination. Even at noon on a Thursday, the library was already getting busy.\n\nWho should study here: Students trying to cram a semester of knowledge before the big exam and those working late into the night would fit right in at Leavey. \u201cIf it\u2019s late-night, Leavey is always the best option,\u201d said Helen Son, a senior studying health promotion and disease prevention.\n\nBest vibes: The Village\nPros: The Village offers the perfect opportunity for caffeine runs or a quick bite to eat. As an added bonus, dogs are often in the Village, giving students a much-needed serotonin boost from that four-legged bundle of fur. \u201cThe couches of the Village are great,\u201d Son said.\n\nCons: Make sure to bring your electronic devices with a full charge because there are no outlets, and, chances are, you\u2019ll have to contend with glare from the sun, chilly weather and wind.\n\nWho should study here: Students who know they should study, but are not opposed to socializing.\n\nMost secluded: Science and Engineering Library\nPros: Walking to the Science and Engineering Library, it\u2019s clear that the students studying here prioritize privacy. Inside, there are two study floors \u2014 both featuring oversized windows to let in natural light \u2014 and the study area on the second floor really brings the cozy vibes.\n\nCons: The low ceilings and hospital-like lighting can make this study space seem uninviting.\n\nWho should study here: Students who really need to study without the distraction of possibly running into friends. \u201cIt\u2019s always empty in there,\u201d said Jacob Marshall, a senior business administration major.\n\nBest views: School of Cinematic Arts (SCA)\nPros: The balconies offer sunlight and shade while also providing a serene study space. Most importantly, views during golden hour cannot be beat. \u201cI set up tables that are stacked on top of each other, so I have a desk that\u2019s eye level. And I work there for hours,\u201d said Roy Gantz, a junior public relations major. \u201cBut, if you go there, you need to give me priority. Don\u2019t steal it.\u201d\n\nCons: The balconies are hard to find if you don\u2019t know where to look and are also exposed to the elements, so a jacket is definitely recommended.\n\nWho should study here: The SCA balconies offer the perfect chance for students to take a break from studying in enclosed library spaces with harsh overhead lighting and get some sunlight.\n\nMost peaceful: Doheny\nPros: Located in the center of campus, Doheny Library is the picture of grace and elegance, with tall windows that allow copious amounts of sunlight. Inside, there are rows and rows of bookcases and tall rooms with grand ceilings. \u201cThe Doheny book stacks [are] always empty,\u201d said Marshall.\n\nCons: One notable thing is the silence...you can hear a pin drop. There is certainly no white noise, and the overall vibe is very studious.\n\nWho should study here: Students who need to concentrate on their work without distraction. Doheny is not the place for shenanigans.\n\nAnd with that, we at Annenberg Media wish you all good luck this exam season!\n```"}

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nBy Qais Adawiya and Sophie Sullivan\nNovember 30, 2023 at 5:56 pm PST\n\nThe Trojans had high hopes of a potential College Football Playoff bid this year, but the season did not go as planned. USC made a major move two seasons ago, hiring Oklahoma Coach Lincoln Riley to a $110 million dollar contract - believing he was the missing piece to deliver a championship. The Trojans regressed from their 10-3 record last year to now 7-5 coming off their most recent loss against rival UCLA. With the season coming to a bitter end, Lincoln Riley\u2019s days may be numbered at \u2018SC.\n\nStudents across campus gave us their take on the season - starting with the man at the top. Senior Porter Ladenfield urges patience and does not believe Riley should lose his job. Porter Ladenfield: he\u2019s one of the best coaches in the country. And if we can get the defense figured out, I think we can contend for national championship.\n\nThe reactions were mixed with some students getting personal with the attacks. Sophomore Vishnu Swaminathan did not hold back his thoughts on Lincoln Riley Vishnu Swaminathan: I feel as though he\u2019s out to get USC. I feel like he\u2019s just messing around right now and he\u2019s not really putting his best foot forward.\n\nThe criticism of the team\u2019s performance seemed to lie more with the defense- specifically the unemployed coordinator. Ladenfield goes on to praise the USC Quarterback Ladenfield : Offense is still performing with Caleb Williams, but we couldn\u2019t really do much when we\u2019re giving up 40 plus points.\n\nSenior Jack Carter also believes the problem lies elsewhere. Jack Carter:  The defensive issues were starting to show up in the middle and it\u2019s kind of hard to make a big change in like coordinators in the middle of a season. So I definitely understand, like why it took so long for our coordinator get booted.\n\nThere was unanimous praise for the teams Quarterback Caleb Williams, who turned in another phenomenal season. Computer Engineering & Computer Science major Nate Boxer shared his feelings on the Junior Quarterback Nate Boxer: Well, we had the reigning Heisman champ, you know, after winning the Heisman Trophy last year, Caleb showed us his notes where he wanted to win a PAC 12 championship, win another Heisman winner, national championship. I mean, we started off the year like six know seven or something like that. And we just lost like the last like whatever, five games, the most important one. So it\u2019s kind of totally flopped.\n\nReactions about the team moving to the covenant big 10 conference were also mixed. Freshmen Annie Shields gave a unique perspective on the matter. Annie Shields: As an athlete, like in general, I\u2019m really, really excited because it\u2019s going to be like better competition. But also there\u2019s like nerve anxiety, especially because like the traveling too. So I think it\u2019s going to be like super interesting to see like how the adjustment goes, like with that whole situation.\n\nBoxer goes on to share is feelings on the move. Boxer: Honestly, I\u2019m a little scared. I think. I think we\u2019re kind of going to get whipped in the Big Ten. I mean, against teams like powerhouse schools like Michigan.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say something needs to change with the Trojans. Television will be boring without \u2018SC in the mix.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Qais Adawiya\n```"}

(AP/Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nNovember 30, 2023 at 5:54 pm PST\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 From top to bottom, the Kings look dominant; all four lines are generating points and goaltending has been stellar. The Kings went 2-1-0 this week, first routing Anaheim and Montreal before losing a close one to the Capitals. Wednesday\u2019s loss aside, Los Angeles\u2019 offense continued to shine.\n\nThe Pacific Division is as close as can be right now. The Golden Knights are on a three-game skid and now only lead the division by one point. Behind Vegas are the Canucks, who have regressed a bit, losing multiple divisional games after starting the season on a tear. The Kings trail Vancouver by two points and are three points out of the division lead. Thanks to the win streak, Los Angeles holds third place comfortably and is eight points ahead of the Flames and Kraken.\n\nThe season is still young, but the Pacific seems to be a three-team race between the defending champions and two up-and-coming, Cup-hungry teams. This week, L.A. was first tasked with beating the struggling Anaheim Ducks. The Kings took control of the game early thanks to two first-period scores and never looked back. Left winger Kevin Fiala was the first to find the back of the net on an impressive play where his shot deflected off goaltender John Gibson\u2019s elbow for the goal.\n\nThe Kings displayed their depth two minutes later, when fourth liner Arthur Kaliyev lit the lamp to give Los Angeles a 2-0 lead. L.A. scored a pair of goals in the second period too, with Fiala tallying his second of the night. The game finished 5-2 in Los Angeles\u2019 favor and goaltender Cam Talbot saved 29 shots, picking up his 10th win of the year.\n\nThe Kings followed up that performance with their fifth straight win on Saturday against the Canadiens. Goaltender Pheonix Copley earned his third career shutout in Los Angeles\u2019 4-0 drubbing. Copley has still yet to lose in regulation this season, and while his stats might not be elite, he has proved a solid backup option to Talbot.\n\nOnce again, the Kings\u2019 depth contributed to generating goals. Third line winger Carl Grundstrom scored the Kings\u2019 first goal of the night and fourth line center Trevor Lewis also scored in the victory. The player of the game, however, was Thousand Oaks native Trevor Moore. Moore scored twice, including a sweet wraparound goal in the second period that he just barely snuck by Canadiens\u2019 goaltender Jake Allen.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t all gravy. The Kings\u2019 first loss since Nov. 11 came against the Capitals on Wednesday night. Kaliyev opened up scoring to give L.A. a 1-0 lead in the first, but the Kings\u2019 offense was no match for Washington. The Caps tied the game just three minutes later, giving them the momentum to go on and win. Washington would next capitalize on a second-period turnover directly in front of Talbot to take a 2-1 lead. Centerman Connor McMichael scored the game-winner and assisted on the first goal for the Capitals.\n\n22-year-old Kaliyev shined this week, with a point in each of the three games. With a plus/minus of plus-seven, the Uzbek has been efficient when out on the ice and should move up the lines if he maintains these numbers. Even including this week\u2019s loss, the Kings\u2019 goalie tandem has continued to be stout. L.A. hasn\u2019t allowed more than two goals in a game since Nov. 9 and Talbot and Copley have split time nicely in net.\n\nThis week, the Kings will host the Avalanche before going on the road to face the Blue Jackets and Canadiens for the second and final time. Colorado will be tough \u2014 the Avs have won four straight and narrowly lead the Central Division. The Kings are still yet to lose on the road and will enter Tuesday\u2019s game in Columbus with a 9-0-0 away record. Considering the Blue Jackets are one of the NHL\u2019s worst teams, it should be easy business for Los Angeles. The Kings will then try to sweep the Canadiens next, another team that has struggled mightily.\n\nWhile the win streak is over, the Kings are still 7-2-1 in their last 10 games and right among the West\u2019s best. With so much success on the road this season, Los Angeles should be looking forward to its next stretch, which includes four straight away games. The Kings will welcome the Colorado Avalanche to Crypto.com Arena on Sunday at 5 p.m.\n```"}

And at the time we knew that we would have gotten in trouble if we had opened our presents. And so, we very, very sneakily and very quietly ripped open a little section of the wrapping paper so that we could see exactly what was inside.

Coming off of an underwhelming performance on Friday against Oklahoma, the Trojans stormed back for a commanding win over the Eagles. The game was fairly even early in the first; USC got some promising offensive touches, but was initially unable to shake the Eagles. It wasn\u2019t long, though, before the Trojans got hot. USC went on an 11-4 run to make the score 24-16 behind a pair of 3\u2032s from fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis, who had 14 of the Trojans\u2019 first 24 points. \u201cOnce he gets going and gets hot, it\u2019s hard to stop a player like that,\u201d junior guard Kobe Johnson said after the game. Another 17-6 run in the middle of the period widened USC\u2019s lead, and Eastern Washington seemed to lose more of its offensive edge as time went on. And despite Ellis\u2019 dominance, the Trojans shared the ball well early. If it wasn\u2019t Ellis, it was sophomore forward Kijani Wright draining free throws after contact, or graduate forward DJ Rodman sinking a 3, or sophomore forward Vince Iwuchukwu cutting through the lane for a dunk. The Trojans had 16 first-half bench points compared to only five from Eastern Washington. By the half, the score had ballooned to 52-33 USC. Freshman guard Isaiah Collier got off to a relatively quiet start, scoring only two points in the first half. But he started the second with a bang: his seven points in the first three minutes of play helped the Trojans build up a 13-3 run. Despite his early struggles, Collier finished the game with 15 points and six assists. The most surprising stat? \u201cNo live ball turnovers for a game,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cHe\u2019s never done that before. So we\u2019re very appreciative that he watched some video this week and has made an effort to improve. That\u2019s what college basketball is all about, and we expect him to keep doing it.\u201d USC kept its foot on the gas throughout the second half, eventually amassing a 32-point lead. Their 106 points were the most the Trojans have scored in a game so far this season. They never led by less than 21 in the second half. Five Trojans (Ellis, Johnson, Collier, Wright, and Iwuchukwu) scored in double digits, but Ellis still established himself as a standout. He had 19 points in the first half and recorded a career high eight made 3-pointers in the game. Ellis shot 80% from beyond the arc on the night. \u201cHe is one of the greatest shooters I\u2019ve ever coached,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cI was [coaching] in the NBA before college, so that says a lot.\u201d But Ellis, who ended the game with 28 points and two steals, had high praises for his teammates, especially the big men. \u201cThings open up tremendously when they\u2019re finishing,\u201d Ellis said of the Trojans\u2019 frontcourt. \u201cWe need them to play big this coming Saturday. We believe in them, and we trust that they will.\u201d Wright contributed 12 points and five rebounds for the game, while Iwuchukwu finished with 13 points and six boards. Johnson showed off his defensive prowess with three steals, on top of 12 points and seven assists. The win over Eastern Washington was a key victory for the Trojans, who were bumped out of the AP  Top 25 poll  after their loss to unranked Oklahoma on Friday. USC is also facing a daunting upcoming slew of games: five of the next six matchups will be on the road, including Gonzaga on Dec. 2 and Auburn on Dec. 17. This all comes before they begin Pac-12 play at Oregon on Dec. 28. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be prepared for March,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cNobody cares about who\u2019s the best team in November; they care about who\u2019s the best team in March.\u201d The Trojans take on No. 11 Gonzaga at the Legends of Basketball Las Vegas Invitational Saturday at 7 p.m. PST.\n```"}

(Photo by Katie Simons)\n\nBy Katie Simons\nNovember 30, 2023 at 3:25 pm PST\n\nFor generations, students have typically been forced to learn foreign languages using paper worksheets and flashcards, but workers at the USC Academic Innovation and Research Engagement (AIRE) hope to change that with the virtual reality (VR) Study Lab.\n\n\u201cAnyone can learn Spanish for a classroom \u2014 textbook, memorize a list of vocab words, and be tested on it,\u201d said Nahon Belay, a sophomore office assistant for the project. \u201cYou can\u2019t [really] learn languages unless you\u2019re being immersed in it. You can\u2019t learn languages unless you\u2019re speaking it and applying it in the real world, which is why I think this is a really important tool.\u201d\n\nAIRE hosted its first VR Language Learning workshop Thursday afternoon in Taper Hall. Students and faculty were invited to try out the new technology and practice their speaking skills in realistic virtual environments. The event was used to gain feedback from users in the hopes of using the technology in language courses in the spring.\n\nBelay credited the creation of the project to Monica Garcia Prado, an academic program manager who works with AIRE. \u201c[She] is really passionate about implementing this in the classroom,\u201d Belay said. \u201cI think next semester she wants to do more of the labs and then slowly integrate it into classrooms if she can. Obviously, the end goal is we want to have them in language classrooms where students can use them for free.\u201d\n\nThe idea of using VR for language learning began this fall when Garcia Prado wrote a note to Belay, who is a Spanish II student, to try out different language learning VR apps. Now, AIRE is partnering with the language learning app Mondly and the Meta Quest 2 VR headsets to put users in real-life virtual situations performing practical tasks like speaking to a taxi driver, checking in at a hotel and shopping in the language of their choice.\n\n\u201cI liked that they did give prompts so you don\u2019t feel lost or overwhelmed,\u201d said Zankway Oo, a program assistant at the Office of Overseas Studies. \u201cI went with [purchasing] a train ticket in Europe, in Spain.\u201d\n\nThe languages are offered in three different levels: beginner, intermediate and advanced. According to Belay, the beginning level provides users with prompts and three responses in the chosen language and English. The user then chooses one response and practices their pronunciation with the answer. The intermediate level provides prompts, but does not give users pre-written responses. The advanced level provides no prompts for users, instead expecting them to respond verbally to what they hear, like they would in a real conversation.\n\nHowever, in the intermediate and advanced level, the VR still expects specific responses, which can be challenging for native speakers who have specific accents or use certain slang terms. \u201cIf you are a native speaker or have a background with the language where you kind of know some slang terminology or local dialects, [the program] doesn\u2019t really take those into account with the software,\u201d said Michele Heilman, a senior geodesign major who tried beginner Arabic and intermediate Portuguese. \u201cSo I\u2019m sure over time they\u2019ll start to incorporate more slang or local dialects and then it will be more realistic because it is VR and it is a realistic immersion experience, but in some ways it can\u2019t capture some of the things that you experience if you\u2019re actually there.\u201d\n\nWhile the program still has improvements to make, Oo believes that even with its faults, this type of innovative technology is a great step forward to making language learning more practical. \u201c[The VR was] easily more immersive, more fun, more engaging and it\u2019s more relevant to today,\u201d Oo said. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re talking about students here, so we have to make sure we\u2019re relevant to what the current climate is, and VR technology is definitely on the rise and it\u2019s been implemented in other places, so why not cultural immersion?\u201d\n```"}

Adjunct professors and Adjunct Faculty Alliance-UAW (AFA-UAW) supporters gathered in the SCA courtyard where James Savoca, adjunct associate professor in the Division of Film & Television Production, gave a speech to participants and supporters before leading a march to Bovard Auditorium.\n\n\u201cBeing public, it\u2019s the best protection you have,\u201d Savoca said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the right thing,\u201d he continued, adding that \u201cwe have to continue to grow.\u201d\n\nParticipants marched down Watt Way and Childs Way before turning the corner onto Trousdale Parkway, with the group chanting phrases such as \u201ctuition goes up every day, pay your professors at SCA.\u201d Once the group reached Bovard, Savoca entered the building and delivered AFA-UAW\u2019s official letter of intent to unionize to the USC Office of the Provost. The letter urges the university to recognize AFA-UAW and cooperate in \u201cbargaining a contract that reflects the value of [adjunct professors\u2019] contributions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go through all the bull****, we want them to just say, \u2018yeah, we understand, and we want to recognize you,\u2019\u201d Savoca said in a speech to the crowd after delivering the letter. \u201cSo that\u2019s what we\u2019re asking for. So plan A has been very nice and non-adversarial.\u201d\n\nThe march follows the newly formed USC Graduate Student Workers union\u2019s (GSWOC-UAW) \u2018last chance picket\u2019 on Nov. 9. The GSWOC has been bargaining with the university to receive benefits such as increased wages and protections against discrimination, and were set to go on strike on Nov. 28 if the university failed to negotiate in good faith. However, the strike was avoided after the union reached a tentative agreement with the university administration on their first contract on Nov. 26.\n\nApproximately 75% of SCA\u2019s faculty are adjunct professors, and prior to delivery, 74% of adjuncts had signed Adjunct Faculty Alliance-UAW cards, according to the AFA\u2019s email. The adjunct professors are unionizing after SCA began taking away second classes for adjunct professors, \u201coften with very little notice,\u201d which has reduced pay for adjuncts and enabled the university to stop providing health insurance to these faculty members, according to the AFA email.\n\nAdjunct professors are also objecting to SCA\u2019s low or fixed wages, gender disparities, insufficient school-wide diversity and lack of a clear path to full-time positions, as well as adjuncts\u2019 unpaid participation in committees, training and meetings.\n\nIn a statement to Annenberg Media, SCA said that the school \u201chighly values our adjunct professors who are invaluable to our mission.\u201d \u201cThey bring a wealth of expertise, experience and currency to the school and enhance our students\u2019 educational experience,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cWe also appreciate and respect the direct, collegial, and cooperative relationship we have with our adjunct professors and their participation in shared governance. We do not believe they need a third party to speak for them. We remain committed to continuing to provide fair compensation and will continue to directly respond to their concerns and needs as they arise.\u201d\n\nAccording to the AFA\u2019s email sent ahead of Wednesday\u2019s march, \u201cadjuncts love what they do, love USC and the students, and want to continue to provide the excellence both the students and the school deserve. However, USC is severely hindering the adjuncts\u2019 ability to do their job with new and existing policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs professors, we\u2019re not gig workers,\u201d said Missy Pawneshing, an adjunct professor in the division of Film & Television Production, after the march. \u201cWe\u2019re working for this industry, we love what we do, we\u2019re so committed to this school and the students here, and we just want an opportunity to really show that.\u201d\n\nPawneshing explained that while SCA has \u201cbeen making strides in terms of diversity,\u201d the program\u2019s current course limitations for adjunct professors decrease work opportunities and one-on-one time these faculty members have with students, while simultaneously stripping away protections \u2014 such as insurance \u2014 that many adjunct professors do not receive in their primary jobs in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that you bring in women and people of color and non-binary [adjunct professors], and then you immediately say, \u2018oh, but we\u2019ll take away your health insurance,\u2019 or \u2018we\u2019re not going to give you a chance to form these bonds and mentorships with students and with other faculty.\u2019\u201d Pawneshing said. \u201cIt degrades the academic environment, and also academic liberty.\u201d\n\nThis decreased opportunity for adjuncts to teach courses, coupled with the removal of protections such as health insurance, further punishes adjunct professors who are already earning \u201claughable\u201d wages, Division of Film & Television Production Adjunct Assistant Professor Todd Louiso explained.\n\n\u201cWhat I get paid this semester, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d Louiso said. \u201cAnd there are all sorts of things that go along with that, and how much time that I put into teaching my students, because I love it.

And so that\u2019s not even covered with the actual time I\u2019m here teaching.\u201d\n\nLouiso explained that the university also does not cover fees for accommodations that are necessary for adjunct professors to work on campus, as he said that parking costs alone can add up to \u201ca quarter of what you get paid as an adjunct.\u201d\n\nAdjunct professors at USC teach the majority of undergraduate and graduate courses, and are also advisors, mentors and often counselors, as the AFA-UAW email described.\n\n\u201cMy mom\u2019s a teacher, so I\u2019m very much for better pay and better respect for teachers, especially adjunct faculty who take time out of their lives and their careers to teach us so that we can one day be them,\u201d graduate film & television production student Benjamin Nestor said, explaining that adjunct professors \u201chave experience that people who have stayed in academia don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nRecognizing adjunct professors\u2019 unique roles in their classrooms, students from across SCA showed up to the march in solidarity with their own professors, including junior cinema and media studies major Alisha Merchant.\n\n\u201cI just think there\u2019s a lot of things that make this environment really hostile,\u201d Merchant said, \u201cAs somebody who pays for facilities here, and as somebody who expected to come to \u2018the best film school,\u2019 to have professors live here paycheck by paycheck and have to work two jobs and not sustain their families, is just really disheartening, and I think USC should do better.\u201d\n\nSophomore film & television production major Ryn Daniel said, \u201cI feel like there\u2019s been a lot of conversation about how [USC] frames working as a professor here as a privilege, and that\u2019s why people get paid less, but it shouldn\u2019t be that way,\u201d said Ryn Daniel, a sophomore film & television production major \u201cIt should be just people being treated with respect, and respect for the work that they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nWith officials across the university now aware of the union\u2019s requests, AFA-UAW \u201cwants to play nice,\u201d Savoca said. However, if the USC fails to follow up, the union will \u201chave to go to plan B,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf USC becomes a school where you have to be independently wealthy to teach here as an act of service instead of a job that is meaningful employment, that\u2019s gonna hurt our students in the long run,\u201d Adjunct Assistant Professor in the John Wells Division of Writing for Screen & Television Ivy Sunderji explained. \u201cIf they don\u2019t pay us enough to actually maintain our homes in L.A., if we don\u2019t have health insurance, we won\u2019t be well enough to teach. We\u2019ll have to leave, and that\u2019s going to hurt the quality of the education, because we will limit the points of view that our students have to learn from.\u201d\n```"}

Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and Jewish Americans for Fairness in Education filed the complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco, reporting many \u201cincidents of intimidation, harassment and physical violence\u201d directed towards Jewish students for the very first time.\n\nUC President Michael Drake and UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ were named as defendants among other officials in the complaint. Twenty-three law student organizations on Berkeley campus have policies that ban Zionist speakers and restrict Jewish law students from accessing networking opportunities, earning pro-bono hours and more, the Brandeis Center alleges in a press release.\n\nThe complaint cites UC Berkeley Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky, who said that the policy \u201cexcludes \u201890 percent or more\u2019 of Jewish students at Berkeley law,\u201d according to the press release. Chemerinsky has spoken out about anti-Semitism at Berkeley before.\n\n\u201cI am a 70-year-old Jewish man, but never in my life have I seen or felt the antisemitism of the last few weeks,\u201d Chemerinsky wrote in an Oct. 29 opinion piece for the Los Angeles Times. However, he disagreed with the basis of the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cStudent organizations have the First Amendment right to choose their speakers, including based on their viewpoint,\u201d Chemerinsky said to The Hill. \u201cAlthough there is much that the campus can and does do to create an inclusive learning environment, it cannot stop speech even if it is offensive.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit said UC Berkeley\u2019s lack of action in addressing the student groups\u2019 anti-Semetic policies betrayed not only its Jewish students and faculty, but also UC\u2019s adherence to civil rights and equal treatment.\n\n\u201cThe school is quick to address other types of hatred, but why not anti-Semitism?\u201d Kenneth L. Marcus, current founder and chairman of the Brandeis Center, Attorney for Plaintiff, and a graduate of UC Berkeley School of Law, said in the press release.\n\nUC Berkeley said in a statement to KPIX-TV that they believe the complaint is inconsistent with the First Amendment and that as a public university, it doesn\u2019t have the \u201clegal right to stop demonstrations or expression that many would consider to be offensive.\u201d\n\nHannah Schlacter, a UC Berkeley graduate business student and plaintiff in the lawsuit, told KPIX that the organizations filed the lawsuit because students want to see systemic change and their concerns taken seriously.\n\n\u201cSo, systemic change would mean that on the Berkeley website when they talk about free speech, then they should identify what is antisemitism, what is Islamophobia, what are hate crimes against Jews and what are hate crimes against Muslims,\u201d Schlacter said to CBS.\n```"}

The South Carolina native shared their thoughts about the concept of objectivity for journalists from underrepresented communities.\n\nTre\u2019Vell Anderson: Objectivity is a machination of white supremacy. Objectivity is just subjectivity from the vantage point of those who are already in power. Everybody has biases. Nobody can be objective. But what we can be as journalists, right? We can be accurate. We can be precise. We can be thorough.\n\nUSC students with Tre'Vell Anderson and Dr. Allissa V. Richardson. (Photo by Kaleef Starks)\n\nA journalist who centers stories about identities along the margins, Anderson encourages journalists to challenge the status quo through their storytelling for more representation. Anderson: Our stories will be disregarded, they will be diminished, they will be disrespected. That\u2019s just the landscape that we\u2019re dealing with and that\u2019s because the foundation of our industry has already disrespected us and our stories. So, that\u2019s going to continue. If we are interested in changing what this record looks like as it relates to our communities, we are going to have to play the game. By which I mean, how you can make these stories feel important and of consequence to the people who are in power, so that we can continue telling them, so that more people can see the possibilities of how they can exist.\n\nThey also shared their thoughts about the notion of how bias is seen for reporters of color and/or those from excluded communities. They feel that their identity improves their reporting. Anderson: The problem is it\u2019s only our biases as black people, as queer people, as folks from historically excluding communities that get deemed as a problem. Our counterparts, their biases, it\u2019s just normal. I think what we\u2019re trying to get to a place and an articulation of, in terms of being black journalists specifically, but I think this applies to other communities as well. My life experiences and the identities that have shaped me can always help inform the work that I\u2019m doing, and if we\u2019re able to acknowledge the truth of our realities as human beings, and our complexities as human beings, that only improves the reporting.\n\nRichardson says Anderson\u2019s visit is a display of \u2018inclusion in real time\u2019.

(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)\n\nBy Sarah Arencibia and Ruben Flores November 30, 2023 at 12:24 pm PST\n\nTrojans disappointed by the lack of success and inspiration from this year\u2019s football team might want to look to the USC women\u2019s basketball team for plenty of both. USC\u2019s 85-44 victory against Cal Poly Tuesday night not only boosted the Trojan winning streak to six games straight, but saw Aaliyah Gayles\u2019 collegiate scoring debut and Juju Watkins breaking a decades-old record.\n\nPerhaps the biggest show of dedication and drive from Tuesday night came from Gayles, a freshman who underwent intensive rehabilitation for the past year and a half, preventing her from playing. During her senior year of high school, she suffered multiple gunshot wounds while at a house party, putting her through multiple operations and forcing her to relearn how to walk. After months of physical therapy, Gayles finally got her chance to shine on the court again.\n\n\u201cShe has such an amazing comeback story,\u201d said Melie Haile, who went to Spring Valley High School with Gayles. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019d say that it\u2019s not even a comeback story because it\u2019s like she never left. But her story is definitely a testimony to strength, and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of her.\u201d\n\nGayles stepped onto the court for only four minutes in the final quarter, but in that time she was able to sink her first three-pointer in the #3 Trojan jersey, making the crowd erupt.\n\n\u201cHer ability to shake back at such a fast pace, I think she\u2019s changed the face of not sports, but the game forever because of her whole story,\u201d Haile said. \u201cIt shows strength and resilience. I think she has such a bright future ahead of her, and I\u2019m so excited to see what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nGayles was first spotted on the court three weeks ago during pregame warmups before USC\u2019s game against Ohio State, cheering on her teammates from the sidelines. The following week she began to play. Now with four points on the board, Gayles is just getting started.\n\n\u201cShe maybe had a slow start in her first couple games, but you would too if you were out for two years,\u201d said Kennedy Coats, a friend of Gayles. \u201cI think she\u2019s on the come up. She\u2019s making her way back to the star that we all know that she can be, the star that USC recruited. So I\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\nGayles wasn\u2019t the only Trojan owning the spotlight Tuesday. Star freshman Juju Watkins continued to wow the college basketball world by scoring her fourth 30-point game this season, passing the previous single-season school record of three 30-point games as a freshman held by legend Lisa Leslie since 1990. The only catch? Leslie accomplished it over the course of 30 games. For Watkins, it\u2019s only been six.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it just goes to show that she really does live up to her name,\u201d Haile said. \u201cAnd it also is a testament to all her hard work and dedication as well because you know, that type of stuff is not easy at all. To be able to break that many records and you know, make history.\u201d\n\nWatkins has been named as PAC-12\u2032s Freshman of the Week for every week she\u2019s been on the court, with all signs pointing towards the former top recruit continuing the streak.\n\n\u201cShe puts on a show,\u201d Coats said. \u201cA masterclass every game I\u2019ve been to, breaking records every game I\u2019ve been to, she\u2019s a star. She\u2019s definitely the type of player that could bring this team to a championship, so we\u2019re excited to see that.\u201d\n\nWith a record of 6-0, the women\u2019s basketball team is already ranked No.6 in the Associated Press\u2019 poll, a ranking not held by the Trojans since 1994, Leslie\u2019s senior year. But even with both the team\u2019s hype and the stellar stats to back it up, Gayles\u2019 friends say the women\u2019s basketball team is still underrated.\n\n\u201cI feel like women are always overlooked and just like, not really given the credit that they deserve,\u201d Haile said. \u201cSo for our girls basketball team to be coming in as such a powerful force, people can\u2019t help but notice. We are breaking so many records and we\u2019re doing so well. The recognition will come if they just keep doing what they\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d\n\nSince USC football ran out of gas towards the end of the season, many Trojan sports fans have been left feeling somewhat let down. The women\u2019s basketball team could offer a hopeful alternative.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a struggle to get women\u2019s sports in the spotlight,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cEven now, especially when women\u2019s basketball is in this big cultural moment. These women are playing great basketball. I think everybody should tune into USC women\u2019s basketball this year for sure.\u201d\n```"}

NameDrop is the name of the new Apple feature available on iPhone iOS 17.1 and WatchOS 10.1 - that basically means the most up-to-date versions. Launched on October 25th, the new feature is part of the Airdrop function. It now allows users to share contact information quickly and seamlessly. Forget about physical business cards lost at the bottom of your bag or this one note in your phone\u2019s folder that you can\u2019t find.\n\nWhile it seems fairly harmless, this new feature has been raising concerns about how easy it has become to gain access to private information. Law enforcement agencies across the country have issued warnings about digital safety and safeguarding private information. Kendra Walther, USC Associate Professor of the Information Technology Practice, thinks that we should proceed with caution.\n\nKendra Walther: \u201cI think overall, it could be helpful using NameDrop in the way Apple has introduced it, but there might be some concerns about the default settings and privacy concerns around that.\u201d\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the Jefferson Hills Police Department shared a Facebook post where they addressed parents to encourage them to \u201cchange these settings after the update on your children\u2019s phones.\u201d Mykalah King, a freshman studying Psychology, opens up about how it could invade the users\u2019 privacy.\n\nMykalah King: \u201cI think that everyone has their own privacy preferences, I think that I don\u2019t want not knowing where my phone number is going around and people are sending it to people\u201d\n\nSo, how does the feature actually work? To share information with another compatible iPhone, all you have to do is bring the two devices near each other. If you want to disable the NameDrop function, you simply need to head to your phone\u2019s settings, select the AirDrop tab, and then toggle the \u201cBringing Devices Together\u201d option off.\n\nApple explains privacy is one of their leading values: \u201cPrivacy is a fundamental human right. It\u2019s also one of our core values. Which is why we design our products and services to protect it. That\u2019s the kind of innovation we believe in,\u201d Apple says on their webpage.\n\nKendra Walther: \u201cI\u2019m assuming that most of the contact information that would be shared would be names and phone numbers, right? In the olden days, these used to be published in phonebooks and you could opt out, but the default was to opt in and so as long as the individual has control over what\u2019s received and what they are sending to somebody else, I\u2019m not too concerned about that level of data privacy.\u201d\n\nThe default mode was turned on. However, to share your contact information you need to hit the \u201cshare\u201d button that pops up asking for approval to transfer contact information. But a bigger concern is emerging from the ever-advancing technology - and it\u2019s the takeover of A.I., as Barrett Koster, Senior Lecturer in Information Technology at the Viterbi School of Engineering, says.\n\nBarrett Koster: \u201dI generally turn everything off, I\u2019m old school. I don\u2019t like it doing stuff without my doing it. So this particular feature I\u2019m not worried about. AI in general... Oh you wanted this, you wanted that, maybe not...\u201d\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Thomas Legrand.\n```"}

Once a USC Song Girl... and now a fitness guru, she includes this special ingredient in her daily life. Driscoll: \u201cI love garlic, I also like how you can grill garlic or you cook it, so if your not using a powder it\u2019s very fresh.\u201d Taking it in the raw form is good, but did you know you can also take it in a pill form? Interestingly enough, my grandfather was the one who studied and patented what are called nanospheres of garlic. These polymer tablets. He researched all of the developments. Unfortunately he passed away when I was just a baby, but my mom knows all too well about garlic. Vaughn: \u201cHe patented multiple products with the nanospheres and also with garlic, um, as a healthy lifestyle. And um the garlic research started in our kitchen. So for me as a 15-year old girl bringing friends home to the house, the garlic, wafting in our house. And, um, had to explain that to a lot of friends. But he truly was brilliant.\u201d\n\nDespite my moms hesitance to the garlic, as a matter of fact, for thousands of years, it was used as a medical treatment in ancient cultures. Den\u00e1 Brummer, a food professor here at USC explains the history as to why garlic is so good for you. Brummer: \u201cOne of the most common herbs used throughout the world, whether it\u2019s in China, Egypt, or even Roman civilization, was garlic.\u201d She says that people can never have enough garlic. Brummer: \u201cI think people shouldn\u2019t discount the notion of adding garlic to their food. It offers lots of nutritional and chemical benefits that work in many beneficial ways. So a little garlic can save the day.\u201d And my mom agrees. Vaughn: I think its beneficial to our entire, you know, livelihood. Just to be able to take that on a daily basis is a simple supplement that you can take to help your overall well being and it\u2019s not going to do your body any harm by taking that, but it will help your body. That\u2019s what he was most impressed with with the clinical studies and things like that I know some love garlic and some hate it, but maybe knowing the health benefits can help you use it more in your life... but... try not to forget a breath mint.

(Photo by Marie Louise Leone)\n\nBy Marie Louise Leone\nNovember 30, 2023 at 6:41 am PST\n\nToday at 1 p.m., more than one hundred protesters gathered on UCLA campus for a Students for Justice in Palestine die-in demonstration to recognize Palestinians killed in Gaza in the last month and a half. The protest started at UCLA\u2019s Perloff Hall, where several demonstrators gave speeches, and marched to Royce Hall. There, an organizer who did not give their name gave a statement about being a Palestinian American to cheers from the crowd and vocalized their goal:\n\nProtester: The goal is to be disruptive, but in a different manner, one that speaks to students and passer-bys visually with a framework of nonviolent action. We are asking you to lie down to illustrate the martyrs that deserved to be treated as more than numbers and statistics. This form of protest has been done through generations and we will stay as long as it takes to honor that. We will be reading the names of martyrs and sharing testimonies. So just - to honor the martyrs of Gaza, please find a place, take up space and lie down.\n\nWhile students passed through the UCLA campus to classes, more than one hundred demonstrators lay down on the brick walkway outside Royce Hall, chanting pro-Palestinian slogans as they protested. Speakers at the event included voices from the UCLA campus and diversity groups. Ryan, who did not give a last name, gave a statement as a representative for the Jewish Voice for Peace.\n\nRyan: I am here as an anti-Zionist Jew, speaking of the decades long humanitarian crisis caused by the occupation and apartheid in Palestine. This work has been made difficult by acts of aggression committed by design, a state that weaponizes Jewish fear and greed, and the attempts to conflate anti-Zionism or criticism of the state of Israel with anti-Semitism.\n\nOne organizer Layla, who only gave a first name for fear of retaliation, spoke to why they were here today.\n\nLayla: I\u2019m here as a show of mourning for the over 20,000 people that have been killed in Gaza over the past few months. They have been sort of relentlessly bombed and attacked by Israeli military forces. And this has resulted in thousands of children dying and thousands and tens of thousands of adult civilians dying without, you know, the recognition that and empathy and action that they deserve.\n\nLayla felt that the pro-Palestinian students at UCLA had each other\u2019s backs, as shown by the turnout for the various SJP actions that have been organized in recent weeks.\n\nLayla: I have felt incredibly supported by the other members of this of the UCLA community, the people that have been showing up to these actions in the past two weeks. I think there\u2019s many, many students that are resonating with, you know, the that are that are showing empathy and showing our all these emotions and their solidarity with the people of Palestine.\n\nSome students, Layla says, feel unsafe being too visibly Palestinian, pointing to the shooting on Saturday in Vermont of three Palestinian college students who were wearing traditional Palestinian keffiyeh scarves.\n\nLayla: People have been assaulted for, you know, wearing keffiyeh is which is a cultural symbol on campus. And so the die in is not just to encourage university administration to support show support for the people of Palestine, but also for their own students here at UCLA who are unsafe on campus right now, given the - how intense the Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism is.\n\nAs more than a hundred UCLA students gathered to lie down, the organizers began reading names of the Palestinian dead. The protesters say they object to UCLA and other universities\u2019 alleged investments with companies such as BlackRock, a private investor in the production of military hardware. Their message to UCLA and the UC system: stop what they called the funding of a war in the Middle East.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Marie Louise Leone.\n```"}

That\u2019s right, Spotify is back for the seventh year of its annual personalized data set dubbed Spotify Wrapped, revealing users\u2019 top artists, songs, podcasts and minutes spent listening.\n\nJunior accounting major Chloe Benitez said she was \u201csuper excited\u201d to see her Wrapped when she woke up Wednesday morning. \u201cThe first thing I did was text my friends to have them send me what they had,\u201d said Benitez.\n\nJeremy Gruber, a digital marketing expert and adjunct professor of music industry in USC\u2019s Thornton School of Music, applauded the company for the concept. \u201cWhen it was invented a few years ago for the first time, it was a genius marketing campaign by Spotify,\u201d said Gruber. \u201cI think it\u2019s really, really smart that they offered a way for fans and artists to engage and share their passion for music.\u201d\n\nOne way that Spotify\u2019s 574 million yearly users can engage with each other is through a new slide introduced this year called \u201cSound Town\u201d which shows each user which city in the world had the most similar listening habits to them. Junior accounting major Elle Tonnu, who listened to 37,000 minutes this year, got San Luis Obispo, California, as her town \u2014 somewhere she has never been. At least, not yet. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll visit and make friends and we can listen to music together,\u201d said Tonnu.\n\nA few of Tonnu\u2019s and Benitez\u2019s top artists included The Strokes, Harry Styles and Coldplay. Spotify users can engage with their favorite artists through a personalized \u201cthank you\u201d video message created by artists for their top fans. More than 40,000 artists uploaded videos this year, according to Spotify.\n\nFeatures like the artist thank-you videos and Sound Town are nice for users, but Gruber, who works with artists who have music on Spotify, warned against the idea that these were just for the benefit of listeners. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice thing to do on its face, but Spotify doesn\u2019t pay artists, Spotify pays rights holders,\u201d said Gruber. This means Spotify pays record labels and publishers who have relationships with the artists.\n\nFor this reason, Gruber said it\u2019s likely that Spotify will benefit more from something like the artist thank-you videos than the actual artists themselves. Tonnu said her favorite part of Wrapped is finding new artists to listen to. \u201cIt\u2019s just fun to see what your friends are listening to and then hop on to what they\u2019re listening to and compare your styles with each other,\u201d said Tonnu.\n```"}

Experts weigh in on the deployment of SPOT, the robot pup.\n\nSpot robot in a demonstration by the Honolulu Police Department. (Photo courtesy of Jennifer Sinco Kelleher for AP News)\n\nBy James Bao November 29, 2023 at  6:30 pm PST\n\nIn Los Angeles, there\u2019s a new officer on patrol \u2014 and reactions are mixed. The Los Angeles Police Department deployed their newly acquired technology, a canine-looking robot, at a standoff with an \u201carmed\u201d man in Hollywood on Nov. 8. Officers arrived around 4 a.m. at the intersection of Melrose and Western avenue after receiving a report of an armed man on a metro bus. They were unsuccessful at establishing contact with the suspect, which led to the deployment of the robodog to get a better view of the interior of the bus. The robot, otherwise known as a \u201cQuadruped Unmanned Ground Vehicle (Q-UGV),\u201d assisted officers at the scene to confirm the man\u2019s location and status \u2014 asleep. After a two hour standoff the man awoke, got off the bus, spoke to the police and was taken into custody for further questioning. His weapon turned out to be a BB gun.\n\nFollowing  an 8-4 vote  at a city council meeting in May, the Los Angeles Police Foundation, a non-profit organization aimed at supporting local police, received the greenlight to donate SPOT, a Q-UGV machine valued at nearly $280,000, to the LAPD. But concerns and criticism started long before. In 2021, the public first saw police use this robot in New York City. \u201c Digidog \u201d was the name given to the technology by the New York Police Department. After its  deployment in a home invasion and at a public housing building , the robot dog was compared to dystopian surveillance drones by critics for its aggressive policing, especially in low-income communities or communities of color, according to  the New York Times .\n\n\u201cIt may not be at a specific point that an AI system becomes unethical, but that its use and its values might have the potential for harm, from the beginning,\u201d wrote Jasmine McNealy, associate professor in the Department of Media Production, Management and Technology at the University of Florida in a statement to Annenberg Media. New York Councilman and Democrat Ben Kallos compared New York\u2019s Digidog to the robotic killer dogs featured in a 2017 episode of TV show \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d and called the device\u2019s presence a sign of \u201cpolice militarization,\u201d according to a  press release  in March 2021. As a result of the backlash and its ethical concerns, the NYPD ended its lease with Boston Dynamics, the robot\u2019s manufacturer, four months earlier than intended.\n\nL.A. Councilmember Hugo Soto-Mart\u00ednez said he has always disagreed with police usage of the robot dogs. \u201cThis surveillance [of Digidog in New York] is not only disturbing, it is deeply unjust,\u201d  he wrote on X , formerly Twitter, before voting no at the L.A. Public Safety Committee meeting in January. \u201cEspecially when talking about low-income tenants and communities of color\u201d, he added, calling it a dystopian machine.\n\nProfessor of criminal justice at the University of Cincinnati John Eck said questions about the technology\u2019s ethics are better put to the machine\u2019s developers. \u201cIf they are donating the robodog and collecting data to do an evaluation (made available to the public) that will help improve the robopup\u2019s abilities to do good, then they are on the right side of things,\u201d Eck wrote to Annenberg Media. \u201cIf they are expecting taxpayers to fund their experiment, collect no useful information and do not make the information public, they have transgressed.\u201d\n\nDavid Thomas, veteran police officer and professor of forensics studies at Florida Gulf Coast University, weighed in on the situation. Thomas said the public\u2019s opinion toward SPOT may stem from negative media portrayals such as the killer robot dog depicted in the 2005 film War of the Worlds. \u201cThat\u2019s what people see, that\u2019s what they see on the Internet, that\u2019s what they see on social media. So law enforcement has to do a better job of explaining themselves and showing people exactly what [SPOT] can do,\u201d Thomas told Annenberg Media. But Thomas said there\u2019s less to worry about than critics claim. \u201cCritics might be looking at it as like a war of the worlds kind of thing, where the dogs are out attacking people and they think that there\u2019s some other brain that\u2019s driving it,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThe reality is, in this case, that machine is being guided by a law enforcement officer on the other side who has to abide by all of the state statutes and department policies.\u201d\n\nL.A.\u2019s Public Safety Committee voted on whether the private donation of SPOT is permitted in January before the decision was ultimately made by the city council. It was approved 4-1. In May, the city council approved the implementation of the robotic canine on L.A. streets but with a short leash. The LAPD must provide quarterly reports on Spot\u2019s time, reason and outcome of deployment, along with any issues in operation, according to  the L.A. Times . Additionally, police said that the device would only be dispatched in situations that require SWAT responses.\n\nHamid Khan, an organizer of the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, said he took LAPD\u2019s promise with a grain of salt. \u201cThere\u2019s a long history of mission creep with the LAPD that what we have seen and everything we have called out has then suddenly been transformed into a much wider expansion of its deployment,\u201d he said, comparing the robot dog to the normalization of helicopter fleets and SWAT itself.\n\nEck predicted that SPOT will go down one of two paths in the next five years. \u201cIn five years, the technology is [either] abandoned for the next sparkly object, or become mainstream and people complain when it\u2019s not used,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBefore its deployment last week, the robotic canine was seen in Koreatown in early August, which LAPD Assistant Chief Dominic Choi said he believed to be the first time the tool was utilized on the streets. In the Koreatown standoff that involved an armed man and police shooting, SPOT was able to retrieve two weapons near the suspect, giving officers safe passage to take the man into custody, according to ABC 7 Los Angeles. The LAPD declined to comment on the effectiveness of the robot dog in recent deployments and on the department\u2019s future plans for the technology.\n```"}

Sichuan Airlines has been approved to resume flights to the United States for the first time after three years of the pandemic.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation has approved a new round of increased flight applications from Chinese airlines. New flights are taking off this week. Chinese airlines have been authorized to operate 35 U.S.-China flights per week, with U.S. airlines operating an equal number, totaling 70 flights. This marks nearly a double increase from 36 flights per week by the end of September.\n\nAdditionally, Sichuan Airlines and Hainan Airlines, two regional Chinese carriers, have been approved to operate U.S.-China routes for the first time in three years. This spells good news for Chinese students at USC.\n\n\u201cThe lack of direct flights has been a major obstacle for me to go home,\u201d said Suchen Yu, a junior Chinese student. Yu\u2019s family is in Hefei, Anhui. This summer marked her first trip back to China since the pandemic. Despite not needing to quarantine, the inconvenience of layovers was a significant hardship.\n\n\u201cWhen the price of a one-way direct flight was $2,000 more, I told myself that layovers weren\u2019t so bad,\u201d said Yu. \u201cBut you realize it\u2019s not the case when you\u2019re actually traveling.\u201d Yu\u2019s round trip this summer included layovers in Hong Kong and Manila. From leaving Los Angeles to arriving at her home, each journey took nearly 30 hours.\n\nShe particularly complained about her experience with Philippine Airlines, saying, \u201cGoing through two bag checks and long queues in a completely foreign country after a long flight is incredibly frustrating.\u201d\n\nLin She, a third-year Computer Science Games student from China, is also pleased with the decision of the U.S. Department of Transportation. \u201cWhen I came to study in 2021, there were hardly any direct flights, and I had to transfer in Dubai. You can imagine how it feels to fly for 10 hours and then another 16 hours. Even now, between China and the U.S., apart from a few opportunities to redeem points, there are hardly any cheap cash tickets. But with the increase in supply, I believe we will soon see a change.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles International Airport (LAX) is one of the U.S. airports with the most flights to China. Because of the geographical advantage, Los Angeles remains the U.S. city with the most flights from Chinese airlines, accounting for 18 of the 35 weekly flights.\n\nFor reasons of fair competition, the U.S. Department of Transportation prohibits Chinese airlines from using newly opened routes that pass through Russian airspace. Due to the shortest path between the U.S. and China requiring a crossing over the Arctic, avoiding Russian airspace means an increase in flight distance, fuel consumption and crew requirements.\n\nThis has little impact on flights from the U.S. West Coast to coastal cities in China, but for East Coast flights or flights to inland China, planes have to reduce load or add stopovers due to insufficient range. Sichuan Airlines noted in its announcement that flights from Los Angeles to Chengdu need to stop in Hangzhou, but cannot board or disembark passengers.\n\nAir China\u2019s New York-Beijing flight needs to stop in Los Angeles, while Hainan Airlines\u2019 Boston-Beijing flight has chosen Seattle. Initially, Hainan Airlines sold tickets for Seattle-Beijing flights, but the Hainan Airlines Seattle office told Annenberg Media that currently, they can only board passengers in Boston.\n\n\u201cBefore the first flight on November 26, we were notified that Seattle could only be a technical stopover, without approval. We are actively coordinating with U.S. DOT, CBP and Seattle Tacoma Airport.\u201d\n\nCurrently, one-way tickets from the United States to China are priced below $450 during the off-season at the end of November. However, due to the fact that flight frequency is far from fully restored to the weekly 330 flights level of 2019, prices around the Christmas holiday period remain high.\n\nLin She said that he will choose to transfer in Tokyo this winter, but if direct flights between China and the U.S. can offer pre-pandemic prices and service levels, he will opt for the more convenient option.\n\nAlthough the issue of Russian airspace may not be resolved for the time being, travel between the two largest economies in the world, which are currently in a phase of restoring relations, is still moving towards normalization. Yu finds solace in the joint commitment by the leaders of both countries to significantly increase flights early next year.\n\n\u201cI would like to go home again next summer, and hopefully by then, it will be back to the pre-pandemic situation.\u201d```"}

Since 2016, when he played just one game due to injury, Allen has finished in the top 10 for first downs in four of the past six seasons.\n\nAllen reached 10,000 career receiving yards against the Jets on Monday Night Football with a fittingly incredible one-handed grab. He became just the second Charger ever to do so (Antonio Gates) and joined Julio Jones, DeAndre Hopkins, Mike Evans, Travis Kelce and Davante Adams as the only active players in the 10K club.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited for Keenan because it really capped off one of those maestro performances for him,\u201d said head coach Brandon Staley after the game. \u201cA career game, a record-setting game.\u201d\n\nAfter the game, Allen reflected on the achievement, emphasizing his resiliency and consistency. \u201cStack up the seasons, stack up the wins. Once you start to do that, then you start to accumulate,\u201d Allen said.\n\nThe records don\u2019t stop there. Allen set a new franchise record with 18 receptions against the Vikings, also becoming the only player in NFL history to have three games with 15+ catches in one season. In the same game, he also threw a 49-yard touchdown to Mike Williams, the first passing touchdown of his career.\n\nWith seven losses already, the Chargers\u2019 season is likely over, but Allen isn\u2019t done quite yet. With six games still remaining, Allen needs just ten receptions, 276 yards and two touchdowns to set new career highs in all three categories.\n\nDespite his many accolades, Allen has yet to be named to an All-Pro team. With six total receivers selected each season, Allen should be a lock to receive his first nod this year.\n```"}

Clinkunbroomer was shot in his patrol car on September 16 while stopped at a red light outside of the Palmdale Sheriff\u2019s station. He was 30-years-old.\n\nThe deputy had collected up to 69 hours of overtime in the two weeks leading up to the shooting and had worked a double shift the day before the incident, reported attorney Brad Gage, a representative of the deputy\u2019s parents. \u201cHad he not been fatigued and exhausted, he would have responded safely; he\u2019d be here today,\u201d said the deputy\u2019s father, Michael Clinkunbroomer.\n\nCounty officials have 45 days to respond to the claim stating the precursor to a wrongful death lawsuit naming the county sheriff\u2019s department and Board of Supervisors before a lawsuit can be filed. \u201cSheriff Luna and the Board of Supervisors knew of the dangers to their employees as a result of intentionally forcing overtime, but intentionally pursued such actions in conscious disregard of the rights and safety of deputies,\u201d Gage wrote in the claim.\n\nProsecutors have charged Kevin Cataneo Salazar, 29, with one count of murder, plus special circumstance allegations of murder of a peace officer, murder committed by lying in wait, murder committed by firing from a car and personal use of a firearm. Cataneo Salazar allegedly followed Clinkunbroomer just before 6 p.m. as he left the sheriff\u2019s Palmdale Station, the district attorney\u2019s office said in a September news release.\n\nMarle Salazar, Salazar\u2019s mother, told the Los Angeles Times her son was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic about five years ago. She claimed he would say he was hearing voices in his head, and sometimes believed cars or people were following him. \u201cThey\u2019re only saying that he was the one that shot the deputy, but nobody is saying he has a record for needing mental help,\u201d Salazar told the Times.\n\nUnder California\u2019s \u201cred flag law\u201d \u2014 the first of such legislation to be enacted in the country \u2013 firearms can be seized from people who are considered a danger to themselves or others.

I\u2019d rather do that any day.\u201d\n\nStudents do have at least some time to get their papers together before the due dates start lining up.

A new on-campus resource from USC Student Life might provide an opportunity to do just that. Previously known as Traditions, the university is working to revamp the area for students to study and hangout after campus hours.\n\nAccording to an email sent from USC Student Life to student leaders, the venue\u2019s potential location will be in the center of campus, and would be open every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night as a hangout space for students. \u201cThis will be a lounge space and will not have programming,\u201d USC Student Life wrote. \u201cWe are also working with university partners to plan for a late-night food option nearby.\u201d\n\nThe email attached a survey asking questions of what students would like to see at the venue. The space could include TVs with a variety of video game hookups, as well as board games allowing students to get away from stressful assignments without having to leave campus. Since the dining halls on campus close at 10 p.m., students can look to the program for a plethora of Tutor Campus Center food and beverage options that might be open much later.\n\nAccording to the survey, the venue could close as early as 8 p.m. and as late as 4 a.m. Students around campus seem ecstatic about the possible campus addition. \u201cThe center would be a really good idea because I live in New North, and the halls are always active after 10 p.m.,\u201d said freshman Economics major Declan Larson. \u201cI always hear people say they are hungry and they want to study, but obviously the dining halls close at 10, so from just a food perspective, that would be a good idea.\u201d\n\nLarson said he believes that a center where people could go to collaborate and do work as well as having other benefits such as video games and food would be a great resource for students to have. Students value the convenience of the venue, noting that not having to leave campus is a plus. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d said freshman Economics major Sam Mitchell. \u201cI don\u2019t really think there\u2019s a lot of late-night options at USC.

In a historic bout, Brazil suffered their first ever home loss during a World Cup qualifier, falling to Argentina 1-0, however, the match itself was overshadowed by violence amongst the fans. Before the match, chaos broke out as fans from both nations were separated by Brazilian police who were seen clubbing Argentine fans with their batons.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino issued a statement condemning the violence that transpired before the game, saying that the behaviors, \u201chave no place in our sport or society.\u201d After the historic win, Argentinian forward Lionel Messi took to Instagram to air out his frustrations. \u201cGreat victory in the Maracana although it will be marked by the repression of the Argentinians once again in Brazil. This can\u2019t be tolerated, it\u2019s crazy and it needs to end now!\u201d\n\nThis comes at a time where FIFA is already under fire for the bid process of the 2034 World Cup, with only Saudi Arabia placing their hat in the ring for the chance to host. This prompted an immediate response from human rights groups in an effort to ensure FIFA is upholding their human rights commitments. In the buildup to the 2034 bid, Saudi Arabia is expected to lay out a human rights plan regarding their workers involved in the World Cup expansion by July 2024.\n\nPrevious World Cup host Qatar was found to overwork stadium workers, and were similarly criticized for their poor human rights record. FIFA closed off bidding from countries outside the Asia and Oceania regions in an effort to host the World Cup on five different continents within an eight year period. This comes with public speculation that it is being set up for Saudi Arabia as the 2030 World Cup is to open in Uruguay, and then move to be co-hosted by Morocco, Spain and Portugal. With the rule in place to not be able to host on the same continent within eight years, this makes the only realistic countries Saudi Arabia and Australia, as many countries in the region lack the proper funding.\n\nThe New York Times recently uncovered the relationship between the FIFA president and plans of Saudi Arabia hosting the World Cup, pointing towards other countries like Norway being skeptical of the decision. In August when Saudi Arabia got the bid, people were upset, a sentiment that has grown due to the events that transpired during Tuesday\u2019s match.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia\u2019s sports minister, hopes that this World Cup bid will help Saudi Arabia\u2019s dream of being one of the leaders in the sports world. Over the past two years, the Roshn Saudi League, also backed by the Nation Public Investment Fund, has attracted stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar to help build support for the league. FIFA has eyes on the organization to not have a repeat, while Saudi Arabia continues to campaign for a spot at the top of the sports world.\n```"}

Born in Los Angeles on June 1, 1921, Margaret Huntley Main was the oldest living titleholder of the Rose Court, a selection of young women that serve as ambassadors of the Tournament of Roses, and the local community. Last Friday, she died at the age of 102.\n\nMain was chosen as the queen by the Pasadena Tournament of Roses while she was attending Pasadena City College. In a statement on Facebook, the Rose Parade said, \u201cAs the revered 1940 Rose Queen, her legacy shines as a testament to the Rose Court tradition, and her unwavering dedication to the Tournament of Roses.\u201d She is remembered as, \u201ca timeless symbol of grace, [who] will forever adorn the history of the Rose Parade.\u201d\n\nMain remained involved with the Rose Parade throughout her life.

She also annually attended the October coronation and queens\u2019 luncheon in December until she stopped traveling in 2019.\n\nOn Main\u2019s 100th birthday, The Tournament of Roses honored her with a birthday party in Auburn. The event was attended by then-tournament President Robert Miller who brought Main\u2019s 1940 crown to wear one last time.

Gavin Newsom not vetoed Senate Bill 58, a bill that would have decriminalized natural psychedelics including psilocybin, the psychoactive component of psychedelic mushrooms. If the bill had passed, it would have eliminated criminal penalties for the use and possession of substances containing psilocin and psilocybin such as mushrooms, mescaline and dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Possession was limited to those 21 or older, and the sale or personal exchange of psychedelics would have remained illegal.\n\n\u201cJust very disappointed,\u201d said Jesse Gould, a former U.S. Army ranger who was not happy with the decision. Gould is the founder of the Heroic Hearts Project, an organization he created after discovering the benefits of psychedelic therapy when returning from three deployments to Afghanistan. The Project was also a sponsor of SB 58.\n\n\u201cWe put a lot of time, effort and energy into it. He had ample time to let us know the actual trajectory that he wanted, which he mentioned in his reason for vetoing it. So for us, it wasn\u2019t really a good excuse,\u201d said Gould. \u201cHe could have easily told us that before he wasted three years of time, energy and funding to get there only for him to veto it...I feel like the democracy had spoken.\u201d\n\nThe bill would have also required the California Health and Human Services Agency to research the therapeutic use of the substances and provide findings from the study to the government. The measure originally passed the Senate 21-14, with all Republicans either voting no or abstaining. Several Democrats also opposed the measure.\n\nThe decision to veto the bill has impacted several groups, including criminal justice reform advocates seeking to end the war on drugs and veteran groups that use psychedelic substances to treat PTSD, anxiety and depression. Gould suffered from severe PTSD after returning from deployment. After quitting his investment banking job, he took a trip to Peru where he took part in an ayahuasca retreat. Jesse was amazed that his symptoms had disappeared after he returned from the retreat.\n\n\u201cI had a very challenging but profound experience, and towards the end, it really did seem to change my life in a positive way,\u201d he said. Gould felt that the experience healed some of the traumatic brain injury he sustained during his time as a mortarman.\n\n\u201cFrom my experience, and then talking with other veterans...it seemed like there was this need for at least more people to know that there are other options to explore if they\u2019ve tried everything else.\u201d Gould founded HHP in April 2017, and it has since helped hundreds of veterans overcome their trauma through various treatment programs and recovery resources.\n\nGould said that veterans still face an uncomfortable choice. \u201c[Veterans] risk being declared a criminal, or go overseas to save their own mental health. I don\u2019t know if anybody should feel proud of the fact that a veteran who is struggling has two choices essentially if they fall through the cracks of the VA. But that\u2019s the realistic nature of us as a country not giving veterans the care they deserve.\u201d\n\nMany groups opposed the bill, including groups like the California Statewide Law Enforcement Association and several politicians including California Senate minority leader Brian Jones (R-San Diego). Detractors of the bill believe more clinical research and studies are necessary to verify the safety of the substances. Many psychedelics are still labeled as Schedule I controlled substances, the same category as methamphetamine and heroin, which has made it difficult to conduct research and establish regulations around the substances.\n\nThere was also strong opposition from many parental organizations, including the conservative, faith-based California Family Council due to worries related to the lack of research and the possible dangers of young adults and teenagers experimenting with these substances.\n\nWhile the research around psychotherapy with substances such as psilocybin, LSD, MDMA and ketamine has gained more traction in recent years, there are still many knowledge gaps that exist. Dr. Scott Shannon founded the Wholeness Center, a mental health clinic based in Fort Collins, Colo. which provides specialized psychotherapy services. Shannon said that an individual seeking psychedelic treatment for mental health issues like depression, trauma or PTSD should first undergo an evaluation with a psychotherapist. He calls this preliminary trust-building phase \u201cbuilding the container.\u201d\n\nThen, the individual will be administered the substance and provided with headphones to listen to music, \u201cwhich helps them to focus on the inner work that they need to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d say the field is more determined by the gaps that exist than the knowledge that exists,\u201d said Shannon. \u201cThe research results that we have so far are very exciting but very preliminary.\u201d\n\nShannon said that the results only cover a small amount of what needs to be understood for psychedelics to assume a larger role in society: long-term benefits, durability and long-term risks. \u201cIn the short run, we know that they seem to be quite safe and quite well tolerated, but in the long run, we have more questions than we have answers.\u201d\n\nSome USC students believe that there should be more education and discussion about these substances at the college level. Carly Hamel, a junior studying neuroscience, founded MYCO, a new club at USC that focuses on learning about plants and fungi. She said due to the stigma surrounding psychedelics, she wasn\u2019t surprised by Newsom\u2019s decision to veto SB 58.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much research right now that is being done with psychedelics, especially psilocybin,\u201d said Hamel when asked what steps should be taken to raise more awareness around these substances. \u201cAnd I think we just need to put that out there, to talk about it more and to bring it to our classes. I really think it\u2019s just talking about the research that\u2019s been happening and bringing it to the college level and educating this generation, so in future years, we [will] know more about it.\u201d\n\nWhile Gould and his team at HHP are unable to access the psychedelic substances they rely on in California, they can work with other states that have decriminalized the substances. \u201cWe are making movements in other states that have more [people] that are willing to work with us on [the] veteran mental health crisis. So hopefully we can move forward with them and provide some refuge for veterans in need in California,\u201d said Gould.\n\nHe said the project is working to set up veterans with access to psychedelics in states like Oregon, where the laws are more favorable. \u201cThat\u2019s where my nonprofit comes in, connecting veterans who are not being served by this country to effective means of mental health care.\u201d```"}

This is the team\u2019s second consecutive NCAA tournament under head coach Brad Keller. Keller, who has made numerous appearances in the tournament as an assistant coach, is confident that his team is ready to dance.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve gone through so many things this year, we\u2019ve gone through so many different scenarios,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI think we\u2019re actually kind of battle tested for a lot of different things that can occur. So, I think there\u2019s a lot of confidence there.\u201d\n\nUMBC finished first in the America East Conference with an 8-2 conference record, while also winning the conference tournament. Last year, USC swept the Retrievers at Galen Center in the opening weekend. Despite the victory, Keller knows that this year\u2019s UMBC team will be very different from last season.\n\n\u201cKasey [Crider] is an amazing coach,\u201d Keller said of the Retrievers. \u201cThey run a six-two. They\u2019ve got arms all over the place, they love setting a lot of those arms in crucial times and hit their way out of a lot of things. We got a battle coming up, and I can\u2019t wait to see him.\u201d\n\nFor senior outside hitter Skylar Fields, who has played in four NCAA tournaments during her time with both USC and Texas, having that experience helps her be a mentor to her teammates.\n\n\u201cI think it kinda helps me be able to lead my team a little bit more, let them know that anybody can win on any given night,\u201d Fields said. \u201cOnly thing you can do is survive until the end. So just take it one point at a time, and keep focusing on winning the match.\u201d\n\nDespite ending the regular season on a three-match losing streak, Keller mentioned that making the tournament can rally a team instantaneously.\n\n\u201cHow do you not get fired up for this?\u201d Keller asked with a smile. \u201cThis is the NCAA\u2019s. You earned the right to be in this place, and it\u2019s win or you go home. This is the best thing ever. So there\u2019s no motivation involved. This is what we do, this is what we want to do, we want to be a part of this. We earned the right to be here, and so, if they\u2019re not up for it, they shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nFields echoed Keller\u2019s statement about how making the NCAA\u2019s got the Trojans hyped up for this weekend.\n\n\u201cIt got us super excited. That\u2019s been our goal this whole season was to get into the tournament and then finding out that all of our hard work has paid off is really exciting.\u201d\n\nWith a win over UMBC in the first round, USC will most likely take on the Pitt Panthers on Saturday in Pittsburgh in the second round. The Panthers (25-4) claimed a share of the ACC title with a 16-2 conference record and are the tournament\u2019s No. 4 overall seed. They are also one of the 16 first and second-round NCAA hosts.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really good, their two freshmen are really, really good, well coached,\u201d Keller said. \u201cThat team is efficient, and they are relentless on defense, so it\u2019s gonna be a defensive effort from both teams ... not actually about the serve and pass game.\u201d\n\nAs the Trojans make their way east to take part in the NCAA tournament, Keller is looking forward to the final chapter of the 2023 season with his team.\n\n\u201cHonestly, being around my team at least one more time,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI love the journey, I love these kids, I love what we\u2019re doing here, and any chance I get to be around my staff and my team, I actually love it. So as much as we grind, as much as we are complaining or super happy or super down or whatever it is, we get to do this, and it\u2019s a pretty cool thing.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will take the court against UMBC at 1 p.m. PST on Friday to kick off their campaign for a national championship.\n```"}

One week, a team may face an opponent like the Detroit Lions, who can dominate on the ground with a fantastic offensive line and running back duo. Next, they may have to prepare for a team like the Miami Dolphins, with two number-one receivers who can score at any moment. Now more than ever, franchises are scouring the college ranks for modern second and third-level defenders who can cover elite receivers one play and defend the run the next. This is easier said than done. Teams often compromise on players\u2019 fatal flaws for their other above-average traits. Having true unicorns, players who can actually do it all, is a real advantage.\n\nEnter Baltimore Ravens safety Kyle Hamilton, a versatile chesspiece quickly ascending into stardom as a premier player of a quality Ravens secondary. Now in his sophomore season and settling into defensive coordinator Mike MacDonald\u2019s scheme, Hamilton is quickly becoming a franchise cornerstone for the Ravens and one of the most exciting young players in the NFL with his ability to play all over the secondary.\n\nIn this week\u2019s edition of Tape Talk, we\u2019ll be talking all Kyle Hamilton, delving into his role in Mike MacDonald\u2019s scheme, his strengths, and where he needs to improve to place himself in the elite tier of safeties.\n\nA four-star recruit out of high school, Kyle Hamilton committed to Notre Dame at the end of his junior year and proceeded to dominate during his three-year college career, earning three All-American selections and finishing as a finalist for the Bednarik award (given to the best defensive player in the country), an incredible feat for a safety.\n\nHamilton was projected as a top-five pick during most of the 2021 college football season, yet fell come draft time due to a subpar forty-yard dash during the combine (4.59, around 25th percentile for an NFL safety). He slid all the way to No. 14 until the Baltimore Ravens saw past the poor testing numbers and made him the highest-selected safety since Eric Berry (No. 5 overall in 2010).\n\nHamilton struggled at the beginning of his rookie year as he eased into defensive coordinator Mike MacDonald\u2019s complex defense where he was asked to play everywhere in the backline, from nickel corner to free safety, to box safety and even some cornerback. But despite the challenging assignment Hamilton found his footing as the season progressed and finished as an integral part of the team, starting the Ravens\u2019 final four games.\n\nHamilton has carried over his momentum from the end of the 2022 season, starting all twelve of the Ravens\u2019 games so far while playing as the ultimate chess piece in Mike MacDonald\u2019s defense \u2013 through twelve games, he\u2019s been deployed as a deep safety both in single and two high coverages, leveraged the Hook, Curl, and Flat areas in zone, played as a man nickel corner, and even aligned as an extra defensive lineman off the edge on special packages.\n\nWith his freak athletic ability and impressive intellect for a second-year player, Hamilton is a key reason why the Ravens\u2019 defense can be as variable as Mike MacDonald wants it to be.\n\nIn both the run and pass games, Hamilton has been an integral piece in enabling the scheme of one of the NFL\u2019s most creative defenses, yet he\u2019s been at his best in coverage due to his phenomenal athletic ability. Contrary to what his 40-yard dash time would lead you to believe, Hamilton is an exceptional athlete and shows it on tape. At 6-foot-4, 220 pounds with a 79 3-4 inch wingspan (all near the 100th percentile for a safety), he\u2019s built like a slimmer edge defender, yet moves like a defensive back with excellent foot quickness, long speed, and hip fluidity \u2013 a true defensive unicorn.\n\nHe\u2019s exceptional in man coverage for a safety, able to blanket most tight ends and receivers from the slot due to his fluidity and length. Through twelve weeks, he ranks second among all safeties in yards allowed per target (2.4) and seventh in passer rating when targeted (45.8).\n\nFor a second-year player, he also flashes tremendous instincts in zone coverage, able to quickly discern passing concepts and anticipate the quarterback\u2019s throwing option.\n\nHamilton can neutralize most receivers in man and leverage his area in zone, yet what makes him most frightening is his tremendous range (a safety\u2019s ability to cover ground). Hamilton may have run a 4.59 forty-yard dash, yet that looks like a 4.4 on tape. He can instantly cover the whole field from single and two-high shells due to his tremendous plant & drive (defensive back\u2019s ability to hit the back of their drop when backpedaling and explode without false stepping) and long speed.\n\nRegarding ball skills, Hamilton\u2019s are solid, but not a true positive or negative. He shows the tracking and concentration necessary to pick off passes in front of him, but his body control is not elite to the point where he can make circus catches outside of his frame. He\u2019s also solid after the catch, showing the ability to force incompletions with average play strength against smaller receivers and tight ends.\n\nHamilton\u2019s fluidity, length, instincts and range make him a terrifying weapon in coverage, yet he still has some parts of his game to iron out before he can elevate his name into the elite safety conversation, particularly in run support and open-field tackling.\n\nHamilton is not a below-average run defender by any means. He does a tremendous job of disengaging from receiver blocks to erase screens when aligned as a nickel, and he typically fits his gap and brings down runners when deployed as a box safety due to his elite range. However, his angle processing and decision-making when deciding to commit on tackles is inconsistent when coming down from high alignments, resulting in a myriad of missed tackles and blown assignments \u2013 per pro football focus, Hamilton has missed 14.1% of his tackles, way above the 10.8% average for defensive backs.\n\nFurthermore, I\u2019d like to see Hamilton be more of an enforcer in the run game. On tape, it\u2019s clear he makes his money as a finesse player. Like linebacker, however, the safety position requires constant physicality, and at times, it feels like Hamilton does not enforce and seek contact, but instead lets it come to him, particularly against the run.\n\nIf Hamilton can show that level of confidence and physicality consistently in the run game while continuing to erase receivers and tight ends in coverage, we\u2019ll be talking about a complete player at the safety position.\n\nOverall, Hamilton has been having a phenomenal season on tape and is en route to becoming one of the NFL\u2019s most dynamic and versatile safeties. He\u2019s a near Pro-Bowl level starter who is strong in both man and zone coverage, where he can use his length, fluidity, movement skills, and instincts to erase most receivers and tight ends.\n\nFor Hamilton to become an elite player, I\u2019d like to see him be more of an enforcer in the run game and improve his decision-making when open-field tackling. Ultimately, though, Hamilton\u2019s phenomenal coverage skills already make him one of the scariest cover players in the NFL. Ask any defensive coordinator, and they\u2019ll tell you that if you can use your safety or nickel like a starting cornerback, you\u2019re in good shape. Look for Hamilton to continue to improve and cement himself as one of the league\u2019s premier defensive players in the years to come.\n```"}

Yes u have been reported not only to usc, but the FBI. We are going to spend hours making sure terrorists don\u2019t roam free,\u201d one user wrote. Another user replied to the post: \u201cTerro**st on campus were protesting. I reported them to DPS, LAPD, FBI with their pictures and full names and majors.\u201d One student even requested that the Daily Trojan remove an image of them at a pro-Palestine protest on campus from its Instagram due to harassment for their participation.\n\nThreats and harassment like this are quickly becoming a norm on college campuses. On November 1 the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) released an open letter to colleges and university leaders. The letter called on them to \u201cReject Efforts to Restrict Constitutionally Protected Speech on Campuses\u201d and addressed recent attempts to limit the freedom of speech of student activists protesting the war in Israel and Palestine. This letter was a response to an order from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues to shut down the chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) at public universities in the state. DeSantis and Rodrigues claimed these student groups were connected to Hamas.\n\nCiting the lack of evidence that these groups have any connection with Hamas, a U.S.-recognized terrorist organization, the ACLU affirmed that statements made by these organizations are constitutionally protected. \u201cWe urge you to hold fast to our country\u2019s best traditions and reject baseless calls to investigate or punish student groups for exercising their free speech rights,\u201d read the conclusion of the letter.\n\nAt the November 9 meeting of the Florida Board of Governors, the State University System of Florida announced a pause in its plans to suspend these chapters of SJP. This was after they received legal advice warning of administrators\u2019 personal liability in potential infringements of constitutionally protected rights. If administrators were found to have obstructed students\u2019 civil rights, they could be held individually liable. Instead, Rodrigues will be asking chapters to make \u201cexpress affirmation ... That they reject violence, that they reject they are a part of the Hamas movement, and that they will follow the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile universities can ask all student groups to commit to following the law, they cannot force them to expressly renounce a particular ideology or otherwise express views they don\u2019t actually hold,\u201d asserts the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. \u201cStudents shouldn\u2019t be compelled to disavow certain disfavored views in exchange for funding and recognition. Compelling speech violates the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nFear and harassment at USC\n\nStudents\u2019 pervasive fear is evident on our own campus, where some have refused to give their full names to USC media outlets when speaking about their experiences. Many say they fear for their safety, facing death threats and harassment for their beliefs and activism. There are over 200 names of people affiliated with USC on the Canary Mission website, an organization dedicated to publicly identifying opponents of Israel, with personal information, photos and even social media accounts linked identifying them.\n\nThe former president of USC\u2019s chapter of SJP also faced extensive harassment, which student organizers speculate was one reason SJP has not been active for the past few years. Trojans for Palestine (TFP), an online presence and organizing student group, was founded in October, seeking to fill the gap in a USC pro-Palestinian student movement after the recent dormancy of SJP.\n\nThe president of TFP, who was granted anonymity due to her own fear of harassment and retaliation, spoke with Annenberg Media about doxing on campus. \u201cWe are constantly aware of the fact that we might be doxed, we have gone through protocols you know, we\u2019ve talked to Title IX about it,\u201d said the president, a junior at USC. \u201cEven at our last event, there were Zionist students who were trying to intimidate us, who were taking pictures and videos of us.\u201d\n\nThe TFP president provided photos and videos of these students at their event for over two hours, waving an Israeli flag and laughing at the names of Palestinians who were killed. \u201cIt was absolutely an intimidation tactic to keep people from approaching the names obviously because they don\u2019t want their picture taken,\u201d she said. \u201cA girl came up to us and was like, \u2018Hey, they just took my picture. I don\u2019t want them to take my picture.\u2019 She went up to DPS who was on the sidelines and DPS told her that they couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nThe president expressed that Trojans for Palestine does not conflate Zionism and Judaism, clarifying that they are not against the Jewish religion and have Jewish members in their organization. To her knowledge, no members have been doxed since the group\u2019s founding in October and they are actively taking precautions to protect members.\n\nA few years ago, a USC alum who was involved with the Palestinian justice student movement was sent a photo of a bomb with the caption \u201cWith Love\u201d and an Israeli flag emoji, according to the president of TFP. The photo, sent by an Israeli student, also included the signatures of the Israeli students\u2019 family members.\n\nDoxing on other college campuses\n\nDoxing is defined as publicly identifying or publishing information about an individual as a form of punishment or with malicious intent \u2014 and without the victim\u2019s consent. Websites such as the Canary Mission make the information of supporters of the pro-Palestinian cause widely accessible and open those people up to widespread harassment.\n\nThese issues of freedom of expression related to Israel and Palestine are not limited to the Israel-Hamas war as it has unfolded since the Hamas attack on October 7. In the wake of the Great March of Return in Gaza, in spring 2018, the ACLU released an open letter to Congress following the introduction of the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act. The ACLU was concerned that the bill would \u201cchill free speech of students on college campuses by incorrectly equating criticism of the Israeli government with anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bill is part of a disturbing surge of government-led attempts to suppress the speech of people on only one side of the Israel-Palestine debate,\u201d the ACLU wrote in 2018. \u201cThose who seek to protest, boycott, or otherwise criticize the Israeli government are being silenced.\u201d\n\nThe same can be said of college campuses today, where students are increasingly facing harassment, silencing and threats of doxing for speaking out against the Israeli government\u2019s actions in Gaza. Joel Bellman, a board member and the Advocacy Committee Chair of the Society of Professional Journalists\u2019 Los Angeles chapter, spoke of SPJ/LA\u2019s opposition to this doxing in an interview with Annenberg Media.\n\n\u201cFree speech principles don\u2019t mean freedom from criticism or freedom from other people objecting to what you\u2019re saying.\u201d Bellman said. \u201cWhat it means is, those people can\u2019t shut you down. Doxing and intimidation is one way of shutting you down in a public forum, systematically trying to exclude your viewpoint.\u201d\n\nOne of the most prominent of these cases is that of the Harvard University students who signed and posted an open letter condemning the actions of the Israeli government. Almost immediately, students began receiving threats, which caused many student organizations to remove their signatures and distance themselves from the letter. Students\u2019 personal information was posted online, family members threatened and harassed, Wall Street Executives called for lists of those students to blacklist them from being hired \u2014 all culminating in a doxing truck circling campus with a digital billboard showing student signatories\u2019 names and photos with the caption \u201cHarvard\u2019s Leading Antisemites.\u201d\n\nAccuracy in Media, the conservative media group funding the campaign, then sent a doxing truck off campus to the Harvard students leaders\u2019 homes. Adam Guillete, the president of Accuracy in Media, said that the group intended to continue for weeks and even send the trucks to students\u2019 homes in Burlington, Vermont.\n\nThe doxing campaign against one Palestinian American Harvard student caused an employer who had offered her a job to rescind the offer. She said to The Nation, \u201cThe day I learned that my cousin was killed by the IDF on a raid of his refugee camp, was also the day that I found out that the truck with my name and face on it, calling me an antisemite, would be sent to my parents\u2019 home.\u201d\n\nA third doxing truck then arrived at Columbia University, where it displayed the names and faces of \u201cColumbia\u2019s Leading Antisemites.\u201d In response, Columbia launched a \u201cDoxxing Resource Group\u201d to support students who are experiencing this intimidation and harassment over exercising their constitutional rights.\n\nJewish students held a protest called \u201cNot in Our Name: Stop Doxxing Now,\u201d and used their presence to cover the screens at Columbia. Others participated in a planned walkout of Hillary Clinton\u2019s foreign policy class in solidarity with pro-Palestine demonstrators due to her pro-Israel stance.\n\nPEN America, an organization dedicated to protecting freedom of expression by combatting book bans, educational censorship, disinformation and attacks on freedom of speech, also condemned these instances of doxing.\n\n\u201cExposing students\u2019 private information and intimidating them into silence is an undeniable threat to freedom of expression. We strongly condemn the harassment of any students, regardless of their viewpoint,\u201d said Kristen Shahverdian, PEN America\u2019s senior manager of free expression and education.\n\nThe organization has long advocated for freedom of speech on college campuses, dating back to the principles of their 1948 PEN Charter, and has followed the issue of Israel-Palestine free speech controversies, even undergoing a case study of the 2013-2014 upheaval on UCLA\u2019s campus.\n\n\u201cBy acknowledging and addressing legitimate concerns regarding racism and bigotry in the context of free speech debates, universities can help ensure that the defense of freedom of expression is not misconstrued as a cause that is at odds with movements for social justice,\u201d PEN America asserts.\n\nThis philosophy is particularly applicable to the current situation in which freedom of expression of pro-Palestinian individuals is widely being misconstrued as antisemitism. As students oppose the actions of Israel, they face the same silencing and suppression denounced by the ACLU in 2018.\n\n\u201cPutting students on blacklists for future employers is a tactic that echoes the McCarthy era, and it is easy to imagine how such a precedent could be used against students across the ideological spectrum,\u201d Shahverdian said.\n\nThe McCarthy era denotes another time in which fear-mongering and threats were used to keep people from expressing their political beliefs that went against the U.S. establishment. In the 1950s, Senator Joe McCarthy claimed to have a list of communists within the U.S. government and used that threat to suppress political views contrary to his own.\n\n\u201cThat era is so powerful to invoke I think it\u2019s an era that we are very ashamed of in this country, where we weren\u2019t embracing the free expression principles that we enjoy now,\u201d said Sam LeFrance, the manager of editorial projects for the free expression and education team at PEN America, in an interview with Annenberg Media.\n\n\u201cWe definitely have concerns when it comes to things like doxing and chilling political expression, I think that is undeniable.\u201d\n\nInstitutional suspension and suppression\n\nColumbia doubled down on their stance November 10, officially suspending the Columbia SJP Chapter and Jewish Voice for Peace as student organizations for the rest of the fall semester following a peaceful protest art installation that was unauthorized by the university.\n\nStudents have even begun receiving handouts at protests from \u201cUniversity Delegates\u201d calling for students to \u201cstop your disruption now ... you may be subject to interim sanctions from the Provost up to and including suspension for the rest of the semester.\u201d\n\nStudents questioned the legality of these cards given to peaceful protesters, but Columbia\u2019s position as a private university blurs the lines of their responsibility to protected free speech under the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cBecause private universities are not government entities, they are not required to uphold First Amendment protections in the same manner as public universities. In other words, private institutions may impose stricter limitations on free speech,\u201d states PEN America\u2019s Campus Free Speech Guide.\n\nColumbia was not the first university to ban SJP, nor is it the latest: Brandeis University derecognized its chapter of SJP on November 6 despite its own free speech policy affirming a responsibility \u201cto prevent attempts to shut down conversations, no matter what their topic.\u201d\n\nDavid Cole, the ACLU\u2019s Legal Director asserted in a statement that \u201cit is precisely in times of heightened crisis and fear that university leaders must remain steadfast in their commitment to free speech, open debate, and peaceful dissent on campus. These principles are the bedrock of academic freedom at all universities.\u201d\n\nFree speech and hate speech\n\nJewish students have faced an increase in antisemitic messaging and violence, including the drawing of swastikas at Drexel University, Bates College and American University. A Jewish student\u2019s dorm was set on fire at Drexel and an Israeli student at Columbia was beaten with a stick for confronting someone taking down missing posters of those kidnapped by Hamas.\n\nOn USC\u2019s campus, multiple instances of people taking down hostage posters on USC\u2019s campus have been documented on social media and some Jewish students have said they find these actions to be antisemitic and fear-inducing.\n\nAt the University of Pennsylvania, someone vandalized a Jewish fraternity with the phrase \u201cThe Jews R Nazis.\u201d A Cornell student was recently arrested for a series of posts on Cornell\u2019s Greekrank forums violently threatening Jewish students and the Center for Jewish Living.\n\nPEN America denounces these actions as well, encouraging university leaders to consult their guidance on handling hate speech on campuses.\n\nThe nuances of this topic are particularly necessary to understand because, as they cite, \u201cHateful speech is protected by the First Amendment and has long been cited as such by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU concurs, writing that \u201cSpeech that deeply offends our morality or is hostile to our way of life warrants the same constitutional protection as other speech because the right of free speech is indivisible.\u201d\n\nHowever, both of these organizations \u2014 and the Supreme Court \u2014 draw a distinction when it comes to speech that constitutes targeted harassment or threats of violence.\n\n\u201cWe would just encourage universities to lean into the education and the almost restorative kind of approach, rather than punitive, when it comes to these things,\u201d LeFrance said in an interview with Annenberg Media.\n\n\u201cIf that hate speech is crossing into something that is violating the law, then universities also have the right to stop it.\u201d\n\nLawrence Summers, an outspoken advocate against antisemitism and the former president of Harvard University, wrote about the need to maintain freedom of speech principles even when that speech is harmful.\n\n\u201cHow are we now to reconcile our hurt, our fear, our rage with our responsibility? Not by doxing students and inciting mobs to threaten even those whose views we abhor most,\u201d Summers wrote in a Washington Post editorial.\n\n\u201cNot by seeking to shut down criticism of governments or countries to which we feel a strong connection. Not by calling for guilt by association or discipline or humiliation of anyone without due process.\u201d```"}

A back-and-forth battle between the two Big Ten powerhouses made for an instant classic in the last week of the regular season. Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy did not light up the stat sheet, but played mistake-free football in the biggest game of his college career. McCarthy completed 16 of his 20 pass attempts for 148 yards and a touchdown. With less action in the air, the Wolverines turned to standout running back Blake Corum for domination on the ground. Corum carried the ball 22 times for 88 yards and two touchdowns. Tight end Colston Loveland was the team\u2019s leading receiver with 88 yards.\n\nOhio State saw solid contributions across the board but succumbed to turnovers. Quarterback Kyle McCord completed 18 of his 30 pass attempts for 271 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. As he has done often this season, star receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. led the way with 118 yards and a score on just five catches. Running back TreVeyon Henderson posted 60 rushing yards and a touchdown on 19 carries. From a pure offensive yardage perspective, the Buckeyes had the more impressive day statistically. They outgained the Wolverines, accounted for more first downs and maintained a much higher third down efficiency rate. So in the end, it\u2019s easy to point to McCord\u2019s two interceptions as the deciding factor in this contest, as the Buckeyes failed to turnover Michigan once.\n\nMichigan (12-0) currently sits at No. 2 in the CFP rankings and will all but secure a playoff spot with a win vs No. 16 Iowa in the Big Ten championship. Ohio State (11-1) fell to No. 6 in the rankings after a close loss. The Buckeyes will hope for a monumental upset from the Hawkeyes to keep their playoff hopes alive.\n\nWashington survives close Apple Cup vs. Washington State, 24-21\nIt took a walk-off, game-winning kick but the Huskies got in done at home versus their in-state rival. Washington has been on the winning end of three straight emotional nail-biters, but finds itself in a prime position to be the first Pac-12 team to make the playoff since the Huskies did so themselves in 2016. Star quarterback Michael Penix was efficient in this contest, completing 18 of his 33 pass attempts for 204 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. Wide receiver Rome Odunze was easily the Huskies\u2019 most productive weapon, hauling in seven catches for 120 yards and two touchdowns. Running back Dillon Johnson also continued his productive season with 82 rushing yards and a score on 21 carries.\n\nCougars quarterback Cameron Ward also had a solid day, completing 32 of his 48 pass attempts for 317 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. Receiver Josh Kelly led the team in receiving yards with 106 and a touchdown on eight catches. Washington State\u2019s offense kept up with the high-powered Huskies throughout this contest. They had more first downs and out-possessed Washington throughout the game. It was Ward\u2019s two interceptions and their inability to establish a ground attack that prevented the Cougars from pulling off the upset.\n\nWashington (12-0) jumped up a spot to No. 3 in the rankings. They are set to face No. 5 Oregon in the Pac-12 championship and a win will undoubtedly grant them a spot in the playoff as no undefeated Power Five conference winner has ever missed out. Washington State (5-7) could have been in contention for a bowl game with a historic upset. The end of the season was a let down for the Cougars, who had gotten off to a 4-0 start, including a 38-35 win over current CFP No. 20 Oregon State.\n\nFlorida State beats Florida in The Swamp to stay perfect, 24-15\nDespite losing star quarterback Jordan Travis last week and starting this contest down 12-0, the Seminoles stayed diligent and kept their playoff hopes alive. A hat trick from running back Trey Benson helped elevate the \u2018Noles offense on the road in Gainesville. Benson rushed 19 times for 95 yards and three scores, accounting for all of Florida State\u2019s touchdowns. Quarterback Tate Rodemaker did not wow in relief for the injured Jordan Travis, completing just 12 of his 25 pass attempts for 134 yards. Receiver Johnny Wilson led the team with six receptions for 64 yards.\n\nGators quarterback Max Brown struggled immensely against a stout Seminole defense. Brown completed only nine balls for 86 yards and an interception. Much like Florida State, Florida relied heavily on its ground attack. Running back Montrell Johnson had a pretty efficient day, carrying the ball 18 times for 107 yards and one touchdown. But the Gators\u2019 offense was held to just the one touchdown. Besides Johnson, Florida\u2019s other playmakers struggled to find momentum. Their defense, who sacked Rodemaker three times, including a safety, kept them in this one. It ultimately took a 10-point fourth quarter for Florida State to win, prevailing despite being outgained and out-possessed by nearly 10 minutes.\n\nWith Ohio State\u2019s loss, Florida State (12-0) jumped back into the top four. Although they hold the final spot, the No. 4 Seminoles are far from a lock without Travis under center. It is possible that Florida State would need to convincingly beat No. 14 Louisville in the ACC Championship, along with some help from other teams for the committee to keep them at No. 4. It\u2019s worth noting again that an undefeated Power Five champion has never missed the CFP and the \u2018Noles would fit that criteria with a win next week. However, if teams like Alabama and Oregon win convincingly, it might not be far-fetched that the unbeaten Seminoles miss out.\n\nOregon dominates Civil War, defeats Oregon State, 31-7\nThe Ducks and Bo Nix continue to dominate whomever they face, as they have now won six straight games with an average margin of victory of 26. Nix impressed once again, burnishing his Heisman aspirations by completing 33 of his 40 pass attempts for 367 yards and two touchdowns. Two Oregon receivers eclipsed 125 yards, with Tez Johnson catching 11 passes for 137 yards and Troy Franklin hauling in nine balls for 128 yards and a touchdown. Running back Jordan James led the team with 43 rushing yards and a score on just seven carries.\n\nOregon\u2019s offense looks like a well-oiled machine week-in and week-out, putting up efficient numbers across the board and taking care of the football. The same could not be said for Oregon State, who was shut out in the second half. Quarterback DJ Uiagalelei, who has had a very solid season for the Beavers, struggled to move the ball against a swarming Ducks defense. The Clemson transfer completed 19 of his 35 pass attempts for 220 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Star running back Damien Martinez was held in check all game, logging a season-low 38 yards on 13 carries. Receiver Anthony Gould led the team in air yards with 85.\n\nOregon (11-1) jumps up one spot to No. 5 in the current rankings. The Ducks\u2019 playoff hopes are very much alive with a marquee rematch against Washington in the Pac-12 Championship coming up. We could very well see them back in the postseason for the first time since 2014 if the dominoes fall correctly. As for Oregon State (8-4), they dropped four spots to No. 20 in the CFP rankings. The Beavers had an encouraging season. It earned former head coach Jonathan Smith the job at Michigan State, with defensive coordinator Trent Bray set to become the team\u2019s next head coach. The Beavers await a bowl game assignment.\n\nGeorgia holds off Georgia Tech, 31-23\nThe Bulldogs gave up their weekly opening drive touchdown then promptly cruised to their 29th straight victory. Georgia quarterback Carson Beck did what was needed, completing 13 of his 20 pass attempts for 175 yards, a touchdown and an interception. Running back Kendall Milton not only led the team but earned a season-high 156 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 18 carries. Receiver Dominic Lovett led the team in receiving with five catches for 68 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets\u2019 offense struggled to move the ball after its initial touchdown drive, scoring the final 10 points in fourth quarter garbage time. Quarterback Haynes King threw for 158 yards on just 11 completions, but did score two rushing touchdowns. Running back Jamal Haynes led the team with 81 rushing yards, while receiver Eric Singleton led the team with 96 receiving yards. While Georgia did not have any major issues, it was far from their most dominating performance of the year. The final score is probably closer than the game actually was, but the Bulldogs will need an improved performance in order to beat Alabama in the SEC Championship.\n\nGeorgia (12-0) stays atop the rankings at No. 1. They are certainly in a win-and-in situation, but can\u2019t look past a red-hot Alabama team. It is hard to imagine a world where the Bulldogs do not make the CFP, but an underwhelming loss on Saturday could mean the unimaginable amid a tight race.\n\nAlabama defeats Auburn in Iron Bowl, 27-24\nIt took a 31-yard, 4th & goal touchdown bomb from quarterback Jalen Milroe to receiver Isaiah Bond in the corner of the endzone, but the Crimson Tide got the job done against their longtime rival. Milroe continued to silence any doubts about his ability to lead this offense by showing off his dual threat ability. He completed 16 of his 24 pass attempts for 259 yards and two touchdowns while leading the tide in rushing yards with 107. Receiver Jermaine Burton led the team in receiving yards with four catches for 107 yards and a touchdown.\n\nDown 24-20, Alabama recovered a muffed punt to set its offense up in a prime position to win the game. Milroe commanded a nine-play, 30-yard scoring drive. In an unfortunate turn of events, a fumbled snap took them all the way back to the 31-yard line, but Milroe made the throw of his life to win the game. The Tigers did not match \u2018Bama\u2019s efficient box score. Quarterback Payton Thorne completed just five of his 16 pass attempts for 91 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. Thorne has had a few dreadful stat lines this season, throwing for over 200 yards just twice. Auburn did find success on the ground, outgaining Alabama 244-192 in that category. Running back Jarquez Hunter led the way with 14 carries for 93 yards, while receiver Ja\u2019Varrius Johnson caught four balls for 76 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nAlabama (11-1) stays put at No. 8 in the rankings. An SEC championship victory over a Georgia team that has not lost in over two years would give the Crimson Tide a great playoff case. However, Alabama is among teams like Ohio State and Texas who might need some help from other teams to qualify.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Jason Wang via PS5 Capture)\n\nBy Ethan Huang November 29, 2023 at 12:45 pm PST\n\nFor 13 years, fans of the Alan Wake video game franchise waited alongside the titular character in perpetual limbo for a sequel, and finally, it was released to unexpected fanfare. In a year chock-full of critically acclaimed games and a few undelivered promises, \u201cAlan Wake 2\u2032\u2032 stands out among the best.\n\nAlthough highly anticipated sequels like \u201cMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2\u2032\u2032 and \u201cThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\u201d received major acclaim, they were beaten out in awards by the unsuspecting story of a haunted writer. The Game Awards has become something of a cultural phenomenon. Unlike the Oscars or Emmys, the biggest show for gaming streams on platforms like YouTube and Twitch rather than cable television. Since its start in 2014, the show has grown to an audience of more than 100 million and represents a time of the year when recent games are celebrated while upcoming titles are teased or announced.\n\nWhile last year\u2019s show seemed to be a heated competition between \u201cGod of War: Ragnarok\u201d and \u201cElden Ring,\u201d this year seems to have a more diverse selection of contenders. However, among all of them stand \u201cBaldur\u2019s Gate 3\u2032\u2032 and \u201cAlan Wake 2\u2032\u2032 equally matched with eight nominations each, the most of any game this year. The latter came as a bit of a surprise with its release just last month, especially in a year where survival horror is back in fashion with remakes of acclaimed games \u201cResident Evil 4\u2032\u2032 and \u201cDead Space.\u201d\n\nSaga Anderson played by Melanie Liburd in \u201cAlan Wake 2\u201d (Photo courtesy of Jason Wang via PS5 Capture)\n\nSo what makes it so special? \u201cAlan Wake,\u201d the first game in the franchise, was released in 2010 by game developer studio Remedy Entertainment, headed by Sam Lake. The Finnish company is most known for its Max Payne series, but has come a long way since. The story features a writer who takes a trip with his wife into the small Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls before he becomes sucked into a supernatural battle between the physical forces of light and darkness. In a nutshell, the game ends with the protagonist Alan Wake trapped in a realm known as the Dark Place, and the sequel details his attempts to escape.\n\nThe game would be followed by a spin-off of sorts titled \u201cAlan Wake\u2019s American Nightmare\u201d as well as the \u201cControl,\u201d a game largely detached from the \u201cAlan Wake\u201d series but set in the same universe. Alan Wake\u2019s chapters take place in an alternate version of New York. (Photo courtesy of Jason Wang via PS5 Capture)\n\n\u201cAlan Wake\u201d takes cues primarily from Stephen King novels (with many not-so-subtle references to the famous author) in featuring a story that is suspenseful, but not necessarily in the vein of \u201chorror.\u201d In fact, most of the anxiety comes from dual-wielding a flashlight and a revolver as the player tries to fight off a horde of possessed townsfolk. The sequel, meanwhile, decides to lean into the terrifying and absurd. If the first game is a Stephen King novel with the structure of serialized television, the second is a David Lynch show structured like a book.\n\nIn fact, aside from the large release gap and its setting, the game shares many elements with Lynch\u2019s \u201cTwin Peaks: The Return.\u201d This includes a narrative centering on a supernatural doppelganger as well as musical \u201cperformances\u201d at the end of each chapter. The game is split between two protagonists: Alan Wake himself (voiced by Matthew Porretta and played by Ilkka Villi in live-action) and Saga Anderson (played by Melanie Liburd), an FBI agent investigating Wake\u2019s disappearance from the first game. Sam Lake provides the likeness of Alex Casey, but the character is voiced by James McCaffrey. (Photo courtesy of Jason Wang via PS5 Capture)\n\nTheir stories run parallel to each other, yet are meant to clash in regard to their placement in time and space. The structure of the game is mind-bending and oftentimes confusing, and the player\u2019s ability to decide for themselves the order to play the chapters allows each person to experience the narrative differently. Stories of a murderous cult are intertwined with a musical chapter, while the game mixes live-action footage of actors with rendered gameplay. For much of the game, it is difficult to discern the line between fiction and reality (a lot like the characters themselves), but it ends up making some semblance of sense by its end.\n\n\u201cAlan Wake 2\u2032\u2032 excels at its atmosphere. Here, there is a genuine sense of dread that comes at the most unexpected moments. Black and white jump scares of screaming characters penetrate a dark and moody environment while ghosts pass by, whispering \u201cWake\u201d in a gravelly voice. Compared to its predecessor, the game chooses to lean into elements of horror nearly on par with the iconic series Silent Hill. In fact, the most shocking moment of the game comes towards the end of Wake\u2019s campaign. In complete silence, a few faded photos tell a gut-wrenching story far more affecting than any jump scare could be.\n\nSaga Anderson\u2019s segments include \u201cprofiles\u201d in which information is provided in a mix of both live-action and rendered gameplay. (Photo courtesy of Jason Wang via PS5 Capture)\n\nBut beyond the fear, there is the element of \u201csurvival\u201d as well. This comes down to the game\u2019s mechanics. The first installment saw each episode as an isolated level where ammo and supplies would be reset and recharged at the start of every section. The sequel takes classic elements of survival horror into play, with a far more open world alongside limited inventory space and resources. It also implements a multitude of puzzles, ranging from using simple logic to figure out the combination to a locked cabinet or having to juggle various map changes to find a way through a sometimes complex level. Other survival horror games like \u201cResident Evil 4\u2032\u2032 have such elements (though that game takes a more action-based approach to its gameplay), but \u201cAlan Wake 2\u2032\u2032 stands out not only with its unique gameplay elements but also its difficulty.\n\nBoth Wake and Anderson have their own \u201cmind places,\u201d where they collect information throughout the game and weave together a narrative fitting to their respective roles. As an FBI agent, Anderson plays the role of detective, stitching together pieces of evidence on a board. Meanwhile, Wake, an acclaimed author, has to connect plot points that often manifest in \u201creality\u201d within his supernatural purgatory. The newest additions to Remedy\u2019s latest game are the case board and plot board. Here, Wake and Anderson can stitch plot points together to further the narrative. (Photo courtesy of Jason Wang via PS5 Capture)\n\nRemedy even decides to bring in elements of their previous game \u201cControl.\u201d While that game is more of the action genre with magic guns and force powers, its oppressive and bureaucratic level design and aesthetic are pulled into the world of \u201cAlan Wake.\u201d Objectives are sometimes unclear and the use of one\u2019s surroundings often trumps the common use of a map. This style of gameplay that avoids hand-holding adds to its sense of challenge, as like its predecessor, \u201cAlan Wake 2\u2032\u2032 remains one of the more difficult games in the survival horror genre (even at its lowest difficulty setting). Enemies can take you out with just a few hits and checkpoints can be rare. Now with the limited ammo and flashlight batteries, conserving them against hordes of enemies becomes a necessity. It makes players aware that the people they play as are ordinary people faced with extraordinary circumstances, and shows that this sense of clumsiness is realistic.\n\nIt is with these components that \u201cAlan Wake 2\u2032\u2032 carves out its own identity within a highly saturated and acclaimed genre. One chapter in \u201cAlan Wake 2\u201d features a musical segment set to The Old Gods of Asgard\u2019s \u201cHerald of Darkness.\u201d (Photo courtesy of Jason Wang via PS5 Capture)\n\nThat said, the story is perhaps its greatest strength. The dual protagonists lend themselves to contrasting narratives. Saga Anderson\u2019s runs far more linearly. She enters the town investigating missing persons with her partner Alex Casey (voiced by James McCaffrey but made to resemble Sam Lake), a fellow agent who has \u201ccoincidental\u201d similarities with a character of the same name featured in Wake\u2019s books. The pair are dragged into Wake\u2019s case while also running into eccentric townspeople and cultists as the supernatural begins to seep into the real world.\n\nWake\u2019s story, on the other hand, is best seen as a bit of a loop. He lives in a metaphysical version of New York, and between being chased by men possessed by shadows and appearing on bizarre talk shows, Wake finds himself in a cycle of trying to stop his evil doppelganger, Mr. Scratch. But as the game hammers into players\u2019 heads, \u201cIt\u2019s not a loop, it\u2019s a spiral.\u201d While the line initially seems like another ambiguous message like the first game\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s not a lake, it\u2019s an ocean,\u201d it somehow makes sense within its narrative. A spiral, unlike a loop, is not infinite. It may seem like the story is going in circles, but there is an end at the center of the mystery.\n\nThe collision of a linear narrative and a cyclical one leads to this phenomena, and while the player is left dizzy from spinning by its end, at least some of the truth is found. Alan Wake and Saga Anderson communicate in the Dark Place. (Photo courtesy of Jason Wang via PS5 Capture)\n\nBut, in answering the few questions players had, it opens up a dozen more. Why does \u201cControl\u2019s\u201d janitor Ahti casually appear unannounced in moments throughout the game? Who is this omnipotent being known as Mr. Door? What in the world happens next? Ultimately, that is part of its beauty. Even with a set-up for a continuation, it might be better to leave audiences hanging, as the moment all the questions are answered is the moment the story truly comes to its end.\n\n\u201cAlan Wake 2\u2032\u2032 is nominated for Game of the Year, Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, Best Performance, Best Audio Design, Best Art Direction, Best Score and Music, and Best Action/Adventure at the Game Awards. The event is set to be held on December 7 at the Peacock Theater and live-streamed on various platforms.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/11/29/destiny-within-disasters-the-filmography-exhibit-of-makoto-shinkai/", "response": "```\nDestiny within disasters: the filmography exhibit of Makoto Shinkai\n\nFor one day only, the Academy Museum hosted a retrospective exhibit of anime film director Makoto Shinkai's stylistic filmography around romance, destiny, and natural disasters.\n\nOn Nov. 19, the Academy Museum dedicated their fifth floor for a pop-up exhibit of Makoto Shinkai's past directorial work in anime films, including three screenings of his most recent films, \"Weathering With You,\" \"Suzume,\" and \"Your Name\" throughout the day.\n\nAs Oscar nominations are just around the corner, audiences should take note that 2023 featured some major contenders for Best Animated Feature. One notable release, yet possibly overlooked to U.S. audiences, was \"Suzume,\" a supernatural set to the backdrop of a real-world event. Director Makoto Shinkai's plot follows a high school-aged girl as she embarks on a storm-chasing road trip to save Japan from impending natural disasters visible only to a few.\n\nThe exhibit displayed exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of his films' production process, such as photographs of intimate handwritten director's notes, storyboard panels, and culturally historical research. Also included on these printed walls were explanations of anime as a unique production process and discussion of Japanese cultural nuances, making the experience enjoyable for longtime fans and newcomers.\n\nThroughout the day-long pop-up, three in-house screenings of his most recent, and most internationally renowned, films were offered: \"Weathering With You,\" \"Suzume,\" and \"Your Name.\" The exhibit entrance opened to a blue flowy carpet, which led to a LED wall of a lone-standing door in still water \u2013 the backdrop of Director Makoto Shinkai's latest film, \"Suzume.\" Guests could take pictures with the life-sized backdrop and explore the photo wall mazes on either side, which depicted concept art and other behind-the-scenes materials of Shinkai's films.\n\nWhile there is content on display for all of his films, \"Suzume\" occupied a majority of the display space to celebrate its recent release. Visitors would quickly catch onto the pattern of protagonist duos pictured on movie posters and character concepts. Often leading with boy-meets-girl genres, Makoto Shinkai is known for traditional coming-of-age love premises set within near-miss apocalypse plots. However, more than an anime version of Nicholas Sparks, the Shinkai style cannot be separated from the setting of world-ending stakes.\n\nUnder an exhibit section discussing the vibrancy of his color palettes, museum guests can discern a strong sense of dynamic environments like towns engulfed in flames and hydroponic gardens in city rubble. There is no villain to fight Shinkai's climactic scenes, as he instead draws on natural disasters, like the 2011 Great Earthquake in Japan.\n\nMakoto Shinkai has a signature coloring style, which he achieves with the Painting or \"shiage\" team, who have been making color selections throughout production and eventually add colors to the footage. Much work for \"Suzume\" was created under strict at-home work policies during COVID-19.\n\nAccording to the exhibition label that featured a handwritten welcome, portrait, and a description, the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake \"profoundly affected his approach to his work.\" While not personally affected by the earthquake, during a 2011 interview, Shinkai says that this was the year of his \"real directorial debut\" upon the release of a Ghibli-inspired adventure film, \"Children Who Chase Lost Voices.\" Yet the budding director had not yet begun work exploring the genre he is known for today: natural disasters.\n\nThat year, Shinkai took note of his somber surroundings and saw animation as a way to help people cope. And so, in 2016, Shinkai released a time-traveling tale of a deadly but mesmerizing comet in \"Your Name,\" landing a degree of commercial, critical, and fan success so massive, it blew away his own personal expectations before they formed.\n\nThe three films screened throughout the day in the Academy Museum's Dolby Theater have core sceneries of natural destruction on a grand scale, but also a clear plot that intimately follows a young protagonist exploring what is hidden behind their material world. Romance is the most upfront discovery in all three big-hit films, which, even expected, is still beautifully scored by his longtime musical collaborator, Japanese rock band RADWIMPS.\n\nOriginal soundtracks flowed from the exhibit and screening room speakers during idle times, with mood-defining rhythms only film scores have. Especially in Shinkai's filmography, his sharp sense of art direction based on color is airtight aligned with RADWIMPS' music production, making for a purposeful and potent emotional flow in any one given scene or sunset gaze.\n\nIf a visitor were to walk through the exhibit following the chronology of Shinkai's filmography, they would see that the life-size movie poster for his latest film stands in contrast with the rest. Instead of facing each other or in another pose to suggest a romantic pairing, \"Suzume\" protagonists face forward towards the audience and step through a standalone weathered door frame in a field, suggesting the start of a supernatural adventure. Now forfeiting the traditional love story arcs, Shinkai has a new message for his audiences starting with \"Suzume\" and beyond.\n\nHe directly addresses the inevitable and increasing frequency of natural disasters in an interview with Ghibliotheque, listing COVID-19, the climate crisis, as well as war. He processes these and more through his young protagonists whose lives are inseparable from the anxiety before or aftermath of natural disasters. A flood for one girl to fight in \"Weathering With You,\" or a splitting comet to convince evacuation from in \"Your Name,\" or a spontaneous earthquake to chase in \"Suzume,\" Shinkai asks his audiences: when you could stand to lose everything, what are the last few things you would take a risk for?\n\nFor twelve years, Shinkai waited to create \"Suzume\" after the earthquake. He waited out of consideration for the affected individuals but also says he wasn't ready to face merging fantasy and reality that closely. The exhibit showcases his work with cultural historians to depict natural disasters and the beliefs that surround them. The lore of natural disasters in Shinkai's films is a mix of real-world events and literature studies combined with designed writings specific to each film.\n\nYet, the film sequences displayed on standing TVs at each corner result from Shinkai's earnest creative decisions are treasured by many because they are inherently risky. For example, \"Suzume\" centers around a road trip across Japan, which follows a playlist of songs Shinkai methodically placed from a list of trending hits during 2011. Depicting a time of painful tragedy so explicitly in an entertainment form could be seen as controversial or disrespectful in Japanese culture. However, in the interview with Ghibliotheque, Shinkai explains that the playing of these \"oldies\" would show audiences that the story in the film is an extension of real life, thus the messaging about coping in the aftermath should be treated just as seriously.\n\nLastly, during the production of \"Suzume,\" which follows a high-school-aged girl on a storm-chasing supernatural mystery, Shinkai not only moved away from the boy-meets-girl genres but pushes towards untraditional romances, \"I think it would also work had [Suzume] been a boy or had she been non-binary,\" he told Looper. While future Shinkai protagonists could be flexible in gender or sexuality as compared to other anime films of a similar caliber, the director looks forward to future narratives about overcoming he continued in the Looper interview. Just like his beginnings as a one-man animation crew, Shinkai plans to continue to make short films and play with different film formats down the line. For now, he stands on equal ground with the anime directors that inspired him, and celebrates a streak of big-budget, hit feature films that altogether demonstrate animation's technical innovation and loyalty to surreal stories.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/11/28/pac-12-power-rankings-oregon-finishes-no-1-as-the-regular-season-comes-to-a-close/", "response": "```\nPac-12 Power Rankings: Oregon finishes No. 1 as the regular season comes to a close\n\nBy Will Camardella November 28, 2023 at 10:40 pm PST\n\n\u201cPac-12 Power Rankings\u201d is a column by Will Camardella ranking the Pac-12 football teams on a week-to-week basis. In the Conference of Champions\u2019 final season, the only thing we should have expected was the unexpected. Entering the year, everyone wanted to talk about Caleb Williams repeating as the Heisman Trophy winner and USC making a run at a National Championship. Entering Conference Championship weekend, two Pac-12 quarterbacks sit in Heisman contention, with each of their teams one win away from the conference\u2019s first College Football Playoff appearance since 2016. Neither of those quarterbacks are Caleb Williams.\n\nFew would have expected that Arizona, a team that lost its starting quarterback to injury early in the year and its top 2022 pass catcher to the transfer portal, would go from a 5-7 team to a team one win away from the Pac-12 Championship Game. Who would have thought that Cal, a program based in Northern California that will soon be playing in the Atlantic Coast Conference, would win three games in a row to clinch bowl eligibility? After being the talk of college football in the non-conference portion of the season, I doubt many believed Colorado would finish with the worst conference record in the Pac-12. Yet, all of those things happened in what turned out to be an extraordinarily fun 2023 season, assuming you are not a Trojan fan.\n\nFor my rankings this week, knowing that 10 of these 12 teams will be shipping off to new conferences in less than a year, I focused on what each team\u2019s prospects in their new homes would look like while putting a bow on 2023. Of course, that\u2019s after one last look at Oregon and Washington, who are getting ready to clash in an epic top-five matchup with the Pac-12\u2032s final championship and a spot in the College Football Playoff on the line. One last time, let\u2019s get into the rankings.\n\n1. Oregon Ducks (11-1, 8-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 1\nBlack Friday was business as usual for Oregon in a 31-7 rout of its in-state rival to close out the regular season. Head coach Dan Lanning has proven to be one of the best motivators in college football, as there is never a week where his team is not ready to go. Through the 12-week regular season, the Ducks have played just two one-possession games: one in a non-conference road game in Texas and the other on the road against one of the four undefeated teams in college football.\n\nOregon State has been one of the best teams in the conference all season long, yet Oregon\u2019s defense completely stifled the Beavers from the opening kickoff. Typically in big games, Oregon State has relied on big plays from its rushing attack to have success. Facing the Ducks, the Beavers had a total of 53 rushing yards for the entire game, averaging 2.2 yards per carry on the night. Oregon State has also played some of the best defense in the Pac-12, but that did not prevent Bo Nix from having a 367-yard passing day.\n\nI have discussed in previous weeks how fluky I felt the Ducks\u2019 mid-season loss to Washington was, as justification for why I have them ranked above the undefeated Huskies. This weekend\u2019s game serves as another example of Oregon boat racing an opponent that Washington really struggled with. Even in bad weather, the Beavers moved the ball against the Huskies\u2019 defense in a way it just could not on a clear day in Eugene. The Ducks remain the most complete team in the conference, and they will prove that when they take down Washington this Friday in Vegas.\n\n2. Washington Huskies (12-0, 9-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 2\nWashington finished an incredibly impressive feat on Saturday afternoon with a narrow win over Washington State. In the best top-to-bottom Pac-12 in the College Football Playoff era, the Huskies finished the regular season with an unblemished record and are one win away from their first playoff appearance since 2016. There are only three other undefeated teams in the sport as of now, and, despite their place in the rankings and the criticisms I am about to make of them, they deserve all the credit in the world for their record.\n\nOn the other hand, I would have liked to see Washington handle a Washington State team that had lost six of its last seven games going in a little more decisively. At the end of the day, the Huskies needed a gutsy fourth-down jet sweep to convert and a backbreaking roughing the passer call to go their way in order to win that game in regulation. Michael Penix Jr. had more than 100 fewer passing yards than Cam Ward, and Ja\u2019Lynn Polk did not have a single reception. To again use the common opponent test, the Cougars lost to Oregon by two touchdowns.\n\nWashington, despite being ranked third in the nation, is widely expected to lose in the Pac-12 Championship, with the Ducks favored by multiple scores. This might be the most advantageous position for Kalen DeBoer\u2019s team to be in; they have a knack for pulling out close games against good opponents and now have all the motivation they need to play their \u2018A\u2019 game. While recognizing this, some of the Huskies\u2019 performances in the back half of the schedule keep me from calling them the best team the conference has to offer.\n\n3. Arizona Wildcats (9-3, 7-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 3\nIn the past two weeks of the season, as more and more teams have been eliminated from Pac-12 Championship Game contention, we have seen examples of teams playing demoralized without anything to play for. This certainly could have been the case with Arizona, who found out less than 24 hours before their game against Arizona State that Oregon had locked up the final spot. Instead, the Wildcats put up their biggest offensive numbers of the season by embarrassing the Sun Devils on the road 59-23.\n\nNoah Fifita\u2019s numbers on Saturday afternoon looked as if he was playing NCAA Football 14 on rookie mode. He threw for 527 yards and five touchdowns on 41 passes, for a whopping 12.1 yards per attempt. Even more amazingly, 423 of those passing yards were hauled in by just two receivers, Tetaioa McMillan and Jacob Cowing. It has become clear that Jedd Fisch has been able to get the most out of his skill position players in his time in Tucson, a major reason why Arizona is reportedly trying to work out a contract extension.\n\nFisch inherited a winless football team in 2021 and got the Wildcats to within one game of a Pac-12 Championship Game appearance in just three seasons. He is the first coach to lead Arizona to a nine-win season since 2014. Assuming his contract extension gets done and Fifita remains in the fold, the Wildcats are one of the teams in the conference that has every ability to build off its 2023 success and sustain a winning program for years to come.\n\n4. Oregon State Beavers (8-4, 5-4 Pac-12) | Last Week: 4\nOregon State\u2019s final regular season game was undoubtedly its worst effort of the year. In the Beavers\u2019 rivalry matchup, they lost by three times as many points as their other three losses combined. Oregon State was obviously running into a bit of a buzzsaw on Friday night: Oregon was playing to clinch a spot in the Pac-12 Championship game and to stay alive in the CFP race. On the other hand, the Beavers had been eliminated from conference championship contention the week prior.\n\nStill, like I had said about USC a week ago, teams should be able to get up for their biggest rivalry game regardless of postseason implications, and OSU was just not ready to play. The usually stingy Beaver defense allowed Bo Nix and the Duck passing attack to do whatever they wanted over the weekend. I chose not to drop Oregon State despite this game because of how highly I think of Oregon, as well as my belief that effort played a major role in determining the final score.\n\nOverall, 2023 was a very successful season for the Beavers that will leave many great memories for the fanbase. However, with the announcement of Jonathan Smith taking the head coaching job at Michigan State, the program is now left without a conference or a head coach. While this season may have been a fun one, it is hard to see how it can lead to long-term program success in Corvallis.\n\n5. Utah Utes (8-4, 5-4 Pac-12) | Last Week: 5\nUtah closed out an up-and-down 2023 with a game that, in many ways, embodied its season as a whole. The Utes defeated Colorado in Salt Lake City in a game where they threw a grand total of ten passes and ran the ball 53 times. Utah has not been a potent passing offense all season without Cam Rising in the fold, but the situation became even more dire when Bryson Barnes missed the game due to injury, requiring Luke Bottari to step in.\n\nBottari did not attempt a pass until the second quarter and only had three completions at halftime, yet the Utes never trailed in the game. The former fifth-stringer did contribute with a pair of rushing touchdowns. Utah played excellent defense against the Buffaloes\u2019 backup quarterback while completely shutting down the Colorado running game, paving the way for the win.\n\nThe Utes\u2019 offensive limitations made their season script fairly predictable. Against flawed opponents, they could impose their physicality and grind out tight victories. Against the elite teams in this conference, their style of play could not make up for the difference in talent. Hence, their four losses came to the top four teams in the Pac-12 standings as well as my rankings.\n\nOnce Cam Rising returns in 2024, or Utah finds another quarterback in the transfer portal, that talent gap will close, and the team will be ready to be a major factor in the Big 12.\n\n6. Cal Golden Bears (6-6, 4-5 Pac-12) | Last Week: 8\nWith the exception of Arizona, there was no team in this conference I underestimated more throughout 2023 than Cal. I had them in my bottom three for most of the season, as I did not see how a team that is usually an afterthought could compete in the best conference in college football. In the final regular season game in Pac-12 history, the Golden Bears proved me wrong one last time, finishing the season on a three-game winning streak and qualifying for a bowl for the first time since 2019.\n\nSaturday night\u2019s win in Pasadena was an unconventional one for sure, as Cal only got 3.8 yards per carry from Jaydn Ott, who usually carries the offense. Instead, he carried the Golden Bears\u2019 special teams, taking a 100-yard kickoff to the house. Meanwhile, Jeremiah Hunter hauled in 2 touchdown passes and led the team with 101 receiving yards. The real bright spot of the evening was Cal\u2019s defense, which turned over the Bruins four times and prevented the game from ever getting competitive in the second half.\n\nIn the final game of the regular season, there was no question as to which team wanted it more, and no question which team should be ranked in the top half of the conference.\n\n7. UCLA Bruins (7-5, 4-5 Pac-12) | Last Week: 6\nLast week I defended Chip Kelly amid widespread rumors that he was about to be out of a job, pointing to his decisive win over USC as evidence that UCLA has not quit. However, after the Bruins followed up that season-defining win by getting blown out of their own building by a very beatable Cal team, I am not sure what to think about Kelly.\n\nFreshman quarterback Dante Moore had to return to game action after an early injury to Ethan Garbers. Although he led both teams with 266 passing yards, he threw two more interceptions that sank the Bruins in a big way. He finished the game with a 17.3 QBR and finished 2023 with a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 11-to-9, nowhere near where a five-star quarterback should be.\n\nIf there is a reason to move on from Kelly, it would be that an offensive guru\u2019s prodigy quarterback should not look this lost at the end of his first season. I have been more forgiving than a lot of others for UCLA\u2019s struggles this season, as many of the team\u2019s losses have come to very respectable opponents. On the other hand, mailing in the last game of the year in front of your home fans hardly instills confidence in the way this team responds to its coach.\n\nOf the four teams moving to the Big Ten next season, the Bruins are the ones that I have the least confidence will have immediate success.\n\n8. USC Trojans (7-5, 5-4 Pac-12) | Last Week: 7\nSince USC\u2019s season ended a week early, I won\u2019t spend too much time on this team this week. Despite UCLA\u2019s disappointing finish to 2023, I could not move the Trojans back above their crosstown rival given what had happened the last time they had touched the field. Given that their game against Cal came down to the final play a few weeks back, the team\u2019s records and head-to-head results were close enough for me to justify having the Golden Bears jump them.\n\nAt the end of the day, Cal finished the season on a three-game winning streak, while USC dropped five of its last six games. Although the Trojans still have far superior program infrastructure to have much more success in their new conference than either of the two teams directly above them, these are 2023 rankings only. Thus, USC sits well in the bottom half after a very disappointing year.\n\n9. Washington State Cougars (5-7, 2-7 Pac-12) | Last Week: 9\nWashington State played one of its most inspired football games in recent memory, giving its in-state rival all it could handle with bowl eligibility on the line. Alas, as has been the case in seven of the past eight weeks, the Cougars finished in defeat once again on a last-second field goal.\n\nFrom a positive outlook, the biggest shock of this game was how good of a job the Washington State defense played against one of the most potent offenses in college football. The unit had allowed at least 35 points in five of its first eight Pac-12 contests this season, yet held Michael Penix Jr. to a shade over 200 yards passing and a 54% completion rate.\n\nThe Cougars outgained Washington by 80 yards and probably would have won the game had it not been for two turnovers and 81 lost yards in penalties. With this narrow loss and a blowout win over Colorado, WSU closes out 2023 with a couple of steps in a better direction. However, after a 4-0 start, including wins over Wisconsin and Oregon State, there is no reason why this team should not have qualified for a bowl game.\n\nThe mid-season collapse that featured six straight losses was extremely troubling, and there are already strong rumors that junior quarterback Cam Ward is going to explore the transfer portal. As of now, neither team in the \u201cPac-2\u2032\u2032 seems to have all that bright a future in the short term.\n\n10. Colorado Buffaloes (4-8, 1-8 Pac-12) | Last Week: 10\nOn the bright side for Colorado, Deion Sanders quadrupled the Buffaloes\u2019 2022 win total in his first season as head coach. Unfortunately for Colorado, that statement was also true on October 7, before the team closed out the season on a six-game losing streak. Now, some recruits are decommitting from Boulder as the Buffaloes finished 2023 dead last in the Pac-12 standings.\n\nIn many ways, Utah was the worst possible opponent for Colorado to face to close out the season because of their style of play. The Utes win by imposing a physical gameplan at the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, something that has been the Buffaloes\u2019 weakness all season long. Utah averaged over five yards per carry on 53 rushing attempts, while Colorado only handed the ball off 17 times for 37 yards.\n\nWithout Shedeur Sanders under center to make the occasional explosive play, the team\u2019s offense just could not do enough in the passing game to get out of the teens. One reason this final game \u2014 and the nature of how it played out \u2014 is significant is that the Utes are the Buffaloes\u2019 travel partner heading into the Big 12, and Kyle Whittingham\u2019s team is not getting any less physical any time soon.\n\nIf Colorado wants to be taken seriously beyond the month of September, getting much bigger and stronger in the trenches this offseason is the only way to do so.\n\n11. Arizona State Sun Devils (3-9, 2-7 Pac-12) | Last Week: 11\nRemember Jaden Rashada? The true freshman quarterback was Arizona State\u2019s Week 1 starter but had not touched the football field since before I started writing this column. Shockingly, Rashada found himself back out on the football field in the Sun Devil\u2019s season finale against Arizona.\n\nWith a quarterback making his third career start against a top-15 team playing its best football in November, this result was hardly a shock. Rashada completed just 45% of his passes for 82 yards, one touchdown and a pair of interceptions, clocking his QBR in at 13.5. As has too often been the case for Arizona State, the only positive from a game where its defense nearly allowed 60 points was Cam Skattebo, who ran for 108 yards.\n\nGiven that redshirt junior quarterback Trenton Bourguet had put together many respectable performances this season, I can only assume that Kenny Dillingham\u2019s main priority this week was to give the true freshman some of that valuable year-one playing experience he has missed out on for most of 2023. Because I do not necessarily think the Sun Devils\u2019 top priority was winning the game on Saturday, and Stanford has had more than its fair share of embarrassing efforts of its own, I kept them out of the bottom slot to close out the season.\n\nHowever, unless Rashada can make some substantial progress in his game over the offseason, it might behoove Dillingham to look in another direction under center heading into 2024.\n\n12. Stanford Cardinal (3-9, 2-7 Pac-12) | Last Week: 12\nMercifully, Stanford\u2019s season came to a close on Saturday night after being blown out in its own building one last time, 56-23 to Notre Dame. Stanford was the only team in the FBS that did not win a single home game, making this the first time since 2006 \u2014 excluding the COVID season \u2014 that the Cardinal did not win a home game in Palo Alto.\n\nIn seven games at Stanford Stadium this season, Stanford lost by an average margin of 19 points per game. The Fighting Irish had one strategy over the weekend: hand the ball off to Audric Estim\u00e9 and make the Cardinal defense stop him. As a result, Estim\u00e9 gained 238 yards on 25 attempts while scoring four touchdowns.\n\nNotre Dame put up 56 points of offense on a night where Sam Hartman threw the football 15 times. On the"}

The Trojans entered this week with their best ranking since 1994 and were awarded the  NCAA.com team of the week  after two wins at the Baha Mar Pink Flamingo Championship. \u201cWe kicked off this homestand with a good win,\u201d head coach Lindsey Gottlieb said. The Pac-12 Freshman of the Week, guard JuJu Watkins, scored a game-high 30 points, passing Trojan legend Lisa Leslie for most 30-point games as a freshman in USC history, with four such performances already this season. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to how hard my teammates push me, how our coach pushes me,\u201d Watkins said. Graduate guard McKenzie Forbes finished with 14 points and entered the 1,000-point club with a 3-pointer in the third quarter. \u201cMakes you reflect back on your college career,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cMeans a lot to me not just to accomplish that, but to do it with [Coach Gottlieb] and at the school and with the teammates that I have.\u201d Junior center Rayah Marshall finished with 10 points and a game-high five blocks. From the tip, USC jumped out to a hot start, taking an early 16-3 lead. The Trojans\u2019 defense was too much for the Mustangs, holding the visitors to only 10 points in the first quarter and creating 15 first-half turnovers, more than the Mustangs had in their entire last game versus Seattle University. The Trojans capitalized on the Mustangs\u2019 mistakes, scoring 16 points off turnovers in the first half. \u201cI think that was the game plan,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe wanted to be disruptive.\u201d Watkins and Forbes both got in the groove early, getting to their spots with ease. Watkins was on point in the first half, leading the way with a team-high 16 points. The Trojans\u2019 offense was the focal point of the first half, shooting 42.9% from the field and 36% from beyond the arc. The hot shooting allowed the Trojans to take a commanding 42-20 lead going into halftime. To open the second half, Watkins exited the game after colliding with an opposing Cal Poly player. \u201cI was out of control on that one,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cJust a bloody nose.\u201d  After a brief stint in the locker room, she was back on the court to end the third quarter and didn\u2019t miss a beat, scoring 14 second-half points. And in wild fashion to end the third quarter, Forbes hit a buzzer-beater three to give the Trojans a 24-point lead heading into the fourth quarter. \u201cI looked up and there were two [seconds] left. I was like, \u2018I got to get it up\u2019 and just threw it up there confidently,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cI am glad that one went in.\u201d Already up by 30 points midway through the fourth quarter, the Trojans got to rest their starters the rest of the way. Redshirt freshman guard Aaliyah Gayles put the exclamation mark on the game, scoring the first points of her USC career with a three. Gayles sat out all of last season after being shot multiple times at a house party back in 2022. She finally returned to the court this season, after being away from the game for 574 days. \u201cThat\u2019s everything to us. That\u2019s our teammate. That\u2019s our sister,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cWe all know how hard she worked to get back and everything she\u2019s been through.\u201d The Trojans look to continue their winning ways on Sunday, hosting San Diego in Galen Center at 3 p.m.\n```"}

(AP/Julia Nikhinson).\n\nBy Siena Maniatis\nNovember 28, 2023 at 10:11 pm PST\n\nWith holiday shopping in full swing, USC students are steering clear of in-store sales and letting their phones and computers do their shopping. The reason, they say, is that there are fewer big deals in stores coupled with the convenience of using online outlets instead.\n\nWith Thanksgiving just passing and Christmas right around the corner, companies nationwide have begun their annual holiday sales. Companies kicked off the savings tradition with Black Friday, and while the event used to be one of the most anticipated sales of the year, it is rapidly being replaced by Cyber Monday with in store sales increasing by 1% this year, while online sales boomed by 8.5% according to Mastercard\u2019s SpendingPulse insights.\n\nOver the past few years online shopping has increased, decreasing the amount of people in store shopping, a trend which is very apparent in Black Friday turnouts. For example, before Cyber Monday, people used to line up outside stores hours before opening on Black Friday to catch the best sales, however we rarely see this anymore.\n\nThe decrease in in-person shopping is in part due to COVID:, During the pandemic,as this is when shopping in-store began to follow a downward trend and online shopping began to become even more popular.\n\nAngel Quang, a freshman majoring in Computer Science and Business Administration, said that she preferred Cyber Monday sales to Black Friday sales because they are more \u201caccessible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s fewer sales. From what I\u2019ve seen on the Internet, there\u2019s not really a lot of people lining up for Black Friday shopping...It\u2019s like 20% off but at what cost?\u201d Quang said.\n\nAnother student, Uso Atuegbu, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, agreed, saying that most of the sales aren\u2019t \u201csteals\u201d anymore which makes it less desirable and worthwhile for shoppers, especially in-store.\n\nProfessor Vitaly Glozman, who teaches data sciences and operations in the Marshall School of Business, says that the overall discount percentages offered during sales this year are roughly the same as in past years. But consumers feel that the savings are less because the overall price per item has increased.\n\nGlozman also believes that despite the rise in online shopping with sales such as Cyber Monday, people will continue to shop in stores around the holidays, especially for more expensive items.\n\n\u201cI think people complain, but a lot of people kind of like the atmosphere, the social atmosphere, and the whole holiday spirit,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile he is unsure if most of the buying will be done online versus in store he expects people will go to malls and retail stores even if it is just for the experience.\n\nHowever, USC senior and acting major, Corey Gifft, is done with holiday shopping and sales, chalking it up to \u201cmarketing manipulation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe state of our economy has fallen into this hyper-capitalistic view that isn\u2019t sustainable for growing or incoming generations. Also Black Friday was just terrible. The sales didn\u2019t really feel like sales,\u201d he said.\n\nAs holiday shopping continues throughout the season, it is clear that students will be doing the bulk of their shopping online.\n```"}

In between classes, each roommate takes turns baking and hand-delivering their baked goodies by bike on streets surrounding the university.\n\nMax Afrasiabi, a junior studying philosophy, says he grew up surrounded by freshly-baked bread in his community of Portland, Oregon. When he came to college, it was one thing he longed for back home. \u201cI really was craving handmade bread, so about a month ago I decided to dive into it,\u201d Afrasiabi said. \u201cWe started baking bread here in our house at 1380, which is our address. We started making bread and it came out really, really well the first time, and since then we started making bread every week.\u201d\n\nKarim Fouad, a senior studying architecture, had been cooking before he moved into 1380 with his other roommates. \u201cWe just naturally started cooking together, cooking meals for each other, and whenever we would spend time together it was just something we would do,\u201d Fouad said.\n\nThe business was created when the roommates came together to cater a friend\u2019s birthday party earlier this semester. \u201cI think there is something about cooking for someone, and when they enjoy the food it is one of the most rewarding feelings,\u201d Fouad said.\n\nCustomers interested in buying their bread can directly scan a QR code to the order form, located on their Instagram and website. 1380 Studio is currently selling one type of bread on their website, their \u201cOriginal Country Loaf.\u201d Each loaf sells for $13.80 and is delivered directly to each customer\u2019s door.\n\nAfrasiabi spends about three hours on every two loaves of bread, beginning the night before and continuing to bake until the next morning. \u201cIt\u2019s like a round, big round, beautiful loaf of bread, kind of like a big sourdough loaf, and it\u2019s very, very similar to sourdough...,\u201d Afrasiabi said. \u201cSo that\u2019s our main thing because it\u2019s just so good for everything.\u201d\n\nAfrasiabi explained that their original loaf is used for a variety of different things: a sandwich, french toast and even croutons. 1380 Studio made its first debut on campus at the Mena Marketplace by USC\u2019s Middle Eastern North African Student Assembly on Tuesday. The roommates began baking bread for the market a week before Thanksgiving.\n\n1380 Studio created a specialized menu for the marketplace that featured their original country loaf, a ful pita sandwich, jam and za\u2019atar butter. \u201cWe were trying to make it Middle Eastern-themed to really tie it back to me and Karim,\u201d Afrasiabi said. \u201cI\u2019m Persian and he\u2019s Egyptian, so we were really trying to bring in the food that we know and that we grew up with to create a menu more specifically for the MENASA market.\u201d\n\nAfrasiabi explained that while 1380 Studio is currently only selling bread, it is just the beginning. The roommates hope that 1380 Studio will become a \u201csize-specific, event-based kitchen\u201d that can do consistent catering. \u201cWe are definitely not limited to bread, we do all sorts of cooking,\u201d Afrasiabi said. \u201cWe\u2019re really just looking to do any sort of cooking. We really love cooking for people and providing that experience and bringing them together to really have a wonderful time.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP/Young Kwak)\n\nBy Matthew Andrade\nNovember 28, 2023 at 9:14 pm PST\n\n\u201cShout\u201d is a column by Matthew Andrade about college football.\n\nWe knew the party had to end at some point. For most of the Pac-12 footprint, the party ended at around midnight on Saturday when the lights at the Rose Bowl turned off, putting the final Pac-12 regular season in the rearview mirror once and for all. Oregon State fans would dispute that timeline. For them, the party ended before the Beavers took the field against Oregon \u2014 hours before, in fact. Before kickoff, it was reported that Oregon State head coach Jonathan Smith was set to take the head coaching job at Michigan State. Oregon showed some of Michigan State\u2019s game against Penn State on the video board during the Ducks-Beavers matchup to poke fun. When the hire was made official Saturday morning, Oregon State fans were in the dumps.\n\nPotential for a nine-win season doesn\u2019t negate reality. Oregon State\u2019s situation is dire: No conference, no coach, no future. You can\u2019t blame Beaver fans for feeling that way. To be in a Power Five conference one second and then left behind the next is unfathomable. It\u2019s something college football is supposed to protect. The small college towns of America built this sport. But the sport has opted for a professional model. Don\u2019t like your current situation? Well, you can\u2019t relocate the university, so switch to a midwestern conference where, supposedly, the grass is so much greener. Why care what happens to anyone in your wake?\n\nOregon State and Washington State are the schools currently drowning in that wake. Those two are trying to find a way to keep the conference alive. What\u2019s most likely is that they\u2019ll play for a couple seasons as just two conference teams under the brand of the Pac-12 in order to keep the conference\u2019s assets and rebuild the league. That may work to a certain extent, but the new Pac-12 won\u2019t feel the same. Everyone knows that. It\u2019s possible Oregon State will never be as strong as they\u2019ve been these past couple of seasons either. It hurts losing the head coach who turned around a program from 1-11 to three straight winning seasons. What\u2019s his connection to Michigan State anyway? He\u2019s from the West Coast. He played in a Fiesta Bowl with the Beavers. The closest he\u2019s coached to the state of Michigan was as the offensive coordinator for Montana. Yet, you can\u2019t blame him for leaving.\n\nIt\u2019s inevitable that Oregon State will be dropping down to the Group of Five (now Group of Six) level. The Beavers could dominate down there, sure, but everyone wants to compete at the top. Oregon State\u2019s situation isn\u2019t Smith\u2019s fault. He\u2019s done everything in his power to build that brand, as a coach and as a player. That\u2019s the most frustrating part of all of this. Oregon State isn\u2019t lying idle while the rest of college football passes it by. Oregon State put $162 million into renovating Reser Stadium. The Beavers\u2019 athletic director presented a contract extension to Smith mere weeks ago. Top transfers like former Clemson quarterback DJ Uiagalelei made themselves at home in Corvallis. Oh, should I mention that Oregon State is 18-7 in its last two seasons? The Beavers have invested in football, but none of it matters. They\u2019ll be left behind all the same while a program that\u2019s 34-34 in its six seasons with its head coach will get to march off into the sunset to cash yearly checks of nearly $100 million. What that money is for, if not the one thing that could drastically improve the football program \u2014 hiring a new head coach \u2014 I do not know.\n\nThe hit to Oregon State over the weekend is the first of many to come as this destructive wave of realignment settles. The next blows will be felt next season when we remember how we had it made when these 12 programs were together. Then again, passionate fan bases aren\u2019t what move the needle. The average fan \u2014 who can\u2019t contain their excitement when they see USC-Ohio State and Oregon-Michigan as upcoming conference matchups \u2014 is who the sport is trying to cater to anyway. TV ratings will be up as a result. Everything will be right with the world if viewership and money are what you care about. But some of us don\u2019t care about that. We would watch UCLA-Arizona State if there were two other people in the entire world who had interest. We appreciate what makes this sport different from the NFL: upsets, rivalries and passion. So, as we approach the final Pac-12 championship, celebrate the moment. Cherish this conference. There will never be anything quite like it.\n\n\u201cShout\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

What would a 12-team College Football Playoff look like this season? \n\nBy Terence Holton November 28, 2023 at  6:49 pm PST \n\n\u201cThe Big Ten Breakdown, Vol. II\u201d is a column by Terence Holton about the new look of college football. The Pac-12 has officially come and gone. However, even greater changes to the college football world are upon us. While for the past nine years we have enjoyed a four-team College Football Playoff, next season there will be 12 teams duking it out for the coveted crown of national champions. So, what would that look like in this current season? Because conference championship week is this upcoming weekend, I will also be adding in my predictions to who will win their respective conference titles, as well as foretelling who I believe would deserve to make it in this 12-team playoff scenario.\n\nThe first-round byes: In this new 12-team setting, the top four ranked Power Four conference champions will receive a first-round bye. This season, I believe the top four ranked in order will be: No. 1 Georgia, No. 2 Michigan, No. 3 Oregon and No. 4 Texas. The top four are all damn good football teams. Some may ask why Washington does not have the bye over Oregon, as earlier this year the Huskies beat the Ducks. Bluntly, Washington has looked bad, while Oregon has been rolling. Washington is squeaking by unranked opponents, while the Ducks are clobbering teams like Utah and Oregon State, two teams the Huskies narrowly escaped. Vegas agrees with my Oregon prediction, as the Ducks are favored by 9.5 points heading into Friday\u2019s game. As for the other three, Texas gets in because it beat Alabama in Tuscaloosa and are Big-12 champs, but Georgia and Michigan ... They are far and away the best teams in the country. I have praised Oregon this year, but this season is really Georgia and Michigan\u2019s to lose \u2014 both look incredibly dominant.\n\nFirst-round home field advantage: This is where this starts to get a bit more tricky and hard to predict. In order, the next four teams should be: No. 5 Ohio State, No. 6 Washington, No. 7 Florida State and No. 8 Alabama. Both Washington and Florida State head into this weekend undefeated; however, I believe they will both lose their conference championship games. Without senior quarterback Jordan Travis, the Seminoles look lost. Florida State\u2019s defense is great, but it barely edged out the disappointing Florida Gators. I already explained my thinking about Washington, but only one loss to No. 3 Oregon means it deserves the No. 6 seed. Ohio State has an argument to make the four-team playoff this season, and I believe it 100% deserves to be the top home-field advantage squad. Frankly, the reason they lost to Michigan is because sophomore quarterback Kyle McCord stinks \u2014 in my opinion. If this current team had CJ Stroud, it would have beaten Michigan. Alabama is a tricky one, because they will have two losses. However, those losses will have been to Georgia and Texas. I will never count out a Nick Saban-led Alabama Crimson Tide. As long as that man is coaching, Alabama has the ability to beat anyone. The Crimson Tide can still compete with the best of the best and therefore still deserve home field advantage in the first round.\n\nThe Underdogs: These four teams will be playing on the road for the first-round matchup, but they\u2019re why the playoff expansion is so great. The three best available Power Five teams will make it, and then the fun part: the best overall Group of Five team will be in. This is how I believe the rankings should go for the best available now: No. 9 Missouri, No. 10 Arizona, No. 11 Louisville and No. 12 Tulane. Sadly, the team that caused the Trojans collapse during the Sugar Bowl last season in Tulane makes it, but it is great that Group of Five teams get a chance to shake things up. Missouri is a great team. The Tigers are 10-2 with dominant wins over Tennessee and a close loss to Georgia. Missouri has arguably the second-best wide receiver in college football in sophomore Luther Burden III, coupled with a phenomenal running back in senior Cody Schrader. The Tigers could easily shake things up. I think Arizona is a top 10 team in the country. Redshirt freshman quarterback Noah Fifita took over halfway through the season and blew the college football world away. Head coach Jedd Fisch has done a masterful job with a team that went 1-11 two years ago, but the Wildcats are now sitting at 9-3 and playing some really fun football. Louisville will deserve to be in after beating undefeated Florida State. The Cardinals have been one of the biggest surprises of the seasons and have looked fantastic, therefore deserving to be ranked No. 11. With all that being said, here\u2019s what the exact matchups would look like.\n\nNo. 1 Georgia -Bye- Plays winner of 8/9 matchup\nNo. 2 Michigan -Bye- Plays winner of 7/10 matchup\nNo. 3 Oregon -Bye- Plays winner of 6/11 matchup\nNo. 4 Texas -Bye- Plays winner of 5/12 matchup\nNo. 5 Ohio State vs No. 12 Tulane\nNo. 6 Washington vs No. 11 Louisville\nNo. 7 Florida State vs No. 10 Arizona\nNo. 8 Alabama vs No. 9 Missouri\n\nThe 12-team playoff truly cannot come quick enough, and I think other Trojan fans should feel the same way, as it will be even easier for USC to make their first playoff appearance. \u201cThe Big Ten Breakdown, Vol. II\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

Chavez says thefts have been an ongoing problem. In 2019, a plaque honoring farm labor leader Cesar Chavez was stolen. More recently, plaques have been stolen from Veteran Memorial Park in Downey and from a park in Boyle Heights.\n\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s the same individual suspects that are the ones targeting this particular area,\u201d Chavez said. Chavez said it appears the thieves used chisels, sledgehammers and battery-operated screwdrivers and left broken concrete and bricks.\n\n\u201cWe calculated for us as a department that the value is over $100,000,\u201d said Chavez.

For each copy of the book purchased today or tomorrow, the Jester & Pharley Phund will donate another to the Orthopaedic Institute for Children.\n\nBrittany Hart Scholten, the civic engagement coordinator at Annenberg, explained that the school partners with a nonprofit organization every holiday season to benefit the local community. This year, they chose The Jester & Pharley Phund, started by Barbara and Joe Saltzman, in remembrance of their late son David.\n\nThe mission of The Jester & Pharley Phund is to \u201cempower economically disadvantaged and ill children facing serious challenges by sharing the universal messages of perseverance, resilience, hope and joy.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe and Barbara Saltzman are fixtures of the Annenberg community. Joe has been a professor here for 56 years,\u201d Hart Scholten said. \u201cJoe and Barbara have gone around California and brought so many good programs, like literacy programs for example, donating books to schools in low-income areas and also to hospitals.\u201d\n\nThe Saltzmans\u2019 son David passed away from cancer, and he wrote and illustrated the book \u201cThe Jester Has Lost His Jingle\u201d before he died. The book focuses on the story of a jester who can\u2019t make his kingdom laugh and sets off on a quest to find joy. During their journey, the jester and his sidekick, Pharley, learn that laughter \u201ccan provide the best tonic for anyone facing seemingly insurmountable obstacles.\u201d\n\nThe book has sold hundreds of thousands of copies since its publication 28 years ago and is a New York Times Bestseller, but the numbers and accolades don\u2019t compare to the human connection to Barbara Saltzman. She and Joe promised David to give a copy of the book to every kid in the country with cancer \u2014 at the time around 10,000 children \u2014 and they did that, she said. Now, they are hoping to donate one to any kid who is struggling.\n\n\u201cSo many are facing serious challenges these days that it really makes us feel proud and happy to be able to help these kids with the vision that David has in the book,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a vision of optimism and joy and happiness.\u201d\n\nSaltzman said that she receives many letters from adults who grew up with the book and have returned to it when in need of a pick-me-up. \u201c\u2018The Jester\u2019 is so impactful to a young audience because no matter the age of the children or what is going on in their lives, they all have complicated days, sad days, maybe a day when someone teases them,\u201d said Saltzman, \u201cSo, while on the surface it\u2019s a children\u2019s book, it really is for every single age \u2014 people of every experience just fall in love with it.\u201d\n\nHart Scholten said that her two young sons love reading \u201cThe Jester Has Lost His Jingle\u201d and playing with their jester dolls. \u201cThey\u2019ve even drawn stuff from the book,\u201d Hart Scholten said, \u201cand there\u2019s a quote in there that really resonated with my seven-year-old boy: \u2018So when you\u2019re feeling lonely or sad or bad or blue, remember where laughter\u2019s hiding...

(Photo by Marco Verch, licensed under Creative Commons 2.0) \n\nBy Anthony Clingerman and Lana Diab November 28, 2023 at 6:11 pm PST\n\nRecord holiday spending is setting the stage for a possibly impactful Giving Tuesday this week. Giving Tuesday is an opportunity for nonprofit corporations to raise funding on the heels of the holiday spirit and is usually witness to an increased amount of donations compared to the rest of the year. Many businesses rely on the money raised during holiday drives to continue operation, but less than half of Americans donated to charity at all last year.\n\nThis year\u2019s Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales provided an important glimpse at the current state of the economy, as Adobe Analytics reported $22 billion dollars being spent over the course of the shopping season. These numbers represent a large increase across the board from last year\u2019s sales numbers, but heightened consumerism may not equate to a similar increase in charity for Giving Tuesday.\n\nThe National Council of Nonprofits released a report earlier this year that indicates diminished donations for multiple organizations, as 2022 saw a decreased rate of giving for only the fourth time in four decades. Danny Feingold, the founder and publisher of a nonprofit journalism publication Capital and Main, elaborates on the importance of donations for nonprofit organizations.\n\n\u201cAll nonprofit organizations rely, to a greater or lesser extent, on support from the communities that they serve,\u201d Feingold said. \u201cWithout that support, it\u2019s difficult, sometimes impossible for us to serve the communities and to succeed at our mission.\u201d\n\nGiving Tuesday provides companies and communities the opportunity to invest in a cause they deem important. \u201cAt this moment when there\u2019s so much at stake for the country, this is a particularly critical time,\u201d Feingold said. \u201cPeople give to those organizations that are consistent with their own values and what they want to see in American society.\u201d\n\nWealthy donors represent the largest opportunity for hopeful nonprofits, as a study conducted by the Bank of America demonstrates a disproportionate amount of capital coming from this sector. Households with an annual income of $200,000 are actually donating more money than before the Pandemic.\n\nNonprofit organizations often court these super donors as a large percentage of their economic planning, and seek outside sponsors to supplement other revenue streams. Multiple economic factors are to blame for the lack of charity by traditional consumers, but heightened rates of inflation are one of the main culprits.\n\nSupply chain issues during the pandemic were compounded by a shift to work-from-home efforts, and information from the National Bureau of Economic Research indicates that the resultant prices are here to stay.\n\nNot every organization holds a pessimistic view of the current situation as many anticipate a much needed infusion of funding as part of the holiday. Giving Tuesday saw a large amount of capital invested prior to COVID, but 2022 set a new record with $3.1 billion in donations.\n\n\u201cI think that to help one another is one way that we can move forward in society, and create unity and companionship,\u201d said Asa Simmons, a team leader for Little Saint Nick Foundation. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve kind of strayed away from and we only help those people who we personally care about.\u201d\n```"}

We let students air their grievances and share their least favorite Christmas songs. So, brace yourself for some festive critiques and maybe a few \u2018bah humbugs.\u2019\n\nChristmas is a holiday known for its iconic music. We all know someone who\u2019s obsessed with Christmas music, maybe even started playing it the day after Halloween, but the quieter population we don\u2019t talk about are those who maybe prefer not to capture their holiday cheer through song. So, let\u2019s compare some of USC\u2019s favorite and least favorite Christmas songs.\n\nMaysi Ang, an international student, is a fan of the classics.\nMaysi Ang: I think the classic All I Want by-- Oh, All I Want for Christmas by Mariah Carey. However, being an international student, she may not have spent enough time to be annoyed by a Christmas song yet.\nAng: I don\u2019t think I have any. Like, even Jingle Bells is nice to me. To be honest, because I\u2019m from Singapore, so we don\u2019t really celebrate Christmas at home. It gives me the Christmas vibes, I think, which is really, really nice.\n\nAnd for those who like Christmas more than the average person, their favorite is as important as what presents they give. Gabrielle Gonzalez, a freshman, is one of these people.\nGabrielle Gonzalez: I\u2019m a Christmas lover. Just like Ang, Maria Carey is a staple on her Christmas playlist.\nGonzalez: I like the Mariah Carey Christmas song, and that\u2019s my favorite. All I want for Christmas is you. That one. I can listen to that year-round. But even someone who loves the holidays has their limits.\nGonzalez: I\u2019m trying to think probably one of the Justin Bieber Christmas songs like I don\u2019t know. I do, but I don\u2019t hate them. They\u2019re just not my favorite.\n\nAlex Bland, also a freshman, doesn\u2019t entirely agree. Despite also being a self-proclaimed Christmas lover, she shares entirely opposite feelings as her friend Gabrielle.\nAlex Bland: I\u2019m going to have to say Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas is you. Yeah, it\u2019s definitely because it\u2019s so overplayed on Tik-Tok it like it genuinely just, like, gives me a headache. And Bland\u2019s favorite? Gonzalez\u2019s least favorite.\nBland: In contrary to Gabrielle, I have to say, Justin Bieber\u2019s and the Disney channels like Happy Universal Holidays. I love that. Gonzalez: Alex has been playing Christmas songs since October.\n\nBut let\u2019s not forget that for some people, finals week is an obstacle before winter break that cannot be overlooked and can definitely dampen the festive mood. Kirstan Azarrage, a sophomore, has a different relationship with Christmas music.\nKirstan Azarrage: Christmas time makes me a little anxious because it\u2019s like the end of the semester finals and all of that. So, I\u2019ve been associating Christmas music with that anxiety. Yeah.\n\nAnd for some students, they relate to Christmas songs that reflect more of the California weather. Hayden Brown talks about her favorite:\nHayden Brown: My favorite Christmas song is Winter Things by Ariana Grande. I think it\u2019s really cute. It\u2019s a very quaint song, but I like that she talks about being in a warmer climate because I\u2019m originally from Hawaii and now I live in L.A., so I\u2019ve never really had like a cold winter. And it\u2019s just it\u2019s a fun, sweet couple song and yeah.\n\nHowever, not all Christmas songs can provide that feeling. Brown: Okay, my least favorite is Baby it\u2019s cold outside. Super creepy vibes. Like super creepy that the woman wants to leave, and this guy is like, keeping her in the house. Being like, No, it\u2019s so cool. Like, don\u2019t leave. Just a very outdated song. I feel like that has a lot of sentimental value to older generations that I\u2019ve really never understood myself. So that would be my least favorite.\n\nFor others, like Jaxson Hill, a graduate student, his favorite Christmas song is a reflection of what he grew up with.\nJaxon Hill: I would say my favorite Christmas song is The Peace Carol, which is a special that John Denver, who\u2019s famous for taking home country roads, as you probably heard saying, with the Muppets on a Christmas special. And I don\u2019t know, I listen to it a lot as a child, so it brings a lot of good childhood Christmas memories.\n\nIt seems the holidays have a way of bringing people together, even if it\u2019s over trivial arguments on classic Christmas songs. Regardless of how much you love or hate Christmas songs, there will be no escaping them in the coming weeks.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Erick Trevino.\n```"}

And what better way to get into the holiday season than through some of your favorite holiday films. When it comes to holiday movies, everyone is familiar with the popular classics from \u201cHome Alone\u201d to \u201cHow the Grinch Stole Christmas,\u201d but what about the lesser known holiday flicks?\n\nSpeaking to USC students, we got to find out some of their favorite non-traditional films to view during the holidays. One film that focuses on the meaning of coming together during the holidays is the 2011 film \u201cGood Luck Charlie: It\u2019s Christmas!\u201d The movie focuses on the ups and downs between a mother and her daughter as they road trip across America during the holidays. It is a very heartwarming film that shows how a family bond only grows stronger during the Christmas season.\n\nUSC student Alex Gramajo has made the film a holiday staple for himself as he has watched the movie at least once for the past six Christmases. \u201cIt is just a very touching movie to me, and it reminds me of my relationship with my siblings as we all watch it together every year,\u201d said Gramajo.\n\nFans of the superhero genre will not be disappointed during the holidays as they have not one, but two films they can watch. The first choice being the 1992 film \u201cBatman Returns.\u201d The film is a sequel to the hit 1989 movie \u201cBatman,\u201d and follows the dark knight as he battles against his nemesis the Penguin during the Christmas season. The film features a very winter time aesthetic with most of the set design being buildings covered in snow and ice.\n\n\u201cI like how the film balances the festive and light tone of Christmas, but also has that bit of darkness that comes with the holidays,\u201d said Julianna Townley.\n\nAnother superhero film people can watch is the 2013 film \u201cIron Man 3.\u201d The film follows genius billionaire Tony Stark as he suits up as Iron Man to fight crime on a Christmas Eve backdrop. The film has a great combination of action, humor, and heart, with heart being a mainstay in holiday films, but the action and humor element make this film pretty unique.\n\n\u201cEven though Christmas is in the background of this movie, I feel like the movie still does have that holiday spirit that every classic Christmas movie needs,\u201d said Sophia Flores.\n\nThe next choice is for any fan of the wizarding world, the 2001 film \u201cHarry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone.\u201d The film is the first entry in the magical series and follows Harry during his first year at Hogwarts. Although the majority of the film does not take place over the holiday season, it does feature elements that we find in many holiday films, such as friendship and belonging.\n\nUSC student Olivia Guizzo enjoys watching the Harry Potter films during the holiday season, because she likes how the series features the elements of acceptance and family amongst the main cast. \u201cEven though the film is not particularly a holiday film, I just like how warm and soothing the halls of Hogwarts look, it reminds me of being cozy in bed during winter and the holidays,\u201d said Guizzo.\n\nNow that you have heard some USC student\u2019s favorite unconventional holiday films, maybe you think twice about whether to watch the same old holiday movie you watch every year, or consider trying something new.\n```"}

During their acceptance speech, Mon\u00e1e highlighted the significance of the Soul Train Awards. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like being recognized by your own family,\u201d Mon\u00e1e said. \u201cI\u2019m so honored to have something like this for us that continues to evolve and showcase so many different forms of what soul can be.\u201d\n\nPalmer paid respects to Don Cornelius, the original creator and host of Soul Train. His efforts created an opportunity for the public to see a positive representation of Black culture that showcases their unique experiences, fashion style, music and dance moves. The show was broadcast nationally in 1971 when it moved from Chicago to Los Angeles. In 1987, they began giving out annual Soul Train Awards to honor Black artists in the entertainment industry.\n\nTo close out the night, T-Pain delivered a medley of his greatest hits after receiving The Legend Award. Then the crowd went into party mode as he performed \u201cBuy U a Drank,\u201d \u201cBartender,\u201d \u201cLow\u201d and others. In his acceptance speech, T-Pain encouraged upcoming artists to chase their dreams no matter what negativity the world spews. \u201cTo new artists out there, I don\u2019t want you to chase this,\u201d T-Pain said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to base your life on how many of these people in this crowd can tell you that you can have this. I want you to know that you already got this... Be who you are unapologetically. Be whoever you want to be.\u201d \n```"}

It\u2019s the 27th anniversary of David Saltzman New York Times best-seller, \u201cThe Jester Has Lost His Jingle\u201d. Saltzman wrote the heartfelt book as his senior year project at Yale University before he passed away from Hodgkin\u2019s disease in 1990. The Pharley Phund embraces Saltzman\u2019s message to bring hope to children coping with illness. Throughout the year they gift thousands of ill children with the jester book and jester doll to uplift their spirits with a jingle and a smile.\n\nBarbara Saltzman, the mother of the author and founder of The Jester & Pharley Phund, who was present at the event, truly believes these pages are special. Barbara Saltzman: This book has a wonderful vision of optimism and joy and happiness and how it\u2019s always with you no matter what. The colorful children\u2019s book is filled with laughter and love. After the jester loses his special jingle and is banned from the castle, he travels to rediscover happiness. On his journey he visits a little girl in a hospital who teaches him a very important lesson - that one can still find happiness and a sense of humor despite their circumstances.\n\nSaltzman\u2019s favorite part of the book is the concluding message when the jester races back to the castle with rainbows behind him. Saltzman: And he says they found where laughter has been hiding. It\u2019s hiding inside everyone. It\u2019s buried deep within. You just need to give it a little push to make it pop right out.\n\nIn lieu of Giving Tuesday and the holiday season, the USC community participated in this inspirational tradition. People can buy the book and plush doll to give a squeeze and a big smile to a child who may need extra Christmas cheer. The book is on sale for $20, $24 for a bilingual version and $25 for the jester. For every book or doll purchased today and tomorrow, The Jester & Pharley Phund will donate another to the Orthopedic Institute for Children.\n\nWhile they book may look like a children\u2019s book it impacts people far beyond their childhood. Saltzman: I can\u2019t tell you how excited I am to hear from people who love the book. They got the book when they were babies 28 years ago and they love it. And it still helps them every day when they have a tough day so I hope everybody will know that this book is not just delightful for little ones. But it is really so important for all of us to have it because we all have bad days once in a while, and it\u2019s good to find a way to find the laughter that\u2019s hiding inside us.\n\nThere is nothing like the warm feeling inside of giving. Look for other opportunities to give back this season.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Erika Driscoll.\n```"}

Community members and families can donate toys at any local fire station. Donated toys will be given to kids in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange, Ventura and Riverside counties and proceeds will go to buying toys or sports equipment for children in need.\n\nFire Station 15 Captain Anthony Reyna spoke on the importance of stations being a place to accept donations for those less fortunate this holiday season.\n\nAnthony Reyna: We don\u2019t only respond to emergencies and people when they\u2019re in dire need of medical care or things like that. But we\u2019re also supposed to imprint ourselves in the community itself. And I think with kids, especially during holidays, when they\u2019re they don\u2019t have the ability, or their families don\u2019t have the ability to provide toys and all the holiday spirit that kids should be able to grow up with. I think it\u2019s important for us to kind of step in and help assist families with that.\n\nIn addition to the fire fighters helping, Reyna witnesses\u2019 families turning in donations more often, passing on the gift of giving to their children.\n\nReyna: The majority of people that are coming in and donating to us now, our families. So what\u2019s happening is you see that the parents are trying to instill a belief of gift of giving to their children that are coming in. And it\u2019s just instilling somebody for the next generation of kids and next generation of people.\n\nFor second year applied math major, Isaac Lustre, his mother passed on such beliefs.\n\nIsaac Lustre: From a young age, my mom especially taught me to be very compassionate and caring for others. I\u2019m Filipino and we have a lot of family in the Philippines. And so, what we would do is donate all of my old stuff and all my old toys to our Filipino families. And we\u2019ve also donated like a lot to fire stations because I\u2019m from the Valley, so a lot of fires are around the area. So, we would often like donate stuff to fire stations.\n\nFor those interested in donating toys for the drive, head out to your local fire station or check-out the upcoming Stuff-A-Bus Events happening in December 1, 8 and 15.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Dan LeFebvre)\n\nBy Todd Takeuchi\nNovember 28, 2023 at 5:37 pm PST\n\nSometimes you can get coal in your stocking even if you\u2019re on the nice list. Christmas is a time filled with an array of flashing lights, the smell of peppermint and an assortment of decorations surrounding various neighborhoods. Friends and family members gather around the Christmas tree and cherish the time they have with one another during this holiday season. Embedded with the traditions of Christmas comes the art of gift-giving. Whether people have been naughty or nice, the anticipation builds as people patiently wait to see if they got what they wished for.\n\nAs the sun rises on Christmas day, many race to the tree, reading the labels of all the presents and tearing up the wrapping paper with their names on it. As they get to their presents, some are filled with excitement, pulling out the items they wished for. But there are some who are unlucky when opening their gifts, leaving them puzzled as to what they\u2019re looking at. How does one react when the present they received is something they didn\u2019t want?\n\nUSC students across the campus shared their Christmas stories of times when they were left with a present they didn\u2019t like in the slightest. Donovan Wood, a sophomore majoring in business administration, was baffled by what he saw when he opened up his present. Wood explained how it came off a bit weird knowing that he had received something that he would have no trouble getting for free.\n\n\u201cOne year I got a toothbrush and toothpaste. Which is kind of weird because my mom is a dentist,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIf we are going down the route of giving gifts for teeth, maybe an electric toothbrush would\u2019ve been a bit better.\u201d\n\nAlejandra Moreno, a freshman majoring in psychology, had instant regret when she opened the box to see what was inside. Moreno knew that what she had in her hands, she would never put on her body.\n\n\u201cWould definitely love to get age-appropriate clothing,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cWhen I was 15, I remember one of my aunts got me a shirt with a minion on it. I was already too old for that shirt when I got it. But it would\u2019ve been cool for me to wear maybe when I was seven.\u201d\n\nAlex Weir, a freshman majoring in business administration, had one of the most \u201cunique\u201d gifts that left him in a state of uncertainty, not knowing the meaning behind someone giving him this gift.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really sure why, but one time someone gave me a single quarter for Christmas,\u201d Weir said. \u201cI opened my stocking and thought that it might\u2019ve been something else. To be honest, that quarter is probably still in a piggy bank somewhere in my house.\u201d\n\nDenisea Lavato, a sophomore majoring in accounting, was a little bit annoyed by the gift she received because it was something that she didn\u2019t ask for. But it was also something that she would\u2019ve never imagined getting as well.\n\n\u201cI got a hedgehog one year. Not really sure why, but my older sister just got it for me,\u201d Lavato said. \u201cHaving that thing around, they\u2019re kind of a pain in the ass. I would\u2019ve rather preferred a purse, some clothes or something low maintenance.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of the Cooper Family)\n\nBy Anthony Bottino November 27, 2023 at 11:04 pm PST\n\n\u201cUSC Unsung Heroes\u201d is a column by Anthony Bottino that talks about elite USC athletes who aren\u2019t on one of the school\u2019s Division I teams. The most basic requirement to do a sport is that you have to practice and exercise. For many sports, this comes in the form of going to the gym and lifting weights. Aside from athletes, countless people go to the gym to work out. It is such a common thing for so many people. However, very few people take it to the next level and compete in lifting weights.\n\nUnlike most, the Cooper twins have turned going to the gym into their sport by becoming powerlifters. Brooklyn and Kingston Cooper, both 19 and sophomore business administration majors, originally from Texas but now living in California, hold state records in powerlifting. They both have the raw records in bench and deadlift for their respective weight classes (Kingston 52 kg and Brooklyn 56 kg) under the Teen III category (17-19 years old).\n\nThe duo has had a love for lifting for most of their lives, but they didn\u2019t start out as powerlifters. Growing up and to this day, the two have been inseparable. They had the same interests and did everything together. This brought them to start their powerlifting journey together. Their love for the gym and lifting began in middle school with a strength and conditioning class. They loved the class and were immediately hooked, starting to go to the gym outside of class.\n\nAlong with the help of their dad, they began going to the gym multiple times a week, and their competitive nature took over. It was still a few years before they would make the jump to being full-fledged powerlifters, though, because they still had an interest in track and field. Brooklyn ran the mile, and Kingston ran the 400 meters. But as much as they enjoyed running, they still loved lifting even more. Even with the track season going on, they still continued to lift.\n\nBack and groin injuries sustained by both twins from track made lifting more viable. If there wasn\u2019t enough motivation for them already to make the switch to powerlifting, then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Kingston and Brooklyn utilized their new free time by hitting the weights hard. They weren\u2019t just lifting to stay in shape or simply to work out. Now they were doing it with the goal of getting stronger.\n\nAs the year went on, their dad started to take notice. He did some research and discovered that for their age and weight, they were lifting a lot more than the average person. Their father turned into a coach, giving the twins the extra push they needed to finally become powerlifters.\n\n\u201cEven before we started powerlifting, he\u2019s been coaching us in terms of our general lifting,\u201d Brooklyn said. \u201cHe goes to the gym a lot and loves working out, so I think that influenced us a lot. He\u2019s very passionate and did a lot of research, so he gave us that knowledge.\u201d\n\nWith track behind them and the world of powerlifting ahead, it was time for them to join a team. Luckily, their high school had a powerlifting team. It wasn\u2019t exactly like every other school team, though. It didn\u2019t receive as much funding or attention as the other sports, so it was more informal. Most of the people on the team were athletes who saw it as a way to stay in shape and get stronger during the offseason. Brooklyn and Kingston were really the only ones with an actual interest in powerlifting and competing. In fact, they were the only girls on the team.\n\nThis created a unique dynamic for the team, but the twins found many positives from it. Being the only girls, they were able to get much more attention from the coaches at competitions since there was no one else for them to compete with. It allowed them to advance in their lifting and is what really grew their love for the sport. Not only that, but it was an experience that they got to share together.\n\nSince they have a strong bond with each other, when it came time to apply for colleges, they immediately knew they wanted to go together. They both applied to the same universities with the same major and planned on rooming together.\n\n\u201cWe are each other\u2019s support system, even in the gym she is always there for me,\u201d Brooklyn said. \u201cIn the gym and academically, she [Kingston] pushes me to do better.\u201d\n\nWhen they both got into USC, they decided to attend together due to academics, student life and the fact that its gyms had a slight edge over other schools. When they finally arrived at USC and discovered the Trojan Barbell Club, they knew they had to join. They were already well-versed in powerlifting competitions, and the club only elevated their training and performances, while also making competitions more accessible.\n\n\u201cThey helped us go to our first meet with USAPPL (USA Powerlifting). At the meet, they help you, and it makes it a lot less stressful,\u201d Kingston said. \u201cThey guided us through the USAPPL process and helped prepare us for the meet.\u201d\n\nWith a year of the Trojan Barbell Club under their belt and learning how to compete through USAPPL, they decided to compete on their own throughout the summer. Now that their family had also moved to California, they could go for state records, too. In the summer, they attended the SoCal Summer Smash competition.\n\nWhen the twins started powerlifting, they had no intention of breaking any state records, but they would end up pleasantly surprised. As they kept training and the meet got closer, they realized they both had a very good chance of breaking the state record.\n\n\u201cWhen we first got into it, I never thought about any records,\u201d Brooklyn said. \u201cWhen we saw how close we were, it was still kind of unbelievable for us, because it showed how far we had come.\u201d\n\nWhen the meet came, it was time to see if their dream could come true and if the training paid off. Kingston was up first in the 52kg Teen III division for raw bench. For Kingston, the barbell went up easily, and she became the first of the twins to break a California record. She benched 70 kg.\n\nBrooklyn would soon follow suit, but not without drama. On the first of three tries, Brooklyn broke the record. On her second attempt, she added more weight but wasn\u2019t able to lift it. The two were nervous for the third and final attempt, but this time, Brooklyn did it, benching 72.5 kg and officially becoming the raw bench California record holder in the 56kg Teen III category.\n\nIn the same meet, they both broke records together and were able to celebrate their hard work paying off. This wouldn\u2019t be the only record they would go on to break, though. In the fall, at a meet with the Trojan Barbell Club, they both broke the California raw deadlift record for their weight classes.\n\nThey had faith in themselves for the bench press record, but the deadlift came as a shock to them.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would come close to the deadlift record anytime soon. I didn\u2019t think I was anywhere close to it,\u201d Brooklyn said.\n\n\u201cDeadlift I didn\u2019t expect because I have a pretty bad back, and I was stuck at the same weight. I just never expected to be able to deadlift as much as I can,\u201d Kingston said.\n\nBrooklyn and Kingston were able to achieve an amazing feat, and now they can call themselves state record holders. Their journey through powerlifting has only just begun, and with their passion, determination and work ethic, it seems like they will be shattering many more records.\n\nThe most important thing to them, though, is that they are doing it together.\n\n\u201cWatching each other lift is really exciting, and we love watching each other,\u201d Kingston said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very special to be record holders, and it\u2019s really cool to say we did it together,\u201d Brooklyn added. \u201cDoing it together as training partners, we both understand the journey we are on.\u201d\n\n\u201cUSC Unsung Heroes\u201d runs every other Monday.\n```"}

The impossible was done in the WWE on Saturday, November 25. The company put on one of its best premium live events in terms of matches, while also exceeding expectations with surprises. The event advertised the return of Randy Orton, who had been out of action for over a year and a half, but one legendary return wasn\u2019t enough for WWE. R-Truth, who has been off of screens for a year, also made his return in a backstage segment. With the event hailing from Chicago, it would only make sense that Chicago royalty, CM Punk, would be on the minds of fans. And after his firing in AEW, Punk had the opportunity to make a new move in his career. Just as the WWE logo appeared on my screen, signaling the end of the event, Punk\u2019s music started blasting, and the infamous star made his return. I was in a public place, so I couldn\u2019t react how I did when Punk debuted in AEW back in 2021 (screaming my head off), returning to wrestling for the first time since 2014. But the reaction he got from his hometown crowd was deafening, even watching on a screen. The king is back where he belongs for the first time since 2014, aside from his small stint as an FS1 talk show host. WWE has already been so hot as of late, so it will be great to see how the return of these icons will contribute to that rise.\n\nEven without this jaw-dropping Punk return, this would have been a 10/10 event for WWE, so here are the top pro wrestling matches from Survivor Series: WarGames.\n\nWomen\u2019s WarGames Match (WWE Survivor Series, November 25)\nThis match featured the babyface team comprising of Becky Lynch, Bianca Belair, Charlotte Flair and Shotzi, versus Damage CTRL \u2014 consisting of members Asuka, Bayley, Iyo Sky and Kairi Sane. The story was the typical good versus evil battle, but it also had a sub-story with Flair and Lynch trying to reconcile their friendship and work together as teammates. This all made for a great storytelling build leading up to the match that did not disappoint. The ring was specially designed to be a double ring surrounded by a steel cage. Things started off with only Bayley and Lynch in the ring for five minutes, while their other teammates were locked in a cell outside the ring, waiting to enter one by one from each team until all members from each side were in the ring and the match could officially begin. Weapons were also legal in this match, with everything from kendo sticks and steel chairs to metal chains and trash cans being used. There were so many incredible moments in this matchup, but there were two, aside from the finisher, that took the cake. At one point, Sky climbed to the top of the steel cage with the steel trash can and launched herself from the top, knocking down all of the babyface team. On the other end, Flair also climbed to the top of the steel cage delivering a moonsault to knock out all of Damage CTRL. The baby faces won the match after all of them contributed to Bayley\u2019s demise. First, Flair speared her, then Shotzi hit her with a senton, then Belair hit her finisher, the K.O.D. and then Becky hit the Manhandle Slam through a table.\n\nMen\u2019s WarGames Match (WWE Survivor Series, November 25)\nWith the same rules as the women\u2019s WarGames match, Seth Rollins and Finn B\u00e1lor began in the ring for an incredible match. The other teammates on the babyface team accompanying Rollins were Cody Rhodes, Sami Zayn, Jey Uso and the returning Randy Orton. B\u00e1lor\u2019s teammates included the rest of The Judgment Day: Dominik Mysterio, Damian Priest, JD McDonagh and Drew McIntyre. Similarly to the women\u2019s match, there was a story within a story. Uso was previously a member of the Bloodline, a heel faction, but recently became a babyface; conversely, McIntyre was recently a babyface that turned heel, so both sides had some trust issues to deal with. The weapons in this match were even more creative, including a steel pipe, cowbell and more. When Judgment Day and McIntyre had the upper hand, Priest decided he wanted to cash in his money in the bank briefcase against Rollins. Thankfully, Orton made his return just in time and thwarted those plans. Once Orton came in, the team chemistry jelled, with all of them hitting one of Orton\u2019s signature moves, a DDT off the second rope. The babyface team seemed like they\u2019d end the match with Orton RKOing McDonagh mid-air after Rollins and Zayn threw him from the top of the steel cage. However, Orton let Rhodes do his own finisher on Priest, Cross Rhodes, to pick up the victory for the team. CM Punk\u2019s music hit right after this, with everyone still inside the cage, to make for an insane night for WWE.\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

She also credits Mike Lingenfelter, the owner and co-director of Munciana Volleyball Club, where Wijay played club during her final year of high school, as another major influence on her volleyball career.\n\nWijay led a stellar high school career that included back-to-back CIF championships and the 18U national championship with MVC under Lingenfelter. She said that she was never really into a lot of the social aspects of high school like prom or homecoming, especially since she was in high school during the COVID-19 pandemic. Her early success paved a path to an early graduation, which allowed her to reclassify and join the USC women\u2019s volleyball team in time for the 2023 season.\n\nDespite her family\u2019s ties to Houston, Wijay always had her heart set on USC. \u201cWhat made me choose USC was just the atmosphere, the swag, the determination that [head coach] Brad [Keller] has, the determination that everybody on the court has,\u201d Wijay said. \u201c[Senior outside hitter] Skyler [Fields] was one of them, the decisions why I chose to be here cause I wanted to learn a lot from her. I was close to my family, which was great, and it\u2019s been my dream school since I was younger, and just have always felt like USC has always been the place for me.\u201d\n\nKeller had coached Wijay earlier in her career when she was 13 while working at Supernova, and as a result, knows Wijay and her family extremely well. This allowed him to really understand the depth and knowledge that she possesses for the game. \u201cWhen you\u2019re around it so much, it becomes kind of a second language to you, which is why I think a lot of people are so excited about her because she plays the game at a different level,\u201d Keller said. \u201cShe does a lot of things that a lot of other players aren\u2019t doing and she\u2019s doing it at a young age.\u201d\n\nKeller offered her the opportunity to join USC and forgo her senior year of high school, but he said he would not have pressured her into it if Wijay was not ready for it. \u201cI think she brings a lot of different elements. She passes, she plays defense, she\u2019s just a complete volleyball player. I think this team needs that,\u201d Keller said. \u201cShe\u2019s more balanced as a player. So I think that opens up some of the other players, and I think she brings a lot of value with that.\u201d\n\nSophomore libero Megan Verbiest knew Wijay before their USC careers from playing in beach volleyball tournaments when they were kids. \u201cShe wanted really good teammates and a coaching staff, and I think that\u2019s everything we had to offer,\u201d Verbiest said. \u201cWe\u2019re all like family, the team culture is amazing, and I think that\u2019s the best thing you can do when you\u2019re so young coming into such an intense program.\u201d\n\nWijay also talked about how she clicked with Verbiest when she visited USC on her recruiting trip, as well as everyone else on the team. Upon meeting everyone on the team for the first time, Wijay realized that she enjoyed not only being with Verbiest, but also all of her other future teammates. \u201cShe fits in so perfectly, she\u2019s so young too,\u201d Verbiest said. \u201cBut she\u2019s just like all of us. She\u2019s such a sweet girl, and has such an amazing heart, and really wants to win, wants the best for everyone, and it\u2019s great energy and presence on the court.\u201d\n\nThe veteran players are not only showing Wijay the ropes, but also mentoring many of the other younger players, which has had a positive effect on the team culture. \u201cI think a lot of our upperclassmen are doing a good job of leading and guiding not only her, but a lot of the players on this team,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a long journey to get culture right, and I think we\u2019re well on our way and doing the right things with that.\u201d\n\nWijay\u2019s favorite volleyball moment was when the Trojans took on the Purdue Boilermakers in West Lafayette and upset them three sets to one. The atmosphere and energy in the arena during the match was unforgettable. In addition, she also enjoyed getting to face crosstown rival UCLA, where USC took down the Bruins in an exciting five-set thriller. \u201cShe was just a force to be reckoned with and couldn\u2019t be stopped, and really helped us win those big matches,\u201d Verbiest said.\n\nOff the court, Wijay said that her favorite moment as a Trojan was her first football game she attended as a student, when USC hosted recruits on the field before the football team crushed Stanford 56-10 on September 9. When she isn\u2019t playing volleyball, she said that she enjoys getting boba, going on random drives, shopping and hanging out with her friends. Verbiest can personally attest that Wijay likes to hang out with friends, and recalls all the times that Wijay has paid her a visit. \u201cShe\u2019ll always call me randomly all the time and say: \u2018Okay, I\u2019m coming over,\u2019\u201d Verbiest said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like: \u2018Okay, let me give you the codes to come in and we\u2019ll just sit down and hang out.\u2019\u201d\n\nComing into USC at 17 years old \u2014 and a year earlier than most college students \u2014 certainly has presented challenges for Wijay, challenges that she is working her way through and adjusting as she figures out life on her own. \u201cBiggest challenge was definitely just learning how to fight for my own food, learning how to get on the starting side, learning what I can do to make the team better, learning different personalities, how to manage them, how to get along with them, communicating, being organized, not losing my things,\u201d Wijay said. \u201cLearning how to just be a grown-up, mature and not 17, was probably the stuff I needed to learn.\u201d\n\nWijay is currently majoring in real estate development, as she said she has always found houses and real estate very fascinating, and hopes to open her real estate brokerage company and do home development in the future. USC\u2019s real estate development major made playing for the Trojans even more appealing than it already was for Wijay. \u201cI\u2019ve literally been obsessed with real estate since I was a child,\u201d Wijay said. \u201cEverybody thinks it\u2019s so weird, but when I was younger, I was in seventh grade, and my parents are like: \u2018What do you want to do for your birthday?\u2019 And I was like: \u2018I wanna look at open houses.\u2019\u201d\n\nWijay also hopes to play volleyball overseas for a couple of years with hopes of making the US National team. But for right now, she has her eyes set on helping USC bring home a national championship. \u201cTo win a national championship, and I know our record of winning and losing comes close, but our team, when we\u2019re on, we\u2019re on and I think it\u2019s really hard to beat our team,\u201d Wijay said. \u201cLike to beat Washington State, the number four team [on October 20], when we weren\u2019t even doing the best, that wasn\u2019t even our best. So when we\u2019re at our best, it\u2019s gonna be really hard for someone to beat us, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nWijay and the Trojans have a chance to go for it all when they head to Pittsburgh to take on the UMBC Retrievers in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Friday afternoon. Keller knows that her good work ethic will take her far in life, even after Wijay graduates and moves into the next chapter of her life. \u201cShe\u2019s such a great human,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI think that she is just an incredible person, and when you\u2019re an incredible person, and you\u2019re talented and you have a good work ethic, good things are gonna happen down the road.\u201d\n```"}

The letter, which was shared with the administration and publicly circulated via the Instagram account @uscalums4justice on November 16, tied these tragedies to what it called the university\u2019s \u201cshameful history of ignoring Palestinian voices on campus.\u201d\n\nThe authors of the letter addressed the recent controversy surrounding USC economics Professor John Strauss, who was recorded making inflammatory comments at a peaceful pro-Palestinian protest on campus on November 9. In a widely circulated video, Strauss was recorded saying \u201cevery one should be killed\u201d while passing by the memorial honoring the Palestinian lives lost in the war. In an interview with Annenberg Media, Strauss claimed he was solely referring to Hamas.\n\nEziamaka Ogbuli, a 2023 graduate of the Keck School of Medicine, said that the incident with Strauss influenced her decision to sign the letter. \u201cI was drawn to sign the letter, like many of my peers, because we wanted to hold our university to the standards it touts but fall short of,\u201d Ogbuli said in a written statement to Annenberg Media. \u201cPalestinian and Arab students\u2019 voices matter, and for the university to hold investments tied to Israeli occupation and genocide all the while protecting a professor who called for Palestinian death, it was a real no-brainer to sign the letter.\u201d\n\nNoha Ayoub, a 2019 USC alum involved in USC Alums for Justice, shared her motivations behind signing the letter. \u201cMe being involved has less to do with this particular moment of Professor Strauss\u2019s comments and more to do with the fact that historically, USC is dangerous to its own students by flat out refusing to actually address the fact that they have a campus whose climate is incredibly toxic and violent to its most vulnerable students,\u201d she shared. Ayoub emphasized the conditions for Arab, Muslim and pro-Palestinian students on campus. \u201cCurrently, our Arab and Palestinian students and Muslim students and anyone who is perceived as being such or is vocally pro-Palestine is not safe. This campus climate has gotten incredibly dangerous and verbally and physically violent,\u201d she added. \u201cStudents have a right to be safe on campus and currently they are not.\u201d\n\nThe letter outlines eight total demands for the university, including the removal of Strauss, a tenured professor; a condemnation of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim hate; a stance against the \u201cU.S.-funded genocide being committed by Israel\u201d; a written apology to Palestinian, Arab and Muslim community members; and more specialized resources for Muslim/Arab students affected by harassment and discrimination.\n\nAndrew T. Guzman, provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, responded in an email to USC Alums for Justice, stating, \u201cStudents are encouraged to report incidents through our Title IX office. The university has also recently published a free speech resource to help members of the Trojan community understand our obligations to each other.\u201d\n\nAyoub said that the university\u2019s response to the demand for more comprehensive resources has been \u201cfalling short.\u201d \u201cAll of those resources are specific to free speech and have nothing to do with the physical safety of students,\u201d Ayoub said. \u201cAnd there are no resources available for students who may require further tuition assistance if their families in the Gaza or the West Bank are being impacted right now by the genocide and by the war.\u201d\n\nUSC Public Relations did not immediately respond to Annenberg Media\u2019s request for comment.\n```"}

Every year it\u2019s going down and down,\u201d said Samir Kher, the manager of Glamor\u2019 Us, a shoe store on the bottom floor of the mall. Glamor\u2019 Us had a variety of Black Friday sales and 30% off signs still hang on the shelves. Despite the discounts, Khan said that the store did 60% less in sales than last year.\n\n\u201cA lot of businesses are closing because of the losses,\u201d Khan said. Khan, who has owned the location for almost 13 years, said that Black Friday was always crowded in the mall between 2012 and 2019 but has had decreased traffic each year since 2020. He speculated that the COVID-19 pandemic, conflict in the Middle East and the current economic climate led to the lack of people.\n\nNicolas Casillas, the manager of Game Force, a video game store on the mall\u2019s first floor also noticed a \u201clack of traffic\u201d on Black Friday. Casillas said that the Plaza \u201clooked like today\u201d as he pointed to the empty concourse on Monday afternoon.\n\nNicolas Casillas, the manager of Game Force, smiles behind the cash register (Photo by Nicki Berelson)\n\nLike Glamor\u2019 Us, Game Force also saw a drastic dip in sales, with Casillas saying he did around 50% less Black Friday sales compared to last year. Casillas remembers that even five years ago, the mall was \u201cmore lively with more traffic\u201d on Black Friday.\n\nCindy Ibarra has been the manager of the Foot Locker at the mall for about a month after previously working at the Culver City location, which she said routinely is hectic on Black Friday. While smaller businesses struggled, her store had a better day than she expected.\n\n\u201cThis mall is very dead, but we were actually busy during Black Friday and we definitely saw a lot more traffic compared to last year,\u201d said Ibarra, who noticed people lined up outside the mall at 8 a.m., two hours before its opening. When asked about Cyber Monday, Ibarra said she expected sales to continue to be high. Her store saw an increase of about 30% in online orders over the weekend.\n\nSome businesses rely entirely on in-person sales, and can\u2019t reap the benefits of Cyber Monday and an increased interest in online shopping. Glamor\u2019 Us does not have an online shop and hopes that sales leading up to Christmas will make up for the disappointing day on Friday.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just a lack of people that is affecting his business; according to Kher, theft is an issue that is driving other shop owners away from the mall. \u201cAlmost every other day people are stealing here,\u201d Khan said. But Casillas sees it a bit differently. \u201cYou gotta have people in the mall to steal,\u201d he said. He said that the glass cases protecting gaming gear and merchandise behind the cash register make his store theft-proof.\n\nDuring this year\u2019s Black Friday holiday, shoppers in the U.S. spent about 9.8 billion, a 7.5% increase from last year in online sales, according to Adobe Analytics. Adobe predicts that online sales for this Cyber Monday will reach about $221.8 billion, about a 5% increase year-over-year.\n\nIn-person shopping is also seeming to bounce back after the COVID-19 pandemic, with Coresight Research reporting how top-tier mall traffic experienced a 12% increase while non-top-tier mall traffic was up 10% in 2022 compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nKher also cited weather trends as a reason the mall is seeing less sales. He said that rain and cold weather often drive people into the mall to shop, so the shorter rainy season has been hurting sales in recent years. But rain is not always seen as a positive.\n\nCary Colbert, a mom of two, brought her kids to the mall to play at the indoor playground located next to Game Force. Colbert only goes to the mall for the playground and the TJ Maxx, but said that the chain stores are the ones that normally draw people in. She complained that the mall was \u201ccontaminated,\u201d explaining how when it rains, buckets must be placed under leaks and ceilings smell of mold.\n\nSome Americans are turning away from in-person shopping at malls. According to the State Press, only around 700 malls still stand in the country after the total stood at over one thousand in 2020. These numbers are heavily down from 2,500 malls nationwide in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cThe mall is always empty,\u201d Colbert said, \u201cThe day TJ Maxx is gone, the mall is gone.\u201d\n```"}

The founder of In-N-Out, Harry Snyder, had a motto: \u201cKeep it simple, do one thing and do it the best you can.\u201d From local customers to celebrities and Michelin-starred chefs, In-N-Out Burger has captivated consumers with its simple yet reliable menu.\n\n\u201cTake me to the drive-thru at In-N-Out Burger and you\u2019ll see me in the back seat with tinted windows with a Double Double,\u201d said celebrity chef Gordon Ramsey in an interview with Taste of Home. Over the span of 75 years, the regional chain has kept its menu short, offering cheeseburgers, \u201cdouble-doubles,\u201d hamburgers and french fries. It also offers a \u201cnot so secret\u201d secret menu for customers who have a specific way they want their food prepared, as seen on their website.\n\nAccording to Dr. Steve Westberg, a USC associate professor of the practice of psychology with expertise in consumer psychology, the secret menu \u201cprovides consumers with a way to be in the know and tell their friends about it. It generates word of mouth and an element of delight.\u201d Maggie Hedera, a junior studying public relations and advertising, tried In-N-Out for the first time at its Westwood location. Without being an avid fan of hamburgers or french fries, Hedera said she wanted to see \u201cwhat the hype was all about\u2018\u2019 after making the move to L.A. from the South.\n\n\u201cI think the quality [of the food] and the really convenient time that it takes to get the food is just so appealing to California,\u201d Hedera said. Jiayi Gao, a second-year graduate student in analytics, also said that she wasn\u2019t a \u201cbig fan of burgers or fries\u201d but wants to try it because her coworker told her that \u201c[In-N-Out] is a culture in California, and people came to California specifically for In-N-Out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey said that if they could recommend one thing in California to eat, it would be In-N-Out,\u201d she said. According to a report released by Datassential in 2018, 63% of In-N-Out customers visited for the experience rather than its convenience. Even beyond its reliable consistency, Hedera said that the chain\u2019s drive-through service and its warm ambience were the most memorable aspects of her first-time experience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of nostalgic,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the vibe I got. Even with the branding and the paper hats, it seemed kind of retro, and it\u2019s a staple in California. I think it\u2019s trendy but also nostalgic at the same time.\u201d The company\u2019s website emphasizes their value of familiarity, as the restaurant remains dedicated to the same menu and fresh preparation.\n\n\u201cKeeping their menu pretty consistent just allows customers to really know what they\u2019re always getting,\u201d Westberg said. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of comfort in repetitiveness and familiarity. Things that are familiar give us a warm, fuzzy feeling.\u201d Sophomore creative writing major Donal Buckley said that in general, fast food restaurants tend to have emotional value that goes beyond taste and nutrition. Even though he didn\u2019t grow up in California and didn\u2019t develop the same connection to the chain, he said he could see why In-N-Out has remained so popular.\n\n\u201cI think people have some attachment to In-N-Out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I grew up, I had fast food places that I went to and they\u2019re not the best places in the world, but because I grew up with them, I just go there. People from California just grew up eating In-N-Out, so it\u2019s nostalgic for them to go back.\u201d Buckley mentioned that the \u201celusivity\u201d of In-N-Out may be sacrificed once it becomes accessible in the East Coast.\n\n\u201cI feel like in my head it\u2019s a Californian thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it moves to the East Coast, it might lose some of its novelty, but also like, they can have their In-N-Out.\u201d Even though In-N-Out is making its move eastwards, Hedera said that it won\u2019t take away from how special the experience is in the West.\n\n\u201cPeople will always see In-N-Out as California,\u201d she said. \u201cI think when it comes to other states, it\u2019ll bring California with it.\u201d Regional identity can play a role in the popularity of fast food chains, according to Westberg. There is an In-N-Out available in Austin, Texas, but Westerberg said that the \u201cSoCal vibe just doesn\u2019t play as well in the middle of Texas,\u201d thus making Whataburger the go-to spot in Texas.\n\nWhile Westberg said that the novelty of In-N-Out may slowly wear off once it becomes more accessible in the east, \u201cit\u2019ll take some time to become established in these other new areas where people have heard about them before they went there.\u201d Like Hedera said, the strong brand identity of In-N-Out and its consistency over the years has enabled it to \u201cstay true\u201d to the elements they want to represent, according to Westberg.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re really a model of how other companies ought to achieve success,\u201d said Westberg. \u201cThey understood their environment.\u201d\n```"}

(AP Photo/Mohammed Hajjar)\n\nBy Aditya Thiyag and Jason Goode November 27, 2023 at 5:35 pm PST\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: \u201cWe have just completed the return of the first of our hostages. Children, their mothers and additional women. Each one of them is a whole world. But I emphasize to you - the families, and to you - citizens of Israel: We are committed to return all our hostages. This is one of the war\u2019s objectives, and we\u2019re committed to achieve all of the war\u2019s objectives.\u201d\n\nThat was a statement given by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last Friday, November 24, after a four day humanitarian truce and ceasefire was initiated between Hamas, a militant group that the U.S. government designates a terrorist organization, and Israel. A hostage exchange was initiated Friday and the truce between Hamas and Israel has since been extended by two days.\n\nMark Regev, a senior adviser to Israel\u2019s prime minister confirmed the truce extension had been reached and released a statement that clarified Israel\u2019s terms for further extensions.\n\nMark Regev: \u201cFor every 10 hostages released, we\u2019re willing to give an extension of another day, and if Hamas will release Israeli hostages as agreed we will extend \u2014 that\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d\n\nDr. Benjamin Radd, a Senior research fellow at the UCLA International Institute, is an authority on government and politics in the Middle East, as well as U.S. foreign policy. He spoke on the Israel government\u2019s goals with the war and predicted how long the ceasefire would last between Hamas and Israel.\n\nDr. Benjamin Radd: I see it as continuing until it no longer can. At which point Israel has indicated it will absolutely resume its operation and efforts to remove Hamas from power. Israel has two objectives. It is to release all of the hostages and it is to dismantle and deconstruct Hamas as a political and military entity.\n\nRadd also spoke on a return to talks regarding the two-state process and stated that he believes it is the key to success between the two parties.\n\nRadd: It seems like an inevitability that the only way to prevent this from happening in the future is to resume diplomatic talks centered around the two state process. Whether or not that will happen any time soon. Remains to be seen how successful Israel is in removing Hamas leadership from Gaza. The longer that takes, the more difficult that is, the less likely that we\u2019ll see a two state solution as a viable option. Because from Israel\u2019s perspective, that discussion cannot be had while Hamas maintains any power authority.\n\nIn spite of this ceasefire, acts of violence against Palestinians have continued to intensify across the United States. Yesterday, November 26, three Palestinian college students were hospitalized following a shooting in Burlington, Vermont. Additionally, the Council on American-Islamic Relations recorded nearly 1300 requests for help and reports of bias following the October 7 attack on Israel. This is over a 200% increase in the number of complaints received compared to last year.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Aditya Thiyag.\n```"}

Under the tentative agreement, wages would go up from about 35-thousand dollars a year to about 40-thousand dollars a year with further wage increases up to about 25 percent over four years.

(Photo courtesy of Chenspec)\n\nBy Emilia Garza and Aidan Williams\nNovember 27, 2023 at 5:10 pm PST\n\nThe threat of antisemitic violence and grief over those lost in the Israel-Hamas war has cast a shadow over USC\u2019s Jewish community that seems likely to spread into celebrations of Hanukkah. Hanukkah is a Jewish festival commemorating the retaking of Jerusalem by Jewish rebels in the 2nd Century BCE. The festival, which begins this year on December 7 and lasts until December 15, is observed for eight days and eight nights and is celebrated with traditional songs, eating oil-based foods, and various activities like playing the game of dreidel. The lighting of the Menorah is one of the holiday\u2019s famed traditions. The menorah consists of nine branches, each holding a candle to be lit subsequently each evening. One of the candles is used to light the others, making the Menorah tradition last the eight days of the festivities.\n\nSara Benor, a professor of linguistics at USC with expertise in Jewish languages, said that the holiday is \u201ccelebrated with blessings and lighting the menorah and various fun activities and sweet treats; and in modern times, the celebration of Hanukkah has been influenced by Christmas, and so it also involves decorations and gift giving.\u201d\n\nWhile Hanukkah is traditionally a joyous celebration, this year may be different. \u201cPeople\u2019s festivities will be tempered by the ongoing hostilities and the fact that the hostages are still in captivity. So I think a lot of Jews who are concerned about that will feel a little bit less happy in this happy season than they normally do,\u201d Benor said.\n\nSome USC students feel similarly. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more of a time of mourning this year, I would argue because so many Jewish families have been impacted by what\u2019s going on with the war,\u201d said Ava Browne, a Jewish student at USC studying film. Browne continued to explain that some of her family members won\u2019t be present during this year\u2019s celebrations because they can\u2019t travel back from Israel. \u201cThis year there\u2019s going to be a candle lit for people in Israel for sure on our menorah, which is something that probably wouldn\u2019t have happened in prior years,\u201d Browne said.\n\nGrowing antisemitism in the U.S., and on college campuses specifically, is also influencing this year\u2019s celebration of Hanukkah. \u201cThe war has just made being Jewish sort of scary. I\u2019m very proud to be Jewish, but I definitely feel like I\u2019m afraid to be preaching about it at all right now. It\u2019s just going to be more of a coming together theme this year,\u201d she said. \u201dI think it\u2019s still going to be joyful, but I think it\u2019s going to also be a lot of mourning.\u201d\n```"}

USC\u2019s cultural diversity means a multitude of different traditions are observed by students on and off campus.\n\nWhile some students are looking forward to the upcoming holidays, some are still savoring their memories from Thanksgiving. Carly Gottlieb, a junior studying law, history and culture, says her Thanksgiving tradition is to meet up with her twin sister who studies at UC Davis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from South Florida, and it\u2019s really expensive to fly down to Florida just for Thanksgiving,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cIt\u2019s super nice. It\u2019s what we do every year.\u201d\n\nJennifer Nie, a senior studying cognitive science, celebrated Thanksgiving at her aunt\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do a Thanksgiving feast, spend an hour playing piano... some people will sing, some people will dance.. and another hour wrapping dumplings,\u201d she said.\n\nRiley Pierce, a sophomore studying business administration, said that he went home to observe the holiday.\n\n\u201cOur family and extended family came down to my parents\u2019 house, and we just celebrated together [with] a nice dinner,\u201d Pierce said.\n\nAlthough students might still have Thanksgiving leftovers in the fridge, plenty are already thinking about the winter holidays. Some students are even preparing for festivities before they head home.\n\n\u201cI was actually just going to go pick some [holiday decorations] up after school today. I kind of want to decorate my apartment,\u201d Nie said. \u201cMaybe [I\u2019ll] buy a mini Christmas tree or something like that and then just celebrate with friends and wear warm clothes\u201d\n\nDessai says she plans on celebrating with her friends at USC.\n\n\u201cI love white elephants and secret Santa,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, my roommates and I want to get [each other] a Christmas card.\u201d\n\nWhile students are getting ready for the holidays at USC, students are also looking forward to celebrating a variety of traditions with their loved ones during winter break. Gottlieb celebrates Hanukkah at home with her family, which means she\u2019ll start the festivities on December 8.\n\n\u201cI usually just celebrate every night with my family. We also have a family friend that does a holiday party where we make latkes. It\u2019s fun to be around everybody.\u201d\n\nGottlieb says that her favorite Hanukkah food is potato latkes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super fried, super bad for you, but they\u2019re delicious... You have to have it with sour cream or applesauce.\u201d\n\nLatkes are a potato dish traditionally eaten during Hannukah, and the oil that latkes are fried in is symbolic in the Jewish faith. According to the Tenement Museum, latkes are a reminder of \u201cwhen the oil of the menorah in the ransacked Second Temple of Jerusalem was able to stay aflame for eight days even though there was only enough oil for one day.\u201d\n\nDessai celebrates Christmas with her family by watching the movie \u201cElf\u201d \u201cevery Christmas morning together after we unwrap the presents.\u201d\n\nNie said that her holiday season centers around food.\n\n\u201cThe dumpling [wrapping] is the biggest [tradition]. I don\u2019t know why we always do that, but we do this for every holiday,\u201d she said.\n\nPierce celebrates Christmas with games and dinner.\n\n\u201cWe usually go to my uncle\u2019s house in San Diego and have all the family come down. As a yearly tradition, one of the older male members of the family has to dress up as Santa for the little kids. I haven\u2019t done that yet, but I might have to do it this year.

The film features an all-star ensemble cast. (Photo courtesy of Prime Video)\n\nBy Nya Manneh November 27, 2023 at 10:21 am PST\n\nUSC\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts held a long-awaited screening for Emerald Fennell\u2019s film \u201cSaltburn,\u201d which stars Jacob Elordi and Barry Keoghan, earlier this month. The film, which hit theaters nationwide on Thanksgiving weekend, is a prominent example of excess, absurdity, and desire.\n\nFennell is well-versed in making an audience feel uncomfortable and doesn\u2019t shy away from visceral or even erotic moments in her storytelling. However, when writing this film, it seems Fennell wanted audiences to also ponder the question: Is it possible to like fundamentally unlikeable characters?\n\nFor her second film after \u201cPromising Young Woman\u201d (2020), Fennell recruited a star-studded cast to star in her hilariously absurd narrative. The film follows Barry Keoghan\u2019s Oliver Quick, as he becomes enticed by a charming aristocratic classmate named Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). After forming an unlikely friendship at Oxford, \u2013 despite protests from his friends\u2013 Felix invites Oliver to his lavish estate for the summer.\n\nThere, Oliver is introduced to Felix\u2019s world and eccentric family, comprised of his beauty-obsessed mother (Rosamund Pike) and her disastrous best friend (Carey Mulligan), slightly airheaded father (Richard E. Grant), troublemaking sister (Alison Oliver), cynical cousin from the States (Archie Madekwe), and creepy butler (Paul Rhys).\n\nAs was also seen in her first film, Fennell has a talent for using color and framing to tell a good story. She romanticizes the absurdity of the film with stunning visuals that make people want to have Felix\u2019s life too. In fact, there is a moment in the film that looks straight out of Pride and Prejudice, with Oliver and Felix peacefully talking about life above a soft fog rolling over a river and vast field at sunset.\n\nTo further make audiences fall in love with an otherwise absurd group of characters in a story full of ridiculous twists and turns, the audience is introduced to a multitude of individuals who are as spoiled and ignorant as can be. Still, one can\u2019t help but like them. Felix, for all of his charisma and charm, is nothing more than a spoiled little boy struggling with his status. His cousin, Farleigh, is a judgemental jerk at times, but with enough witty comments on the ridiculousness of his family to make everyone laugh.\n\nFelix\u2019s sister Venetia, for all of her efforts to break up her brother and Oliver\u2019s friendship, truly loves her family and just wants love in return. Felix\u2019s mother Elsbeth absolutely abhors ugly people while her husband seems like he\u2019s a bit out of touch with reality, but their almost childish ignorance is what makes them so adorable.\n\nThe entire Catton family is oblivious to what goes on around them. However, in a family that doesn\u2019t understand racial disparities and pretends negative emotions don\u2019t exist, Oliver is likely the worst of them all. Still, one can\u2019t help but marvel or even laugh at Oliver\u2019s actions and strategic genius despite some of the atrocities he commits throughout the film.\n\nIn an interview Fennell did with Vanity Fair, she explained how when writing the film, she wanted people to sympathize with unlikeable people, highlighting \u201cthe sorts of people that we can\u2019t stand, the sorts of people who are abhorrent\u2014if we can love them, if we can fall in love with these people, if we can understand why this is so alluring, in spite of its palpable cruelty and unfairness and sort of strangeness.\u201d\n\nOliver falls in love with the beauty, wealth, and charm of Felix\u2019s aristocratic family, and while they visibly display a lack of understanding about problems occurring outside of their bubble, Oliver can\u2019t help but want to be just like them \u2013 misplacing his desire for their lives in an obsession with Felix.\n\nIn every way, Fennell\u2019s second film is a marvelous spectacle of talent and wit. This gothic psychological comedy/drama will leave experts of cinema and casual moviegoers alike in awe with its comical and twisted storytelling and use of cinematography.\n\nThe entire film is beautifully colored in the most vibrant hues of pinks, yellows, and blues. The film\u2019s 1.33 aspect ratio makes audiences feel like they\u2019re peering in on something they shouldn\u2019t have access to. Each scene looks like a painting or something taken through a film camera. Paired with a grandiose and dreamy score, Fennell\u2019s team\u2019s use of cinematic techniques completely romanticizes Oliver\u2019s once-in-a-lifetime experience at Saltburn and adds a glittery memory to some of the naturally disturbing events that occur throughout the story.\n\nUltimately, \u201cSaltburn\u201d is a film that everyone must watch at least once. It is equal parts comedic and disturbing, but trust me when I say viewers will be glued to their seats. Just have an emotional support buddy for that bathroom and grave scene, and be ready to walk out of the theater with your jaw on the floor, because the ending will shock you. However, no matter what people take from it, \u201cSaltburn\u201d is full of a lot of good laughs and unexpected moments that will keep this film on everyone\u2019s minds long after the film ends.\n```"}

But for football fans across the country, this is no normal week. After the festivities and foodstuffs of Thanksgiving have passed (along with a magnificent Thursday of not one, not two but THREE NFL contests), it\u2019s time for the greatest weekend of college football of the year. That\u2019s right, folks: it\u2019s rivalry week. In this special edition of Saturday eve, we\u2019ll look at the best rivalry games to catch this weekend, as well as catch up on the College Football Playoff picture. Plenty of top-ranked teams will be looking to solidify their position, while their rivals have a chance to end less successful seasons with an upset. Rankings never seem to matter in the heat of a historic rivalry, making this weekend\u2019s slate a real treat.\n\nLast week\u2019s game of the week between Washington and Oregon State was a close one, but a 22-20 victory by the Huskies was enough for them to climb into the No. 4 CFP spot. Despite defeating North Alabama by a wide margin of 58-13, then-No. 4 Florida State slipped to No. 5 in this week\u2019s iteration. Why? Despite it not being listed as a CFP ranking criterion, many believe the Seminoles took a bump due to losing star quarterback Jordan Travis to a leg injury early in the game. Despite a solid performance from backup Tate Rodemaker (he completed 13 of his 23 passes for 217 yards and two touchdowns), in the eyes of the committee, the Seminoles are apparently not a playoff-quality team yet without their star signal-caller. But in an interview with ESPN, CFP selection committee chair Boo Corrigan denied this reasoning. \u201cIt really was about Washington and what Washington did this weekend,\u201d Corrigan said, adding that Travis\u2019 injury had nothing to do with FSU\u2019s new ranking.\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK \u2014 No. 2 Ohio State (11-0) vs. No. 3 Michigan (11-0) Ann Arbor, Mich. 9:00 a.m. PST on FOX\n\nThe likely game of the year is finally here. It\u2019s pretty rare for us to see two top-four teams face off during the regular season, let alone as their season finales, let alone in an all-time historic rivalry setting. But the Buckeyes and the Wolverines have now done it two years in a row, and with the B1G expanding in historic fashion next year, it\u2019s hard to imagine it happening again any time soon. Neither of these squads feature top-30 offenses. Why? They boast two of the best defenses in the nation. Michigan\u2019s 234.8 yards allowed per game leads FBS, as does Ohio State\u2019s mere 10 allowed touchdowns. They both put on clinics against No. 11 Penn State, allowing 15 and 12 points, respectively. These units have carried both teams through inconsistent offensive seasons, never requiring more than a few touchdowns to win games. But that could all change this weekend, when these crippling defenses might make even those few touchdowns seem out of reach.\n\nOhio State\u2019s passing game has carried their offense all year: their passing offense is ranked 22nd in FBS with 283.7 YPG, as opposed to their rushing game which ranks 84th with 145.5 YPG. But Michigan is the second-best statistical passing defense in the nation, allowing just 144.8 YPG through the air and only five passing touchdowns across 11 contests. It\u2019s hard to imagine the Buckeyes\u2019 inconsistent quarterback Kyle McCord carrying Ohio State offensively \u2014 in his last two run-ins with top-10 passing defenses (Notre Dame and Penn State), McCord completed only 59.7% of his passes for just one score. The Buckeyes won the former on the back of a 104-yard rushing performance from Treveyon Henderson, and the latter by their defense only allowing 240 yards of total offense from Penn State. This game will likely be decided on the ground, as FOX Sports\u2019 Colin Cowherd pointed out earlier this week: \u201cOhio State\u2019s run game is eighth in the Big Ten. Not in the country, it\u2019s eighth in the Big Ten. Michigan has one of the nation\u2019s best run games, number two in Power 5 in rushing touchdowns. Why does that matter? The last 21 times Michigan and Ohio State have played, the team who rushed for more yards won. Ohio State\u2019s offense the last several years has gotten fancy over physical, speed over power. The better O-line is Michigan. The coach more convinced you have to run to win is Michigan. The more consistent run game is Michigan. The last two meetings Michigan has out-rushed Ohio State by 342 yards, and this is the best version of Michigan\u2019s run game.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong \u2014 while Michigan\u2019s passing offense has been lackluster this year, they\u2019ve pounded the rock at will on almost all of their opponents, and Ohio State simply hasn\u2019t shown that they can keep up. Their defensive prowess has been built through the air (the only better pass defense unit than Michigan), but they haven\u2019t defended the run nearly as well, ranking 19th in yards per carry and per game. Meanwhile, as Cowherd mentioned, they haven\u2019t rushed the ball well themselves this year either, and Michigan ranks eighth in FBS in rushing yards allowed per game (90) and seventh in yards per carry (2.97). Unless McCord has a banner day, Ohio State will likely have very little offensive production. But hey, so will Michigan, as despite their advantage on the ground, the Buckeyes will still be the best statistical defense the Wolverines have faced this year. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that Michigan will out-rush the Buckeyes given the skill difference in the trenches and the Wolverines\u2019 home-field advantage. It\u2019ll be up to Kyle McCord and his star receivers Marvin Harrison Jr. and Emeka Egbuka to put up enough points to reverse the 21-year trend and win this game through the air.\n\nPLAYOFF WATCH\n\nAs teams play their final regular season game, it\u2019s time to take a look at how this weekend\u2019s slate could impact the playoff picture. Let\u2019s start with the teams on top. UNDEFEATED: No. 1 Georgia, No. 2 Ohio State, No. 3 Michigan, No. 4 Washington, No. 5 Florida State\n\nOf the CFP\u2019s current top five, no one has an easy path forward to the playoffs. They\u2019ll all require a top-10 victory to earn their spot. For No. 2 Ohio State and No. 3 Michigan, the future is pretty clear. Win this weekend, and your team is what should be an easy win against No. 17 Iowa away from a sure playoff berth. Lose, and you\u2019re done. Presumably, a one-loss Ohio State or Michigan team \u2014 a team without a B1G championship berth \u2014 would be ranked No. 5 behind undefeated Washington and Florida State squads. According to the committee\u2019s website, conference championships are used as the primary tiebreaker between teams with comparable resumes if head-to-head competition has not occurred.\n\nWhile OSU and Michigan have their biggest game this weekend, Georgia and Washington enter rivalry week in a different situation. Georgia will walk by unranked Georgia Tech, but face No. 8 Alabama next weekend in the SEC Championship. Win, and they\u2019re in at No. 1, but that\u2019s a tall task. The Tide will be Georgia\u2019s best opponent all year, and will be hungry for a win as they look to angle back into the playoffs themselves. More on that later \u2014 as for this weekend, don\u2019t expect the No. 1 team to go anywhere. Meanwhile, Washington takes on unranked Washington State in front of their home crowd, but will likely face Oregon next week in the Pac-12 Championship. As I\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s hard for me to imagine them pulling out a second W over the Ducks in neutral Las Vegas. But as of this weekend, Washington will be set to move up to No. 3 behind the winner of Ohio State-Michigan.\n\nIf No. 5 Florida State puts forth the sort of dominant performance against unranked rival Florida tomorrow that fans are expecting (social media platforms have been flooded with the hashtag #FinishFor13 in reference to Jordan Travis\u2019 injury), that should be enough for the Seminoles to hop the loser of Ohio State-Michigan for the No. 4 spot. But my fellow Floridians should all know that a rivalry win in the Swamp is far from a given, rankings aside. Ben Hill Griffin will be popping on Saturday with a home crowd that\u2019s angry over a 5-6 season and hopeful to both spoil their rival\u2019s playoff hopes and end the year at .500. But an even taller task could come next weekend against No. 10 Louisville in the ACC Championship. Louisville comes into this game with just as much to play for as FSU \u2014 an ACC Championship win would solidify Louisville\u2019s first-ever top-10 CFP finish. All eyes will be on the Noles\u2019 new QB1 Tate Rodemaker this weekend, as anything but a strong showing against the Gators bodes poorly for the possibility of another ranked win for Florida State.\n\nON THE EDGE: No. 6 Oregon, No. 8 Alabama\n\nOregon has a tough matchup this week against No. 11 Oregon State, a win which would surely boost their playoff stock heading into conference championships. As of press time on this article, they\u2019re up 21-7 in the third quarter, so it seems like they have things handled in what could be the historic rivalry\u2019s final iteration. One has to wonder if an 11-1 Oregon team, whose only loss was to Washington, would rank above an 11-1 Ohio State or Michigan squad whose only loss would also be to a top-four squad. Strength of schedule would likely give the Ducks a slight disadvantage there, but a conference championship win over Washington would change that. A 12-1, Pac-12 Champion Oregon squad would likely outrank almost any other one-loss team, as they\u2019d be the only such team to have defeated all of their opponents at least once. They\u2019d certainly be a playoff team at that point, likely only outranked by an undefeated B1G Champion, Florida State or Georgia team. Sky\u2019s the limit for the Ducks, but the year is far from over and they\u2019ll have to pull out two challenging wins before moving into the top four.\n\nAfter careful consideration, Alabama has earned the right to be considered \u201con the edge\u201d as well. The Tide control their destiny the same way the Ducks do: a very challenging road lies ahead, but winning out guarantees a CFP berth. All Alabama has to do is defeat the best team in the nation and they\u2019re in. This creates a nightmare scenario in which an undefeated B1G champion slides to No. 1 and the rest of the board becomes a toss-up. Would the win over Georgia be enough for Alabama to rank No. 2, or would undefeated records from Florida State and Washington still be a trump card? Only time will tell, but what we know for sure is that two weeks of exciting and consequential football lie ahead.\n\nIN THE HUNT: No. 7 Texas\n\nThe Horns would have loved to see No. 4 Washington lose their perfect record last week, as Texas\u2019 strength of schedule could\u2019ve seen them jump as high as No. 5. But Washington kept things perfect, meaning the last realistic chance for a non-playoff contender to end an undefeated team\u2019s season has passed and Texas\u2019 chance of a playoff berth have greatly decreased. But all is not lost for the Longhorns \u2014 a path to No. 4 still exists, even if it seems unlikely. Unlike Alabama and Oregon, Texas needs more than two more wins as they rely on other results to pave the way for their climb up the rankings. Winning out would make Texas a one-loss conference champion, meaning their playoff chances rest on how many conference champions remain undefeated in the final rankings. Oregon defeating Washington in the Pac-12 championship would be a good step, as would Florida State losing to Florida this weekend or losing the ACC Championship to Louisville. Alabama defeating Georgia would also be crucial \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine a one-loss Tide squad ranked behind the one-loss Texas team that handed them said L. The Longhorns will need at least one, but likely multiple, of these scenarios to occur to carry them into a No. 4 spot. Depending on how this week goes, it could be the last in which Texas is considered a contender.\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy nikki thomas November 24, 2023 at 6:21 pm PST\n\nAfter a win on Thursday against Seton Hall, No. 23 USC men\u2019s basketball (4-1) took on Oklahoma (5-0) Friday in the championship game of the inaugural Rady Children\u2019s Invitational in San Diego. The Trojans were unable to close out the game, despite four players scoring in double digits, and ultimately fell 72-70 to the Sooners.\n\nOklahoma got out on top early 10-7, but a 7-0 USC run put the Trojans up 14-10. It was a game of 3-pointers in the first half: the two teams made a combined 13 total 3s through the first 20 minutes. Despite being ahead most of the first half, USC could never shake the Sooners. Neither team led by more than four points until 1:00 left in the opening period, when fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis laid the ball in to put the Trojans up 39-34.\n\nUSC got 13 points off turnovers in the first half, but led by only three at halftime. The Trojans started feeling the heat when Oklahoma brought it back within one at the beginning of the second half. A 3-pointer from Oklahoma redshirt junior John Hugley IV tied the game at 49, and a floater from sophomore Milos Uzan put the Sooners up for the first time since they led 10-9.\n\nHowever, USC junior guard Kobe Johnson went on an explosive run, scoring nine straight points for the Trojans to put them back on top 58-57. But, Oklahoma took their largest lead of the night on a floater from junior guard Javian McCollum with 5:33 remaining in the game and never looked back. McCollum led the Sooners with 18 points.\n\nUSC brought the game back within two with less than a minute left in the game, but freshman guard Isaiah Collier slipped and threw the ball away, and Oklahoma regained possession with 35 seconds to go. The teams exchanged fouls, and graduate forward DJ Rodman iced two free throws for the Trojans to tie the game at 70 with less than thirty seconds left.\n\nThe Sooners ran the clock down, and a missed McCollum jumper gave USC hope for a moment. But Oklahoma guard Otega Oweh tipped in the ensuing offensive rebound with 1.4 seconds left to secure the victory over the Trojans. Oklahoma\u2019s largest lead of the game was only six points.\n\n\u201cWe gave up too many shots at the rim,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said postgame. \u201cI don\u2019t know where our big guy was.\u201d\n\nIn a game that saw seven ties and nine lead changes, USC managed to put together a strong offensive effort. Ellis had 16 points, four rebounds and four assists, but he shot less than 38% from the floor. Johnson added 16 points, three steals and two blocks, and Rodman finished with 10 points and five rebounds. Collier scored 10 and had four assists, but also contributed six turnovers. He leads the team in turnovers with 32 this season.\n\nCollier was an important part of the Trojans\u2019 success early in the game, but he faded into the background as it progressed. Collier averaged 23.5 points per game last week, as he won his second consecutive Pac-12 Men\u2019s Freshman of the Week award. Against Oklahoma, he scored only two points in the second half.\n\n\u201cIsaiah is a freshman; he\u2019s going through a learning process right now. He\u2019s very talented, and we need him to play better,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cI think he just needs to come back and learn, and we need to help him as a coaching staff.\u201d\n\nRedshirt senior forward Joshua Morgan also struggled offensively in the loss, scoring two points with six rebounds and two blocks. In Thursday\u2019s win against Seton Hall, Morgan recorded a career-high 10 blocks, marking a new USC record for most blocks in a single game. Morgan is currently fourth in the nation in blocks.\n\nFriday\u2019s loss was the first time all season that USC has allowed an opponent to shoot 50% from the field; in all other matchups this season, it kept opponents shooting below 43%.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, but we have to move on,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nThe Trojans return to the Galen Center on Wednesday at 8 p.m. to take on Eastern Washington.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\n\nBy Channin Zhao\nNovember 24, 2023 at 2:37 pm PST\n\nOn Nov. 26, the third-seeded LAFC will visit Seattle Sounders for the MLS Cup Playoffs Western Conference semifinals. The victor of the match between LAFC and the second-seed Sounders will enter the conference finals on Dec. 2, with the winner progressing to the MLS Cup Final on Dec. 9. As opposed to the first round, the conference semifinal is a single-elimination match. If the game is tied at the end of regular time, two 15-minute extra time periods will settle the score, with a penalty kick shootout afterwards if necessary.\n\nThe rivalry between LAFC, also known as the Black and Gold, and the \u201cRave Green\u201d Seattle Sounders has long been lasting. The Black and Gold\u2019s first-ever match upon joining MLS in 2018 was a 1-0 against the Sounders through a Diego Rossi goal by. A year later, however, LAFC fell to the Rave Green in a crucial conference final in a 3-1 defeat, a season which saw LAFC set a league record for points and Carlos Vela win the Golden Boot and MVP awards. The Seattle Sounders went on to claim the throne in the final against Toronto.\n\nIn 2020, during the Covid-19 season \u2014 a year after their heart-breaking loss \u2014 LAFC fell short again to the Sounders with the same 3-1 scoreline in the first round of MLS playoffs. With the upcoming match, LAFC seeks revenge over their rivals who have hindered the club\u2019s progress in the past seasons.\n\nComing into the match, LAFC swept the Vancouver Whitecaps with a 5-2 victory in Game 1 on Oct. 28 and a 1-0 win in Game 2 on Nov. 5 on the road. With the regular season Golden Boot winner Denis Bouanga in top form, scoring three goals in the Whitecaps series, LAFC should approach this match optimistically. The reigning champions could potentially become the first back-to-back MLS champions since the Houston Dynamo in 2007. With 16 goals in their last five games, LAFC will hope to put more past the Sounders on Sunday.\n\nSeattle, however, are not going to give the Black and Gold an easy match. Being the second best defensive team in the league, conceding only one goal and scoring nine in their past five games, there\u2019s every reason to believe that the Sounders\u2019 defense of Yeimar, Ragen, Roldan, and Nouhou are up to to the task defending the likes of Vela and Bouanga. With MLS Golden Glove winner and the league-leader in clean sheets Stefan Frei signing a new deal, he will be giving his all trying to add to his clean sheet tally of 14 against LAFC.\n\nAfter bagging the crucial game winner against FC Dallas, Albert Rusn\u00e1k has scored all seven of his goals this season clutch game-winners, and he\u2019ll want to keep up that streak against LAFC. This upcoming match will be important for both sides as they hope to progress to the finals. With both LAFC\u2019s offense and the Sounders\u2019 defense in top form, the game will surely be a spectacle. I predict the match will end up being a 1-1 draw in regular time, with LAFC progressing to the Conference finals on penalties. Will the prediction stand? We\u2019ll see on Sunday!\n```"}

(AP/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nNovember 23, 2023 at 11:30 pm PST\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Kings found great success following losses to the Penguins and Flyers and were finally able to win two games at home, something Los Angeles hasn\u2019t had much luck with thus far. The home victories came against the Panthers and the Blues, while they also defeated the Coyotes in Tempe. The Kings now only trail the Canucks and Golden Knights for the Pacific Division throne. Vancouver has been a bit shaky since its fiery start to the season, losing winnable games to the Flames and Kraken this past week. Meanwhile, defending champion Vegas has been inconsistent, losing three of its last four games. Below the Kings stand the struggling Kraken, who haven\u2019t been able to catch momentum so far. The Ducks\u2019 early-season success seems to be at a halt, while the Flames, Oilers and Sharks didn\u2019t progress at all this week. Just a few points out of first place, the Kings are riding high. While the Golden Knights and Canucks may just be in a slump, we\u2019re already a fifth of the way through the regular season \u2014 there\u2019s never a bad time for Los Angeles to cover ground in the division.\n\nThe Kings went a perfect 3-0-0 with a particularly important win over the dynamic Florida Panthers. This was just L.A.\u2019s second home win of the season, and it was a close 2-1 finish. Goaltender Cam Talbot stood his ground in net, adding another marquee performance to his surprisingly spectacular season. This was Talbot\u2019s eighth win of the year. An\u017ee Kopitar and Kevin Fiala scored in the victory.\n\nFollowing the win against Florida, the Kings took on the St. Louis Blues at home and drubbed them 5-1. The game was over before it started; four Kings scored in the first period alone. Talbot once again delivered, bringing him to a stout .930 save percentage and 2.02 goals against average on the year. Talbot got the night off in Los Angeles\u2019 beatdown of the Arizona Coyotes. Once again, the Kings dominated from the first faceoff. Trevor Moore and Kopitar scored in the first period and L.A. never looked back. Moore lit the lamp again in the second and Phillip Danault concluded the scoring affair in the third. Backup Goaltender Pheonix Copley made 30 saves for the Kings.\n\nThe Kings\u2019 can accredit their plus-eight goal differential this past week to Talbot and Copley\u2019s consistent goaltending and the team\u2019s electric offense. This past week, Danault tallied four points including a goal. The centerman has navigated the second line exceptionally well, with 12 points on the season and good discipline staying out of the penalty box. Kopitar added three points to his total and still co-leads the Kings in goal scoring, even at his advanced age. The 36-year old\u2019s offensive awareness has been a big reason for his success this season. The Slovene has at least one point in all but one game this month and has been a leader on the Kings\u2019 mixed roster of veterans and younger players. While he has struggled through parts of the season, Fiala netted two goals this week, his second and third of the season. The left wing has been an assist machine, so his pair of goals added to his efficient offensive play. Fiala headed into the month on an eight-game point streak before regressing for a couple of contests, so expect his recent consistency to continue even more on the second line.\n\nThis week, the Kings will take on the Ducks, Canadiens and Capitals \u2014 all teams with worse records. The Southern California showdown against Anaheim could be a real test. The Ducks started out firing on all cylinders before dropping some games. However, Anaheim has proven it can beat contending teams with statement wins over the Bruins and Golden Knights. The Canadiens look to be tanking, and should be an easy win, while the Capitals are on a five-game winning streak and covering ground in the Metropolitan Division. The Kings were perfect this week and have a chance to become the Western Conference\u2019s best if they keep up the stellar play. Los Angeles\u2019 defense improved drastically from last week and complimented the stout showing in net from the goalie tandem. Be on the lookout for a possible continuation of the win streak this week, as L.A. stays in Southern California. The Kings will meet the Ducks in Anaheim at Honda Center at 12:30 p.m. on Friday.\n```"}

(Photo by Carly Rieger)\n\nBy Marissa Russ November 23, 2023 at 11:10 pm PST\n\nUSC men\u2019s basketball put the cherry on top of its Thanksgiving with a 71-63 win over Seton Hall in the Rady Children\u2019s Invitational in San Diego. Fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis led the team in scoring with 22 points, but redshirt senior forward Joshua Morgan and junior guard Kobe Johnson stole the show with their defensive efforts.\n\nThe No. 23 Trojans successfully snapped Seton Hall\u2019s four-game win streak, leaving the unranked Pirates 4-1 after finishing last year\u2019s season 17-16.\n\nThe first half remained competitive as both teams initially struggled to make shots and played physical defense. Kobe Johnson had three steals at the half and scored the Trojans\u2019 first six points with two 3-pointers in early back-to-back possessions. Seton Hall struggled offensively, finishing the first half shooting only 28% from the field and going 0-for-6 behind the arc. The Trojans went 5-for-13 from beyond the arc and shot 39% to give them a 32-22 lead at halftime.\n\nThe beginning of the second half continued with the momentum in favor of the Trojans. Ellis opened with a 3-pointer, followed by a block by Morgan during Seton Hall\u2019s opening possession. The Trojans eventually went on a 10-0 run in the first three minutes of the half. However, by the 7:50 mark, the Pirates went on a 14-2 run of their own. Multiple USC turnovers and a string of missed shots aided the Pirates\u2019 run. USC finished the game with 19 turnovers, eight of them occurring in the second half.\n\nBy the final four minutes of the game, the Pirates erased USC\u2019s 20-point lead and trailed the Trojans by three. Then, the Trojans defense took off, and their shots started to fall. In what might have been the play of the game, Morgan recorded back-to-back blocks in one possession; he blocked Seton Hall senior guard Dre Davis for his ninth block of the game before blocking graduate center Jaden Bediako for No. 10. Not only did Morgan set a new career high, he also set a new record for most blocks in a game for USC men\u2019s basketball. Onyeka Okongwu was one of four previous record holders with eight blocks, doing so in 2019.\n\nThe Trojans smited the Pirate comeback attempt and secured the win. Johnson was another bright spot in the Trojans\u2019s defense, as he finished with five steals, six rebounds and 13 points. Standout freshman guard Isaiah Collier went 5-of-8 from the field with 15 points and five assists. Ellis was 6-for-15 from the field along with five rebounds and two assists.\n\nUSC improved to 4-1 on the season. It\u2019s a strong start for the Trojans, who have not had a consistent starting lineup the entire season and are still waiting for Bronny James\u2019 anticipated debut.\n\nUSC will face Oklahoma in the championship game of the Rady Children\u2019s Invitational Friday at 12:30 p.m. The 5-0 Sooners defeated the Iowa Hawkeyes 79-67 Thursday in the first game of the invitational.\n```"}

However, the Caps\u2019 resurgence this season may be proving that last year\u2019s blunder was a fluke. Washington has been winners in its last five contests, has only one regulation loss in its last 10 games and only trails the electric New York Rangers in the Metropolitan Division.\n\nThe Capitals\u2019 win streak included a shutout over the dominant Vegas Golden Knights. Left wing and future hall-of-famer Alex Ovechkin leads the Capitals in points and has looked to have found his groove again after having a down year in 2022-23. The 38-year old has recorded a point in over half of his team\u2019s games, despite slumping on the power play unit. Ovechkin has shared the puck well and has a chance to add to his accolades if he can lead a rebounding Caps team back to the playoffs.\n\nWith 827 career goals, the second-most all-time, don\u2019t be surprised if Ovechkin can lower the 67-goal margin between him and Wayne Gretzky for the throne. Centerman Dylan Strome is Washington\u2019s goal leader with eight, and he also leads the team in plus/minus at plus-4. Strome has recorded points in the Capitals\u2019 last three games, including the overtime winner against the Sabres, the first of his career.\n\nThe center also set up Tom Wilson with a nice dish to send the game to overtime with just over a minute remaining. Strome has been a reliable top-six forward and is grabbing the attention of Washington fans in just his second season with the team. He also leads the Caps in shot percentage at 23.5%, indicating his solid offensive navigation thus far.\n\nStrome played the most games of his career last season (81) and had career-highs in both goals and assists. The future is bright for the 26-year old. Defenseman John Carlson has been another Capital to keep eyes on. Carlson has generated chances with 10 assists including two in Washington\u2019s gritty win over Buffalo.\n\nDarcy Kuemper has been the Capitals\u2019 go-to option in net but has been inconsistent in nine games played. Charlie Lindgren, who has only played five games but has a stout goals against average of 2.01, has proven himself so far. Lindgren struggled last season, so Capitals fans should hope for the goalie situation to become more stable as the season progresses.\n\nThe Capitals look like a solid team, but they also play in a tight division. Only four points separate them and the seventh-place Devils, showing the competitiveness of the Metro. Washington will hope to create some separation in the division in the next stretch, which consists of five consecutive Pacific opponents.\n\nThe Capitals will host the Edmonton Oilers in D.C. on Friday.\n\nProsperity for Pavs\n\nJoe Pavelski might be one of the oldest players in the NHL at 39, but he is playing like he\u2019s 25 and in his prime. Pavelski is the Dallas Stars\u2019 points and goals leader, and he has played a huge part in the team\u2019s division-leading success.\n\nThe center hasn\u2019t notched more than 30 goals since 2017-18 but very well could find these numbers again this season if he keeps up his stellar play. Pavelski has recorded at least one point in Dallas\u2019 last five games and has been accurate shooting the puck.\n\nThe Stars only have one regulation loss in November and just four on the season, which is tied for the lowest in the Western Conference. Dallas had a great regular season last year but unfortunately fell one point short of the Avalanche for the division title.\n\nThe Stars would later be stunned by the Kraken in the second round, a team playing in just its second playoff series ever. While gaining ground on the Avalanche will be tough, if Dallas can win the Central Division, I could see them making a deep run, possibly even to the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nWith a hot start from Pavelski, as well as solid showings from Roope Hintz and Jason Robertson, Dallas\u2019 lines look deep top-to-bottom and capable of reaching the promised lands once again.\n\nThe Dallas Stars will look to keep up their winning ways against the Flames at home on Friday.\n\nWinter Classic uniforms revealed for the NHL\u2019s two newest teams\n\nThe NHL\u2019s second outdoor game of the season is just around the corner. On New Year\u2019s Day, the Kraken will take on the Golden Knights at T-Mobile Park, home of MLB\u2019s Seattle Mariners.\n\nWhenever the matchups for the outdoor games are announced, fans immediately speculate what each team\u2019s specialty uniform will look like. Seattle and Vegas got creative for theirs.\n\nWhile both expansion teams are basically brand-new, they both unveiled fauxback uniforms that imagined what both the Kraken and Golden Knights would\u2019ve looked like if they existed in the early-20th century.\n\nFrom the depths \n\nA closer look at the @SeattleKraken 2024 NHL #WinterClassic sweater.\n\nShop now at https://t.co/OlcE7fekTF !\n\npic.twitter.com/Z8WSvVUYvk \u2014 NHL (@NHL) November 22, 2023\n\nOn January 1 of next year, the Kraken will don unique multicolored jerseys that pay tribute to the Seattle Metropolitans, the first team from the United States to ever win the Stanley Cup in 1917.

Instead, Vegas kept things simple and revealed a white, gold and gray uniform. The \u201cV\u2019 for Vegas in the middle is complemented with a Fleur-de-lis motif, and the uniform itself pays tribute to the old West origins of the city.\n\nWith such an iconic brand like the Golden Knights, I thought that they could\u2019ve done a bit better. The jerseys are simple and don\u2019t have a lot going on. The NHL\u2019s outdoor games provide opportunities for teams to experiment on a blank canvas, so I wish that they had a bit more detail.\n\nNonetheless, Vegas will still be looking sharp come January.\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/11/22/juju-watkins-dominates-late-to-guide-usc-to-comeback-win-over-penn-state/", "response": "```\nNo. 8 USC women\u2019s basketball was in an offensive rut, similar to one of those that plagued this team far too often last season. The Trojans hadn\u2019t scored in over six minutes in the fourth quarter, allowing Penn State to go on a 14-0 run and take a 70-64 lead. But USC\u2019s inefficient offense last year didn\u2019t have JuJu Watkins. So, the logical plan for USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb was simple: do your thing, get JuJu the ball and win this thing. And the Trojans did just that.\n\nThe freshman guard phenom absolutely took over in the final minutes, scoring the game\u2019s final seven points to lift USC to a 71-70 win over Penn State Wednesday night in the Baha Mar Pink Flamingo Championship. Watkins finished with 31 points on the night on 9-for-20 shooting from the field, plus 11-for-14 at the free throw line. She also added 12 rebounds \u2014 giving Watkins her first double-double as a Trojan \u2014 and three assists.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s special,\u201d Gottlieb said of Watkins. \u201cThere\u2019s no more adjectives I can use.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how the final two minutes of the game went, starting with the Trojans trailing by six points after the long scoring drought: Watkins rebounds her own miss and cashes in a second-chance layup. She then drills a transition 3-pointer a mere 17 seconds later to narrow the deficit to a point. Watkins misses a heat-check jumper with under a minute to go on the next USC possession, but she grabs a huge rebound on the other end of the floor off a Penn State miss while being fouled. Finally, with 30 seconds to go, Watkins drives into the paint and sinks a go-ahead layup.\n\nNow with a lead, the Trojans could go back to ol\u2019 reliable: their defense, which forced a difficult shot by the Lady Lions and then knocked away the ensuing rebound far enough away for the clock to expire.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as proud of this win as any we\u2019ve had this year,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of our fight and our toughness, and I think that\u2019s how we won.\u201d\n\nIt was a gutsy win for USC in a game that featured 15 lead changes and nine ties. The Trojans didn\u2019t play their best game against a frisky Penn State squad that also entered the game undefeated \u2014 that includes the star Watkins. USC turned the ball over 20 times Wednesday night, including five during that fourth-quarter scoreless stretch. Those Trojan turnovers turned into 21 points by the Lady Lions, compared to just 10 for USC on 12 Penn State mistakes.\n\nWatkins had seven giveaways \u2014 a reminder that despite her incredible first few games, she is still a freshman with plenty of room to grow.\n\n\u201cI think it just goes back to the team,\u201d Watkins said of her ability to stay in rhythm. \u201cThey put so much trust in me. Even when I\u2019m turning the ball over \u2014 tonight wasn\u2019t great for me \u2014 but they still believed in me and continued to empower me.\u201d\n\nBut, frankly, USC can afford some early errors by Watkins as long as she keeps consistently making jaw-dropping plays. For example, here\u2019s Exhibit A, a half-court buzzer-beater to give the Trojans a 35-34 halftime lead:\n\nShots like that will make a few turnovers hurt a little less.\n\n\u201c[Watkins] keeps showing me new things,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThe most telling thing is how much her teammates freaking love her, because when she gets knocked down and battered, they\u2019re going to play better, because they understand how hard she works and what a great teammate she is.\u201d\n\nSophomore forward Kylie Lavelle had a big first half for the Lady Lions off the bench, contributing 10 points, including a pair of threes, to help keep the game almost dead even through 20 minutes. Aside from Watkins, junior center Rayah Marshall had 11 points and 10 rebounds \u2014 the 23rd double-double of her career and third of this season. Despite not scoring a point, graduate guard Roxane Makolo had a team-high plus-12 in her 11 minutes off the bench. The TCU transfer played a bigger role in the absence of starting graduate forward Kaitlyn Davis, who is day-to-day with an undisclosed injury.\n\nUSC also had a strong night behind the arc; graduate guard Kayla Padilla hit a pair of threes in the third quarter to boost the Trojans to a six-point lead. USC was shooting 7-for-11 from range at one point in the second half and finished 9-for-18.\n\nBut every time USC tried to creep away, Penn State seemed to respond, thanks in large part to sophomore guard Shay Ciezki and her team-high 18 points and seven rebounds. In fact, the Lady Lions faced their biggest deficit of the game at 64-56 before their 14-0 run in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn the end, Penn State didn\u2019t have time to counter the Trojans\u2019 final blow from Watkins. In the Thanksgiving spirit, Watkins shared her gratitude for her family and her team, which both happily paraded out of Baha Mar Convention Center after her late heroics.\n\nUSC (5-0) now returns home after two wins in the Bahamas, starting with a matchup against Cal Poly on Tuesday at 7 p.m. at Galen Center.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/11/22/the-cookbook-thanksgiving-edition/", "response": "```\nThe Talk of Troy The cookbook: Thanksgiving edition On a special holiday edition of The Cookbook, TOT\u2019s Jude Oca\u00f1as gives his predictions for the Thanksgiving Day games. Expand Photo by Jude Oca\u00f1as. Photos courtesy of All-Pro Reels and Sports Spotlight  By   Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as November 22, 2023 at  7:47 pm PST \n \nThanksgiving Day football is always the best time of the season. Waking up on Thursday morning, the only thing that matters to me is eating a bunch of delicious food and watching football. Since I have been alive, I have had a love-hate relationship with the holiday. The days can be filled with many mixed emotions. On one hand, a combo of Thanksgiving food and a Cowboys win makes for an enjoyable day of festivities. However, in recent memory I have been eating a lot more homemade apple pie to cope with the Cowboy losses. In the last ten Cowboy Thanksgiving games, we have only won four. A game against the Commanders this time around should make for one of the more enjoyable days in recent history. This week\u2019s  Michelin Star Player of the Week  is  Russell Wilson . When the Broncos needed plays from their stars last week versus the Vikings, Russell Wilson stepped up and delivered. In the final minutes of the game, Mr. Unlimited took his team on a 75-yard drive and delivered his infamous moon ball in the back of the end zone to Courtland Sutton for a game-winning touchdown. Don\u2019t look now, but the Denver Broncos have just won four straight, with Wilson playing some of his best ball we have seen from him in a Broncos uniform. Sitting at 5-5 right now, the conversation has shifted from Caleb Williams number one overall talk to a potential playoff berth. Only time will tell, but for now, the Broncos are riding. The waiter has arrived, what\u2019s first on the menu? First Course | Green Bay Packers (4-6) vs. Detroit Lions (8-2), 9:30 a.m. PST, FOX The Detroit Lions have been the most surprising team so far this season. Dan Campbell has implemented a culture within the team that makes each player play for one another. This type of culture has shown up on the field, and is partially responsible for their best start since 1962. Quarterback Jared Goff has improved medially from his Ram days to where he is now, being a lot more of a confident passer. The Lions are less one-dimensional now, and now have the ability to beat you with both the rushing and passing game, a trend I see continuing with Goff picking apart the Packers\u2019 secondary, and David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs causing problems on the ground against a 28th-ranked rush defense. I have already said it a few times in this column, but the Packers have done nothing to help the young gunslinger Jordan Love. There has been no sort of run game to complement a passing game, and in large part because running back Aaron Jones has not been able to stay on the field. The hangover of losing Aaron Rodgers this offseason has hit them hard. In a game where the Packers are very much an underdog, I want to see Jordan Love just have fun and let loose. A quarterback who is too much in his head is never a good sight. Stuffing \u2014 David Montgomery, Lions running back  \u2014 Montgomery is an old fashioned back with the way he uses his power. What sticks out most about his game is how he never stops turning his legs. It\u2019s not a common trait in all running backs, making him a hard target to get to the ground. Dessert \u2014 IT\u2019S NOT THE SAME OLD LIONS.  In the 22nd Thanksgiving meeting between the Lions and Packers, this should be an appetizer for what is to come. The Lions had the Packers number the first meeting of the season in a 14-point win. And now being a home game in Detroit, I think the Lions should handle business early on. Second Course | Washington Commanders (4-7) vs. Dallas Cowboys (7-3), 1:30 p.m. PST, CBS In the last two weeks we have seen both teams play the struggling New York Giants. On one hand, the Cowboys took care of business early on, running away with a 43-17 victory. Yet on the other hand, the Giants\u2019 new starting quarterback Tommy DeVito looked like a completely different player versus the Commanders. What seemed like a cakewalk for the Commanders was suddenly turned into trying to find offense. They would end up falling 31-19 to the G-Men. These two games say a lot about what is going to conspire on Thursday. The Dallas Cowboys, and more specifically Dak Prescott, have looked completely different since their week five loss to the San Francisco 49ers. The realization from the coaching staff of getting the ball to the playmakers has worked exceptionally well. The Prescott-Lamb connection has been on fire, and in the last five games Prescott has a 14:2 touchdown to interception ratio. The only question is, will the Cowboys overthink things? Commanders quarterback Sam Howell has shined in moments this season, and showcased the big arm that he possesses. However, the 12 interceptions are a problem, and have unfortunately cost the team some possible wins this season. Against an aggressive Dallas defense, the main key for Howell and the offense will be protecting the ball. Keeping Prescott and the Cowboys offense on the sideline is critical to having a chance in this game. Mashed Potatoes \u2014 Daron Bland, Cowboy\u2019s cornerback  \u2014 If you don\u2019t know the name, I would start Googling. The fifth-round draft pick from 2022 has shined with every opportunity he has gotten. With his fourth interception returned for a touchdown of the season last week versus the Panthers, he is now tied for most in an NFL season. Will a day of thanks and turkey be a moment in history for the young star? Dessert \u2014 HOW BOUT THEM BOYS . The Dallas Cowboys will dominate this game, in all three phases. Prescott is cooking, and the defense is ready to feast on Thursday. Third Course | Seattle Seahawks (6-4) vs. San Francisco 49ers (7-3), 5:20 p.m PST, NBC A divisional matchup is a great way to end the day of festivities. After taking down a pound of turkey, stuffing, gravy, mashed potatoes, and green bean casserole, grab some apple pie and turn on NBC to finish your night. After a rough slide of three straight losses, the 49ers have responded with two double-digit wins in the last two weeks. Purdy appears back in form, and the team is getting significantly healthier. The 49ers at any time have the ability to be explosive with the plethora of weapons on the offense, and for the Seahawks, that means trouble. The Seahawks are going to want to be smart with how they roll out their players on Thursday night. While it is a divisional game, putting out hurt players like Geno Smith and Kenneth Walker could be detrimental. In a short week, it\u2019s not worth risking a season like the Bengals did with Joe Burrow last Thursday. Cranberry Sauce \u2014 Devon Witherspoon, Seahawks cornerback  \u2014 I was shocked when the Seahawks pulled the trigger at five in this year\u2019s draft to select Witherspoon. However, the first-round pick has silenced the critics, including myself, with his play this season. He excels in pass coverage, with unique traits as a downhill tackler at the cornerback position. Dessert \u2014 BANG BANG NINER GANG.  The 49ers are the better team, Levi Stadium is going to be rocking, and that energy is going to feed into a huge team win for the 49ers. While football is on and the festivities are around the hour, Thanksgiving is a time to be grateful for what we have. Final projects and exams may feel like the antithesis of our existence right now, but take a moment to enjoy this time with family and friends. The work can wait a second, but memories with others can\u2019t. I hope your Thanksgiving is filled with many laughs and great eats, while you kick back and enjoy some NFL football on turkey day. Happy Thanksgiving! Last week\u2019s record: 1-2 Overall record: 11-13 Recipe of the week In the spirit of Thanksgiving, I want to give you guys a special recipe from the family tree. This recipe is brought to you by my cousin Ally Bailey of Denver, Colo. Personally, my favorite dish on a Thanksgiving table is stuffing because of how versatile it is. In pretty much any combination of Thanksgiving food you could put on your plate, stuffing is a must. Ingredients Bread: Start out by toasting 3-4 small loaves of bread to make it nice and crunchy, and then cut it up into 1/2-3/4\u2032\u2032 squares and leave it out for an hour or more. Onions: yellow onions, 3-4 large, chopped into 1/2\u2032\u2032 pieces. Celery: 1 large bunch, cleaned and chopped into 1/2\u2032\u2032 slices. Parsley: fresh, 2 bunches, chopped semi finely. 4 cups water and 1-2 sticks of butter heating on the stove. Other spices: add fresh sage, rosemary, thyme. At least 3-5 T each. Add salt & pepper to taste. Other choice items: toasted pine nuts (2 cups), dried cranberries (2 cups). Directions 1. Combine all together (hands work well) in a very large pan. Add more water, as needed, for desired wetness. Taste often. Add more of anything you want! 2. Divide into several smaller casserole dishes and bake in a 375\u00b0 oven. You can bake covered (more uniformly moist) or a combo. I prefer to bake covered for about 30 min, then uncovered for 20-30 min more (crunchy and golden on top). Enjoy and Happy Thanksgiving!\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/11/22/pac-12-power-rankings-arizona-in-the-top-three-usc-falls-to-the-bottom-half/", "response": "```\n\u201cPac-12 Power Rankings\u201d is a column by Will Camardella ranking the Pac-12 football teams on a week-to-week basis. It\u2019s amazing how quickly the season goes by. USC has already completed its regular season, while the other 11 teams in the Pac-12 will play their final game on their schedules this coming weekend. Week 12 had some particularly telling results in some high-profile matchups. Teams such as Washington and Arizona again rose to the occasion against strong competition, while the Trojans and Colorado appeared eager to turn the page to 2024. Since each game makes up less of a team\u2019s overall body of work as the season progresses, these rankings are seeing less radical change week over week. This week, no team moved up or down more than one spot, usually as a result of a direct head-to-head matchup. However, it has become clear that the three teams still alive to make the Pac-12 Championship game have established themselves as the cream of the crop in the conference. So, starting with those three contenders, here\u2019s how the Conference of Champions stacks up after its penultimate week of games.\n\n1. Oregon Ducks (10-1, 7-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 1\nMuch like its game against Colorado back in September, Oregon won a game by 36 points while the box score makes the game seem closer than it was. Bo Nix threw six touchdown passes as the Ducks put together over 400 yards of offense in the first half alone. After 30 minutes of play, they led 42-0 over Arizona State. This game against the lowly Sun Devils came the week after Oregon hosted USC and the week before it battles its in-state rival. Yet, Dan Lanning\u2019s team did not in any way stumble against a team that was able to scare Washington. This effort proves that the Ducks have a rare trait in college football in 2023; they always give their opponents their \u201cA\u201d game. They rank second in the country in average scoring margin, as they average 25 more points per game than their opponents. This consistency will be put to the test over the next two weeks, as Oregon battles Oregon State in a high-stakes rivalry game and will likely go on to a rematch with Washington. It will be a grueling task for this team to make its way to the College Football Playoff, but if there\u2019s any team that can handle it, it is the Ducks.\n\n2. Washington Huskies (11-0, 8-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 2\nIf you had to draw up the perfect game scenario to give Washington its first loss of the season, Saturday\u2019s game in Corvallis would have been pretty close. The Huskies were playing in a raucous road atmosphere against a strong defensive team in torrential rain. Dropped passes were an issue, Michael Penix Jr. completed less than half his passes and the Huskies barely eclipsed 20 points of offense. The fact that Washington still found a way to pull out the win says a lot about the character of its football team. Its often-scrutinized defense came through in a big way this weekend, getting timely stops to prevent Oregon State\u2019s furious comeback attempt. The Huskies held the Beavers to three conversions on 12 third-down attempts, and they won the turnover battle three to one. Washington deserves a lot of credit for surviving every big test they have faced this year. None of the team\u2019s obvious flaws have resulted in a loss despite tight matchups against teams like Oregon State, Oregon and Utah. If the Huskies\u2019 defense that held Oregon State to 20 points and shut out Utah in the second half shows up in Vegas in a few weeks, they will be Pac-12 champions.\n\n3. Arizona Wildcats (8-3, 6-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 4\nCollege football is a funny thing. If Jedd Fisch had started Noah Fifita at quarterback instead of Jayden de Laura against Mississippi State and gone for two in overtime against USC, I believe Arizona would be a dark horse for the College Football Playoff. Do not take those as large-scale criticisms of Fisch. He has built a program that is still alive for a Pac-12 Championship Game berth when the likes of USC, Utah and Oregon State have all been eliminated. Arizona welcomed Utah, one of the most consistently good programs in the country and the back-to-back conference champs, into Tucson and absolutely dominated, winning 42-18. The Utes have one of the best defenses in the conference, but that did not stop the Wildcats from building a 28-0 lead early in the second quarter. Noah Fifita was extremely effective with a QBR of 97, and Tetairoa McMillan had an eight-reception, 116-yard day. The Arizona defense forced two Bryson Barnes turnovers and turned both interceptions into points. The Trojans were the most surprisingly disappointing team in the Pac-12, but the Wildcats have been the biggest positive surprise. An effort like that against Utah would have been unthinkable for Arizona to have in years past, but it has become the norm for this team in 2023, especially at home.\n\n4. Oregon State Beavers (8-3, 5-3 Pac-12) | Last Week: 3\nOregon State is a solid football team that went toe-to-toe with one of college football\u2019s few undefeated teams. Its defense kept the explosive Washington passing attack in check, and its offense won the yardage battle and dominated possession time. Unfortunately for the Beavers, none of those things translated to victory because of very shaky quarterback play. I\u2019ve talked a lot this year about DJ Uiagalelei\u2019s up-and-down season, but the fact is he failed to produce in the biggest spotlight this program has had in a while. He completed less than half his pass attempts and threw a pair of backbreaking interceptions as Oregon State was trying to climb back into the football game. His offense had the ball in the fourth quarter with a chance to win the game, but Uiagalelei could not get the Beavers past midfield. Oregon State did enough to win the football game, but the Clemson transfer has been unable to make the plays that other quarterbacks in this conference have to get his team over the hump. He will have one more opportunity to prove me wrong when the Beavers take on Oregon in Eugene, but I have not seen anything to make me think he can hang with Bo Nix.\n\n5. Utah Utes (7-4, 4-4 Pac-12) | Last Week: 5\nUtah has faced a ton of adversity throughout the season, especially with injuries at the quarterback position. A 4-4 conference record was probably predictable given the strength of the Pac-12, but it is still very disappointing for a program of this caliber. The one thing that the Utes absolutely cannot do if they want to win a football game is to fall behind early, but that\u2019s exactly what happened against Arizona on Saturday. Some early turnovers and an uncharacteristically poor showing from the Utah defense allowed the Wildcats to storm out to a 28-0 lead. Once that happened, Bryson Barnes had to throw the ball 53 times to try and come back. After the early scoring blitz, Arizona actually did not put points on the board again until the fourth quarter, but, because of how limited the Utes\u2019 offense is in the passing game, they could never make things interesting. They should be able to handle a reeling Colorado team in the season finale, but this was a season where too much went wrong for them to compete for the conference this season.\n\n6. UCLA Bruins (7-4, 4-4 Pac-12) | Last Week: 7\nEthan Garbers\u2019 return at quarterback was all UCLA needed to get its season back on track, as the Bruins reclaimed the victory bell in a 38-20 rout of USC. Garbers protected the football and tossed three touchdown passes against the porous Trojan defense. While the UCLA offense had one of its best performances in the conference schedule, it was just another day at the office for the defense. USC only recorded three rushing yards the entire game, while the Bruins recorded four sacks. Overall, the unit held Caleb Williams and Lincoln Riley\u2019s offense to its lowest point total of 2023. UCLA has had its ups and downs, but the one thing Chip Kelly was missing this season was a signature win. The Trojans have not lived up to expectations, but winning a game on the road against your archrival in dominant fashion will always make a head coach look good. There have been some rumors that the Bruins may want to make a coaching change this offseason, but a win like that should ensure that Kelly stays put.\n\n7. USC Trojans (7-5, 5-4 Pac-12) | Last Week: 6\nHaving been officially eliminated from Pac-12 Championship Game contention the week prior, USC had nothing to play for against its crosstown rival on Saturday except pride. Pride did not motivate the Trojans. They barely put up a fight against a mediocre UCLA in an 18-point loss in their home stadium. USC has been a bad team at the line of scrimmage for most of the season, and that showed against a stout Bruin defense. The Trojans never got their run game going; they averaged one-tenth of a yard per carry on 22 rush attempts. Caleb Williams was also under siege, getting sacked four times and pressured even more often. USC had a generational talent at quarterback who can avoid the rush and make great plays, but when he\u2019s asked to do so as often as he was this season, a disastrous game like this is inevitable. The game was also an underperformance for the Trojans\u2019 defense given how poor UCLA\u2019s offense had been on the road this year. The only other Pac-12 defense to allow over 30 points to the Bruins was Stanford. Major changes should be coming to the defensive coaching staff in the offseason, and they are sorely needed. I only dropped USC one spot in these rankings, because I felt a lack of effort in their last game factored into the final result. Any way you slice it, having the L.A. Coliseum stands three-quarters empty in the fourth quarter of USC\u2019s biggest rivalry game is a horrible look for the program. Year two under Lincoln Riley was a major step back from year one, and he will have a lot of work to do in the offseason to be prepared for the Big Ten in 2024.\n\n8. Cal Golden Bears (5-6, 3-5 Pac-12) | Last Week: 8\nCal established that it is the superior Bay Area football program heading into the ACC in 2024, handling Stanford in Palo Alto 27-15. Surprisingly, the Golden Bears will enter the final weekend of the regular season with a real possibility to make a bowl game. Cal did not light up the scoreboard on Saturday, but it did execute its gameplan about as well as it could have. Jaydn Ott was given 36 carries, and he systematically churned out 166 yards. His effectiveness on the ground set up the passing game, as Fernando Mendoza threw for almost 300 yards and three touchdowns. Meanwhile, Ashton Daniels was held to a 51% completion percentage, and the Golden Bears did not allow a single Stanford skill-position player to gain more than 67 yards. This was the first time since September that Cal held an opponent to fewer than 30 points.\n\n9. Washington State Cougars (5-6, 2-6 Pac-12) | Last Week: 10\nWashington State finally snapped its six-game losing streak by taking care of business against a reeling Colorado team. The Buffaloes were far from the most impressive opponent to take down, but given some of the losses the Cougars have taken in this stretch, any win is a welcome one. The WSU defense stepped up in a big way, especially up front. The unit sacked Shedeur Sanders four times in the first half before he left the game with an injury. The Cougars also forced three turnovers, including two scoop-and-score touchdowns. On offense, Cameron Ward accounted for four total touchdowns and hit a few big plays throughout the night. Carlos Hernandez was a major threat in the passing game; he had just two catches but both were for at least 29 yards. Colorado is a team with a lot of weaknesses, and Washington State exploited those weaknesses in a way it could not against the likes of Stanford and Arizona State. A game like that does not salvage the season in my mind, but it does at least prove that the Cougars have not quit with bowl eligibility still on the table.\n\n10. Colorado Buffaloes (4-7, 1-7 Pac-12) | Last Week: 9\nYou could make a variety of compelling arguments as to what moment could be considered \u201crock bottom\u201d for Deion Sanders in his first season at Colorado, but I believe Friday night\u2019s blowout takes the cake. Against a Washington State team that had lost six games in a row, the Buffaloes were utterly uncompetitive in a 56-14 drubbing. The most surprising thing about Colorado\u2019s season may have been it took until Week 12 for Shedeur Sanders to get injured. He was knocked out of the game in the second quarter, in another game where the Buffaloes\u2019 offensive line could not protect him. They had 10 offensive drives after Shedeur departed but found the end zone just one time. It is increasingly clear that Shedeur was covering a lot of the underlying problems with this Colorado roster, which is why the team was so uncompetitive without him on the field. The defense allowed 42 points in the first half to the Cougars in another uncompetitive performance. The Buffaloes now rank second to last in the Pac-12 in scoring defense, allowing just one-tenth of a point fewer per game than Stanford. Deion called this 1-7 stretch the hardest stretch of his life. With a matchup with Utah and Kyle Whittingham on deck to close 2023, I see no reason why that will not continue.\n\n11. Arizona State Sun Devils (3-8, 2-6 Pac-12) | Last Week: 11\nI chose not to drop Arizona State despite an embarrassing loss because they were far from the first team Oregon has embarrassed this season. Even still, it was disappointing to see that the Sun Devils could not make that game competitive in their stadium, where they have had much stronger efforts in weeks past. The ASU offense only functions when it runs through Cam Skattebo. When the Ducks score 42 unanswered points in the first half alone, the running game cannot be much of a factor in the comeback attempt. Thus, Skattebo only had eight carries for less than 50 yards. The Sun Devils wound up having to throw the football 47 times but only averaged 4.4 yards per attempt. Trenton Bourguet had a QBR of 22.7. Defensively, Arizona State gave up big play after big play, as eight separate Oregon pass catchers had receptions of at least 16 yards on a 400-yard passing day for Bo Nix. The roster was not equipped to match up with the likes of Troy Franklin and Gary Bryant, and it showed on the final stat sheet. All around, it was a poor effort for Kenny Dillingham in his second-to-last home game, but because of the respect I have for Oregon, I will not extensively punish them for it.\n\n12. Stanford Cardinal (3-8, 2-7 Pac-12) | Last Week: 12\nStanford is the only team in the FBS that has not won a game at home this season. Normally, the Cardinal do not have much of a home-field advantage with sparse crowds. However, Saturday\u2019s game against Cal was above capacity, and it did not matter. The Golden Bears\u2019 defense has been one of the worst in the country; they allow over 40 points per game in Pac-12 matchups. However, Stanford could not eclipse even 20 points in a game where it only picked up four first downs. The running game was particularly ineffective; Ashton Daniels scrambled for 67 yards, but the actual running backs on the roster combined for just 34 on 12 carries. This game was Troy Taylor\u2019s final realistic opportunity to earn a fourth win this season with the motivation of a home rivalry game to fire up his team. Instead, the Cardinal again looked uncompetitive. With the way this team has looked at its worst this season and how often we see its bottom-tier effort, three wins seems like an overperformance for Stanford in 2023.\n```"}

(AP/Colin Hackley)\n\nBy Victor Kevorkian November 21, 2023 at 11:15 pm PST\n\nArizona continues hot streak, beats Utah, 42-18\n\nThe Wildcats are winners of five straight and making a statement as they head to the Big 12 next season. Quarterback Noah Fifita has continued to produce efficient statlines during Arizona\u2019s hot streak. He completed 22 of his 30 pass attempts for 253 yards and two touchdowns. Receiver Tetairoa McMillan, who has been Fifita\u2019s favorite target this season, led the team with eight catches for 116 yards and a touchdown. McMillan also added a passing touchdown to his impressive day, finding receiver Michael Wiley for a 21-yard score on a double pass trick play to open up scoring in the first quarter. Running back Jonah Coleman led the team with 90 rushing yards and a touchdown on 14 attempts. Arizona\u2019s offense put this one away early, starting the game on a 28-0 run in the second quarter. It was an impressive offensive performance in a game in which they were out-possessed by over 10 minutes. Utah\u2019s offense struggled throughout, scoring its first points with under a minute remaining in the second quarter. While he may have benefitted from garbage time, quarterback Bryson Barnes wasn\u2019t horrible statistically, completing 31 of his 53 pass attempts for 320 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. He added 44 yards on the ground. Receiver Devaughn Vele had himself a nice day, hauling in nine receptions for 111 yards and a score. Arizona, now 8-3, jumped from No. 17 to No. 15 in this week\u2019s College Football Playoff rankings after another impressive ranked victory. Utah 7-4 are now unranked.\n\nGeorgia dominates Tennessee on road, 38-10\n\nThe Bulldogs became the first team in college football history to go undefeated in SEC play three years in a row since the eight-game season was introduced. Volunteers running back Jaylen Wright started this contest off with a bang, rushing for a 75-yard touchdown on the first play from scrimmage. His score had the home fans rocking at Neyland Stadium, but it was all Bulldogs from there on out. Georgia\u2019s defense allowed just 13 first downs and forced six punts. The Bulldogs dominated time of possession 40:58-19:02, en route to their 11th win of the year. Bulldogs quarterback Carson Beck had one of his better statistical games of the season, throwing for 298 yards and three touchdowns on 24 of 30 passing. Receiver Marcus Rosemary-Jacksaint led the team with seven catches for 91 yards and two touchdowns. Fellow pass-catcher Dillon Bell caught five balls for 90 yards and a score, adding an 18-yard passing touchdown to his day on a trick play late in the first. The Volunteers failed to find significant contributions from their skill position players, as Wright led the team with nine rushes for 90 yards and his opening touchdown. Quarterback Joe Milton struggled to get anything going, completing 17 of his 30 pass attempts for 147 yards. It was a sloppy day for Tennessee\u2019s offense against a stout Georgia defense. Georgia (11-0) remains No. 1 in the CFP rankings. Tennessee (7-4) slid from their No. 18 spot to No. 21.\n\nOhio State takes care of Minnesota, 37-3\n\nThe Buckeyes outgained the Golden Gophers 434-159, adding another win to their undefeated record. Ohio State quarterback Kyle McCord, who has found some rhythm of late, posted an efficient outing at the Horseshoe. He completed 20 of his 30 passes for 212 yards and two touchdowns. Receiver Emeka Egbuka led the way with five catches for 83 yards while running back TreVeyon Henderson exploded for 146 yards and two touchdowns on 15 carries. Down just 13-0 at halftime, Minnesota\u2019s dreams of a monumental upset were still alive. However, its offense was held to just 10 first downs and 159 total yards, an underwhelming yet expected outcome. Quarterback Athan Kaliakmanis completed just 11 passes for 89 yards. Running back Jordan Nubin was the most productive Golden Gopher, totaling just 50 yards on 20 touches. Ohio State (11-0) remains ranked No. 2 in the rankings, as they look forward to their biggest matchup of the year vs. No. 3 Michigan. Minnesota (5-6) remains unranked.\n\nWashington holds on vs. Oregon State, 22-20\n\nThe Huskies were able to escape Corvallis with a win despite being shutout in the second half. Washington\u2019s defense forced three turnovers in a sloppy win, but a safety off a high snap late in the first quarter proved to be the deciding factor, as Washington prevailed by two points. Quarterback Michael Penix was not particularly great, but did enough to come out on top. He completed just 13 of his 28 pass attempts for 162 yards and two touchdowns, adding 22 yards and a score on the ground. Running back Dillon Johnson led the team with 89 rushing yards, losing a fumble in the process. Receiver Rome Odunze was perhaps the most impressive Husky, catching 7 passes for 106 yards and two touchdowns. The Beavers\u2019 offense had numerous opportunities to steal this game, but failed to convert. Quarterback DJ Uiagalelei put up his worst statistical performance of the year, completing 15 of his 31 passes for 164 yards and two interceptions. He added 53 yards rushing to his day. Running back Damien Martinez carried the ball 26 times for 123 yards and two touchdowns, while receiver Silas Bolden led the team with 64 receiving yards. Oregon State won this contest in every aspect but the score. They outgained the Huskies 317-272, punted just once and dominated time of possession 37:27-22:33. In the end it was not enough to knock off the conference frontrunners, who have now clinched a spot in the Pac-12 championship game. Washington (11-0) took Florida State\u2019s spot at No. 4, largely attributed to the Seminoles losing their star quarterback to injury. Oregon State (8-3) dropped five spots to No. 16.\n\nOregon routs Arizona State, 49-13\n\nDucks quarterback Bo Nix may have won his Heisman on the road in Tempe, tossing six touchdown passes in the first half. Nix totaled 404 yards on the day through three and a half quarters and a 42-0 lead meant the Heisman hopeful could sit out the rest of the game. Receiver Troy Franklin led the Ducks in receiving yards, hauling in eight balls for 128 yards and two touchdowns. Nix found four receivers for over 75 yards, with five Ducks receivers finding the endzone. Sun Devils quarterback Trenton Bourguet struggled, completing 20 of his 37 passes for 142 yards. Running back Cameron Skattebo led the team with 49 yards on the ground while receiver Elijiah Badger led all receivers with 64 yards on seven catches. Arizona State converted just three of its 14 third down attempts, a true representation of its disappointing 2023 season. The Ducks nearly doubled Arizona State\u2019s total yardage, out gaining them 603-316. Oregon (10-1) stayed put at No. 6 in the rankings. Arizona State (3-8) remain unranked.\n\nMichigan outlasts Maryland, 31-24\n\nMichigan avoided the monumental upset to secure the teams 1,000th win, becoming the first college football program to accomplish this feat. Up by just five points heading into the fourth quarter, it was evident that this would be no easy win for the Wolverines. Quarterback J.J. McCarthy played a modest role in the win, completing 12 of his 23 pass attempts for 141 yards and an interception. The Wolverines did not find as much success on the ground as they did last week against Penn State, forcing McCarthy to try and make plays with his arm. Running back Blake Corum did have a solid game however, rushing the ball 28 times for 94 yards and two touchdowns. It was the Michigan defense that willed its team to victory, forcing two safeties and recovering a fumble for a touchdown. Terrapins quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa struggled to find the endzone, as he threw for 247 passing yards and two interceptions. Receiver Kaden Prather led the team with three catches for 81 yards. Maryland totaled just 15 rushing yards in this contest, as their offense struggled to get things going. Neither offense had the day it anticipated and Maryland was able to string together scoring drives to keep this game within reach. In the end, Michigan\u2019s defense held true to keep their playoff hopes alive. Michigan (11-0) kept their No. 3 spot in the rankings despite an uninspiring win. Maryland (6-5) remains unranked.\n\nFlorida State loses Jordan Travis against North Alabama, 58-13\n\nThe North Alabama Lions had all attendees in Tallahassee in shock after jumping out to a 13-0 lead at the end of the first quarter. North Alabama\u2019s momentum would not last long, as the Seminoles would go on to score 58 unanswered points to shut down any thoughts of a historic upset. But the biggest story from this game came late in the first quarter when \u2018Noles quarterback Jordan Travis\u2019 awkwardly landed on his leg during a read option run. Travis would be carted off the field, later announcing that his collegiate career is over after suffering a gruesome injury. Florida State would turn to backup quarterback Tate Rodemaker, who was solid in his first real action of the season. Rodemaker completed 13 of his 23 pass attempts for 217 yards and two touchdowns. Running back CJ Campbell led the team with 78 yards and a score on just three attempts, while tight end Jaheim Bell led the team with 59 receiving yards. With the game effectively over by the third quarter, the Seminoles were able to turn to the bottom of their depth chart as 12 skill position players logged a stat. Florida State (11-0) slipped to No. 5 in the rankings despite the large margin of victory after Jordan\u2019s announcement on Monday.\n\nClemson knocks off North Carolina, 31-20\n\nThe underdog Tigers are winners of three straight games, with two of them coming against ranked opponents. Clemon blew this game open with an offensive explosion in the second and third quarters, going on a 28-7 run within that time frame. Quarterback Cade Klubnik was very solid at home, throwing for 219 yards and a touchdown while adding 44 yards and a score on the ground. Running back Will Shipley had a big day, rushing for 126 yards and a touchdown on 18 attempts. Receiver Adam Randall led the team with 57 receiving yards. The Tar Heels offense jumped out to a 7-0 lead late in the first quarter but struggled to replicate that success for the remainder of the game. Quarterback Drake Maye completed just 16 of his 36 pass attempts for 209 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Maye\u2019s favorite target was Devontez Walker, who hauled in 4 balls for 70 yards. Carolina\u2019s biggest offensive contributor was running back Omarion Hampton, who rushed the ball 19 times for 178 yards and two touchdowns, including a 55-yard scamper to the house. Clemson\u2019s home victory was the product of an all around efficient team performance. The offense controlled the clock and the defense held true on third downs while winning the turnover battle. Clemson (7-4) cracked the rankings at No. 24 for the first time since early September after another ranked win. North Carolina (8-3) is no longer ranked.\n```"}

This is the Vista Theatre, an iconic Hollywood staple that opened in 1923. However, the pandemic caused the theater, like many other small theaters across the country, to close its doors in 2020. That was until renowned Hollywood director Quentin Tarantino of \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d \u201cKill Bill,\u201d and \u201cInglourious Basterds,\u201d bought the theater in 2021. The theater officially reopened November 17, over a month after its centennial anniversary.\n\nAudience members trickle to the front of the building 20 minutes ahead of the theater's opening. The next day, more fans stood in front of the theater, snapping photos and discussing their favorite films as they waited for it to open for a screening of Eli Roth\u2019s \u201cThanksgiving.\u201d Among them was Cesar Ortiz, who first went to the Vista after seeing the location in the opening scene of \u201cScream 2,\u201d leading to his repeated attendance.\n\n\u201cMy first time was a couple of years before they shut down for the pandemic, and then my second time, it was when they had \u2018Scream,\u2019\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to see what the new changes are with the remodeling and everything.\u201d\n\nAt precisely 2:20 p.m., the metal grate in front of the theater lifted and fans streamed in as the smell of popcorn floated out of the lobby and into the streets of Los Angeles. As the theater starts to open, fans prepare to line up for a screening of \"Thanksgiving.\"\n\nThe theater\u2019s interior is something to behold \u2013 decorations range from a mannequin of Gogo Yubari, a character from Tarantino\u2019s \u201cKill Bill: Volume 1\u2032\u2032 and various Egyptian-themed installations. The auditorium itself has been renovated from the ground up. The sides of the wall continue the ancient Egyptian imagery, featuring the faces of pharaohs overlooking the audience as the brick walls are adorned with wings and serpents. Audience members piled in as they awaited the red curtain to pull back.\n\nTheater manager Victor Martinez stood at the front door dressed in a red tuxedo as he scanned audience tickets and welcomed them into the lobby. Martinez has been working at the Vista for 35 years and is overjoyed to finally be able to bring it back after its closure.\n\n\u201cI was devastated. I mean, this has been my home away from home,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe\u2019re very proud to reopen with [Tarantino], because if that theater is going to survive another 100 years, it\u2019ll be because he took over.\u201d\n\nThe theater\u2019s appeal extends beyond its status as a Hollywood staple. Martinez hopes that they can be a part of carving out a unique niche for showing movies on film. This means that they will be run on traditional film reels as opposed to being played digitally.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to show [films on] 35 millimeter and 70 millimeter,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe\u2019re building this cool Hollywood film club for all the film fans, and we\u2019re very proud of that because Quentin does not like digital.\u201d\n\nMartinez said that the relationship between the Vista Theatre and Tarantino started many years ago. He stated that the director was a regular attendee before its closure in 2020, which is what eventually led to their collaboration.\n\n\u201cHe saw me work over the years,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe would come in and see sold out shows. He would see how fast we were cleaning up with the crowd, and we used to joke around and say \u2018Hey, maybe someday you\u2019ll be the owner...\u2019 I\u2019m so flattered because I feel like Quentin gave me a life achievement award as a manager.\u201d\n\nThe opening night of the theater on Friday saw hundreds of excited moviegoers greeted by the cast and crew of \u201cThanksgiving,\u201d but it did exactly not go off without a hitch. Leonardo Baricala, a local who attended the Vista Theatre for the first time on Friday, stopped by the theater on Saturday in hopes of getting another ticket after leaving the opening screening early.\n\n\u201cThe movie started about 15 minutes late, but we were surprised by the director and the cast... the movie started fine, but about 30 minutes in, the audio started to go in and out... and then it started to get really crazy and it was like two minutes without audio,\u201d Baricala said. \u201cWhat I saw yesterday was really good. The place looks amazing, and they had this unfortunate problem, so I hope to come back to see [\u201dThanksgiving\u201d] before it closes.\u201d\n\nMartinez attributed this to \u201clittle bugs that come with projectors,\u201d but explained that all these issues have been ironed out ahead of the weekend. With the massive crowd waiting in line for concessions and piling outside of the theater prior to opening hours, it\u2019s safe to say that audiences have not been deterred from checking out the venue.\n\nMartinez said that he holds the theater close to his heart following its shutdown and subsequent revival. Now, he is more than excited to greet old regulars and new visitors alike outside of the refurbished Vista lobby.\n\n\u201cI definitely learned a valuable lesson that it is true what they say; \u2018You don\u2019t know what you got until it\u2019s gone,\u2019\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThe good news is that because of the pandemic, I will never retire.\u201d\n\nIf watching movies on film and occasionally seeing the cast and crew of movies does not seem interesting enough, Martinez gave one last reason to catch a show at the Vista.\n\n\u201cWe have the best popcorn.\u201d```"}

Similarly to the \u201cNational Prescription Drug Take Back Day\u201d coordinated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the initiative by the USC Pharmacies and USC Student Health is designed to encourage community members to dispose of unneeded and unwanted medications at selected locations \u2014 \u201cno questions asked.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake Back Days\u201d address a critical public safety and health issue in the United States: prescription drug overdoses. According to the National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics, thirty-two percent of opioid overdose deaths are related to prescription opioids; following the LA County Department of Public Health, \u201cnearly 75 percent of residents who use prescription drugs inappropriately, obtain them from relatives or friends.\u201d Indeed, one of the contributing factors is the estimated 200 million pounds of unnecessary prescription drugs that are hoarded in American medicine cabinets. As noted by the National Community Pharmacists Association and quoted by USC, \u201cthis situation provides easy access and an opportunity for the abuse of these medications by others for whom they were not intended.\u201d\n\nIn creating and taking advantage of such spaces, the USC community actively joins the fight against accidental and intentional drug misuse. U.S. President Joe Biden and China\u2019s Xi Jinping also highlighted the importance of cooperation in this context, declaring a united front against the illegal fentanyl trade in San Francisco, just one day before the event at USC.\n\nThe anonymous element of the USC initiative may be as important as the day itself, as it welcomes everyone to act responsibly without personal judgment. In particular, the stigma of addiction is a primary obstacle in education and harm reduction for frequent and occasional drug users alike.\n\nOnce again, USC\u2019s annual initiative seems to have played its part in the fight against drug abuse and misuse: the disposal containers at the USC Health Center Pharmacy (UPC Jefferson Parking Structure), the USC Medical Plaza Pharmacy (HSC HC1, First Floor) and the USC Verdugo Hills Professional Pharmacy (1808 Verdugo Blvd., Suite 111) were full by the end of November 16, and people of all ages were seen taking advantage of the initiative.\n```"}

USC never trailed once in the 64-54 win\u2014 despite a late Pirates push \u2014 and moved to 4-0 on the season.\n\nUSC started the first quarter with some healthy ball movement, as all of the starters scored early. A 14-0 Trojan run resulted in an early 18-3 lead. Freshman guard JuJu Watkins started 1-for-5 from the field but heated up later in the quarter, leading the team with seven points through the first 10 minutes.\n\nSeton Hall mounted a 5-0 run to start the second quarter, but USC showed some signs of life behind clutch buckets by graduate forward McKenzie Forbes. Every time it seemed like the Pirates might inch closer, the Trojans found an answer. They held Seton Hall to 30% shooting from the field in the first half and led by 15 at halftime.\n\nUSC seemed to have the game under control in the third, building its lead up to 20 behind seven straight points from graduate forward Kaitlyn Davis. But the Trojans went cold early in the fourth, scoring only one point through the first 4:30 of play. With less than a minute remaining in the game, the Pirates cut the lead down to 10, and it seemed like USC might be in trouble.\n\nFortunately for USC, time ran out on Seton Hall, and they ultimately fell to the Trojans. \u201cWe are still a young team together,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said after the game. \u201cI actually like that we had to grow and learn and make a few mistakes and have enough of a cushion to come out.\u201d\n\nIt was a relatively quiet night for Watkins, whose  35-point performance against Le Moyne  last Monday was the second-highest scoring game for a freshman in USC history (Cheryl Miller put up 39 as a freshman against Northwestern on Nov. 30, 1982). Against Seton Hall, Watkins went 6-for-17 from the floor and finished with 15 points. \u201cThey were very physical with [Watkins]; they threw a lot of defenses at her,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI thought her maturity in handling that is a good step for us.\u201d\n\nDespite some shooting struggles, Watkins still led the team in points and tacked on seven rebounds and two blocks. Monday\u2019s win marked the fourth consecutive game where both Watkins and junior center Rayah Marshall (14) scored in double digits. \u201cJuJu\u2019s amazing,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWhen you have guards like that coming off the screen that can score, whether it\u2019s in the paint or a 3-point pull-up, it makes my job a lot easier.\u201d\n\nMarshall led the team in rebounds with 15 and recorded her 22nd career double-double in the matchup. It was also her 54th straight game with at least one blocked shot. Other USC players made their mark on the game as well, as Forbes finished with 12 points and Davis scored 13 in her first double-digit game as a Trojan.\n\nUSC is ranked No. 8 in this week\u2019s  AP poll , its highest ranking since the end of the 1994 season.

(Photo by Olivia Siu)\n\nBy Olivia Siu\nNovember 20, 2023 at 5:40 pm PST\n\nLike an in-the-know insider, those who are subscribed to the Outside the Box Office mailing list receive exclusive invitations to film screenings of both indie and VIP studios as late as the day of. Taking advantage of USC School of Cinematic Arts\u2019 multiple screening rooms, the Outside the Box Office\u2019s calendar boasts a wide selection of films for both the USC community and the general public to enjoy.\n\nAs a testament to the university\u2019s and industry\u2019s connectedness, Outside the Box Office partnered up with streaming giant, Netflix, this past Friday. Together, they presented a screening of Wes Andersons\u2019 \u201cThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\u201d with a Q&A session to follow with the film\u2019s cinematographer Robert Yeoman, a faculty member of the School of Cinematic Arts (SCA) and producer Steven Rales.\n\nThe screening series calendar is both star-studded and jam-packed. On Thursday before, audiences enjoyed the country of Georgia\u2019s official Oscar submission for Best International Film, \u201cCitizen Saint\u201d with a discussion to follow with the director-writer-producer Tinatin Kajrishvili.\n\nA film still of \u201cCitizen Saint,\u201d provided with a note from the director, Tinatin Kajrishvili (Image courtesy from Studio Artizim).\n\nThe ambitious and well-connected screening series reflects the rigor and reputation of SCA. It came to fruition 15 years ago due to the efforts of its still-active founder, Alex Ago. Born from USC\u2019s most popular elective of over 50 years, CTCS-466: Theatrical Film Symposium, also known as Thursday Night at the Movies with Leonard Maltin, Outside the Box Office screening series was a result of Ago\u2019s refusal to turn away external screening offers for the once-a-week class.\n\nThe opening of the new SCA complex in 2009, complete with new screening rooms, was the opportunity to begin a screening series that is independent of the weekly class. Ago details this beginning, \u201cAs long as distributors were still willing to give us the same resources and provide access to movies and guests, then we could offer them for free to the campus at large.\u201d\n\nThat is still to say there is an Oz-like wizard at work, as Ago states that this screening series is also carefully curated. Ago said his own criteria for a selection to make it to the screening calendar, is that it must be able to be \u201cdiscussed on its own merit as a film and not simply as a topic.\u201d He strives for a film festival structure that equally commends the content as well as the craftsmanship that makes it possible.\n\nTherefore, subscribers and audiences of the Outside the Box Office series have a filmmakers\u2019 workshop resource directly and actively contributed from awarded and on-the-rise creators. An event that encapsulates this educational and community-building spirit is a 2022 screening that brought together multiple supporters to celebrate. \u201cLumpia with a Vengeance\u201d was a crowdfunded action comedy film that was hosted at SCA\u2019s Ray Stark Family Theatre under Outside the Box Office, and whose co-writer and director, an SCA alumna, Patricio Ginels.\n\nUSC Troy Philippines and SCA partnered together for a screening of \"Lumpia with a Vengeance.\" (Photo by Olivia Siu)\n\nThe lobby was lively with members from screening partner USC Troy Philippines and catering from Lumpia Mania.

Like a \u201cyear-long film festival,\u201d Outside the Box Office allows a place on the USC campus for pre-release films, international Oscar submissions, and crowdfunded works alike.\n\nThis year, the screening series celebrates 15 years of hosting a space for inspiration, collaboration, and education for those who act in both creator and audience member roles.\n\nSubscribe to the Outside of the Box Office Mailing List here.\n```"}

Its beauty is most apparent at a Southern California farmers market where heaps of jewel-toned produce weigh down plastic tables and woven totes. There are pears that I\u2019ll turn into galettes, apples that I\u2019ll bake into pies, persimmons that I\u2019ll consume raw and by the pound and sweet potatoes that I\u2019ll add to everything else. I\u2019m just as likely to eat a roasted sweet potato in my oatmeal as I am to drink it through a straw in a smoothie. They\u2019re the chameleons of the culinary world, and they\u2019re too often overlooked.\n\nThis Thanksgiving, I urge you to promote the humble sweet potato from supporting character to starring role. This isn\u2019t a diatribe against turkey, and I\u2019m not turning my nose up at stuffing (or dressing as some people call it). I love all holiday foods equally. But while the turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and gravy get all of the love and attention, the sweet potatoes sit alone and untouched on the counter...forgotten.\n\nI trace this lack of attention to the classic sweet potato casserole with marshmallows. For someone with a raging sweet tooth like myself, I\u2019m fully on board with this explosion of sugar and fat. But as an objective observer, I can see why some would think it too rich or too sweet. So, I\u2019ve decided that with the promise of pie to look forward to after dinner, a smarter approach to the sweet potato is to highlight its savory side.\n\nEnter tahini. Just like my favorite root vegetable, this nutty sesame paste is extraordinarily neutral, and can be either sweet or savory depending on the needs of the cook. In this recipe, I straddle the line between the two by mixing it with salted butter, maple syrup and apple cider vinegar. The result? A silky sauce that caramelizes in the oven.\n\nIt takes a little over an hour to make this dish, but most of this time is hands-off. After roasting the sweet potatoes, all you have to do is tear or cut them into large pieces and toss them with half of the tahini butter and sesame seeds before baking them some more. Served with Greek yogurt (if desired) and drizzled with the remaining butter mixture, this creamy, sticky, nutty contribution to your holiday feast is practically guaranteed to delight and impress.\n\nThe best part about this recipe is that it\u2019s easily doubled, tripled or halved. Happy eating!\n\n\u2014 Twice-Baked Sweet Potatoes with Tahini Butter\n\nServes 4\nActive 15 min.\nTotal 1 hour, 25 min.\n\n2 large sweet potatoes, scrubbed and pricked with a fork\n1\u20444 cup (2 oz./56.5 grams) salted butter\n2 Tbsp. tahini (such as Soom)\n1 Tbsp. maple syrup\n1 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar\n1 Tbsp. sesame seeds, plus more for garnish\nPlain whole Greek yogurt, for serving\n\n1. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Place sweet potatoes on a large-rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and let sit until cool enough to handle about 10 minutes.\n2. Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and whisk in tahini, maple syrup, apple cider vinegar, and sesame seeds.\n3. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, rip or cut into large chunks and place on the same rimmed baking sheet in a single layer. Pour half of the tahini mixture over the potatoes, tossing to coat fully. Return to preheated oven. Bake until tahini has caramelized and the potatoes are beginning to char, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven.\n4. Top a large platter or plate with a thick layer of Greek yogurt. Transfer sweet potatoes to a platter and drizzle with remaining tahini butter. Sprinkle with more sesame seeds.\n```"}

Photo courtesy of USC Visions and Voices.\n\nBy Ashton Benn November 20, 2023 at 2:49 pm PST\n\nMichelle Saunders stood flanked by her fellow club dance legends, Archie Burnett and Brahms \u201cBravo\u201d Lafortune. They were engrossed in a lively conversation about their favorite New York clubs in the \u201870s and \u201880s. \u201cOn Saturdays, we headed downtown to the Paradise Garage,\u201d Burnett said. Saunders\u2019s tan face, etched with wrinkles, lit up when Burnett spoke. At the mention of the iconic nightclub, dancers slid and carved through the space behind the three legends. They kicked their sneakers in the air, grooved and danced to the backdrop of the three voices, which were still reminiscing about the enduring community they cultivated inside the wall of Greenwich Village\u2019s Paradise Garage.\n\nAs the three club legends talked and the dancers moved to their voices, a series of photos and videos appeared on the screen behind them. Younger images of Saunders sporting a white bikini top and short skirt flashed by, her eyes sparkling as if she were about to paint the town red with her fashionista confidence. The screen shifted to a video of a shirtless Burnett, skin ripped with muscles, as he danced around the nightclub \u2014 vogueing and waacking. Suddenly, a young Lafortune glided in, wearing two different colored shoes which blurred as he executed his signature fast footwork.\n\nThe whole spectacle took place at the University of Southern California\u2019s Bovard Auditorium as part of Ephrat Asherie Dance (EAD)\u2019s show \u201cUnderscored,\u201d presented by USC\u2019s Visions & Voices. Hailing from New York City\u2019s underground dance scene, these legends joined Asherie and five other members of her company, EAD, to honor club culture and the liberation it symbolizes. Club culture encompasses music, dance, fashion, social interactions and community within nightlife. It has a rich history rooted in underground metropolitan scenes.\n\nThe multimedia performance blends dance, visuals and spoken word, breaking the fourth wall and culminating in an onstage dance party with the audience. \u201cUnderscored\u201d is more than a dance performance, it is a dynamic celebration of a culture that is too often forgotten. Asherie, who serves as the choreographer, artistic director and performer of the company, brought these artists together to create a one-of-a-kind experience. Small in stature but big in spirit, Asherie wanted to pay tribute to the underground scene that transformed her own life. As a result, \u201cUnderscored\u201d was born.\n\nAs a New York City b-girl, Asherie grew up surrounded by hip-hop music and culture. She went on to receive her MFA from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee where she dived deeply into the vernacular jazz dance roots of contemporary street and club dances. She is a 2016 Bessie Award Winner for Innovative Achievement in Dance and her choreography has received numerous awards.\n\nThe night kicked off with a pre-show panel which consisted of hip-hop icons in the Los Angeles dance scene. Soul Train dancers Bill \u201cSlim the Robot\u201d Williams and Sharon Hill were joined by Toni Basil, Deidra \u201cKrucial\u201d and Charlie E. Schmidt. Together they discussed the creation of unique West Coast hip-hop dances in influential L.A. clubs \u2014 movement labs where the scene\u2019s hottest dancers gathered to experiment and innovate. Spanning five generations, the panelists provided context for the hour-long show that followed.\n\nThe lights dimmed as figures slinked across the back of the stage, their bodies only visible as silhouettes. Facing the back, one by one they freestyled hip-hop to the synth music. As the bass gradually intensified, the dancers\u2019 movements grew more energetic. It culminated in an eruption of music, light and dance that engulfed the stage. At certain points in the show, the six people danced in unison, but it was their freestyles that showcased their distinct movement styles. Matthew \u201cMegawatt\u201d West defied gravity with his breakdancing, while Manon Bal fiercely vogued and framed her face with sharp wrist movements and poses.\n\nBut after ten minutes, the company humbly took a backseat when the legends arrived on the scene. Not even Saunders\u2019 neon green hair could outshine her smile as she strutted out from the corner wing. At 80 years old, she danced through the corridor of bodies and lightly tapped the company members as she went. With her touch, each performer peeled away into a groovy house dance sequence. Within this scene, Saunders embodied the spirit of the Paradise Garage and similar clubs that thrived at the time. Even with her more limited movement range, her unabashed dedication to dance and music as a means of self-expression was unmistakable.\n\nAs Saunders gracefully exited, large square mirrors rolled onstage. People craned to get a look at who was hidden behind them, but the mystery was short-lived. Burnett burst forward with captivating confidence. He moved his long arms in his iconic vogue style and he sliced his limbs in precise lines. Even the slightest hip roll or finger flick drew enthusiastic cheers from the audience. But Burnett\u2019s solo was more than just a dance. \u201cHow long do you think our club hours were?\u201d he gazed out into the auditorium and asked. In response, someone from the audience shouted, \u201c9 pm to 2 am,\u201d to which Burnett threw his head back and laughed. \u201cSundown to sunup,\u201d Burnett declared after a few more wild guesses.\n\nLast but certainly not least, Lafortune joined Burnett. Known for his unmatchable house footwork, he wasted no time getting into the rhythm. Asherie and the company often circled these dance legends, sometimes they joined in the dance and other times allowed them to command the stage. Interwoven with the freestyle and house beats were monologues and conversations between the performers, who reminisced about their cherished dance havens. Lafortune shared anecdotes about David Mancuso\u2019s iconic club and The Loft. The younger performers recounted their experiences at various dance spaces. It all made for a beautiful exchange of intergenerational wisdom.\n\nAll the performers were united by their shared experiences as artists who found their voices by dancing in nightclubs. They were surrounded by the safety of like-minded individuals who were there to deeply feel the music and connect with their communities. \u201cUnderscored\u201d did more than just tell its viewers about the New York City clubs. It delved deep into the memories which resided within Saunders, Lafortune and Burnett\u2019s minds. They were brought to life and recreated with an end-of-show dance party on the Bovard Auditorium stage.\n\nFollowed by their bows, the performers leaped off the stage and invited audience members to join them. The LA dance community intermixed with the legends and old friends from opposite coasts reunited. Eventually, Burnett found himself at the center of the onstage dance circle, then gestured for others to join him in the spotlight.\n\nAlthough the vibrant underground club culture from the 1970s to the 1990s may only now exist in memory, there will always be cultural pockets preserving its legacy. \u201cUnderscored,\u201d through its engaging history lesson, paid tribute to the pioneers who played a significant role in shaping the hip-hop culture we know today. While many of these club legends have since passed away, Asherie\u2019s work ensures that their contributions are remembered and celebrated.\n```"}

Expand AEW put on several great shows over the weekend in Los Angeles. (Photo by Maddy Myer)\n\nBy Maddy Myer November 20, 2023 at 2:21 pm PST\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d is a pro wrestling column by Maddy Myer. All Elite Wrestling spent all week entrenched in the Los Angeles area. It started with AEW Dynamite on November 15 at the Toyota Arena, then moving over to the Forum for AEW Rampage and Collision on November 17 before their Full Gear pay-per-view at the Forum on November 18. It was an incredible week of wrestling for the company, where new stars were solidified, and old stars showed they still have what it takes.\n\nOut of the entire week of action \u2014 some of which I was able to see live at the Forum \u2014 Full Gear had the most impressive matches. Some standout performances came from \u201cHangman\u201d Adam Page and Swerve Strickland, Orange Cassidy and Jon Moxley, and arguably AEW\u2019s most over star at the moment, Maxwell Jacob Friedman, better known as MJF.\n\nHere are the top pro wrestling matches from Full Gear.\n\nHangman Adam Page vs. Swerve Strickland (AEW Full Gear, November 18)\n\nThis matchup started as an absolute brawl that showed just how much these men hate each other. They didn\u2019t call this match a Texas death match for nothing, and it was clearly evident from the start. Hangman Adam Page even landed his finisher\u2014 the buckshot lariat \u2014 early on before going for more damage on Swerve Strickland, including an early on chair shot. Soon after, Page taped Strickland\u2019s hands together and began to put staples into his chest and arms. Eventually, a bloody Strickland had enough and turned the tables on Page, driving his head into a barbed wire-wrapped chair. Strickland proceeded to slam Page\u2019s upper back straight into a cinder block. At this point both men were bloody and not giving up, using everything they could \u2014 from glass to a barbed wire-covered slab of wood \u2014 to get the job done. In the end, Strickland picked up the victory after using a metal chain wrapped around Page\u2019s neck until he passed out.\n\nOrange Cassidy vs. Jon Moxley (AEW Full Gear, November 18)\n\nSpeaking of two men that hate each other, Jon Moxley and Orange Cassidy also fit that bill. Moxley took the fight right to Cassidy, dragging him outside the ring and slamming his abdomen on the barricade. The bigger Moxley continued to manhandle Cassidy with suplexes and submission holds. Cassidy eventually turned it around with a suplex of his own, but this time from the top rope. He followed that up with a diving DDT and another DDT right after, as well as three outside dives to take Moxley out. In the closing moments, Cassidy picked up the victory and retained his AEW International Championship by delivering six orange punches to Moxely followed by his beach break finisher.\n\nMJF and Samoa Joe vs. Austin and Colten Gunn (AEW Full Gear, November 18)\n\nThough an unlikely pairing, MJF and Samoa Joe took the fight to Austin and Colten Gunn (The Gunns). Early on, there were some chemistry issues, but Joe showed he was there for MJF and even took out both Gunns with an outside dive early on in the match. Once MJF was back in, the Gunns took some cheap shots and every opportunity to isolate him, but MJF eventually reversed their double-team move with a double DDT. The chemistry issues started up again, with MJF and Joe tagging each other in at inopportune moments. Joe got pinned for the 1, 2, 3, until MJF saved him and started attacking the Gunns outside the ring. The Gunns turned their attention back to the ring \u2014 where Joe was waiting for them \u2014 and used Joe\u2019s submission for the victory. Adam Cole, MJF\u2019s actual partner and fellow Ring of Honor World Tag Team Champion, made his return to stand by ringside, as he\u2019s still injured but wanted to support MJF. Joe already left the ring area after stepping in to help MJF pull off the victory. With no support, the Gunns used this as an opportunity to injure MJF with deliberate chair shots to his knee, knowing MJF had to defend his AEW World Championship later that night. AEW played the storyline well and took MJF out in an ambulance to truly sell the injury.\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner\nNovember 19, 2023 at 10:35 pm PST\n\nNo. 16 USC men\u2019s basketball took on Brown for the first time ever and got back into the win column Sunday evening at Galen Center, winning 81-70. Following a disappointing defeat to UC Irvine last Tuesday, the Trojans ended their three-game homestand on a high note against the Bears.\n\nFifth-year guard Boogie Ellis, who missed Tuesday\u2019s game due to injury, scored at all three levels for USC and had a season-high 28 points. Junior guard Kobe Johnson also missed the last game but made an immediate impact for the Trojans in the starting lineup. Johnson scored USC\u2019s first two baskets and finished with 14 points.\n\n\u201cComing into the game, I just wanted to provide anything I could for my teammates. I just wanted to come in and do what I needed to do to win,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI was ready to come play.\u201d\n\nUSC was without graduate forward DJ Rodman, and freshman guard Bronny James still remains sidelined. However, James warmed up with his teammates prior to tipoff and was dressed in basketball attire, unlike previous games.\n\nEllis erupted in the first half. His 3-point shot was a thing of beauty, as his 4-of-5 shooting from behind the arc in the first 20 minutes kept USC on the winning side of the scoreboard. Freshman guard Isaiah Collier shot 3-of-5 on 3-pointers in the first half, and he would finish with a career high of 24.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just getting back into the flow of things,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI missed one game, so I kind of felt a little bit off, but I\u2019m just glad to be back.\u201d\n\nThe Bears thrived off second-chance points in the first half, as more than a third of their points in the first frame were scored on second attempts. The Trojans\u2019 bench also struggled in the first half. While Brown had 10 points from its subs, USC went into the break with only starters sinking any shots. Johnson, Ellis and Collier scored 33 of USC\u2019s 35 first half points.\n\nThe Trojans led by as much as 15 points with 6:23 left in the half, but an offensive comeback from Brown capped off by a buzzer-beating three from senior guard Felix Kloman got the Bears within three at halftime, trailing 35-32.\n\nThe game also remained close in the second half until USC found its rhythm down the stretch. The Trojan bench added 12 points to the scoring affair and Ellis continued to stand out.\n\n\u201cWe gave (Brown) hope, and they came out and played a really competitive second half,\u201d USC head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cThey have some very good offensive players, and a couple of them got hot and were tough to stop.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s junior guard Kino Lilly Jr. led the Bears with 24 points in the game, including a clutch 3-pointer with 4:53 remaining to knot the game up at 66 apiece. Johnson would respond with a 3-pointer of his own less than a minute later for USC, and the Trojans never looked back.\n\nEllis put the nail in the coffin with a deep, shot-clock-beating 3-pointer to give USC a nine-point advantage with 29 seconds left. This was Ellis\u2019 sixth from beyond the arc of the night.\n\nOn top of Collier\u2019s career high, the freshman was very efficient, shooting 8-of-14 from the field. With recent injuries affecting lineup consistencies, the Trojans responded to the adversity with a solid, double-digit victory.\n\n\u201c(Collier) just has to keep getting better as a player defensively and offensively. He\u2019s extremely talented, but talent doesn\u2019t help your team win if it\u2019s inefficient talent, so he has to keep learning and getting better,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cI saw a lot of growth from him tonight, I thought some of that decision making was much better than it was prior.\u201d\n\nWhile the Trojans did finish with a victory, they struggled in a few aspects of the game, missing 11 free throws and turning the ball over 12 times. Nonetheless, USC still excelled from behind the arc to finish off strong.\n\n\u201cOur practices have been very inefficient for the last two weeks since we\u2019ve had all these injuries, just because we have guys playing out of position,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nNext, the Trojans will participate in the Rady Children\u2019s Invitational, starting with a matchup against Seton Hall at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday at LionTree Arena in La Jolla, California.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Justin White\nNovember 18, 2023 at 7:37 pm PST\n\nIn a season that could be titled as \u201cThe Humbling of the USC Trojans,\u201d the season finale saw USC lose in embarrassing fashion 38-20 to its rival UCLA Bruins Saturday at the Coliseum. Similar to last season\u2019s rivalry matchup, UCLA got off to a quick 14-0 lead in the first quarter, as its defense halted the Trojans in their tracks. USC failed to make it past the 50-yard line in the first quarter for the second time this season, the first being against Arizona.\n\nBut USC would place themselves back into the game soon after. On a third and 10 from the USC 26-yard line, junior quarterback Caleb Williams heaved a bomb to a heavily covered Brendan Rice, who broke free and made the catch in stride to score the Trojans\u2019 first points. This would prove to be one of the few times the USC crowd had something to cheer for.\n\nWith less than ten minutes left in the third quarter, and so close to getting a gutsy stop while backed up against its own endzone, the USC defense could not escape the demons that have plagued it for two years. The Trojans allowed a touchdown pass from junior quarterback Ethan Garbers to sophomore running back T.J. Harden, pushing the deficit to eleven.\n\nOn the first play of the ensuing USC drive, redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd \u2014 on a play that had potential to be explosive \u2014 fumbled the ball into wide-open space surrounded by nothing but baby blue. Sophomore defensive back Jaylen Davies would pick it up and score untouched, increasing the Bruin lead to 18. The deficit would remain at 18 for much of the remainder of the game before mercifully ending in a score of 38-20.\n\nLast season gave many fans, students and alumni alike reason to believe that USC would return to the top of the college football mountain in 2023. Williams was coming off a Heisman-winning season, the defense saw new additions such as Georgia defensive tackle Bear Alexander and Oklahoma State linebacker Mason Cobb, and the air around the area felt just a little different. But a devastating blowout loss to Notre Dame (in which Williams had his worst collegiate performance) slowed the train that seemed headed for Houston, and a subsequent loss to Utah completely derailed it.\n\nThe second half of the season has been tumultuous to say the least. After a strong 6-0 start, USC went 1-5 in its final six games. The Trojans also lost their ranked status for the first time in the Lincoln Riley era.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve clearly not done a good enough job in the second half of the season,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said. \u201cDidn\u2019t do a good enough job today getting our offense ready to go.\u201d\n\nRiley also spoke about the amount of close games the team has played in lately, admitting that the team was reaching its limit. \u201cDo I think we were a little bit worn down emotionally? ... I think I can look back on it and say yes.\u201d\n\nRiley said. \u201cBut the reality is you play better and you coach better, then you\u2019re not in that many [close games].\u201d\n\nOne of the team\u2019s biggest questions all season long was brought up yet again after the game: the status of Caleb Williams for next season. When asked, Riley praised the quarterback while not speculating on his future. \u201cHe\u2019s done a lot like a lot of these guys up here. He took a chance on this place and took a chance on being a part of restarting this program,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHe\u2019s a special player, special competitor, and obviously we\u2019ll see where it goes from here.\u201d\n\nThe loss is the second blowout defeat the Trojans have experienced this season. Both games were against the Trojans\u2019 bitter rivals, with the first coming against Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. The loss was the beginning of the fall of a season some previously saw ending with a new national championship trophy being added to the case in Heritage Hall. After that, a loss to Utah, an uncomfortably close win against Berkeley and three straight losses to Washington, Oregon and now UCLA have cemented a 7-5 regular season finish.\n\nRiley says he and everyone in the program knows that this is not the result that most expected when the season began. \u201cOur guys are disappointed, the coaches are disappointed, I\u2019m disappointed, our fans are disappointed, and they should be,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuses. It\u2019s below what we expect here, it\u2019s below our standard. I\u2019ve got to do a much better job.\u201d\n\nThe game was also Senior Day, with one of many seniors playing in their final game in a Trojans uniform being center Justin Dedich. Dedich has been with the program for six seasons, seeing the final few years with Clay Helton coaching the team and leading the offensive line as center for the 2023 season. \u201cIt\u2019s very emotional. It\u2019s been a long six years here. Obviously wanted a different outcome for this game, especially with my unit,\u201d a somber Dedich said. \u201cBut, I\u2019m grateful for all the times I\u2019ve had in this place, grateful to be a part of this team, part of this program. Wouldn\u2019t want it any other way. Love being a Trojan.\u201d\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Riley says he and company know that the program has plenty of room to grow while striving for a highly-coveted national championship, one that USC has been starved of since 2004. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep climbing. Everyone wants the clean, smooth road to the top, and that\u2019s for the movies,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThe road to the top is jagged. There\u2019s different twists and turns, especially coming from where this was. But we\u2019ve got to stay together as a program, we\u2019ve got to stay together as a fanbase, we\u2019ve got to stay together as a university. These are the tough times you push through for the great things on the other side.\u201d\n\nWhile USC\u2019s regular season is now over, most of the other FBS teams have one week remaining in their regular seasons.

(Photo by Amrita Sundaresan)\n\nBy Amrita Sundaresan\nNovember 18, 2023 at 11:36 am PST\n\nOn Monday, Maxine Hong Kingston, an award-winning writer best known for her book \u201cThe Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts,\u201d was joined by USC professor and author David Ulin in a conversation about her writing journey throughout the creation of her stories up until now. Kingston\u2019s books have gained popularity over the years due to her ability to blur the lines between fiction and nonfiction in her stories. In addition to this, her contemporary novels showcase the representation of the Chinese American perspective.\n\nFrom die-hard fans to new readers, Bovard Auditorium was filled with USC students, professors and others who were ready to hear Kingston\u2019s writing insights. \u201cWhat I would want is for the reader to get the same feelings or have the same vision that I have,\u201d Kingston said during the panel. \u201cTo do that in words is...it takes technical skill. When I started teaching writing, all of a sudden I understood that there\u2019s such a thing as private writing and there\u2019s public writing.\u201d\n\nKingston dug deeper into the differences between public and private writing, including how the line between the two tends to blur when it comes to herself. \u201cIn these writing classes, I know that everybody has started writing a diary at some time and I would tell them don\u2019t do diary [private] writing in this class,\u201d Kingston said. \u201cThat\u2019s something I would tell the students, but then the border is just not strict in my writing.\u201d\n\nFor Kingston, going through multiple drafts, especially for her book \u201cChina Men,\u201d a historical fiction novel about the lives of three generations of Chinese men in America, is what led her to create something different. \u201cThe way I see it is that the first draft you\u2019re laying the footprint of your building and the second draft is the next story,\u201d Kingston said. \u201cThe third draft and you go higher and higher and as you do each draft you know more, you understand more.\u201d\n\nKingston talks more about her work with \u201cChina Men,\u201d keeping the audience on their toes as she explains how everything fell into place after she went through multiple drafts. \u201cIt felt like I was hearing a symphony when \u201cChina Men\u201d came to me and I could hear the different waves of sound,\u201d Kingston said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m teaching writing students I don\u2019t want them to just sit around doing nothing and waiting for the muse. So, I tell them that everybody\u2019s got a story and all you have to do is work. Write a little bit everyday and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nAfter years of writing, Kingston has always brought up the topic of possible retirement. But every time she tries, it tends to never work out the way she planned it to. \u201cIt\u2019s all sacrifice for the writing,\u201d Kingston said. \u201cThe last few years I keep saying I\u2019m retiring now, okay no more, but it keeps coming. So, I keep announcing I\u2019m going to quit, but it won\u2019t let me go.\u201d\n\nKingston wrapped up the night with talks of her retirement and left the audience with an important piece of advice. \u201cIf we listen to other people, it makes them feel good,\u201d Kingston says. \u201cIt heals their wounds and also they tell really good stories. I think listening is a talent.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Jeremiah Estrada)\n\nBy Jeremiah Estrada\nNovember 18, 2023 at 11:22 am PST\n\nAfter a four-year hiatus since Tyler, the Creator\u2019s last festival in 2019, the long-awaited Camp Flog Gnaw returned this past weekend, Nov. 11 to 12 at Dodger Stadium. Each year, the music festival carnival notably brings together fans of Tyler in LA for two days with a lineup of artists from genres such as pop, indie, hip-hop, rock, rap, and house music. Included in the lineup of performers camping in all the fun were a few AAPI artists like Beabadoobee, Balming Tiger and Dominic Fike.\n\nFilipina singer-songwriter Beabadoobee was the first artist to take the Camp stage on the first day of the festival. CFG includes three stages named after the festival itself with Camp being the largest, Flog being the second largest and Gnaw being the smallest. Bea\u2019s discography has music from the likes of acoustic indie to alternative rock which she amplified for the crowd during her set. Fan favorite tracks included \u201cthe perfect pair\u201d and \u201cGlue Song\u201d which brought a summery atmosphere and coziness that the audience swayed to in the fall weather. Bea\u2019s supple voice echoed through the main stage as fans sang along. The Camp stage\u2019s lofty screen shone her stage name with flashes of colorful scribbled art as its backdrop. She shared how she\u2019s far from home in the UK before one of her songs but the CFG crowd helped welcome her with finger hearts and singing along to her melodies. Bea is known for her soft music but she also channeled her upbeat alternative style in songs like \u201cCologne.\u201d Fans lightly thrashed and bobbed their awe-struck heads to the chords she played on her electric guitar. The singer served the best of both worlds with her take on a laid-back and high-tempo performance well suited for a midday show.\n\nBalming Tiger in a dance formation during their song \u201cBuriburi.\u201d (Photo by Jeremiah Estrada)\n\nBalming Tiger is a musical group from South Korea that took formation at the Flog stage in the early afternoon on Saturday. The group performed a set of their hip-hop and alternative K-pop music in their matching dark gray tracksuits for an audience that instantly matched their energy. They marched to the bouncy rhythm of \u201cMoving Forward\u201d from one direction of the stage to another. Remaining in a playful but unified arrangement, the five members swung their hips side to side when they performed \u201cBuriburi.\u201d Balming Tiger chanted for the crowd to shake their booty with their arms outstretched to each end. Halfway through their set, Omega Sapien, the group\u2019s green-haired frontman, said he was happy to see many smiling faces. He followed this gratitude by welcoming everyone at CFG to \u201cK-pop from the dark side.\u201d Balming Tiger continued their hybrid rap sound with the deep synth beat of \u201cSEXY NUKIM\u201d and the upbeat, body-rocking intensity of \u201cPOP THE TAG.\u201d Their hypnotizing digital visuals heightened the sensation already felt from the group\u2019s vocals and funky beats.\n\nDominic Fike singing out to the crowd with his electric guitar in hand. (Photo by Jeremiah Estrada)\n\nDominic Fike is an alternative/indie singer of African American, Filipino and Haitian descent who performed on Sunday, the festival\u2019s second day. He entered the Camp stage to an audience that whooed and roared as he started his set with \u201cHow Much Is Weed?\u201d The uproar continued in songs like \u201cAnt Pile\u201d where he strummed his electric guitar and filled the audience with serotonin with his velvety vocals. He shared how he felt nervous but that it\u2019s also good to get that feeling with how it\u2019s a notion to him that his life is about to drastically change. Although he got to perform on the main stage that evening, he questioned why he wasn\u2019t the main headliner of the night. Nonetheless, he thanked Tyler for the festival and shared how he has performed at CFG before. Next to Fike on stage, he had a large road sign illuminating different messages in orange text. Phrases included \u201cWORDS MEAN THINGS,\u201d \u201cNEXT STEPS,\u201d and \u201cMORE OR LESS.\u201d His sign was just one part of the all-around warm hues in his performance. The screen behind him and his band beamed orange and red colors as smoke spread around the stage. Fike incited the crowd to join him in a fan-favorite song \u201cPhone Numbers\u201d that he described has more rap to it before he turned the microphone on his stand toward the fans. His prideful set went on with more thrashing, lulling and everything in between to at one point when he even hopped off stage near the barricade.\n\nFestival guests turned happy campers left Camp Flog Gnaw pleased from all the music that brought the community together. The festival gave a platform and stage to these AAPI artists to perform for their beloved fans with striking passion. The lineup also included many artists of color such as WILLOW, Kali Uchis, SZA, Cuco, Kendrick Lamar and more who were devoted to sharing their music and connecting with fans as well.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/11/17/saturday-eve-week-12/", "response": "```\nThe Talk of Troy Saturday eve, Week 12\n\nWith five undefeated playoff contenders remaining, the college football playoff race is heating up heading into the final two weeks of the regular season.\n\nOnce again, it\u2019s that time of the week. We\u2019ve almost made it to thanksgiving, and with final playoff rankings just a few weeks away, the race for the top four is beginning to take shape. At the top of the pack lie five undefeated teams that can all win out and guarantee a CFP bid. Below them is a pool of one-loss teams that, after the next few weeks\u2019 games, will be very difficult to separate. Stay tuned for a full rundown of what\u2019s to come in the rankings. Happy Saturday eve.\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK \u2014 No. 5 Washington (10-0) vs. No. 11 Oregon State (8-2)\n\nCorvallis, Ore. 4:30 p.m. PST on ABC\n\nOregon State has the second-highest remaining strength of schedule of any team in the country, according to ESPN\u2019s football power index. With it comes the chance to knock off two playoff contenders that both played roles in dissolving their conference and end the year with a top-ten CFP ranking for the first time in program history.\n\nWashington is the slight favorite in this one, but the Huskies have been struggling as of late. The high flying offense is still there \u2014 quarterback Michael Penix Jr. still leads the country in passing, and Washington has scored 35 or more in four of their last five contests. But against No. 6 Oregon, Stanford, USC and No. 18 Utah, the Huskies gave up four or more touchdowns and won close games that were still up for grabs late. For a while now, they\u2019ve looked one mistake or stroke of bad luck away from their first loss, starting from their victory over Oregon that only came due to a shanked field goal by the Ducks on the game\u2019s final play.\n\nOregon State has been up and down all year in the passing game, their opponent\u2019s biggest strength. The offensive production has been inconsistent, with quarterback D.J. Uiagalelei struggling to find a groove in the Beavers passing game. His 2,254 yards with 20 touchdowns and four interceptions are respectable, but the efficiency isn\u2019t there at 58.6% completion. Meanwhile, the defense has had its flashes, but overall ranks in the bottom half of FBS units against the pass, allowing 230.5 yards per game.\n\nOregon State\u2019s strength is the run. They\u2019re a statistical top-20 rushing offense in the country with an average of 196.9 yards per game on the ground and 24 rushing touchdowns this season. Sophomore back Damien Martinez is having a banner year, logging his fifth 100+ yard outing this season last week with four touchdowns against Stanford. Deshaun Fenwick makes for a nice 1-2 punch from the running back room, and Uiagalelei has added six scores on the ground as well.\n\nWashington gives up just over 140 rushing yards per game, and haven\u2019t faced many strong rushing offenses this year. The last time they did saw Oregon rush for 204 yards and two touchdowns as a team. The Beavers need to grind out the clock in this one, using their efficient rushing offense to slowly move downfield and eat up time to keep the ball out of Penix\u2019s hands. If the running game looks as good as it has all year, they just may have a chance to hang with one of the best teams in the country in what will surely be an entertaining matchup crucial to final CFP rankings.\n\nWinning out guarantees Washington a playoff spot, as No. 2 Ohio State and No. 3 Michigan play each other next week, and the loser will slip to No. 5 behind the remaining undefeated squads. An Oregon State victory, however, would raise all sorts of interesting questions \u2014 does Washington stay at No. 5, going from the lowest-ranked undefeated squad to the highest-ranked one-loss group? Or do they slip lower, beneath other one-loss squads like Texas and Alabama? And if Washington isn\u2019t the only team to be upset in the coming weeks, do they have the resume to earn a playoff spot from a wider pool of one-loss teams?\n\nWhile the CFP rankings are far from final, the first piece of the puzzle will fall into place with the result of this primetime matchup.\n\nUPSET ALERT \u2014 No. 17 North Carolina (8-2) vs. Clemson (6-4)\n\nClemson, S.C. 12:30 p.m. PST on ESPN\n\nThe CFP committee may think UNC is the favorite in this game, but Vegas, along with myself, sees it differently. Clemson are 7.5-point favorites in their final home game of the season, where head coach Dabo Swinney and the Tigers have the chance to make a statement in a season many have been ready to write off as wasted for some time now.\n\nDespite their record, Clemson still ranks as a top five defensive unit in the nation. Their 5.35 yards allowed per passing attempt ranks third in FBS. Yes, UNC boasts an elite offense, especially through the air, but they haven\u2019t played a unit remotely this skilled all year. The Tigers allow just 162.5 yards per game through the air, and have given up only 10 passing touchdowns in as many games.\n\nClemson will definitely slow down the Tar Heels\u2019 offense more effectively than most other units have this season, but the question of whether they can pull out a win lies on the offense. Once Swinney admitted quarterback Cade Klubnik kept the ball on a called handoff to lose against Miami in 2OT last month, it seemed as if most of the confidence had been sucked out of the Tigers\u2019 offense. After losing to N.C. State the next week, the Tigers upset Notre Dame in a contest carried by running back Phil Mafah\u2019s 186-yard performance \u2014 Klubnik completed just 50% of his passes for 109 yards, a score and an interception.\n\nKlubnik\u2019s next game against Georgia Tech last week was stronger, as he threw for 205 yards and four touchdowns with one interception. But the point is, Clemson\u2019s offense isn\u2019t so hot. But as they proved against Notre Dame, a crippling defense and skilled running back can often be enough to win, and I think it will be for Clemson against a North Carolina team that has been unraveling ever since Virginia ruined their perfect season a month ago.\n\nPLAYOFF WATCH\n\nAs we move closer to conference championship week (and therefore final CFP rankings), I\u2019ve decided to replace the \u201con the rise\u201d and \u201csomething to prove\u201d sections of my column with updates on all teams still in the hunt for a spot in the top four. I\u2019ll take a look at any potential playoff teams not mentioned elsewhere in the column, including their game this weekend, and what needs to happen for them to keep/gain a coveted slot in the playoffs.\n\nUNDEFEATED: No. 1 Georgia (10-0), No. 2 Ohio State (10-0), No. 3 Michigan (10-0), No. 4 Florida State (10-0)\n\nThe top four teams in the poll are unlikely to change this weekend. The defending national champion Georgia Bulldogs put up a dominant 52-17 win against the then-No. 9 Ole Miss Rebels last week, cake-walking through the game that was supposed to be the biggest test of their season. They\u2019ll travel to play a No. 18 Tennessee team that is reeling from a 36-7 road loss to No. 9 Missouri. It\u2019s hard to imagine them not remaining No. 1 with a win of any margin, as they\u2019re the only currently-slotted playoff team with a ranked opponent this weekend.\n\nOhio State, Michigan and Florida State will play manageable unranked opponents in Minnesota, Maryland and North Alabama, respectively. While a big win would be unlikely to vault any of these teams to No. 1, one could cause a rearrangement at the No. 2, 3 and 4 spots. Given that Georgia took the No. 1 spot from Ohio State on a week where both teams won simply because the Bulldogs played a beat a higher ranked opponent by more points, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Ohio State and Michigan swap spots if the Wolverines destroy Maryland and Ohio State barely defeats Minnesota. But the two rivals will play each other in their final regular season game next week, so their relative positions won\u2019t matter much before next Saturday. That game will surely shake up the top four, as the winner becomes a lock for No. 1 while the loser will almost certainly slip to No. 5 behind Georgia, Florida State and Washington, provided the three are still undefeated.\n\nON THE EDGE: No. 6 Oregon (9-1)\n\nOregon\u2019s most important games are yet to come. For now, the Ducks just need what should be an easy road win over a 3-7 Arizona State. But next week, they\u2019ll face Oregon State in the final episode of the classic Civil War before the PAC-12\u2032s imminent dissolution next season. Anyone who\u2019s been to a game at either of these two schools knows that Eugene and Corvallis are electric environments, and the home team has won this rivalry game for the last four years in a row.\n\nThe Ducks have home-field advantage in this one, but Oregon State may be out for blood after watching Oregon play a major role in the destruction of their conference right as the program started to improve. Another ranked win will bode well for the Ducks\u2019 resume were they to find themselves on the edge for a final CFP spot. After a win against the Beavers, they\u2019ll need to win the PAC-12 title for a real shot at the playoff. In all likelihood, that means playing No. 5 Washington again. The Huskies *squeezed* out the victory over Oregon earlier this year, narrowly avoiding overtime after a missed game-tying field goal by the Ducks. That was at home, and the PAC-12 championship will be in neutral Las Vegas. The further trip for Huskie fans will likely give the Ducks a slight crowd advantage, and everyone who has ever played football knows it\u2019s extremely hard to beat the same team twice in a season \u2014 I think the Ducks just might have what it takes to make the CFP if they find themselves playing in Vegas on Dec. 1.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine the committee putting a one-loss, non-conference champion Ohio State or Michigan in the playoff over a one-loss PAC-12 champion Oregon, especially considering they will have defeated Washington, a strong ranked win against the only team that beat them. Even though they\u2019re out of the top four for now, it seems like the Ducks still control their own destiny if they win out.\n\nSTILL IN THE HUNT: No. 7 Texas (9-1), No. 8 Alabama (9-1)\n\nTexas is another team in good position to sneak their way into the top four over the next few weeks, but unlike Oregon, the Longhorns need a bit more than just wins in the remainder of their games \u2014 they\u2019ll be rooting for other teams to shake the rankings up a bit as well. Texas will need three teams currently ranked in the top four to fall to No. 5 or lower, meaning they\u2019ll need some upsets come conference championship week.\n\nAn ideal situation for Texas involves Oregon State pulling an upset on No. 5 Washington this weekend. If that happens, but Washington can beat Oregon for a second time in the PAC-12 title game, then the Huskies and Ducks are both likely out of contention. This could carve a path for Texas to sneak in at No. 4, as with only three undefeated teams remaining (Georgia, Ohio State/Michigan and FSU), Texas and Washington would be the only one-loss conference champions, leaving it up to the committee to decide whose resume is more impressive.\n\nFor a more certain path, the Longhorns would also need either FSU or Georgia to lose their respective conference title matchups. FSU would surely slide a good ways from No. 4 with a loss in their conference title game \u2014 Alabama, the loser of Ohio State/Michigan, and even a one-loss Washington or Oregon team would all likely be ranked above a one-loss Florida State squad.\n\nTurning to Alabama is where things get interesting. Realistically, at this point the Tide look like the lowest-ranked team with any shot at the CFP, and that\u2019s only because they have a shot to knock off the top dog in No. 1 Georgia in just a few weeks. With no other ranked opponents left on their schedule (Alabama will play Chattanooga tomorrow, and Auburn next week), the Tide\u2019s whole season rests on the SEC Championship. A win in that game would indisputably make them the top one-loss team in the poll, and possibly even give them the momentum needed to leapfrog an undefeated group. With Ohio State and Michigan facing off soon, the number of undefeated contenders will drop from five to four. If the Tide can knock off Georgia, and any other undefeated squad loses, Alabama is a lock for a playoff bid.\n```"}

(AP/Michael Ainsworth)\n\nBy Adam Bradford November 17, 2023 at 11:05 pm PST\n\nIf being a new dad wasn\u2019t already keeping Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay up at night, then his team\u2019s three-game losing streak certainly is. Having not won a game in over a month, McVay and the Rams will look to get back in the win column when they return to SoFi Stadium on Sunday afternoon to host the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nLast week, the Rams enjoyed a much-needed bye week after the consecutive defeats, two of which came on the road in embarrassing fashion. Two weeks prior to the bye, the Dallas Cowboys blew out Los Angeles in Arlington by a score of 43-20. Quarterback Dak Prescott tore up the Rams\u2019 secondary, completing 25 of his 31 pass attempts for 304 yards and four touchdowns with an interception.\n\nThe following week, Los Angeles mustered under 200 yards of total offense in a 20-3 defeat at the hands of the Packers in Green Bay. Backup quarterback Brett Rypien started in place of an injured Matthew Stafford, who was dealing with a thumb issue, and struggled mightily. Rypien completed just 13 of his 28 pass attempts for 130 yards, no touchdowns and an interception.\n\nFortunately for the Rams, Stafford was able to get healthy during the bye week. The veteran quarterback was a full participant in practice this week and is expected to start on Sunday. Earlier this week, Rams head coach Sean McVay called his team \u201cas healthy as we\u2019ve been since the start of the season.\u201d\n\nHowever, Stafford\u2019s return alone will not be enough to propel the Rams to a victory, as they face a Seahawks team sitting at 6-3 and quietly in the midst of the NFC playoff picture. Seattle has won three of its past four, including last week\u2019s victory sealed by a walk-off field goal against the Washington Commanders. That result left Seattle tied with the San Francisco 49ers for first place in the NFC West.\n\nWhile Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith isn\u2019t quite matching the Pro Bowl numbers that he put up last year, the journeyman is enjoying another solid season in Seattle. Through nine games, Smith has completed 65.3% of his passes for 2,171 yards, 11 touchdowns and seven interceptions.\n\nThe Rams, on the other hand, are currently 3-6 and largely an afterthought as far as the playoffs go. If Los Angeles wants to have any shot of turning things around and making a postseason push, this weekend is effectively a must-win.\n\nIn order for the Rams to do so, they must figure out how to get their offense rolling. Despite having a veteran quarterback in Stafford, one of the best wide receiver duos in the league in Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua and an emerging young running back in Kyren Williams, Los Angeles has scored more than 20 points in just four of its nine games this season.\n\nKickoff between the Rams and the Seahawks on Sunday is set for 1:25 PM PST. The game will be televised by CBS.\n```"}

They\u2019ve been linked to the Bulls\u2019 top two stars who both played college ball in Los Angeles: former UCLA guard Zach LaVine and Compton\u2019s own Demar DeRozan, who stayed home with USC. However enticing those options seem, the Lakers shouldn\u2019t bite. Instead, they should pursue someone with whom they\u2019re already familiar.\n\nThe Lakers let guard Alex Caruso walk in free agency two years ago after he signed a four-year, $37 million contract in Chicago, but could use him again now. During his four seasons in L.A., Caruso became a fan favorite who played his heart out every night. He routinely showcased athleticism with incredible steals and highlight-reel dunks and the Lakers haven\u2019t been able to replace his tenacity since. Bringing him back would right a wrong.\n\nThe Lakers currently lack perimeter defense. Guards Austin Reaves and D\u2019Angelo Russell are solid defenders, but they can\u2019t match Caruso\u2019s level and it showed when they couldn\u2019t contain Jamal Murray in the Western Conference Finals last season. Caruso has averaged 1.4 steals per game to go with 60.8% shooting from the field. His numbers don\u2019t jump out, but they never have. Caruso\u2019s game is all about affecting play outside of the statsheet.\n\nWhen he played for the Lakers, he complimented the starting lineup\u2019s game with his ability to stretch the floor and help on defense. If the Lakers were able to nab Caruso, he would be on a super team-friendly contract, only costing them $3 million this season and $9 million in total compared to the gaudy contracts of LaVine and DeRozan. LaVine\u2019s contract would be a lot for the Lakers at $40 million but they would have to give a lot of key players and picks to the Bulls in return. DeRozan would be a much more realistic option at around $28 million on an expiring contract, which would cost the Lakers less in trade assets too. Plus, DeRozan has stated before that he would want to play for his hometown team.\n\nThe Lakers have tried to bring in a third star multiple times during the past decade, like Russell Westbrook and Steve Nash, but those teams didn\u2019t live up to expectations. The Lakers performed much better last season after they discarded Westbrook, going on a run to the Western Conference Finals. Except for the Showtime era, the Lakers have always been known for having a dominant duo plus a third great scoring option, like the teams of Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Derek Fisher. Kobe and Pau Gasol\u2019s teams had Lamar Odom and Metta World Peace. In the latest iteration, it seems like Russell can take the title of that third option. He and guard Cam Reddish are finding their stride in the starting lineup, as is Reaves coming off the bench.\n\nIt would be foolish for the Lakers to go after another star. Trading for Alex Caruso and bringing him back to Los Angeles would make so much sense for both sides, especially for the Lakers, who could use that spark plug on defense. The Lakers should let the chemistry between this team develop. Adding a player like Caruso, who some of the team have already played with, would help grow that connection. and should push the Lakers to the Western Conference Finals again.\n```"}

After a dominant performance against Grand Canyon last Friday at home, the No. 8 seed Trojans traveled to Provo, Utah, for their second-round NCAA tournament game against the top-seeded BYU Cougars.\n\nThe game kicked off with a clear sky, but the wet field conditions posed a challenge for both teams, as the ball\u2019s trajectory appeared erratic at times when it made contact with the grass. Both teams showcased their offensive talents right from the opening whistle. The Trojans stood in a 4-3-3 formation while the Cougars went with a classic 4-4-2.\n\nIn a fast-paced fashion, the first 45 minutes proved to be an evenly-matched offensive showdown. Both teams racked up eight total shots and four shots on goal from opposite ends of the field. The Trojans effectively prevented their opponents from entering the 18-yard box in the first half, keeping the opponents at bay and successfully deflecting most of the crossing attempts.\n\nThe most threatening shot attempt for USC in the first half came 41 minutes into the game, when junior midfielder Helena Sampaio found a clear path towards the net, but the shot was caught by BYU\u2019s freshman goalkeeper Lynette Hernaez on the left side.\n\nBYU intensified its offensive efforts in the second half, launching a shot attempt just 24 seconds after the whistle. The Cougars also maintained greater possession of the ball and kept USC to zero shot attempts in the first 23 minutes of the period.\n\nThe Cougars continued their strategy from the first half, spreading Trojan defenders across the field as they organized attacks using crosses from the sidelines. The only goal of this game happened in the 57th minute. A cross from BYU senior defender Kendell Petersen went long to senior forward Brecken Mozingo, who then found senior midfielder Bella Folino inside USC\u2019s box area. Folino, who was in between two USC defenders, sunk a shot past sophomore goalkeeper Hannah Dickinson into the top right corner of the goal. Folino has scored a total of seven goals for the Cougars this season.\n\nAlthough momentum swung the other way, the Trojans kept their composure. Attacks were organized in the midfield, and the ball was finding its way to the Cougars\u2019 half. Despite shooting eight times in the remaining 30 minutes, USC fell victim to the clock, unable to find an equalizer.\n\nIn the closing seconds of the match, junior midfielder Aaliyah Farmer let loose a powerful shot that narrowly sailed over the crossbar, missing the net by a narrow margin.\n\nThe Trojans gave their all in the game, with six players playing the entire 90 minutes. Sampaio, freshman forward Maribel Flores and junior forward Simone Jackson combined for a total of nine shot attempts.\n\nCapping off their 10th consecutive postseason appearance, USC women\u2019s soccer ended their season 11-5-3, ranking third in the Pac-12 and No. 22 overall in the latest NCAA poll. This was the team\u2019s first second round appearance under head coach Jane Alukonis, and USC will look to next season to advance further.\n```"}

Expand The Trojans clash with the Bruins at the Coliseum this Saturday in their final meeting as members of the Pac-12 Conference. (Photo by Sarah Ko)  By   Kasey Kazliner November 17, 2023 at  4:47 pm PST\n\nFor some, it\u2019s just a game. For others, it\u2019s a tradition like nothing else. USC versus UCLA; Trojans versus Bruins; south L.A. versus west L.A.; private versus public. The annual matchup is tailor-made for storylines and heated competition. The rivalry dates back to 1929, and even though conference realignment has moved both teams in the past, the tradition has always remained constant. With both schools set to join the Big Ten Conference next season, Saturday\u2019s contest will be the final time the Trojans (7-4 overall, 5-3 Pac-12) and Bruins (6-4, 3-4) square off as members of the Pac-12.\n\nJust two weeks ago, both USC and UCLA were ranked and only had two losses each. However, both teams\u2019 seasons were derailed after USC fell to conference powerhouses Washington and Oregon, while UCLA dropped games against both Arizona schools. While the Trojans and Bruins certainly would have liked to have been playing for something more, the rivalry tradition trumps the \u201cno real stakes\u201d narrative.\n\nOn the field, UCLA and USC are polar opposites. While the Trojans struggle to contain opponents from scoring at will, the Bruins have trouble finding the endzone. The Bruins were without junior quarterback Ethan Garbers last week against the Sun Devils and their offense looked lifeless, putting up just one touchdown. According to  ESPN , Garbers should be set to return this weekend, which could spark UCLA\u2019s offense. UCLA\u2019s defense has been led by senior defensive lineman Laiatu Latu, who leads the team in sacks with 11. The Bruins have only allowed 16.4 points per game, which leads the Pac-12 and is ninth in the country. However, their measly 26.4 points scored per game has been indicative of their offensive struggles, something the Trojans must take advantage of to win.\n\nEven with four losses, the Trojans\u2019 offense is elite. USC averages 43.8 points per game and even gave defensive power Oregon a run for its money last week, putting up 27 against the Ducks. The Trojan defense, though, gives up 34.6 points per game, which puts pressure on the offense to score more than it might have to.\n\nUCLA head coach Chip Kelly is on the hot seat. Despite signing a contract extension in March that secured him through 2027,  247Sports  reports that Kelly could very well be let go after Saturday\u2019s game. Junior quarterback Caleb Williams could be playing in his final ever college game if he chooses to declare for the NFL Draft after this season and opt out of USC\u2019s bowl game. Saturday will be his 22nd birthday, and he\u2019ll be tested by the Bruins\u2019 stout defense. Williams led the then-No. 12 Trojans over the then-No. 21 Bruins last season in a high scoring 48-45 affair, so expect him to give it his all to repeat last year\u2019s result.\n\nWhile both teams will depart the Pac-12 for the Big Ten next season, the nearly century-old tradition will always live on. While rosters and coaches change as the years go by, the colorful, red and blue battle at either the Rose Bowl or Coliseum always remains intact. The Trojans and Bruins will clash at the Coliseum Saturday at 12:30 p.m.\n```"}

Photo by: Annie Wei\n\nBy Veronica Garza, Jack Smith and Alea Motwane November 17, 2023 at 3:16 pm PST\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, hospital leaders said Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital (MLKCH) may run out of money to pay for bills as soon as 2024. The alternative healthcare option available is St. Francis Medical Center (SFMC) in Lynwood. MLKCH is a non-profit organization that was set to replace the closed King/Drew Medical Center which closed in 2007 after reports of medical failures and mistreatment.\n\nAccording to the L.A. Times, the hospital currently has a budget of $375 million, half of which is funded by billing from Medi-Cal and other payers, such as commercial health insurance plans, for its services. One of the main reasons that MLKCH is closing is that it has had to endure four times the demand as expected, even though the Medi-Cal program does not fully cover the cost of emergency services. Also in the Times report, hospital officials stated MLKCH was expected to handle 25,000 emergency department visits a year. However, last year, the 29 rooms tallied more than 100,000 visits \u2013 four times what they projected.\n\nSome patients, like 20-year-old California State University, Los Angeles student and South L.A. resident Marina Gomez, are unsatisfied with the care provided by MLKCH. Gomez first visited MLKCH\u2019s emergency department after she fractured her ankle while dancing when she was 14 years old. Both of Gomez\u2019s parents are deaf, which she said the hospital did not accommodate during her visit.\n\n\u201cI was translating and they didn\u2019t give me enough time to translate. I was very annoyed, I know there\u2019s a lot of people out here, but right now your focus should be on me, the patient, instead of being angry because I can\u2019t translate fast enough,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nGomez visited the hospital again on November 8 when she obtained a concussion after falling down the stairs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one that\u2019s in pretty bad shape and they\u2019re worried about the communication with my guardian and like, I\u2019m fully conscious,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nWhen asked how she would feel about going to the SFMC, Gomez was not enthused.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s private owned, that already sounds like a big expense to my wallet ... if I had to choose I wouldn\u2019t do that. It would not be my first option,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nIn a statement to Annenberg Media, SFMC stated the issues facing MLKCH are \u201cindicative of the growing challenges in the healthcare industry as a whole, and the unique challenges we face in the South and Southeast Los Angeles area,\u201d and that they are \u201ccommitted to preserving access to healthcare for the communities we serve, to maintaining high standards of quality care, and to ensuring the long-term viability and vitality of the core services we provide to our community.\u201d\n\nThe statement mentioned that SFMC was one of the \u201clargest and busiest private Emergency Departments/Trauma Centers in L.A.

Times article and the possibility of running out of funding.\n\n\u201cWe need everyone who cares about South L.A. to work together to ensure that MLKCH can continue to serve our wonderful community. That means redefining a funding model to account for the increasing demand for our services, soaring costs, workforce shortages, and more.

Gov. Gavin Newsom takes action to teach young students the harmful spread of misinformation and its effects.\n\nMany student-athletes at USC use social media to network and build a personal brand. (Photo courtesy of dole777 on Unsplash)\n\nBy Katherine Havens and Yana Savitsky\nNovember 17, 2023 at 3:11 pm PST\n\nAssembly Bill No. 873, set to take effect at the start of the next academic year, will enforce the teaching of media literacy across K-12 schools in California. With the rise of social media and subsequent \u201cfake news\u201d consumed by the public, the bill aims to educate young students on the importance of critical thinking regarding news, media and other digital evaluation skills. The bill, originally introduced by assemblymember Marc Berman, was signed into law by Governor Newsom in October.\n\nApart from teaching media literacy on its own, it will also be incorporated into existing English, science, math, and history curricula, according to KTLA. With the rise of social media blurring the line between fact and fiction, the coursework adjusted due to this bill may allow students to become more informed consumers of news. Schools in California will teach students how to critically analyze the content they absorb from various digital sources, which is a skill they will carry with them in the real world.\n\n\u201cThe growing ubiquity of new forms of media necessitates the need for comprehensive media literacy education for all elementary and secondary pupils,\u201d states section one of the published Bill Text. While the bill was only recently passed, the need for a comprehensive media literacy curriculum has been a topic of interest for many years according to a 2019 Stanford University study referenced in the Bill Text.\n\n\u201c82 percent of middle school pupils struggled to distinguish advertisements from news stories,\u201d reports the study. In conjunction with this statistic, many other researchers from past studies showed the lack of verifying credibility in news sources that middle and high school students held. The Stanford University researchers mention another study performed by the Stanford History Education Group in 2016, which showed that \u201cyoung people lacked basic skills of digital evaluation. Since then, a whole host of efforts\u2014including legislative initiatives in 18 states\u2014have sought to address this problem.\u201d\n\nFake news and disinformation are constantly circulated throughout the Internet, which are only amplified by the presence of global, newsworthy events. In the past few weeks, misinformation regarding the Israel-Hamas war has been identified on a multitude of social media platforms. False information has been disseminated in the form of misinterpreted videos and photos as well as explicitly fabricated news. From altered images to outdated, out-of-context footage, it is becoming more and more difficult to trust the validity of sources on Instagram, TikTok and X, formerly Twitter, where users spread disinformation according to an article by Boston University.\n\nAdditionally, the problem escalates when content creators of these platforms share and repost these false stories. \u201cOne of the dangers here is that disinformation doesn\u2019t just get you to believe a false thing is true; it also gets you to believe a true thing is false. That\u2019s the poison that disinformation puts in the atmosphere,\u201d said Lee McIntyre, a research fellow at Boston University\u2019s Center for Philosophy & History of Science in an article by Boston University about misinformation and disinformation surrounding the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe epidemic of false news has been an ongoing issue, and will only continue to define younger generations as social media usage increases. With this bill, California aims to spearhead critical media literacy education regarding fake news. \u201cThe spread of disinformation on social media is not something new. Last year, shortly after the insurrection of the capitol building in Washington D.C., the LAUSD Board of Education recognized this as a key issue,\u201d said Los Angeles Unified School District administrators in an LAUSD article.\n\nMcIntyre encourages social media consumers to think critically about the content they consume and seek out credible sources. But, with more legislative action and education \u2014 the problem of misinformation can be combated. \u201c[The] primary way to fight back is to expose [something as] disinformation. As I often say, \u2018You cannot win a disinformation war unless you realize you\u2019re in one\u2019,\u201d said McIntyre.\n```"}

E-Conquest, which saw USC\u2019s Esports teams face off versus UCLA, was another one of Conquest Week\u2019s engaging events for student life. Avid fans were able to see the rival schools go head-to-head on their favorite games including Valorant, League of Legends, Overwatch 2, Rocket League, Super Smash Bros, and Hearthstone.\n\nThe evening started strong for UCLA as their Rocket League team was able to take down the Trojans in a demonstrative 3-1 victory on Stage 2 (1-3, 0-2, 2-1, 1-3). The newer USC squad was unable to figure out how to beat the calculated gameplay from a more seasoned Bruins team, despite a promising showing from USC\u2019s Vitor \u00ab VTR \u00bb Salom\u00e3o \u00bb which allowed the Cardinal and Gold to take a game.\n\nWhile UCLA rejoiced over their first victory, Stage 1 was hosting the most intense match of the event. UCLA and USC Valorant teams clashed in a tight 3-game series, with Game 1 going the Bruins\u2019 way after a difficult OverTime 14-16 win. Games 2 and 3 then played out in USC\u2019s favor with an assertive 13-6 scoreline to tie it up and a close yet confident 13-11 from our Trojans to end the series.\n\nThis nail-biter of a match then gave way to a dominant 2-0 victory for our Trojan Hearthstone team. The Bruins focused on board-development-heavy gameplay with a defensive Paladin deck. USC\u2019s aggressive Warrior and Paladin decks were able to overpower the UCLA tactician. Luck was on the side of the Cardinal and Gold as a clutch \u00ab Tomb Traitor \u00bb card cleared a full opposing board in Game 1, and an \u00ab Ignis, the Eternal Flame \u00bb lucky draw led to a weapon that was strong enough to end Game 2 early on.\n\nThe fun did not end there for the Trojans as the League of Legends team also dominated their Bruin counterparts in a 2-0 series. Despite some parts of the games being close, USC was able to rely on its star AD Carry Joseph \u00ab Levitate \u00bb Hong to carry teamfights and close out the games in style. His Xayah and Aphelios picks reigned supreme versus a UCLA team that had a hard time locking him down.\n\nThe night intensified when UCLA\u2019s Super Smash Bros team took their Trojan counterparts to a tiebreaker, which led the Cardinal and Gold to a 2-1 hard-earned victory. The competition format was a 5v5 \u00ab Crew Battle. \u00bb This format is historically associated with and almost unique to Super Smash Bros. It consists of a series of 1v1s where the winner stays on and the losing team has to keep sending players until they knock out the winner. The first team to knock out all the opposing team\u2019s players wins.\n\nThe first Crew Battle started with USC at a deficit, but the Trojans were able to claw their way back and win by a single stock. Crew Battle number 2 started similarly but this time UCLA kept it together just enough to clutch the victory. The tie-breaker was a more casual 4v4 Random Characters match which USC won.\n\nOverwatch 2 was the final game to close out the night, and a final breath of victory for UCLA who were able to end on a 2-0 win from their team. Despite the Trojans fighting hard and pushing games into overtime, the Bruins\u2019 superior tactical execution was the ultimate decider for the series.\n\nUSC Esports as a whole beat the Bruins in a solid 4-2 victory at this year\u2019s E-Conquest, with a lot of star players popping off on both sides.

Neither offense particularly lit up the box score in this contest. Seminoles quarterback Jordan Travis was efficient enough, completing 19 of his 31 pass attempts for 265 yards and a touchdown. Running back Trey Benson led Florida State\u2019s rushing attack with 80 yards and two touchdowns on 16 carries, while receiver Johnny Wilson led the team with 82 receiving yards. This marked the second straight outing in which the Seminoles were unable to eclipse 30 points, a mark they met consistently in prior weeks. Miami\u2019s inconsistent play at quarterback continued, as two quarterbacks saw action in this game. Freshman quarterback Emory Williams started the game, but struggled, completing just 8 of his 23 pass attempts for 175 yards and two touchdowns. Williams suffered a season-ending arm injury in the fourth quarter, making way for former starter Tyler Van Dyke to take over during a potential game-tying drive. Van Dyke was not much better, throwing an interception on his seventh pass attempt. In spite of inconsistent pass play, receiver Jacolby George managed to haul in five receptions for 153 yards and two touchdowns. Florida State (10-0) survived a close contest, and remains ranked No. 4 in the College Football Playoff rankings. Miami (6-4) is unranked.\n\nMichigan tops Penn State in sloppy game at Happy Valley, 24-15\nThe absence of coach Jim Harbaugh proved to be no issue for the Wolverines. Running back Blake Corum led the way for Michigan, totaling 145 yards and two touchdowns on 26 carries. In light of Corum\u2019s big day, quarterback J.J. McCarthy did not have to do much. McCarthy completed 7 of his meager 8 pass attempts for 60 yards \u2014 an efficient showing in a winning effort that saw not a single passing play called in the second half. While the run game was enough to put the Wolverines over the edge, the 24-point showing marked their lowest total of the season. The Nittany Lions put forth a stagnant home performance in this affair, scoring their lone touchdown with just under two minutes left to play. Quarterback Drew Allar completed 10 of his 22 pass attempts for just 70 yards and a touchdown, but did not have a similarly successful rushing attack to lean on. Running back Kaytron Allen led the team with 72 yards. Michigan (10-0) remains ranked No. 3 in the CFP rankings, while Penn State (8-2) dropped two spots to No. 12.\n\nTexas Tech shocks Kansas on road, 16-13\nHeading into the fourth quarter up 13-0 with no signs of life coming from the Jayhawk sideline, the Red Raiders looked to be in great shape to secure an upset. However, Kansas would put together three scoring drives in the final 15 minutes, tying up the game in a shocking turn of events. In the end, Texas Tech was able to walk off the game with a 30-yard field goal. Texas Tech scored a touchdown on their first drive, but failed to find the endzone for the rest of the game. Despite an overall lackluster day, the Red Raiders did find some success on the ground. Running back Tahj Brooks had 33 carries for 133 yards and a touchdown, while the same success was not replicated through the air. Quarterback Behren Morton completed 19 of his 25 pass attempts for 176 yards and an interception. Receiver Jerand Bradley led the team with 91 yards on four receptions. Kansas also turned to their run game on a down day for the passing offense. Running back Devin Neal had 137 yards on 19 carries, including the Jayhawks\u2019 lone touchdown from 60 yards. Quarterback Cole Ballard could not get anything going in front of his home fans, throwing for 124 yards and a pick while completing just 45% of his pass attempts. Kansas (7-3) fell nine spots to No. 25 in the rankings. Texas Tech (5-5) remains unranked after its upset win.\n\nArizona stays hot, beats Colorado, 34-31\nIt took a last-second, go-ahead field goal, but the Wildcats are now winners of four straight games after a mediocre 3-3 start. Arizona\u2019s offense found success both on the ground and through the air. Quarterback Noah Fifita was sharp, completing 21 of his 35 pass attempts for 214 yards and two touchdowns. His favorite target, receiver Tetairoa McMillan, caught nine of those passes for 107 yards and a score. Running back Jonah Coleman had himself a day too, rushing for 179 yards on just 11 attempts. The Buffaloes\u2019 star-studded offense also produced, but struggled to find success on the ground. Quarterback Shedeur Sanders completed 22 of his 35 pass attempts for 262 yards and two touchdowns. Sanders led the team in rushing with 29 yards, adding a rushing touchdown to his totals. Receiver Xavier Weaver led Colorado\u2019s offense in receiving yards with 84. A relatively clean back-and-forth contest through three quarters saw the Buffs up by seven heading into the fourth. Fifita and the offense, accompanied by some key defensive stops, were able to put together two scoring drives to tie, then win, the game. The favored Wildcats narrowly avoided a road upset and continued their surprising hot streak. Arizona (7-3) moved up four spots to No. 17 in the rankings. Colorado (4-6) remains unranked.\n\nWashington overcomes halftime deficit, defeats Utah, 35-28\nDown 28-24 at home heading into the break, the Huskies knew they had to make some halftime adjustments. But head coach Kalen DeBoer seemingly fired up his squad at the break, as they pitched a second-half shutout to remain unbeaten. Huskies quarterback Michael Penix added to his Heisman resume with another strong performance, completing 24 of his 42 pass attempts for 332 yards and three total touchdowns. Running back Dillon Johnson didn\u2019t quite match the amazing performance he had against Southern Cal last week, but still heavily contributed with 132 yards and one touchdown on 25 total touches. Wide receiver Rome Odunze led the team with 111 receiving yards and two touchdowns on just three catches. Utah signal caller Bryson Barnes had a mixed game, completing 17 of his 30 pass attempts for 267 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. But receiver Devaughn Vele had himself a nice day, catching five balls for 145 yards. One of Barnes\u2019 passes was intercepted off of a deflection by Washington linebacker Alphonzo Tuputala, who ran into the endzone, but prematurely celebrated, dropping the ball at the 1-yard-line. Had this play not gone horribly wrong, Washington may have prevailed by even more. Washington (10-0) remains ranked at No. 5 in the CFP rankings. Utah (7-3) slips 4 spots to No. 22.\n\nMissouri dominates Tennessee at home, 36-7\nIt was all Tigers from start to finish at Faurot Field. Missouri dominated on both sides of the football en route to its biggest win of the season. The Tigers defense forced three turnovers and six punts, allowing just 15 first downs. Offensively, they possessed the ball for nearly 40 minutes and outgained the Volunteers by nearly 200 yards. Their ability to dominate time of possession and the game\u2019s flow was mostly thanks to running back Cody Schrader. Schrader totaled 321 yards and two touchdowns on 40 touches. He was the Tigers\u2019 biggest threat on the ground and through the air, leading the team in both categories. Quarterback Brady Cook was efficient and effective, throwing for 275 yards, a touchdown and an interception, with 55 more yards and another score on the ground. Tennessee had a rough day offensively. From a statistical standpoint, though, quarterback Joe Milton III was not bad, completing 22 of his 34 pass attempts for 264 yards, a touchdown and an interception. Milton\u2019s 36 rushing yards led the team, showing the Volunteers\u2019 inability to pound the rock. Missouri (8-2) jumps five spots to No. 9 in the rankings. Tennessee (7-3) falls five spots to No. 18.\n\nUCF runs all over Oklahoma State, 45-3\nThe underdog Knights came out swinging from beginning to end in front of their home crowd, out-gaining the Cowboys 592-277 in total yards. UCF\u2019s defense forced four Cowboy turnovers and held them to their lowest point total of the season. Oklahoma State quarterback Alan Bowman struggled, throwing for 225 yards and three interceptions. Star running back Ollie Gordon, who has given past opponents major issues and was starting to gain traction in the Heisman conversation, was held to just 25 rushing yards and a fumble. It was a truly dominant performance from the Knights\u2019 defensive unit. UCF\u2019s offense fed off of its defense\u2019s energy, putting up its most impressive performance of the season. Quarterback John Rhys Plumlee looked elite, throwing for 299 yards and three touchdowns on just 18 completions. He also added 74 yards on the ground. Receiver Javon Baker led the way with four catches for 112 yards. Running back RJ Harvey carried the ball 24 times for 206 yards and three touchdowns, his highest yardage total of the season. Harvey now has two straight games with a hat trick after his 164-yard, three-touchdown performance against Cincinnati a week prior. Oklahoma State (7-3) fell eight spots to No. 23 in the poll. UCF (5-5) remains unranked.\n\nGeorgia crushes Ole Miss, 52-17\nAn opening drive touchdown by the Rebels made them seem ready to knock off the defending champions and start a playoff push. Then, they were outscored 52-10 for the remainder of the game. Georgia did seemingly whatever it wanted offensively, scoring their highest point total on the season. Quarterback Carson Beck was efficient, completing 18 of his 25 pass attempts for 306 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. Running back Kendall Milton led the Bulldogs in rushing yards with 127 and two touchdowns, while receiver Ladd McConkey led all receivers with 81 yards and a score. Superstar tight end Brock Bowers made his return from injury and scored a touchdown in front of his home fans. Ole Miss kept things relatively close going into halftime, but scored just three points in the second half. Quarterback Jaxson Dart was held to just 117 yards through the air and tossed an interception, leaving the game due to injury late in the third. Running back Quinshon Judkins had a solid day, rushing for 75 yards and two touchdowns. Overall, the defending champion Bulldogs made a statement against a good team in Ole Miss heading into the final stretch of the season, which bodes well for their eventual  Georgia\u2019s (10-0) dominating performance granted them the No. 1 spot in the CFP rankings, while Ole Miss (8-2) dropped four spots to No. 13.\n\nOhio State stomps Michigan State, 38-3\nAnother hat trick from star receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. propelled the Ohio State over the Spartans. Buckeye passer Kyle McCord logged his best game of the season, going 24 of 31 for 335 yards and three touchdowns. McCord found Harrison Jr. for 149 yards and two scores. Harrison Jr. also added a rushing touchdown from 19 yards out to his big day.  The Buckeyes defense dominated the Spartans, forcing eight punts and allowing just 11 first downs. While they didn\u2019t turn the ball over, Michigan State didn\u2019t have much success on offense. The Spartans horrendous day saw them convert just two of their 14 third down attempts. Quarterback Katin Houser threw for just 92 yards. Ohio State (10-0) dropped one spot to No. 2 in the rankings despite the big win. Michigan State (3-7) remains unranked.\n```"}

The celebration consisted of bird-singing performances by the Torres-Martinez Bird Singers, a panel discussion between Native American students and staff at USC, and speeches from notable USC officials, including Carol Folt.\n\nNative American students were incredibly proud to finally have this recognition on such a large scale, especially at a predominantly white institution. \u201cGoing into [my] freshman year, we didn\u2019t have these big scale events here to showcase and recognize our presence,\u201d said Daniel Williams, one of the co-directors of the Native American Student Assembly (NASA). \u201cI\u2019m seeing all the various different tribal affiliations come out, even from the local community [outside of USC]. It\u2019s just been really rewarding.\u201d\n\nOut of 47,000 students at USC, less than 1% identify as Native American. This means that there are only around 500 Native American undergraduate students and around 350 graduate students on campus, according to Folt. Folt spoke at the celebration to commemorate this inaugural event, praising the much needed representation of Native American students. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s not long overdue, but we\u2019re here now... and [I\u2019m] so grateful to be a part of it,\u201d Folt said.\n\nNative Americans in the United States have a long history of being underrepresented and invisible. Since the fifteenth century, \u201cthe founding and growth of the United States resulted in Native American communities being moved, renamed, combined, dispersed, and, in some cases, destroyed,\u201d according to the Library of Congress. Despite this traumatic past, there is still a thriving culture that exists in the United States today. However, they continue to remain one of the most underrepresented groups in American society. Indigenous Peoples Day was only just recognized as a national holiday in 2021 by the Biden Administration.\n\nWilliams discussed how shocked he was going to school with so many non-Native individuals. \u201cI grew up on the reservation, surrounded by Natives every day,... so coming in, I honestly felt pretty isolated,\u201d Williams said. Williams helped coordinate this celebration and brought NASA to the event, hoping to expand student membership in the organization and community for Native American students. \u201cI\u2019m just really passionate about making sure that our Native, Indigenous students have the space and resources that we didn\u2019t have as... freshmen,\u201d Williams said.\n\nAs part of providing exposure and awareness of Native American culture, the TM Bird Singers were invited to perform bird-singing, a long-standing oral tradition for Native Americans. \u201cSinging is our oral tradition and our oral history. Because we didn\u2019t have a written language, everything was done by song,\u201d said Derek Duro, head singer for the TM Bird Singers. \u201cBeing able to sing is being able to carry my ancestors along with me.\u201d\n\nThrough a mix of repeated phrases and shakers, the TM Bird Singers performed a few bird songs about subjects ranging from the creation of the universe to the migration of Native Americans to the existence of Native Americans today. \u201cNot anybody [can] be a bird singer you [have] to be picked... and then you [take] on that role you represented your tribe,\u201d Duro said.\n\nIn further recognition of Native American people and their culture, there was also a brief speech by the Head Coach for the Women\u2019s Lacrosse team at USC, Lindsey Munday. Munday acknowledged the history of lacrosse, as it was originally invented by Native American people. Munday announced that there will be a land recognition before every lacrosse game this coming season, in the spirit of educating others and understanding the traditions and history of Native Americans.\n\nThe celebratory event was rounded out with a panel discussion between Hydi Ybarra, a physician\u2019s assistant student at the Keck School of Medicine; Derek Duro; Amia-Roach Valandra, a junior health and human sciences major and member of NASA; Robert Judkins, the executive producer and director of broadcast at the Native American Basketball Invitational Network; and Chris Finley, an associate professor of American studies and ethnicity. The panel discussed the different aspects of and experiences that come with being Native Americans in an urban society. \u201cExistence is resistance,\u201d Ybarra said. \u201cThe best version of Native American history is in the future.\u201d\n\nThe panelists also mentioned some ways for students to learn about Native American history and culture, including picking up a Native American studies minor, taking one of the multiple GE courses offered at USC and attending NASA events, many of which are being held in the weeks to come.\n\nTerrell Mesteth, a Native American student and NASA member, appreciated the event\u2019s emphasis on raising awareness about Native Americans in honor of Native American Heritage Month. \u201c[This event] is such a milestone, and really shows how the university supports Native students,\u201d said Mesteth. \u201cWe want more Native students to come and Natives in higher education. This is just one of the many ways students recognize that we are visible and really [acknowledge] that we\u2019re here.\u201d\n```"}

Nowadays, if you\u2019re a K through 12 students at the 32nd Street Magnet School, your bus picks you up at around 5:30 AM. You can thank the closure of the 10 freeway for that. About a mile of I-10 is closed in both directions after a massive fire last weekend damaged over 100 columns between Alameda Street and the East L.A. interchange, near Boyle Heights. That freeway usually sees more than 300 thousand Angelenos, every day. That includes local Los Angeles bus drivers, teachers, principals, parents and students. And now, it sees none.\n\nOne of those Angelenas is Ana Perez. She drives a bus for 32nd Street, one of the schools noticing a big change in transportation because of I-10. Perez says she\u2019s been delayed by having to take alternative routes even today.\n\nAna Perez: I would have taken the I-10 to pick up Bell High School, but I opt to take in the streets. It would have been faster through the freeway. But with the freeway closure, I just ended up taking Florence all the way down.\n\nThe detour, and congestion, have nearly doubled Perez\u2019s commute.\n\nPerez: There is more traffic on the streets, I\u2019ve noticed, because people are taking those traffic streets to avoid the freeway. I\u2019m probably getting here to school maybe ten, 15 minutes later.\n\nAnd if she\u2019s late, it causes other people to be late.\n\nWilliam Jones: It\u2019s like a domino effect.\n\nWilliam Jones is the 32nd Street School\u2019s Magnet Coordinator.\n\nJones: If he picks the student up late, the parents late, and then the bus is late. So, obviously that impacts their education because they\u2019re not here on time.\n\nWho would have thought that a closed freeway would affect the education of children as much as it does? Caltrans, the schools and the parents hope repairs over Thanksgiving Break will help alleviate the traffic delays. But the problems could stick around through the end of the semester.\n\nThat\u2019s a wrench in the works for people like teachers, who like to plan, says 32nd Street Principal Kerry Kehrley.\n\nKerry Kehrley: Educators like most people, are creatures of habit. And I stand by the gates in the doors when people arrive in the morning and I\u2019m very familiar, having worked here for four years now with arrival times, and I\u2019ve noticed that everyone\u2019s arrival times are pretty dramatically different because they\u2019re either here a lot earlier or not at the exact time they used to be, because they all are trying to figure out new routes.\n\nAnd beyond disrupting travel and learning, many kids rely on the schools for lunch that they otherwise might not have. Every student at 32nd Street counts on the Free Lunch program. And the school is taking care of them since the freeway fire disrupted commutes, says Principal Kehrley.\n\nKehrley: For the students who come late, we provide breakfast, lunch and a a small dinner meal as well. So those are still adjusted in terms that we hold for that one bus that comes late.\n\nAnd now, they\u2019ll play the waiting game until I-10, and Angelenos, are back up and running.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Sophie Sullivan.\n```"}

With the expansion, the museum hopes to increase its annual audience to roughly 500,000 by 2030.\n\n\u201cIt means so much because we really are on the frontlines of educating students and making sure that students and visitors understand the lessons of the Holocaust so it doesn\u2019t ever happen again,\u201d said Lonberg. \u201cWe\u2019ve had students come from different parts of the country, and we\u2019ve even had students come from other countries to visit to continue to do that.\u201d \n```"}

Beginning at 10 a.m. and concluding at 4 p.m., residents moved in in shifts and were assisted by Campus Storage movers hired by the Hub. Residents checked in in the lobby, and were offered an array of refreshments and Hub merchandise.\n\nUpon seeing their apartments for the first time, some were dissatisfied. The rooftop pool is still under construction, and there are reports of some apartments having unfinished ceilings and missing faucet heads. \u201cWith our amenities, they said we would get a memory foam mattress, which we didn\u2019t get. They made a lot of false promises,\u201d said Ava Browne, a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies. \u201cThey lied to us and then gave us refreshments on move-in day. They gave us Hub cake pops and were like \u2018Everything\u2019s good!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Hub assured that the complex would be ready by the start of the school year in August, but just a week before the scheduled move-in date, an email was sent out notifying residents of a one to four-week delay. Over the past three months, the Hub continued to delay the move-in date with vague emails with various excuses as to why the complex wasn\u2019t ready yet.\n\n\u201cI feel like the Hub views us for business, rather than as people,\u201d said sophomore theatre major Tori Feinstein. \u201cThey know how to make you feel considered, which is why I think they\u2019ve gotten people to stay, but I really feel that we weren\u2019t considered as people, but for profit. With them continuing to extend the date, rather than just being upfront, they were just doing that to make good business.\u201d\n\nSome were simply relieved that they\u2019d finally reached a housing solution for the school year. When the move-in was first delayed in September, residents were provided with two options: $100 a day and temporary housing at the J.W. Marriott, or $200 a day to find temporary housing at the students\u2019 discretion. Additionally, tenants were given the option to break their leases, but only during a three-day period, not providing a real opportunity to look for alternative housing.\n\nIn October, those who chose to live in hotels were relocated to the Lorenzo due to overbooking. For these students, the Hub move-in is their third, and hopefully final, move-in of the semester.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d just say the stress of the multiple moves and the constant delays was pretty rough on all of us,\u201d said senior biomedical engineering major Aaron Benedek. \u201cBut I think that the Hub team handled it as well as they could have, and I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but I\u2019m happy with the final result.\u201d```"}

According to China\u2019s state agency Xinhua, the two sides made a point to show each other respect, continue to keep open communication channels open, and prevent conflict between the countries. \u201cBoth sides should understand each other\u2019s principles and bottom lines, not make or stir up trouble or cross boundaries, (but instead) communicate more, have more dialogue and more discussions...\u201d said Xinhua.\n\nDespite having a productive conversation, a few hours after their meeting, President Biden surprised many people by answering a reporter\u2019s question by saying President Xi is a \u201cdictator.\u201d And during a speech Xi gave at a dinner last night with business leaders, in another effort to bolster relations between the two countries, President Xi suggested that the US could soon receive as gifts from China, some Pandas! The two leaders agreed to continue high level diplomacy going forward.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Kamyar Moradi.\n```"}

(Photo by Yannick Peterhans).\n\nBy Qais Adawiya, Susan Nyirenda, Shivani Gupta, and Dash Chaiyasen\nNovember 16, 2023 at 5:50 pm PST\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to study in Leavey Library tonight - good luck! Tonight marks the return of USC\u2019s annual spirit rally and concert, \u201cConquest\u201d, on McCarthy Quad. Conquest stems from the long-standing rivalry between USC and their crosstown rivals UCLA. It will open with a rally featuring the Trojan Dance Force, the Trojan Marching Band, the Song girls, and the USC Spirit Leaders. A concert featuring rapper Baby Jake and headlined by Icona Pop will follow soon after, featuring a performance of the hit song \u201cI Love It\u201d featuring Charlie XCX.\n\nThis is a big event for the school and the students, but what does it mean to the performers? Ingrid Griffin is a 21-year-old country and pop singer-songwriter hailing from Lincoln, Nebraska, who attends USC to pursue a major in Music Industry. The senior student is also a DJ at KXSC Student Radio and will perform an eight-minute set with original compositions as part of the festivities.\n\nGriffin has experience performing at many different venues, but this performance is different from her usual street-style showcase. Ingrid Griffin: I have played with a lot of different types of places. Oftentimes I do busking, which means just kind of playing on the street for tips. I do that at farmer\u2019s markets and flea markets and things like that. This is different cause, um, and I like that it\u2019s different because I sort of get people\u2019s full attention for 8 minutes.\n\nConquest empowers student performers with a platform to share their original works in front of the Trojan community, and Griffin is excited for the chance to reach a wider audience. Griffin: I mean, it\u2019s just great experience under my belt. It\u2019s my favorite thing to do in the whole world is perform. And I\u2019m also so excited that I\u2019m going to be singing an original because this is probably the song I\u2019m most proud of that I\u2019ve ever written. And I think it\u2019s one that college students will be able to relate to a lot. So I\u2019m hoping that it sort of piques people\u2019s interest about my original music.\n\nMusicians aren\u2019t the only ones buzzing for tonight\u2019s Conquest: Students around campus are just as excited to attend! Senior Candace House, Business in Cinematic Arts major, shared her enthusiasm for the performers. Candace House: I\u2019m looking forward to see the Cardinal Divas as well as the headliner icon of Pop because they\u2019re singing \u201cI Love This,\u201d which is a song. I love it.\n\nAnother student performer is Hannah Ethridge, a member of Cardinal Divas and a Senior studying African American studies. This will be her second year performing at Conquest with the majorette team. Hannah Ethridge: It means a lot because. Not a lot of we don\u2019t have a lot of support from the school with wanting to with wanting us to dance on the field, which is what typical majorette teams do. A show of support from the Trojan community makes this return even more significant for the majorettes. Ethridge: It just means that, you know, people still want to see us, people like what we\u2019re bringing to the table. So it means that, you know, we\u2019re like, seen or loved and we are appreciated in this community.\n\nConquest festivities will begin at 6:20 in McCarthy Quad following our show.

Up 24-17 and at the opponent\u2019s 38-yard line, it\u2019s a prime opportunity for the Ravens offense to extend the lead to two scores and put away their rival Cleveland Browns in a crucial divisional matchup. Jackson drops back, and with immediate pressure in his face, steps up quickly in the pocket, as he has so many times on many of his magician-like runs. Only this time a 272-pound wrecking ball loops around a Ravens guard to team up with a Browns linebacker for the sack \u2013 Myles Garrett.\n\nNext play \u2014 third and seventeen now around the fifty, the Ravens could still extend their lead behind the leg of eight-time All-Pro kicker Justin Tucker. Jackson calls for the ball. Garrett launches off the line and immediately gets his hands inside Ravens right tackle Patrick Mekari\u2019s chest plate. He then extends his right arm, seemingly bench-pressing his opponent and getting Mekari enough off balance to push him to the ground as he glides toward Jackson for the sack. Garrett stands up with intense bravado, hard-stepping and flexing \u2013 no Ravens score, and the Browns proceed to mount a spectacular 33-31 comeback.\n\nThis two-play sequence in Sunday\u2019s Browns vs. Ravens game is but one of the myriad of special moments Garrett has delivered this fall. He\u2019s been a force of nature since entering the league as the No. 1 overall selection in 2017, yet this season, leading defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz\u2019s historic defense, the four-time All-Pro looks poised to finally be honored as the NFL\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nIn the first week of my new Tape Talk column, we\u2019ll dive into Garrett\u2019s fit in Schwartz\u2019s defense, how he\u2019s been demolishing offensive linemen all year, and his prospective case for earning the DPOY award come February.\n\nGarrett has comfortably been in the elite EDGE conversation since his rookie year in 2017, recording over 30 pressures in all but one season while being only one of six NFL players ever to record double-digit sacks in each of their first six years in the league. But despite having one of the true few defensive cornerstones in the sport, Cleveland has failed to consistently field an elite defense during Garrett\u2019s career, ranking top five in yards per play allowed only once since his arrival.\n\nLast year in particular, the Browns defense was solid but nowhere near spectacular, ranking 15th in total yards allowed (5631), 16th in yards per play allowed (5.4), and 16th in first downs allowed (329). Ultimately, it was clear that the unit would need to take a leap to fulfill the team\u2019s lofty Super Bowl aspirations, particularly with its $230 million quarterback now available for the full season.\n\nEnter Jim Schwartz, the Browns\u2019 novel defensive coordinator for the 2023 season who has hyper-energized the Browns defense \u2013 through ten weeks, he\u2019s orchestrated a defensive masterclass that has seen the Browns D rank first in offensive plays allowed (482), first in total yards allowed (2184), first in first downs allowed (113), and second in yards per play allowed (4.5), bolstering the Browns toward a current spot in the playoffs.\n\nSchwartz isn\u2019t reinventing the wheel to help elevate the Browns unit, but rather implementing his long successful trademark system previously seen in places like Tennessee and Philadelphia: a standard 4-3 front (referring to a front seven composed of four down linemen and three linebackers) with heavy amounts of man coverage behind it and an exotic twist/stunt game.\n\n4-3 defenses are popular and can be extremely effective as they allow three linebackers to roam free without pass-rushing responsibilities. The tradeoff, however, is that the system requires very good defensive linemen, and particularly exceptional defensive ends who are expected to be the premier pass rushers of the system while also being sound run defenders.\n\nOn paper, this makes Myles Garrett the clear lynchpin of Schwartz\u2019s system. With his uncanny pass rush and run defense abilities, he should be able to free up the Browns\u2019 linebackers while also opening up pass rush and run support opportunities to other linemen due to his high double team percentage (Garrett\u2019s 31% is the highest among NFL edge rushers).\n\nThrough ten weeks of the season, it\u2019s clear that he has not only met expectations but exceeded them. Garrett boasts the second-highest pass rush win rate among EDGEs at 33% while facing the most double teams, and he\u2019s currently tied for first among all players in sacks (11.0) and second in QB hits (20). As a run defender, he\u2019s tied for second among all EDGEs in run support win rate (38%) while ranking 19th among all players in tackles for loss with nine.\n\nThe numbers tell us Garrett is dominating, but how exactly is he doing it? One word: physicality. This is not to discredit him as a master of his craft \u2014 Garrett is a strong technician at the defensive end position; he boasts an arsenal of pass rush moves and uses clever fakes to throw linemen off balance. His hand fighting and placement abilities in run support and pass rush are on display almost every snap.\n\nYet what separates him from the rest of the pack is his uncanny physical ability and competitiveness. At 6-foot-4, 272 pounds with the frame of a bodybuilder, Garrett looks like he was made in a lab to rush the passer, and plays like it, too. He can generate elite power in his bull rush with a lightning-quick get-off, and phenomenal ankle and knee flexion ability which allow him to play with low pad level, get under any tackle\u2019s pads and walk them back to the quarterback.\n\nWatch his tape against the San Francisco 49ers, and you\u2019ll see Garrett comfortably walking back ten-time Pro-Bowler Trent Williams into Brock Purdy\u2019s lap multiple times.\n\nGarrett can win around the edge too, showing very good body control and balance to get low and parallel to the ground to round the arc. This may sound standard for an NFL rusher, yet Garrett does it at a truly elite level at 272 pounds and in the frame of a pure power rusher.\n\nTo put it into context, Garrett displays Von Miller-like bend in a frame closer to that of JJ Watt. Alien. He\u2019s dominant in run support, too: Garrett is physically imposing at the point of attack and shows the ability to both two-gap (an assignment responsible for two gaps at a time) or penetrate (an assignment leveraging a single gap) due to the foot quickness and lateral agility that allow him to zoom into the backfield for a tackle for loss.\n\nUltimately, Garrett combines astonishing athletic ability with tremendous physicality, resulting in dominant EDGE play rep after rep.\n\nJim Schwartz has played a part in Garrett\u2019s career 2023 season through clever schematic wrinkles. He\u2019s varied Garrett\u2019s alignment, particularly on late downs, placing him in a myriad of positions ranging from middle linebacker to nose guard to create favorable matchups and easy pressures. His three percentage point increase in blitz rate from what the Browns were running in 2022 has allowed for Garrett\u2019s double-team rate to decrease a bit (despite it still being the highest in the league) and thus give him additional one-on-one opportunities.\n\nAnd his creative use of Garrett in the stunt game has allowed the seven-year vet to get on the move and enjoy easier rushes on the quarterback. However, on the majority of snaps, in a position that isn\u2019t as scheme-dependent as others, Garrett has just gone out there, lined up against his lineman (often two or more) and scorched competition play after play as the alpha of a Browns defense which now looks to be the cream of the NFL crop.\n\nNow 6-3, the Browns are currently the AFC\u2019s sixth seed, putting them in decent position to push on in the latter half of the season to secure a playoff berth. This is mostly due to their defense \u2014 the Browns offense ranks 30th in yards per play (4.6) and 26th in touchdown percentage (2.6 percent). Quarterback Deshaun Watson has looked like a shell of his former self, ranking 21st in passer rating among all quarterbacks, and is actually now reportedly out for the season with an injury to his throwing shoulder suffered against the Ravens.\n\nIf the Browns continue to win football games off the backs of their defense and in spite of subpar quarterback play, Garrett would have a clear narrative for DPOY. Jim Schwartz has been the architect of the Browns\u2019 defensive turnaround, yet Garrett has been his greatest tool. His All-Pro level play at the defensive end position stemming from his tremendous physical gifts and every-down competitiveness facilitates high-level play for the rest of the defense, thus helping elevate a unit currently enjoying one of the most impressive seasons of all time and powering the Browns to playoff contention.\n\nWhile it\u2019s only Week 11, we may as well hand the DPOY trophy to No. 95 up in Cleveland.\n```"}

The Kings won the contest 7-3, and are undefeated on the road this season. (AP/Matt Krohn)\n\nBy Kasey Kazliner November 16, 2023 at 5:20 pm PST\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Over a month into the NHL season, the Kings have bucked the common notion that teams usually find their stride at home and have trouble on the road. Los Angeles hasn\u2019t made it past the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs since hoisting the trophy back in 2014, but is poised to make a run this year with a solid group of veterans in Cam Talbot and An\u017ee Kopitar mixed in with younger players like Quinton Byfield.\n\nThe Pacific Division has been full of strange storylines early on in the season. As expected, the reigning champion Vegas Golden Knights are atop the group and look dominant. The Vancouver Canucks have clearly forgotten about recent seasons\u2019 woes and look like a deep playoff team already. Southern California\u2019s Ducks and Kings are standing their ground in the top four, while the Seattle Kraken have struggled to repeat last season\u2019s success. The Edmonton Oilers, who usually contend toward the top of the top of the division, look lifeless, along with the rebuilding San Jose Sharks and star-longing Calgary Flames.\n\nThe point is, the Kings have the opportunity to take advantage of the NHL\u2019s worst division and land a precious high playoff seed if they keep up their good play. This past week, Los Angeles went 1-1-1, but crucially routed the rival Golden Knights. The 4-1 victory moved the Kings to a 7-0-0 record on the road, the best in the NHL. Los Angeles\u2019 +14 goal differential is indicative of the Kings\u2019 solid play in the offensive and defensive zones.\n\nGoaltender Talbot has found his footing between the pipes, despite being 36 and coming off an injury-ridden season with the Senators. He was nearly perfect in the Vegas win and had 37 saves, bringing him to seven wins on the season already. L.A. is deep offensively and it showed this week. Center Adrian Kempe, who leads the team in points and goals, is as hot as can be right now. The Swedish winger scored in all three games this week and added some assists as well.\n\nKopitar co-leads the team in goals and added to his tally against Vegas, and also assisted Kempe. He added another assist against Pittsburgh but went quiet in the Kings\u2019 loss to the Flyers. Left winger Kevin Fiala is another King to look out for despite recent struggles. Fiala has hung around the second and third lines as his plus/minus of minus-5 has indicated issues on both sides of the puck.\n\nDespite losing, however, Fiala was responsible for getting his team a point against the Penguins, as his third period, game-tying goal eventually sent the game to overtime. The Kings still have progress to make before they can be called true contenders. While their away play has been perfect, they\u2019ve struggled at home, losing both home games this week and posting just one home win thus far.\n\nIt\u2019s early, and they have time to improve, but the team must address this strange trend. The Kings\u2019 defense has held up, but also demands improvement going forward. Los Angeles is one of the highest-scoring teams in the NHL, averaging four goals per game, but still finds itself losing close games due to poor defense. Losses in October to Vegas and Carolina were indicative of this problem, as the Kings lost to both in high-scoring shootouts.\n\nLooking ahead, the Kings will face the Panthers, Blues and Coyotes this week, with the first two contests at home \u2014 prime opportunities for the Kings to improve their home record. Florida will likely be the Kings\u2019 biggest test. The Panthers have been a great team in an ultra-competitive Atlantic Division, following up on their run to the Stanley Cup Final last season. St. Louis and Arizona have been average, but the Kings have taken down the Coyotes twice already and are looking to finish the sweep.\n\nThe season is young and while home losses have been an issue, the Kings are still among the NHL\u2019s best. Offensive production is carrying the team through games, and as long as it can stay consistent, Los Angeles should be fine in the Pacific. The Kings will take on the Florida Panthers next at Crypto.com Arena Thursday at 7:30 p.m.\n```"}

Now, they are \u201cthe second largest independent athletic footwear company in the world,\u201d Ryan\u2019s twin brother Adam Goldston said.\n\n\u201cThere was a whole group of venture capitalists who said \u2018This will never happen,\u2019\u201d Ryan Goldston said. \u201cWe proved them wrong.\u201d\n\nThe experience and interpretation of failure can vary drastically from one person to another. For some, they may pose temporary obstacles, while for others, they may turn out to be catalysts for change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not from the camp of failures lead to successes,\u201d Adam Goldston said. \u201cI\u2019m from the camp of if you find yourself in hell, the only way through is through.\u201d\n\nFor Farren Benjamin, a former Trojan hammer thrower who now works as head of sports partnerships at Tagboard and as an NFLPA-certified sports agent, career opportunities came to her from the networks she made in four years at USC.\n\n\u201cAll of these doors that opened have come to me because of someone that I met here on campus,\u201d Benjamin said.\n\nThe importance of networking was a recurring theme of the evening. Former USC track runner Kira Soderstrom is now an artificial intelligence and machine learning senior technician specialist at Microsoft, and she emphasized networking as one of the key takeaways of her speech.\n\n\u201cNetwork, network, network,\u201d Soderstrom said near the end of her speech. \u201cFind mentors, people in the field you\u2019re interested in working with, and learn from them.\u201d\n\nFormer Trojan quarterback Max Browne and tight end Randall Telfer also shared valuable insights on their transition out of football. Both of them experienced non-linear career paths and eventually settled down in jobs they enjoy.\n\n\u201cThe journey\u2019s been absolutely incredible,\u201d Telfer, now working as the director of digital marketing at Warner Records, said. \u201cI love working in music so much, it doesn\u2019t even really feel like work.\u201d\n\nBrowne is now a real estate advisor and college football analyst for the Pac-12 Network.\n\n\u201cIf you can at least gather up enough warm contacts, when you do get to that transition point, you can then reach out to those people,\u201d Browne said, furthering the topic of networking.\n\nFollowing the speeches, students were given time to engage with professionals and each other. The atmosphere was energetic, as present and former Trojan athletes held conversations and exchanged contacts.\n\n\u201cIt was really cool listening to all the different speakers, their different experiences and how they got to where they are today,\u201d redshirt sophomore baseball pitcher Eric Hammond said. \u201cThey brought up some really insightful points about continuing to consistently work hard each day in order to achieve what you want.\u201d\n\nFor those who want to learn more about Exposition, they can visit their website or Instagram page.

These include his brother Maher, who was charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity, as well as Ghassam Abbas, director of the agency that established Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program.\n\nThe case comes after an investigation involving deep analysis of the Syrian military chain of command and first-hand witness accounts. It was instigated by legal complaints from various groups, including the Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM), the Open Society Justice Initiative (OSJI) and the Syrian Archive, which documents human rights violations in Syria.\n\nMazen Darwish, who founded the SCM and filed the case in France, told the Agence France-Presse that this is a \u201chuge development\u201d as \u201can independent jurisdiction is recognising that the chemical attack couldn\u2019t have happened without the knowledge of the Syrian president, that he has responsibility and should be held accountable.\u201d\n\nThe war in Syria began in 2011. Syrian forces fought back against pro-democracy protests participating in Arab Spring uprisings across the country. A brutal civil war ensued, with the Syrian government fighting various opposition factions. Soon after, the country almost fell into the hands of terrorists as the extremist group Islamic State made Syria their base.\n\nAssad\u2019s government has now regained control of Syria\u2019s biggest cities following a ceasefire in March 2020 brokered by Russia and Turkey. The devastation of the Syrian civil war has been far-reaching, with over 500,000 Syrians killed and 13 million displaced, according to the Syria Observatory for Human Rights.\n\nSyria also suffered a 7.8-magnitude earthquake earlier this year, causing tens of thousands of injuries and deaths. France\u2019s decision to take Assad to trial arguably adds another blow to this already-ravaged country.\n\nBrand thinks the timing of France\u2019s decision is noteworthy. \u201cThis could have happened years ago if there really was a concern,\u201d Brand said. \u201cWhy does it happen now in the middle of the Gaza war?\u201d\n\nShe believes this may be an attempt by major Western leaders to try and rehabilitate their image to Arab and Muslim audiences, after mounting criticism of their reluctance to pressure Israel into a ceasefire or \u201chumanitarian truce\u201d in Gaza.\n\n\u201cFrench ambassadors across the Middle East have complained and protested the position the French government has taken in the [Israel-Hamas] conflict,\u201d Brand said. \u201cSo maybe condemning Assad for his crimes against Syrian civilians is a way for Macron to show he does care about some Arab lives.\u201d\n\nSyria agreed to join the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) global watchdog in 2013, promising to give up all chemical weapons. However, the attack in Eastern Ghouta was not the only time a chemical weapons attack has taken place in Syria.\n\nIn 2017, a joint inquiry by the United Nations and the OPCW found that the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin in an April 2017 attack and has also used chlorine in multiple attacks since.\n\nThe Syrian government has vehemently denied using any chemical weapons, but as commander of the armed forces, Assad\u2019s approval would be mandatory.\n\n\u201cThe president is responsible for many crimes in Syria - but with sarin gas it\u2019s impossible to jump over the gap [of his involvement],\u201d Darwish told Reuters.\n\nIt is unusual for a country to issue an arrest warrant for another sitting head of state, as they have immunity from prosecution. But international law brings exception to that immunity in cases of war crimes or genocide.\n\nDespite this, Craig Martin, professor of international public law at the Washburn University School of Law, does not think it will have a significant impact on Assad presently.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely within the French jurisdiction to exercise universal jurisdiction against someone accused of torture, war crimes or crimes against humanity,\u201d Martin explained. \u201cBut Assad is the current head of state so he has some level of immunity.\u201d\n\nMartin said that if Syria took the case to the International Court of Justice, it is likely they would agree that France cannot prosecute another head of state in their domestic courts, and so the case may be dropped.\n\nAssad\u2019s visit to the United Arab Emirates last year heralded a step forward for Syria to re-enter the world stage. He has since traveled to China and was welcomed back into the Arab League.\n\nThe country also received diplomatic support following the earthquake in February 2023, indicating a tentative thawing of relations between Syria and the international community.\n\nTrials in absentia are permitted in France, meaning Assad could be trialed even without his physical presence. Martin believes that in practical terms, this won\u2019t have a major impact while he remains current head of state.\n\nHowever, the arrest warrant could prevent him from traveling to France especially in the future, were he to step down as president.\n```"}

Why I stopped calling myself a dancer\n\nAt what point does a non-professional lose the confidence to call themselves a dancer?\n\nBy Accalia Rositani November 16, 2023 at 12:16 pm PST\n\nI often wonder when exactly I stopped being a dancer. Was it when I stopped competing? Was it when I decided to be a dance minor in college instead of a major? Was it when my dance class attendance dipped during my first-year post-graduate due to the cost? The funny thing is, I never stopped dancing at any of these stages. I have not stopped dancing since my first ballet class when I was eight years old. So, I guess the question is \u2014 when did I stop feeling like a dancer?\n\nMy dance journey started, like many, in a studio. This laid the foundation not only for my training but also for my overall work ethic and character. My studio was my social capital where I had some of the best and worst times of my life. At 24, I mostly think about the best times. Every year was divided into seasons. I auditioned for competition groups in the summer and fall and learned my choreography for competition season. In the winter and spring, I competed and attended conventions where I danced on concrete floors of hotel conference rooms in hopes of standing out in a sea of hundreds of other kids. In the early summer, I either attended a national competition, an intensive summer or I took a break. However, that last option was unheard of unless I was dealing with an injury. This was my life from fifth to 12th grade, except for my third year of high school when I tore my achilles.\n\nWhile there is so much to critique about dance, from the exorbitant cost to Eurocentrism to toxic body ideals, I can say it added more to my life than it ever took away. I am so grateful to have been trained in this art form from a young age. I only wish I would\u2019ve known sooner about the huge privilege of being able to call myself a dancer without a moment\u2019s hesitation.\n\nEarly rifts\n\nTo be the best, you have to give everything. This principle is preached in any physical or intellectual endeavor. And we all have different things that impede \u201cgiving everything.\u201d For me, that was school. Even before high school, I made a habit. I stayed up late and woke up early to finish my homework. Since I had dance right after school at 4 p.m. every day, I never dropped my backpack on the kitchen table and knocked out my assignments before dinner was ready. My after-school routine looked different. I ran in the front door, threw on my ballet clothes and packed my dance bag with the rest of the outfits I\u2019d need for the day, which were suitable for hip-hop, jazz or contemporary. I grabbed a snack to go back out to the car before making it to dance by the skin of my teeth.\n\nHigh school only made things worse, as it typically does and it was during those years that the serious arguments about dance began. \u201cAre you going to take advanced placement classes or do two solos? Are you going to join a club at school and compromise dance hours but make friends? Are you going to skip school on Friday to go to that one extra class at the convention,\u201d I was asked. I then asked myself what was more important \u2014 dance or school? My mom, dad, dance teachers and school teachers all had different opinions. But like the absolute people-pleaser I was, I tried to do everything. I brought my homework to dance and studied between breaks. I brokered a deal with the cheer coach to let me learn our routines from recordings when I missed practice due to dance. I took tests early when I skipped school for a competition.\n\nOne non-negotiable thing, though, was my attending college. My parents made it their life goal to make sure my brother and I could go to school, so I never considered not going. I also loved school. I always had and that\u2019s part of the reason I refused to compromise it for dance. It took a while to figure out what exactly I wanted to study, but I knew I wanted to write. I ended up pursuing degrees in journalism and Spanish when I attended Loyola Marymount University in 2018. I chose dance as my minor.\n\nBut even before all that happened, I saw the beginning of the end at 15 years old. Who gets to be a real dancer? I can\u2019t say the studio I frequented discouraged us from taking school seriously, but I also can\u2019t deny they made it terribly easy to be a serious student. This is less a statement about my studio than it is of dance culture in general. Growing up, I\u2019d often liken my dance life to what was depicted in the Lifetime reality show \u201cDance Moms\u201d so that non-dancers would get the idea. More than one person responded with, \u201cBut those kids don\u2019t seem to go to school?\u201d That was a key part of the comparison.\n\nIn any case, college was not a popular topic at dance. And the dancers who had long graduated from our studio but whose careers we\u2019d follow obsessively were the ones who\u2019d followed a common dance trajectory. This consisted of moving to Los Angeles after high school and going to auditions until you land a spot with a company, a touring artist or you book things like music videos, in commercial dance. This is still a viable avenue for dancers. Other respectable pathways include teaching and/or choreographing. This could be at a studio or a touring convention. New options have also emerged through social media. Particularly on Instagram and TikTok, dancers can promote themselves through rehearsal footage, studio footage or even clips of them dancing in their homes. Many dancers sustain themselves and make work specifically for social media.\n\nOne can also still be seen as a \u201creal dancer\u201d if they go to college for dance. That is only if it\u2019s chosen as your major. Of course, this gets even more granular when looking at which college you study at. Deference is given to those who make it into places like Juilliard, SUNY Purchase, USC\u2019s Glorya Kaufman or NYU Tisch. But, majoring in dance is critical. During my undergraduate experience, there were multiple times I felt less than the majors. The most memorable time was when I was cast in three shows for a fall showcase. I heard one dance major argue that I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to perform, given my minor status. Even when I took the stage that fall, I felt like an imposter.\n\nIn this way, \u201creal dancers\u201d are qualified through professional, ongoing experience or education. Even if dance doesn\u2019t end up accounting for their entire income, which it doesn\u2019t for most, a real dancer can still be someone with a part-time job or a nine-to-five as long as they\u2019re dancing. More important than the dancing itself, though, may very well be showing it on social media. This is no criticism of that system. There\u2019s no reason why social media can\u2019t be a platform for artists\u2019 work, especially artists who are trying to be seen and I\u2019m in favor of decentralizing art. But this implicit system also means that someone like me, who doesn\u2019t post professional rehearsal footage, doesn\u2019t know if they can call themselves dancers anymore.\n\nAm I a real dancer?\n\nThere are many moments I think about when unraveling the question of \u201cAm I a real dancer?\u201d From the end of high school to where I am now, 24 years old and in graduate school, so many things have chipped away at the identity I\u2019d grown up with. Now I think twice, or fully forget, to tell people I dance. Which is curious because I dance every week. And not just for exercise. I dance to stop thinking and let my body capture music. I do it to be quiet and listen to my breath. I do it because it is a language I am fluent in and sometimes speak better than words. There is a comfort in a dance studio that I cannot access with my closest friends or in my best dreams. Even if I don\u2019t know anyone else in the room, dance is my peace and guides me to a place where I can finally have clarity. These are things I can never be without. And I don\u2019t mind that I\u2019m not getting paid to do it or that I pay for it. I accept that I may never be paid for dance and, therefore, fit the criteria to be seen as a dancer in the eyes of most. I also accept that the decisive factor in this question may be my insecurities \u2014 maybe the person holding me back from calling myself a dancer is me. Maybe there isn\u2019t anything that sets my current self apart from my younger self. I think back to the eight-year-old me whose favorite days of the week were the ones where she\u2019d get to wear leg warmers and bows in her hair. She got to laugh with her best friends while she stretched and chatted with the receptionist after class. Maybe all it takes to be a dancer is to feel that you belong. Whether in a professional or personal capacity, I think it should all count the same.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Yang)\n\nBy Lily Coleman\nNovember 16, 2023 at 12:05 pm PST\n\nWith just one game remaining in the 2023 regular season, and the Pac-12 Championship out of the picture, USC (7-4 overall, 5-3 Pac-12) looks to conclude its season with a victory against UCLA (6-4, 3-4).\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s been coming together, [and] everybody\u2019s been focused on the point of, hey, we\u2019re playing for our seniors, we\u2019re playing for the pride of L.A.,\u201d senior receiver Brenden Rice said. \u201cEven though we couldn\u2019t go on to conquer those dreams that we had, we have to go ahead and look at it as: this is still a great opportunity to go ahead and push forward for the next coming team, the next coming year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just proud of this group because our spirits are high, even though our record isn\u2019t where it wants to be,\u201d senior offensive lineman Justin Dedich said. \u201cThe guys are still willing to come out here and learn and get better every day and just work on trying to be the best versions of ourselves.\u201d\n\nDespite USC having a much higher-ranked total offense than UCLA at No. 9 in the country, UCLA\u2019s total defense is significantly higher than USC\u2019s at No. 10.\n\n\u201cThey remind me a little bit of the Utah D-line,\u201d redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd said. \u201c[They\u2019re] big up front, really physical, and [they] move well, so I feel like it\u2019s going to be super fun to see how their D-line goes against our O-line.\u201d\n\nUCLA has only won six of its last 24 games against the Trojans, but USC lost the last time the historic rivalry was played in the L.A. Coliseum in 2021.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a really good front seven \u2014 that\u2019s probably the strength of their team \u2014 [and] they\u2019ve got a bunch of guys that have length in the secondary,\u201d junior quarterback Caleb Williams said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a bunch of key guys on their defense that are gonna make plays, and we\u2019ve got a bunch of guys over here that are also gonna make plays, so I think it\u2019ll be a good test for us and a good battle.\u201d\n\nThe historic rivalry dates back to 1929, and USC leads the overall series against the Bruins 50-33-7.\n\n\u201cWith rivalry games, you\u2019re never gonna see the team that you watch on tape, you know they\u2019re gonna show up,\u201d senior wide receiver Tahj Washington said. \u201c[In] huge rivalry games, the energy is high, stakes are high.\u201d\n\nThis matchup will likely be Williams\u2019 last regular-season game as a Trojan, as he has yet to confirm whether or not he will play for USC next season. He is currently projected to be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\n\u201cCaleb, he\u2019s a great football player, one hell of a football player, I think everyone knows that, but he\u2019s honestly one of the best dudes off the field \u2014 very humble, just a great leader from day one,\u201d Dedich said. \u201cWhen he came in here last year, he stepped in and started leading right away. What he said really meant something, and everyone respected him.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how he wants to be remembered, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner said he hasn\u2019t put much thought into it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say a player that went out there and gave his all every play, every chance he got,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019d say a player that cares for his teammates, I\u2019d say a player that wanted to go out there and win every single game that we had.... Obviously, as a player, you want to go down and try and be one of the best and greatest players ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has that character, he has that attitude that you just have respect for, that you want to play for, and I think who he is off the field is something that I will remember for the rest of my life,\u201d Dedich said.\n\nWilliams is currently ranked No. 1 in the country in total points responsible for and No. 2 in points responsible for per game, passing yards, and passing touchdowns. He is also on watch lists for the Maxwell Award, Manning Award, Davey O\u2019Brien Award, Walter Camp Player of the Year, and Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award.\n\n\u201cEvery game, we leave it all out there for Caleb, especially with how much he does for this team, it\u2019s super cool,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cSo we definitely want to leave him out with a bang.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a disappointing year, yeah we may be disappointed as players, we may be disappointed in ourselves, or whatever the case may be because we had high hopes [and] we had high expectations for ourselves, but we\u2019ve got a special opportunity to go out here and do something special to end the season,\u201d Williams said. \u201cTo be 7-4 at this point in the season, we\u2019ve got a special opportunity to go play one of our greatest rivalries, if not the greatest rivalry for USC, and we get to show the world who USC is gonna be next year.\u201d\n\nAfter three losses in their last four games, the Trojans will take on the Bruins on Saturday at 12:30 p.m. at the L.A.

However, this year, the Rangers look like the team to beat. In a competitive Metropolitan Division, New York is 9-0-1 in its last 10 games, with loaded talent all across the board. Winger Artemi Panarin is tied for the second-most points in the NHL with 24. Panarin has been undeniably elite through 13 games thus far.\n\nThe winger has put up at least one point in every single game, and has been the biggest reason for the Rangers\u2019 success. Panarin\u2019s passing ability has been second to none so far. His connection with linemates Alexis Lafreni\u00e9re and Vincent Trocheck has allowed him to make unbelievable plays. Lafreni\u00e9re, the number one pick in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft, has lived up to his massive expectations in the new season. The young wing has broken out, after being under a critical microscope for quite some time.\n\nOn Sunday, Lafreni\u00e9re had two goals in New York\u2019s shootout win over the Blue Jackets, including the third period equalizer with 11 seconds remaining to send the game into overtime. Lafreni\u00e9re has found his groove despite the pressure, and will be a player to watch as the season progresses. Chris Kreider leads the team in goals with 10, and has been nothing but consistent this season. The longtime Ranger had three points on opening night against Buffalo, and has continued to feed off of the team\u2019s offensive chances and create some himself.\n\nOn the other end of the ice, the Rangers have the sixth highest save percentage in the league at .922. The main concern for them is keeping goaltender Igor Shesterkin healthy. The netminder has been vital to the team\u2019s success but has missed time with injuries and soreness. Backup and longtime Los Angeles Kings great Jonathan Quick, however, has been solid as a second option, with a 4-0-1 record between the pipes this season.\n\nThe Rangers are playing great right now, but must keep gas in the tank as the season continues. 107 points in the standings were not enough for them to advance in the playoffs, showing the rigor of the Metropolitan Division. If the Blueshirts can win head-to-head matchups against divisional opponents on a consistent basis, they\u2019ll have a much better chance in the postseason. The Rangers will take on the Devils Saturday in Newark, NJ.\n\nPanthers on five-game win streak, Sam Reinhart on a tear\n\nFlorida Panthers\u2019 center Sam Reinhart has been incredible this season. In Florida\u2019s last five games, all wins, Reinhard has a combined 12 points, including four goals. On a team with unclear expectations heading into the season, Reinhart has put on a show. The Panthers may have made it to the Stanley Cup Final last season, but it was a miracle that they were there in the first place, as the No. 8 seed. Plus, injuries and offseason departures took a toll on Florida\u2019s roster, adding to the uncertainty.\n\nBut, currently, the Panthers only trail the Bruins in the Atlantic Division, the team Florida severely upset in last season\u2019s playoffs. Reinhart is tied for the second most goals in the NHL with 12 and the center has 23 total points. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he has the best season of his career this season, as his career-high in total goals was 33 two seasons ago. Reinhart is tearing up all competition at the perfect time, as the Panthers are high on momentum after their Stanley Cup berth.\n\nFlorida could give the Bruins a run for their money for the division title if the Panthers keep it going. The Panthers are hot and will try to get their sixth straight win when they play the Kings tonight at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nTampa Bay Lightning: once great, now a disappointment\n\nRemember when Tampa went to three straight cups and won two? Not too long ago right? Well, those days feel long over. The Lightning got shutout in their two most recent games against the Blues and Hurricanes, and are currently 6-6-4. The Bolts have lost three straight and look tired and distraught.\n\nTheir four overtime losses are tied for the most in the league, and indicate their struggle to finish games. In Tampa Bay\u2019s defense, former Vezina winner Andrei Vasilevskiy has dealt with injury and is yet to make an appearance thus far. Vasilevskiy could certainly turn the team around, but won\u2019t be of any help on the offensive struggles. He has been practicing with the team, and the Lightning expect him to return before December, but an exact timetable is unclear.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t feel like Tampa needs to press the panic button quite yet. The Lightning have overcome adversity before, and they still have some of the most talented players in the NHL, such as Brayden Point, Nikita Kucherov, Steven Stamkos, and Victor Hedman. However, if Tampa Bay can\u2019t turn things around come the trade deadline, I speculate that some veteran players could be moved in order to give some younger prospects a chance. The Lightning will face the Blackhawks in Chicago this evening.\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

I\u2019d like to answer \u201cno,\u201d but I don\u2019t one hundred percent believe that, so I\u2019ll leave it at \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Ever since the Broncos took down the Bills 24-22 on Monday Night Football in miraculous fashion, this question has been weighing on the mind of myself and football fans across the country. Yes, the Broncos were only able to kick that game-winning field goal thanks to a costly Buffalo pass interference and an undisciplined too many men on the field infraction, but the Bills deserved to lose on Monday night. Denver essentially tried to throw that game away and still managed to emerge victorious.\n\nWhether or not they\u2019re a bad football team is up in the air, but one thing is for certain: Buffalo has some big problems they have to fix. It\u2019s already Week 11, and it feels like the Bills are sleepwalking through the season. They currently sit at 5-5, a half game above the Jets for second in the AFC East and out of the playoff picture at 10th in the AFC. Of their five losses, three were at the hands of the Broncos, Patriots and an Aaron Rodgers-less Jets. These are three teams Buffalo should absolutely be beating based on their personnel.\n\nThe schedule doesn\u2019t get any easier for the Bills from here on out either, as they finish the season with the Jets, Eagles, Chiefs, Cowboys, Chargers, Patriots and Dolphins. That\u2019s four playoff teams from last year and two others with legitimate playoff aspirations this season. To make things even more interesting, they fired offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey Tuesday morning.\n\nI don\u2019t know where the blame lies. Maybe it\u2019s on Josh Allen for turning the ball over too much, maybe it was on Ken Dorsey or maybe it\u2019s head coach Sean McDermott\u2019s fault. Whoever\u2019s to blame, they have to figure it out fast, as in before Sunday.\n\nIt might not look that exciting on paper given Buffalo\u2019s lackluster season and New York\u2019s horrendous offense, but the Bills-Jets matchup this weekend has about as much importance as a game in mid-November can have. Due to the way the AFC East has shaken out, the two are essentially each playing for their season this Sunday.\n\nAs a Jets fan, I don\u2019t know what the problem in Buffalo is, but I think they\u2019re going to slaughter Gang Green this weekend.\n\nNow that I got my weekly thoughts out of the way, let\u2019s do some fantasy gossip.\n\nJumping for Johnston\n\nHow is Quentin Johnston only rostered in a third of ESPN fantasy leagues (at the time of writing)? Well, ever since Mike Williams went down for the season with a torn ACL in September, Johnston is a name that has been constantly floating around the fantasy world. Many people had high hopes for the rookie wide receiver out of TCU, but his role on this team has been murky.\n\nAfter he had a lackluster showing in the Chargers\u2019 Monday Night Football win over the Jets a couple weeks ago, many gave up on Johnston and dropped him from their rosters. However, he may have had a resurgence last week and thrust himself into fantasy relevance again. Now, it wasn\u2019t anything special, but he did put up 13.4 PPR points on four catches for 34 yards and a touchdown.\n\nJohnston is quietly third on the Chargers in targets this season, excluding running back Austin Ekeler, and that\u2019s as someone whose highest single-game total is just six. The bottom line: Johnston appears to firmly be the No. 2 wide receiver in a high octane offense and has reached nowhere near his peak yet. There\u2019s no promise he\u2019ll reach that peak, but if he does, he\u2019ll be a legit fantasy starter.\n\nThere should be enough touches to go around in this Chargers offense for him to at least be an option at flex or to fill in for some guys on a bye week. Johnston is a low risk, high reward type of guy. No matter what your position is in your league, there\u2019s not really any downside to picking him up.\n\nTime for Ty\n\nThis is someone to pick up ASAP if you need immediate running back reinforcements. Maybe your starters are injured, or it\u2019s a rough bye week. Either way, Ty Chandler\u2019s here to save the day.\n\nWith Cam Akers out for the season, Chandler has assumed the No. 2 RB role in Minnesota. More than that, though, he was actually getting close to a 50/50 split of carries with starter Alexander Mattison on Sunday. In the Vikings win over the Saints, Chandler took his 15 touches for 45 yards and touchdown, good for a solid 10.5 PPR points.\n\nDon\u2019t get too focused on the production, but more so on the usage. Not only did he see similar carries to Mattison, but he also got touches at the goal line and scored a rushing touchdown. That is something Mattison can\u2019t say he\u2019s accomplished this season. No, I\u2019m serious. Alexander Mattison, the Vikings starting running back all season thus far, has not scored a rushing touchdown, and it\u2019s Week 11.\n\nFurther, Mattison has been in concussion protocol since the victory Sunday, and it\u2019s unlikely he can get cleared before the game this weekend, so expect Chandler to be the guy for the Vikings in Denver.\n\nAside from being a spot starter this week, he should still see a decent workload even with Mattison in the lineup, so he\u2019s worth picking up if you have the space or could use some depth at the position. He\u2019s only rostered in 3% of ESPN leagues at the time of writing, so chances are if you\u2019re reading this, he\u2019s open season.\n\nI know we discussed him last week, but I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention Noah Brown again. The Houston wide receiver had another stellar performance where he eclipsed 20 PPR points for the second week in a row. He\u2019s still out there in over 50% of ESPN leagues and absolutely shouldn\u2019t be. If you\u2019re lucky enough to see him on your waivers, claim him ASAP.\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

MLB\u2019s Athletics, or the A\u2019s for short, have played in the city since 1968, but they have their sights set on Sin City as a permanent home. If the A\u2019s leave Oakland, they\u2019ll be the third pro team to leave the city in four years, as the NBA\u2019s Warriors hitched across the bay to San Francisco in 2019, and the NFL\u2019s Raiders departed for Las Vegas in 2020. Owners took a vote on the Athletics\u2019 proposed move on Thursday. The A\u2019s needed 75% of the owners to vote \u201cyes\u201d for the move to be approved, which they received unanimously.\n\nThe Athletics\u2019 relocation saga has been anything but a gentle slope. While Las Vegas is a much more tourist-oriented, glitzy city, Oakland fans have been loyal to the team for over 50 years, through total abomination by the ownership. Owner John Fisher, whose net worth is valued at $2.6 billion according to Forbes, has turned a blind eye to quite literally everything surrounding his team. The A\u2019s finished dead last in the MLB standings in 2023 with a 50-112 record. Their roster is ridiculously unrecognizable, as their league-low $42.4 million payroll can\u2019t quite afford the typical superstars. The Athletics haven\u2019t won a World Series since 1989.\n\nWhile A\u2019s fans have gone through it all, a big justification for the team\u2019s move has been stunningly low attendance at home games. The A\u2019s averaged just over 10,000 fans per game in 2023, the lowest in baseball. Fans are certainly not to blame, though. The prehistoric Oakland Coliseum is the worst venue of all 30 teams\u2019 parks, and in conjunction with the atrocious on-field product, it drives fans away. Ownership is to blame for attendance failure.\n\nThe A\u2019s once appeared to be committed to staying in Oakland after first donning the \u201cRooted in Oakland\u201d mantra in 2017 along with rallying fans in support of the Howard Terminal project, a cutting-edge ballpark plan on Oakland\u2019s waterfront. But, typical political bureaucracy along with Fisher\u2019s one-track mindedness ultimately killed the plan, and the A\u2019s fully shifted to the Las Vegas idea back in April.\n\nThe main issue is that the A\u2019s are lacking any sort of concrete plan. The team released comically disproportionate Las Vegas stadium renderings back in May, but team officials later confessed that these illustrations ought to be wadded up \u201cfor now.\u201d Another hurdle is that while the A\u2019s received $380 million in public funds from Nevada to subsidize some construction costs, the team could very well face a legal battle with a Nevada-based teachers union. Nevada ranks 48th in the nation in education, and even a fraction of the funds the A\u2019s received could go an exceptionally long way for the struggling school system. But, we must consider that the United States practices democracy, so you decide: improve a severely underfunded school system, or fund a poorly-planned stadium for a billionaire who can most certainly afford it himself? You make the call.\n\nIt must also be considered that if the A\u2019s move to Las Vegas, the San Francisco Giants will be in complete control of the Northern California baseball market. Plus, the neighboring teams to Southern Nevada \u2014 which include the Diamondbacks, Dodgers, Angels and Padres \u2014 will suddenly have even more competition in the region. The A\u2019s want to add themselves to an already congested area, and somehow expect to generate fans despite having no history or credibility in the area. The A\u2019s are rolling the dice and going all-in on an unclear plan in Sin City.\n\nWhile MLB owners are likely to approve the relocation of the team, hurdles still stand in the way. The team\u2019s lease with the Oakland Coliseum ends at the end of 2024, and if the A\u2019s do end up moving to Las Vegas, they could be quite literally homeless until their new ballpark is ready. John Fisher might be silent and putting on a poker face to receive relocation approval, but if the plan proves to be a blunder, the A\u2019s could end up in a worse position than they are now.\n\nFollowing their move out of Oakland to Las Vegas, the Raiders still have no solid fan base or loyalty within the city, and Allegiant Stadium has instead acted as a safe haven for opposing fans to watch their teams play. The A\u2019s could certainly replicate this themselves.\n\nOakland fans find themselves in a crisis yet again, with another team on the brink of leaving. From Reggie Jackson to Rickey Henderson, the A\u2019s have had immense success and rich history in the city, but it has all faded into memories in the wake of the current regime\u2019s desire to get a cheap deal in a shiny location. Regardless of what happens, A\u2019s fans\u2019 intense support for the Green and Gold will not be forgotten. From a \u201creverse boycott\u201d held at the stadium back in June, to constant \u201csell the team\u201d chants across all 30 ballparks, the fans won\u2019t go down without a fight. However, unfortunately, the fate of their existence as fans falls into the hands of an ownership group that has given up on them.\n\nBe on the lookout for relocation updates as MLB owners meet in Arlington, TX.\n```"}

A new analysis of campaign finance data from this year found that just over 1% of donations made by USC professors went to Republican candidates or political action committees.\n\nStudents often don\u2019t get to know their professors\u2019 political preferences, yet this stark contrast shown in campaign finance donation data sheds light on the correlation between higher education and political preference. The non-partisan Pew Research Center found that in the 2020 election, voters who leaned toward or identified with the Democratic Party were much more likely than their Republican counterparts to have a college degree (41% vs. 30%).\n\nFederal Election Commission data from Jan. 1 through Aug. 30 of this year shows that those who included \u201cprofessor\u201d in their disclosed occupation and listed USC as their employer donated a total of nearly $81,000 to candidates and fundraising PACs across the country. Of that total, 99% or $80,142, went to Democratic candidates or PACs while only $841, or just above 1%, went to Republican candidates or PACs.\n\nSome donations are going beyond Southern California. Many are seeking to give their financial support to places that need it more than the Golden State. Professors donated $375 to Emily\u2019s List, a PAC that aims to help elect Democratic female candidates in favor of abortion rights to office. Another professor donated $500 to California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s Campaign for Democracy PAC, which was set up to help fund and promote Democratic candidates in Republican-led states. And another professor donated a total of $300 over the course of six months to the Fair Fight PAC, set up by Stacey Abrams in Georgia and says it promotes fair elections in Georgia and around the country.\n\nBy comparison, FEC data shows that those listing \u201cprofessor\u201d as their occupation and UCLA as their employer have donated almost $103,500 this year. Of that total, just under 5%, $5,090, went toward Republican candidates and PACs.\n\nUSC Leventhal School of Accounting Dean William Holder, who is also a professor of accounting with the Marshall School of Business, gave $500 to Max Ukropina For Congress 2024. Ukropina is running in the crowded Republican primary race to replace Rep. Katie Porter in California\u2019s 47th Congressional District. Porter is vacating the congressional seat since she is making a bid to become U.S. senator in 2024. Holder declined a request from Annenberg Media to comment on his donation. There are no other records of him making federal campaign donations to any other candidates.\n\nOther GOP donations ranged from $1 to $100 from various professors toward WinRed, a conservative and center-right fundraising platform endorsed by the Republican National Committee.\n\nThe majority of donations to Democrats were through ActBlue, a tech company organized as a PAC that allows for individual contributions, including grassroots donations, through its platform. ActBlue donations went to House, Senate and presidential candidates across the country, in amounts as small as $0.30 and as large as $100. A total of $25,773.48 was donated to candidates and PACs through the platform.\n\nOne of the biggest donors to Democrats was Karen Hennigan, an associate professor of research in Psychology at USC Dornsife. According to FEC records, Hennigan donated $5,000 to California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Hennigan\u2019s research focus at USC has centered on deterring youth from marginalized communities from joining violent groups, with a keen interest in predicting the risk of gang involvement. Her work also delves into effective gang prevention strategies and evidence-based approaches to juvenile justice prevention and intervention. These research pursuits align closely with one of the key priorities that Newsom championed during his first term.\n\nAccording to the San Diego School of Law, over the past 25 years, California has seen a notable shift in juvenile justice policies, characterized by declining youth arrest and detention rates, increased state investments in local programs and a move toward research-based alternatives to juvenile justice involvement in local probation departments. This came to a head in 2020, when Newsom introduced a proposal for full restructuring of California\u2019s juvenile justice system, a bill supported and passed by the Legislature.\n\nAnnenberg Media reached out to Hennigan for comment but did not hear back before the publishing of this article.\n\nAnother prolific donor was Geoffrey Cowan, a journalism professor and former dean of USC Annenberg, who donated a total of $6,525. Notable donations went to President Joe Biden and Montanans for Tester, a PAC set up in support of Montana Sen. Jon Tester ahead of what is expected to be a challenging reelection bid next year. Cowan\u2019s largest contribution, $2,500, was to Rep. Adam Schiff, who, like Porter, is running to be California\u2019s U.S. senator in 2024. Schiff is trailing slightly behind Porter in recent polling, 16% to her 17% according to a November UC-Berkeley/LA Times poll.\n\n\u201cThere are, I think, three excellent candidates for the Democratic side. I like all of them. But in Adams\u2019 case, I think he\u2019d be a wonderful senator,\u201d Cowan said when speaking about the race and his donation to Schiff. \u201cI think that the job he did on the impeachment proceeding was just illustrative of how talented he is. I think we need major leaders in the U.S. Senate moving ahead, and I think that he would be such a leader.\u201d\n\nCowan has long supported Democratic candidates up and down the ballot across the country. Ahead of the 2020 presidential primary, Cowan gave $10,185 between January and October of 2020 to a plethora of Senate candidates including Mark Kelly, Raphael Warnock, and Amy McGrath. This included multiple donations amounting to $1,850 to then-presidential candidate Biden.\n\nCowan has been involved with politics since the early 1960s. In 1968, while working for Sen. Eugene McCarthy during his time at Yale, Cowan founded The Commission on the Democratic Selection of Democratic Nominees. The commission worked to increase public participation in the selection of presidential candidates. He is now director of the Center on Communication Leadership and Policy and teaches a large general education seminar at USC.\n\nCowan\u2019s class, JOUR 200W, frequently hosts big-name politicians from across the political spectrum. He said he chooses people with diverse political viewpoints and expertise \u2014 an intentional setup to help students feel \u201ccomfortable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think a classroom should be a space where that\u2019s possible,\u201d he said.\n\nCowan said he makes the choice of who to donate to based on who he thinks is ethical and will make a major difference on issues he thinks are important. He also determines if a candidate would benefit from significant support.\n\nIn comparison to the $81,000 donated by professors, FEC data of those who listed working for USC with occupations other than \u201cprofessor\u201d donated roughly $100,000 from Jan. 1 through Aug. 30 of this year. Analysis of these contributions showed that $6,134 went to Republican candidates or PACs, just over 6%.\n\nUSC Rossier School of Education Dean Pedro A. Noguera, who listed his occupation as dean rather than professor, donated $500 to Rep. Barbara Lee who is also running for U.S. Senate in California alongside Schiff and Porter. Lee is currently ranked fourth in the polls according to the same UC-Berkeley/LA Times poll.\n\nNoguera told Annenberg Media that he has known Lee for 40 years.\n\n\u201cThroughout her career she has been an advocate for peace and justice,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has taken stands to advance both values even when it was unpopular. I am happy to support her candidacy for the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nOutside of those directly employed by the university, some of its biggest donors have also made major contributions to campaigns across the country. Annenberg Media reported in 2022 that Ed Roski, Jr., a USC Life Trustee, made a significant contribution to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s reelection campaign. The donation of $2 million made Roski one of the Republican governor\u2019s top donors as Texas state law does not limit the size of campaign contributions.\n```"}

(Photo by Ling Luo)\n\nBy Alea Motwane and Ari Rose-Marquez\nNovember 15, 2023 at 6:29 pm PST\n\nAs antisemitic and anti-Islam sentiments continue to spread through college campuses across the country, one dean at USC is trying to keep campus a tolerant environment for all students.\n\n\u201cEven though people have different perspectives about what\u2019s happening, what I see is the shared pain on campus, this shared sense of grief, this shared sense of seeing, feeling unseen, unheard, unsafe,\u201d said Varun Soni, dean of religious and spiritual life.\n\nIn a letter published Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Education wrote, \u201cHate-based discrimination, including based on antisemitism and Islamophobia among other bases, have no place in our nation\u2019s schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cSchools that receive federal financial assistance have a responsibility to address discrimination against Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist students, or those of another religious group,\u201d the letter said.\n\nUSC has not been immune to that violent rhetoric or the violence that often follows the turmoil. Soni said he is here to help students of all religions and backgrounds navigate frightening and uncertain times.\n\nIt is no secret that USC students from the Israeli and Palestinian communities have been dealing with acts of discrimination. A video of a pro-Israeli economics professor went viral due to the comments he made at a pro-Palestine peaceful protest. Videos also went viral of students taking down flyers of kidnapped Israeli hostages.\n\nSoni, who has been working at USC for 15 years, described his position as \u201cessentially the university chaplain\u201d and his role as to, \u201cjust be with our students to walk alongside them, to cry with them, to pray with them, and to help them express themselves in ways that they find meaningful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an extremely difficult time for many students on campus, particularly Israeli and Jewish students and Muslim Palestinian and Arab students,\u201d said Soni. \u201cAntisemitism is at historically high levels on university campuses. We\u2019ve seen Islamophobia and anti-Arab hate at levels that we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nSoni said that \u201cbehind closed doors,\u201d his Israeli and Palestinian students, colleagues and friends are both \u201ctelling [him] the same thing.\u201d He said that since Israel and Palestine are \u201cvery small place[s],\u201d many people on campus are \u201cgrieving for people who they actually know.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just existential grief for many people on our campus. It\u2019s personal grief,\u201d he said.\n\nSoni also mentioned that students are feeling lonely and wondering why their friends aren\u2019t checking in on them. \u201cIn some ways, they\u2019re feeling a bit abandoned,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Soni, the two primary concerns of USC are free speech and public safety. Soni added that he has seen students express themselves freely through visuals, teachings and gatherings.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had any, thank goodness, incidents of violence [on campus]. We have seen, not just hate speech, but hate violence on other campuses,\u201d he said\n\nUSC works with DPS, LAPD and local law enforcement officers, and those public safety officials meet with students before events to, \u201cmake sure [we] are clear as to what\u2019s happening so [we] can keep everyone safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between psychological safety and physical safety,\u201d Soni said. \u201cIn the age of antisemitism and Islamophobia, it is totally understandable that people don\u2019t psychologically feel safe.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about what USC is doing and could do further to support students in the Palestinian and Israeli communities, Soni said, \u201cWe\u2019re meeting every day with people and we\u2019re listening with open minds and open hearts and we\u2019re trying to get better... There\u2019s no template for this particular situation. So we\u2019re all just trying to do the best for our community and get better in partnership with our community.\u201d\n\nSoni also added that he believed it is a \u201cshared responsibility.\u201d \u201cThe best source of support that students have is other students,\u201d he said.\n\nPalestinian and Israeli communities across schools in California have also been facing discrimination on campus. At Stanford University, a black S.U.V. hit an Arab Muslim student and yelled \u201cF you and your people,\u2019\u2019 and drove off. The student was treated for injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nIn a message to the campus community after the incident, Stanford University wrote, \u201cStanford is continuing to work to provide a safe and secure campus environment,\u201d and that additional security has been \u201cdeployed at key locations on campus\u201d\n\nAt UCLA, Pro-Palestinian students were beating a pi\u00f1ata with an image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with the chant, \u201cBeat that f\u2013king Jew.\u201d In a message to the college community, Gene Block, chancellor of UCLA issued a joint statement with the University of California President Michael V. Drake and the UC chancellors, who he joined in, \u201cissuing a forceful condemnation of incidents of bigotry, intolerance and intimidation that have taken place on UC campuses \u2014 including UCLA \u2014 over the past several weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn our diverse university community, even if we disagree with someone passionately, we cannot devolve into dehumanizing them with rhetoric, treating them with prejudice or jeopardizing their safety,\u201d Block wrote.\n\nAt UC Berkeley, a law professor wrote an opinion essay in The Wall Street Journal titled, \u201cDon\u2019t Hire My Anti-Semitic Law Students.\u201d Students on campus have now reported that they have been threatened and doxxed, and have been wearing masks while attending protests due to the fear of being captured and posted on social media.\n\nU.C. Berkeley\u2019s chancellor, Carol Christ, sent a message to the Berkeley campus community saying, \u201cWe will not tolerate our students harming one another. Disagreement and differing points of view are an essential part of campus life, and we expect that you treat one another with the same respect and dignity that we are modeling here.\u201d\n\nThe message also shared several resources for students who had been threatened or harassed.\n\nFor Soni, USC President Carol Folt\u2019s words helped to capture his sentiment on the matter. \u201cEncouraging all of us to be civil, to be respectful, to be compassionate, to be supportive, to see each other as Trojans, to see our own experiences and each other, I think that\u2019s absolutely the right message,\u201d Soni said of Folt\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cAnd if it\u2019s just the university\u2019s responsibility, we can only do so much. But if it\u2019s a shared responsibility across the university community, we can do so much more together we can be better together.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of Sam Javanrouh)\n\nBy Ruben Flores November 15, 2023 at 6:14 pm PST\n\nJason Bateman\u2019s advice to Trojans is don\u2019t be full of... well, you know it when you smell it. \u201cBe vulnerable, be honest, be you. It\u2019s infectious. People just smell it. You can\u2019t fake it. Don\u2019t waste your time learning how to be full of sh*t. Because it is a waste of time.\u201d\n\nIn conversation about demystifying the entertainment industry for newcomers and the importance of authenticity in acting and life, Bateman visited Bovard Auditorium Tuesday night as part of the School of Dramatic Arts\u2019 Spotlight series. Known for his award-winning work in projects ranging from acting and directing on the crime drama \u201cOzark\u201d to voice acting work in \u201cZootopia,\u201d Bateman has been a staple of the entertainment industry for several decades.\n\nFrom playing roles in gripping thrillers and absurdist comedies to filling the roles of guest star, executive producer and everything in between, Bateman shared his expertise in acting with an electric crowd of USC students, moderated by SDA professor and experienced actress Alexandra Billings.\n\n\u201cHere comes Thanksgiving, right?\u201d Bateman said. \u201cYou guys are going to go home and grandma is going to tell you a story. You love her, and so you know how to be convincingly engaged. But your sibling is sitting there, too, and your sibling knows when you\u2019re full of sh*t. The camera is your sibling. And that\u2019s not difficult if you just stay inside your boundaries of what is going to convince my sibling that I\u2019m not acting.\u201d\n\nWhile he says his work isn\u2019t anywhere near what\u2019s being done by people like Daniel Day-Lewis or Christian Bale, he\u2019s found joy in acting that has the confidence to fade back and serve the narrative. His roles in \u201cOzark,\u201d \u201cArrested Development,\u201d along with countless others, were examples of him taking advantage of his own skill set, something he encourages others to hone in on.\n\n\u201cYou find actors that fit the character, or are making a choice at the audition that lives inside their skill set,\u201d Bateman said on the process of auditioning for roles. \u201cMake a good guess that lives inside something you can pull off. And if they don\u2019t want that, then you\u2019re not going to get the job, that\u2019s fine. But at least you haven\u2019t said, \u2018I can do this over the course of seven years.\u2019 You might not be able to.\u201d\n\nThe event comes about a week after the end of the massive actors\u2019 strike in the industry that brought to light the increasingly unsustainable wage conditions many actors face. While the new contract will hopefully bring better financial agreements for actors, Bateman acknowledged that the industry is just naturally difficult to navigate for those on screen.\n\nThe key, according to him, is to not let the down-times in between projects get under your skin. \u201cIn a great year, you\u2019re fired six times,\u201d Bateman said. \u201cAnd so you need to have a sense of self and worth and talent and uniqueness. By the definition of uniqueness, it\u2019s not right for everything. It\u2019s perfect for a few things\u201d\n\nThe actors\u2019 strike was also a chance to highlight topics of diversity and inclusion in Hollywood and the entertainment industry at large, particularly the relative lack of women, people of color and people from the LGBTQ+ community in those spaces. Professor Billings asked Bateman bluntly, as a \u201cmixed-raced trans woman\u201d talking to a successful \u201cwhite, straight and cisgender\u201d actor, what assurance could he offer to the diverse crowd that they would have a space when they graduate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of a cynical effort that some studios and some production companies are doing whereby they\u2019re trying to win this optics craze,\u201d Bateman said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s like a little scorecard that Deadline puts out every year. It\u2019s a little insincere, parts of it. But for the most part, it\u2019s fantastic that there\u2019s an effort to catch up and right the scales.\u201d\n\nFor Bateman, while the drive for change is there, what is still lacking are resources and proper investment in those who come from marginalized communities. Oftentimes, studios will hire diverse employees without giving them the proper support, ending up in everyone having a poor experience, and discouraging that artist from wanting to continue their passion. Bateman wants to start being a remedy for that disconnect.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an advocate of creating a shadow program whereby folks like you just get to hang out on a set for a week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so fun on a set, it\u2019s so easy and the mystique is destroyed immediately.

Beginning Monday, Operation G.I.F.T. (Group Initiative For Theft-prevention) will provide free parking over breaks at the Grand Avenue Parking Structure (UPX) at University Park Campus (UPC) and the Health Sciences Campus\u2019 (HSC) Valley Parking Lot.\n\nStudents, faculty and staff can participate in the free parking program for Thanksgiving and winter breaks by filling out the registration form linked on the Department of Public Safety\u2019s website. The form requires participants to fill out basic personal information, as well as information about their vehicle. Students, faculty, and staff who wish to request parking before the program\u2019s official start date, or extend their parking beyond the program\u2019s scheduled end date, can visit USC Transportation\u2019s office in-person to request an extension.\n\nDPS and USC Transportation began the parking initiative in 2005 as a \u201ccrime prevention measure\u201d to get student, faculty and staff members\u2019 vehicles off streets around campus and into monitored parking structures, according to DPS Crime Analyst Wyman A. Thomas. \u201cBack then, in 2004, we used to see a high number of car break-ins or car thefts reported either after the breaks or during the breaks...so this was birthed out of trying to lower the numbers so that we would not have any victims,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nThis year\u2019s program will run through Monday, Jan. 8, 2024, the first day of spring classes. In addition to free parking spots, Operation G.I.F.T. guarantees participants 24-hour patrolling by DPS officers, Thomas said. \u201cDuring that time, we place a heavy emphasis on patrol presence in that particular parking structure, because that\u2019s where all of our participants are,\u201d said Thomas.\n\nWhile Operation G.I.F.T. initially began with 200 to 300 vehicles, Thomas said DPS now monitors just under 1,000 vehicles at UPC during breaks. The program expanded to provide free parking at HSC around 2007.\n\nWith the free parking initiative in place, Thomas said DPS has seen an overall \u201cdecrease in vehicle crimes\u201d over Thanksgiving and winter Breaks, as DPS has not experienced vehicle thefts and burglaries in designated G.I.F.T. parking structures since launching the program. He explained, however, that the department has seen spikes in the frequency of these crimes among non-participants who leave their cars unattended on public streets. \u201cNot all [reports] are USC faculty and staff, but they are within the patrol area, so they do come to DPS to make a report,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nAccording to Thomas, around the same time that DPS and the Department of Transportation extended their free parking initiative to HSC, the departments introduced their free shuttle program to Los Angeles International Airport for students, faculty and staff flying out of LAX over Thanksgiving and Winter breaks. This year, buses will depart from the Widney Alumni House on Nov. 21-22 and Dec. 12-15 at ten set departure times between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Seats on the shuttles are limited, and those wishing to use the free service to LAX must register by November 17 for Thanksgiving break rides, and Dec. 8 for winter break rides. The link to register can be found here.\n\nG.I.F.T. parking is only available at the UPC Grand Ave Parking Structure and HSC Valley Parking Lot, and there is a one-vehicle limit per participant.

The Israel-Hamas war has exacerbated existing struggles between the Israeli and the Palestinian communities - which are also felt by communities in Southern California. NewGround, a Muslim-Jewish community building partnership, works with bridging the gaps between the groups today. Coordinator Ben Ginsberg talks about some of their recent struggles.\n\nBen Ginsberg: Our goal is to help people be seen the way they want to be seen and heard the way they want to be heard. What is being tested right now is people\u2019s ability to understand multiple perspectives and multiple narratives and to offer comfort to each other. Even within a community, there are vastly different perspectives that have to be taken into account.\n\nGinsberg: So in interfaith circles, even for Jews among Jews and Muslims among Muslims, there can still be a lot of misunderstanding. There\u2019s still immense diversity in experiences and perspectives and narratives. With the war\u2019s escalation of issues in the Middle East, Ginsberg says it is easier for some to react with hate, bigotry and even violence.\n\nGinsberg: A lot of people across the board feel that their lives are in danger, that their identifies are in danger. And that can narrow - that can narrow our understanding, impede our compassion and it can lead us to dehumanize each other.\n\nToday, another group is attempting to bridge the gap between Israeli Jewish and Palestinian communities. Estee Chandler: We are advocating for Palestinian equality. This is Estee Chandler, founder of the Jewish Voice for Peace in Los Angeles. The JVP put on a demonstration in Hollywood to call for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. Chandler says both government officials and people in the media have been promoting falsehoods and offensive narratives about the Palestinian people.\n\nChandler: This is a tactic that is used to try to justify the suppression and murder of human beings and we simply will not let it stand. This should not be done in our name, and never again must always mean never again for anybody.\n\nChandler does not believe that this is a matter of a Muslim and Jewish conflict, but instead a situation in which she saw the Israeli community and the Palestinian community to be linked.\n\nChandler: Palestinians must have equality and freedom if my family in Israel will ever see a life of safety and true freedom.\n\nProtesters rallied for the JVP ceasefire demonstration this afternoon in Hollywood. Demonstrator Sarah Jacobus shared her thoughts ahead of the event.\n\nSarah Jacobus: The purpose of it is to assert that we as Jews are calling very unequivocally for a ceasefire in Israel\u2019s bombing of Gaza and that we object to the weaponizing of our grief over the deaths of both Israelis and Palestinians by this massive assault on a civilian population.\n\nA protester who asked to remain anonymous also gave their reason being here.\n\nProtester: I want peace. I want innocent people to stop dying in my name. It doesn\u2019t feel good.

In 2019, a pair of undergraduate students at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County isolated a new virus satellite from a soil bacterium. They named it \u201cMindFlayer\u201d. But recent research showed there was not one but two microbes attached to each other. The two viruses were harvested from a clump of dirt in Poolesville, Maryland. Microbiologists from UMBC then gave the satellite a similar name and they called it \u201cMiniFlayer\u2019.\n\nMiniFlayer is a type of virus that latches itself onto the necks of other soil viruses, like a vampire, then travels and thrives on the back of the bigger virus. Professor Steven Caruso, Lecturer in Biological Sciences at UMBC compares MiniFlayer to a \u201cviral hitchhiker.\u201d\n\nSteven Caruso: In this case, this virus doesn\u2019t need nearly as many genes, is much smaller, and is able to hitchhike, calling it a hitchhiker would be just as reasonable as calling it a vampire virus. In this case, the helper virus is bacteriophage, which means that it is a natural predator for soil bacterium. MiniFlayer lost its ability to lie dormant. In response to that, the satellite has gone on the offensive with horror-movie creativity. Pr. Ivan Erill, a biology Professor at UMBC, compares it to a vampire sinking its teeth into its prey. The team of researchers even found \u201cbite marks\u201d where MiniFlayer\u2019s tendrils were attached.\n\nA recent study in the Journal of the International Society for Microbial Ecology explains this virus lost the ability to reproduce itself. MiniFlayer takes advantage of another bigger virus by grabbing onto its neck. When they enter cells together, MiniFlayer copies its companion\u2019s genetic to mutate.\n\nNow, having two viruses interacting with each other is not uncommon though. What\u2019s unique is the interaction between the two. Caruso: That\u2019s all over the place, viruses that need helper, viruses to infect but we\u2019ve never seen one that needed to be attached to another one.\n\nThe discovery was made by students Jenell Lewis and Hira Ahmed during a lab workshop with Pr. Caruso. Caruso: This was part of a class that I teach for junior and senior level biology majors at UMBC and I have 120 students that work in pairs in an elective lab, so it was a pair of students that were working on this virus.\u201d\n\nResearchers are looking into using phages as medicine against bacteria. \u201cViral satellites have the potential to transform how researchers understand antiviral strategies, but there is still a lot to learn about them,\u201d Pr.

But the thing I have trouble with is finding a place to charge my computer,\u201d said Emma Fallon, a sophomore studying political science.\n\nFallon suggested the school open up more spaces indoors and advertise spaces that students don\u2019t know about. \u201cI feel like students mainly only know that there\u2019s Doheny and Leavey when there are other libraries,\u201d Fallon said.\n\nOn the r/USC Reddit page, students are already complaining about the lack of late-night study areas. \u201cWhy are there not more buildings open late for studying?\u201d asked Reddit user Parking_savior129 on November 6, which got upvoted 115 times by other users.\n\nUnder the post, students shared locations that open late at night, such as the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and the Center for International and Public Affairs.\n\nOf the 18 libraries listed on the USC Libraries website, only Leavey Library is open 24 hours on weekdays for students who want to study at night, which makes it crowded even late at night. Doheny Library, which is another popular library for students to study, closes at 10 p.m. or earlier.\n\nBut the lack of study space isn\u2019t unique to Trojans. Leon Wu, a sophomore studying business and computer science at UC Berkeley, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit hard to find a spot in the library, but if you\u2019re willing to go to libraries that are less popular, there will be spaces...At night, there are a lot of people in the library as well, even at 2 a.m.\u201d\n\nOne graduate student who completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Iowa said the problem persists there, as well. \u201cWhile I think the University of Iowa\u2019s main libraries are a little bit more full of resources and facilities that you can use, the sheer number of different libraries on USC campus kind of makes up for it,\u201d said Kuper Bergman, a master\u2019s student in East Asian area studies.\n\n\u201cUSC has a huge student body, bigger than I want to say UCLA and UCSB because my family\u2019s familiar with those schools. But I\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s a relatively small campus. I do think it\u2019s hard because we are limited with space,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nBesides Leavey and Doheny, students have found other places to study during the daytime. \u201c[The library] is usually packed to the brim. So I usually end up either sitting outside at a table with someone or I\u2019ll sit at one of the little aisle seats before you get into the main rooms,\u201d said Carina Vo-Ta, a junior studying communication.\n\n\u201cI feel like L.A. has such beautiful weather and I always find myself studying outside on the Annenberg patio or the SCA patio,\u201d Peterson said.\n```"}

The members ate enchiladas, carnitas tacos and drank mojitos, reminiscing on the years of attending USC as a scholar for the Latino Alumni Association.\n\n\u201cAs a student, our job focused on creating programming to help with college retention and improve the graduation rate for Latino alumni,\u201d said Maxine Enciso, an LAA Scholar and alumnus from the class of 1996. \u201cIt was a lot of pride to see that Latinos were very present at USC and that we could celebrate in a really special way that is uniquely authentic by being with the program.\u201d\n\nAlumni from the Latino Alumni Association celebrate their achievements as scholars with Tommy the Trojan on Saturday, November 4, 2023.   (Nova Blanco-Rico)\n\nThe LAA was founded in 1973, known then as the Mexican-American Alumni Association, to assist Latino students with the cost of college. It was established to help increase the number of Latino students attending USC.\n\nAnother student who benefited from LAA\u2019s early creation was Francis Quintero, who graduated in 1977 with an engineering degree. \u201cBecoming a scholar enabled me to socialize a bit more and extend myself to students who were coming in,\u201d Quintero said. \u201cThey helped me get a job in the administration offices and I was able to meet incoming students and a lot of Latino students coming in and direct them to resources like tutors and events.\u201d\n\nAdding that without the funding and mentorship and overall support from LAA was a critical part of her success at USC.\n\nFunding and academic support were what many LAA scholars found the most helpful, but even with all those benefits, connecting with other Latinos was just as important.\n\n\u201cI think the networking and the community was so important coming to USC,\u201d Gina Galasso, an accounting graduate of 1993, said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anybody in my family who went to college, so it was daunting. But having those bridges and friends to be able to ask questions and help me navigate the campus was tremendously helpful. It was just a big family.\u201d\n\nOver the past 49 years, LAA has awarded more than $22.4 million in scholarships to about 9,400 Latine students. Many of the graduated alumni are in different fields such as communications, engineering and accounting.\n\nRoberto Garcia, who graduated in 1982 with a degree in social science, later became mayor of  Santa Monica in 2015 to 2016 . \u201cI rarely saw any Latinos, not only in my classes, but even in the professors,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cSo my support system came from the association and honestly without them I probably would have dropped out.\u201d\n\nAdding that due to LAA, he aimed to enrich other Latine individuals and support those who will come after.\n\nThanks to LAA, many students who came from a time of prejudice and isolation found a home. For many alumni, the program gave them a new \u201cfamily.\u201d\n\nThe LAA will host a 50th-anniversary celebration on March 2, 2024. In collaboration with  USC D\u00cdMELO , they will be creating a yearbook with alumni of the past 50 years. Submissions can be turned in  here.

The game will kick off for the 93rd time Saturday at 12:30 p.m. at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, marking the first time USC has had a home game start before 1 p.m. since the Trojans\u2019 9 a.m. start against Arizona State in 2020.\n\nFor USC students, it means setting an alarm much earlier than on a typical game day and coming to grips with the reality that the once-high-flying football team isn\u2019t as interesting to national audiences anymore, leading to an earlier start time.\n\n\u201cI was expecting a night game, but since we\u2019re not ranked anymore, I think that plays into it,\u201d said junior Bella Thurman. \u201cI think the excitement of it goes down a little bit just because there\u2019s not as much anticipation.\u201d\n\nThurman, who is studying acting, said she\u2019s planning on getting up at 8 a.m. to get ready. \u201cI usually sleep in on game days, but it\u2019ll be an early morning,\u201d Thurman said.\n\nRedshirt senior defensive lineman De\u2019jon Benton said the earlier start doesn\u2019t phase him, and he expects that head coach Lincoln Riley will have the team show up around 9 a.m.\n\n\u201cThe early game feels good,\u201d Benton said. \u201cI hope we pack the Coli and everybody enjoys themselves and has a good time.\u201d\n\nUSC leads the rivalry 50-33 all-time, and won last year\u2019s matchup at the Rose Bowl 48-45. This year, the game is on USC\u2019s senior day, which brought up lots of emotions for Benton since it may be his last game in a USC uniform.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only in this space for a certain amount of time, so I want people to come out and enjoy themselves,\u201d Benton said.\n\nThurman said she was \u201csuper surprised\u201d when kickoff was announced for a time slot that wasn\u2019t in the late afternoon or evening. The earliest home game USC has played this year was on September 2 against Nevada, which started at 3:30 p.m. The Trojans\u2019 earliest game overall was a road matchup against Colorado, which was at 10 a.m. (9 a.m. in Los Angeles).\n\nJunior Krisha Suri, a self-proclaimed \u201cUCLA hater,\u201d thinks that the early start time could be a good thing for fans at both schools.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to start tailgating at 9 a.m., but I think it prevents a lot of people from building up hatred and anger,\u201d Suri said.\n\nSuri is also part of the Helenes, a group of students who protect the Hecuba statue in the USC Village from possible tampering and pranks by UCLA fans during rivalry week. With 31 hours of protecting the statue already under her belt, she said she is excited to get away from the statue and into the Coliseum for the game \u2014 even with scattered showers expected to hit L.A. that day.\n\n\u201cRain or shine, we\u2019re going to be there, so it doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d Suri said.\n```"}

(Graphic by Katie Simons)\n\nBy Katie Simons\nNovember 15, 2023 at 12:11 pm PST\n\nEach year on Thanksgiving as my mom seasons the turkey, my sister candies the vegetables, my dad tends to the fire and my brother fills the apple, but me? I am upstairs with my iPad, inevitably rewatching my favorite Thanksgiving-themed TV show episodes. In my humble teen drama-obsessed opinion, Thanksgiving episodes are almost always the best holiday-themed episodes in a series. Halloween episodes often get too entangled with paying homage to horror films to move the plot forward, and the joyful spirit tends to force Christmas episodes to end on a happy, hopeful note. However, when every character gathers around the table for Thanksgiving dinner, the tension is always as thick as their cranberry sauce.\n\nThe recipe for a great Thanksgiving episode included three ingredients: tension, nostalgia and autumnal vibes. For tension, I want several ill-timed secrets to accidentally spill out right as the characters are sitting down to eat. For nostalgia, the finest Thanksgiving episodes allow the characters to reflect on the best and worst moments of their year, giving the viewers an opportunity to revel in the in-show callbacks. And even though by the time Thanksgiving usually rolls around tree leaves have long fallen off and the temperature is dipping into the negatives, the best Thanksgiving episodes provide viewers with a warm, cozy feeling of fall.\n\n\u201cBlair Waldorf Must Pie!\u201d (\u201cGossip Girl\u201d 1x09)\nNot only is this one of my favorite Thanksgiving episodes of all time, but this may be my favorite \u201cGossip Girl\u201d episode of all time. The episode is equal parts drama and nostalgia as flashbacks from the prior Thanksgiving key the viewer into the characters\u2019 earlier lives while playing out against the current tension at the table. Plus, who doesn\u2019t love fall in New York City? Until this episode, there had been hints of drama, but as dinner is served, the full extent of their personal messes comes out. Serena and Dan (who are dating) find out that Dan\u2019s father and Serena\u2019s mother have been in a relationship. Blair\u2019s struggle with perfectionism becomes fully realized as she relapses into her eating disorder that had been kept a secret from viewers. Nate\u2019s father is hospitalized for drug use and his catalogue-esque family begins to fall apart. Yet despite these huge blowouts, the episode ends with the characters each having a greater emotional understanding of themselves, their friends or their family. The flashbacks from the prior Thanksgiving let the viewer understand the cracks that were forming in these complex relationships. Blair\u2019s father mentions the male model that he eventually leaves Blair\u2019s mother for. Blair pulls Serena out of a bar on Thanksgiving morning. Dan wistfully wishes he could date Serena. The episode is a full circle moment, where the personal growth of each character is impactful.\n\n\u201cThanksgiving\u201d (\u201cGlee\u201d 4x08)\nOne of the sillier episodes on the list, this \u201cGlee\u201d episode melds humor, nostalgia and drama quite impressively. While this episode is not perfect (see: the glee club\u2019s cover of  \u201cGangnam Style\u201d  and Rachel and Kurt\u2019s mashup of  \u201cIt\u2019s Turkey Lurkey Time\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Have a Kiki\u201d ), it\u2019s the first time many of the main characters reunite after graduating. The former members return to help mentor the new glee club members before their upcoming competition. The episode calls back to past seasons with an Unholy Trinity performance, a classic Santana and Quinn slap scene and the first phone call between Blaine and Kurt after their breakup. But perhaps the best part of the episode is the first scene, where the returning members sing a  mashup  of \u201cHomeward Bound\u201d by Simon and Garfunkel and \u201cHome\u201d by Phillip Phillips. Over the years I\u2019ve come to associate this cozy cover with Thanksgiving season.\n\n\u201cWelcome Back, Bitches!\u201d (\u201cGinny & Georgia\u201d 2x01)\nNearly two years after the end of their  record-breaking , but also  controversial , first season, Netflix\u2019s \u201cGinny and Georgia\u201d had to make a statement with their first episode back. In a departure from the jovial first season, this episode leans much darker as the scenes alternate between Georgia\u2019s Thanksgiving with her new fiance\u2019s family and Ginny\u2019s Thanksgiving with her father and brother. The following day, Georgia and Ginny reunite after Ginny ran away because she discovered Georgia murdered Ginny\u2019s stepfather in order to protect her. The two, along with Georgia\u2019s fiance and Ginny\u2019s father and brother celebrate Fry-Yay, a version of Thanksgiving Georgia created when she was struggling to make ends meet because she had to work on the holiday. So not only are we treated to Thanksgiving dinner tension, but Fry-Yay is also filled with internal anger and uncomfortable emotion, making this episode an absolute must for a Thanksgiving rewatch.\n\n\u201cThanksgiving\u201d (\u201cHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series\u201d 1x07)\nI\u2019ll admit, I know this is a bit goofy to include on my list, but this episode of the Disney+ drama checks every box of what I want in a Thanksgiving episode as the members of the East High Drama Club come together for a post-dinner Thanksgiving party. The lead-up to the party gives the viewer more insight into each character\u2019s life, providing some needed backstory to the new show. Ricky and his newly single father poorly attempt at making dinner, Gina spends the holiday alone because her mom is working and E.J. and Ashlyn\u2019s parents are away on a cruise. Yet despite these struggles, the group can still find joy in celebrating the holiday together. What this episode does best is solidify the \u201cfound-family\u201d nature of the group. Despite their in-fighting and personal drama, it becomes clear that these characters hold real admiration and appreciation for their classmates. The episode is wholesome and shows character growth while still being exciting to watch and creating new, meaningful drama. And for dessert, we get a great Olivia Rodrigo song out of the episode.\n\n\u201cA Deep Fried Korean Thanksgiving\u201d (\u201cGilmore Girls\u201d 3x09)\nIn this episode, the Gilmore Girls are tasked with eating their way through four different Thanksgiving meals, meaning there are four different chances for drama. At their first meal, Lane is hiding her secret boyfriend from her strict mother. At the next meal, Sookie, a stressed-out chef, deals with her husband butchering their turkey. At Luke\u2019s, Rory and Jess navigate making their relationship public. However, the best scene of this episode occurs at the final Thanksgiving destination \u2014 the Gilmore grandparents\u2019 home. Here, Lorelai learns that Rory applied to Yale in addition to Harvard without telling her. Despite the tension of the moment, the  classic \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d volleying  back and forth of dialogue adds humor and keeps the viewer on their toes.\n\n\u201cThanks Ungiven\u201d (\u201cLife Unexpected\u201d 2x10)\nYou know how everyone has that one show they were obsessed with that no one else has ever heard of? \u201cLife Unexpected\u201d was mine. The plot of the show\u2014rich popular boy and loner girl get together on prom night, girl gets pregnant and doesn\u2019t tell boy, girl puts daughter in foster care. Flashforward 15 years, and the daughter comes to meet her parents\u2014create the perfect trappings for a dramatic, secrets-filled Thanksgiving episode. Set in Portland, the dreary weather captures a perfect Thanksgiving vibe right away. The tension grows over as the group makes dinner and unexpected guests continue to show up. Between three secret affairs, a pregnancy test, a student-teacher relationship and drunk parents, there\u2019s plenty of drama for all party members and viewers to delight in.\n\n\u201cSpiderwebs\u201d (Degrassi: The Next Generation\u201d 13x16)\nWhile these high schoolers are celebrating Canadian Thanksgiving and not American Thanksgiving, there\u2019s still plenty of drama to be served. As the Degrassi High students put on a Thanksgiving dinner and show community members, they must deal with friend alliances being tested and with the drama that comes with significant others returning home from college. Many moons ago, it was this episode that introduced me to the idea of a \u201cturkey dump,\u201d where a partner returns from college for the holiday and breaks up with their counterpart. This episode structure allows the viewers to check up on how fan favorites are doing in college, while still keeping the current student\u2019s plots moving.\n\nThe Treasure of Serena Madre (\u201cGossip Girl\u201d 3x11)\nWhile I will always prefer the \u201cGossip Girl\u201d season one Thanksgiving episode, this list could not be complete without \u201cThe Treasure of Serena Madre,\u201d as it contains perhaps the most  iconic Thanksgiving scene  of all time. In a single, three minute and 21-second scene, Jenny reveals she knows her step-brother and best friend sabotaged her Cotillion debut, Blair accuses her mother of being pregnant, Rufus learns his wife lied about her mother\u2019s cancer and Maureen blackmails her husband and Serena to end their affair with a video of them kissing. Before they\u2019ve even started eating, five characters have stormed off from the table. However, what makes this scene iconic is Jason Derulo\u2019s song \u201cWhatcha Say\u201d playing in the background. This absolutely perfect music choice balances humor with the table\u2019s tension and has inspired an entire TikTok trend of video recreations.\n```"}

The Trojans fell 70-60 Tuesday night at Galen Center, their first loss of the season.\n\nBy Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as\nNovember 15, 2023 at 11:02 am PST\n\nThe No. 16 USC Trojans lost for the first time this season Tuesday night\u2019s matchup against the unranked UC Irvine Anteaters. The Trojans fell to 2-1, as the Anteaters got their first win in Galen since 2012.\n\n\u201cWe deserved to lose this game by the way we played,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s on me. ... We have to execute better offensively during the game.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans shot a season-low 19% from beyond the arc, while also having 15 turnovers. Anteaters red-shirt senior guard Justin Hohn led all scorers with 25 points. Freshman guard Isaiah Collier led the Trojans with a career-high 23 points; however, he finished with a team-high seven turnovers.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s freshman making freshman mistakes,\u201d Collier said about his high turnover night. \u201cI take the blame for that.\u201d\n\nJunior forward Harrison Hornery notched a career-high in points, with 17, and 3-pointers, with four. Hornery was the only Trojan to make a 3-pointer against UC Irvine.\n\n\u201cI am just trying to do whatever to help this team win,\u201d Hornery said.\n\nEntering the game, the Trojans were already shorthanded, battling some key injuries from the last week with Boogie Ellis, Kobe Johnson and Bronny James all out. Even Collier, who played, was battling an injury as well, keeping him out of three days of practice.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a good week of practice, probably the worst week we have had in the last few years, because of injuries,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nThe Trojans struggled all of the first half, finding themselves trailing at halftime for the first time this season, 29-26. The team could not find any rhythm from beyond the arch, shooting 18% in the first half.\n\n\u201cWe were not locked in,\u201d Collier said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t start the game off with energy.\u201d\n\nHohn was leading the charge early for the Anteaters, tallying 13 points in the first half. Irvine was able to disrupt any of the Trojans\u2019 inside game in the first half, outscoring USC 10-8 in the paint.\n\n\u201cHohn got hot, made some tough shots. Give him credit,\u201d Enfield said.\n\nComing out of halftime, Enfield adopted to go with the hot-hand in Hornery over freshman forward Arrinten Page. However, the Anteaters picked up right where they left off, starting the second-half on a 7-0 run.\n\nThe Trojans tried a variety of mixed coverages, going in and out of man-to-man and full-court press, to get the Anteaters offense off track. However, the Trojans\u2019 offensive woes proved to be more detrimental, finishing the game shooting 28% from the field.\n\n\u201cIf we are scoring like we did, it doesn\u2019t really matter if we can\u2019t get stops on the other end,\u201d Hornery said.\n\nThe Trojans did not lead for a single second in the 2nd half, because of 11 turnovers they surrendered in the half. With 37 seconds left, red-shirt junior forward Devin Tillis iced the game with a corner 3-pointer to give the Anteaters a six-point lead. A failed next possession for the Trojans sealed the win for the Anteaters.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing we can take away is preparation,\u201d Hornery said. \u201cWe need to prep better and take no one lightly.\u201d\n\nNext on the calendar for the Trojans is a home game on Sunday against Brown with tipoff at 5 p.m.\n```"}

{"key": "/2023/11/14/the-big-ten-breakdown-vol-2-is-excitement-looming-in-the-air/", "response": "```\nThe Big Ten Breakdown, Vol. II\n\n\u201cThe Big Ten Breakdown, Vol. II\u201d is a column by Terence Holton about the new look of college football. As the final season of the Pac-12 is coming to a close, four schools are planning to face the harsh midwestern winters of the Big Ten. Two of these schools have excelled, and two have failed to meet expectations. However, I bet they are all looking to what the future holds in the Big Ten. So how excited are these teams to join the Big Ten?\n\nUSC excitement level: 3/10\nThe Trojans have looked bad this season. There\u2019s truly no other way to say it. If I had told myself in August this year that USC would be 7-4 right now, I wouldn\u2019t believe it. The USC defense is dreadful, as they currently rank No. 124 in total defense. ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FOURTH! As I said in my last column, the Trojans will be up against arguably the best rushing attacks in the country next season with teams who play tough, nitty-gritty football. While the defense has time to mend, as USC will be looking for a new defensive coordinator, a lot needs to be done. The offense will be most likely without junior quarterback Caleb Williams and senior receivers Tahj Washington and Brenden Rice, so goodbye to the Trojans\u2019 best playmakers in the passing game. While the freshmen on this team are very promising in the passing game, there is no guarantee they will make the leaps USC may need. While I bet head coach Lincoln Riley will land a stellar transfer portal recruiting class to bring in some more talent, this team needs coaching. The defense is an issue that has plagued Lincoln Riley his whole career, so hopefully a guy like Manny Diaz \u2014 currently the defensive coordinator at Penn State \u2014 or Jim Leonhard \u2014 formerly the defensive coordinator at Wisconsin \u2014 can plug some of those defensive holes. However, until those holes are patched, the Trojans will be running scared, giving them a 3/10 on the excitement scale.\n\nWashington excitement level: 6.5/10\nThe Huskies are a very good team, but my main concern is: Where are they going to look after senior quarterback Michael Penix Jr. leaves this year? Freshman Austin Mack will most likely replace Penix Jr., but you can\u2019t always count on highly touted recruits to get the job done. Let\u2019s also not forget that Washington\u2019s top target in junior receiver Rome Odunze is most likely bound for the NFL. Of course, the other receivers on Washington are deadly, but Odunze is a first-round talent, in my opinion. Washington also has a bad defense. The Huskies aren\u2019t USC bad, but they are still No. 99 in the country in total defense. Going to the Big Ten with a bad defense is a recipe for disaster. The Huskies also don\u2019t recruit all that well. While landing Penix Jr. from Indiana was a diamond in the rough, head coach Kalen DeBoer is not that good at landing top talent from high school or the transfer portal. Washington is going to lose a lot of talent to the NFL with the season they\u2019re having, and it is going to have to replace these stars if it wants to compete at a high level. Because the Huskies have looked good, and I do like their future outlook, they are a fringe seven, leaning closer to a six on the excitement level. Therefore a 6.5 feels perfect.\n\nUCLA excitement level: 7/10\nThe Bruins and Huskies are nearly interchangeable in my opinion; however, UCLA has a clear QB1 for the future and a great defense. While he has struggled at times this season, freshman quarterback Dante Moore is the future of Bruin football. Moore was benched in favor of junior Ethan Garbers earlier this season, but his experience playing early in his career will definitely show down the road. While Moore\u2019s offensive weapons for the future are questionable, and head coach Chip Kelly is known to be a bad recruiter, it pains me to say UCLA has a future star on its hands. However, this team\u2019s paramount is their defense. Led by defensive coordinator D\u2019Anton Lynn \u2014  who I think should be considered for USC\u2019s next DC  \u2014 this Bruin defense is tough. It is exactly the type of defense that fits the Big Ten play styles and should continue to do well. All UCLA has to do is put some good weapons around Moore, and Chip Kelly may have a great squad on his hands, thus a 7/10 on the excitement scale.\n\nOregon excitement level: 9/10\nIt hurts my soul to say this, but the Ducks are damn good. Oregon looks like one of the best teams in the nation \u2014 even above Washington, who handed them their only loss. The Ducks\u2019 future looks incredibly promising in the Big Ten. Oregon is truly the only well-balanced team in the Pac-12. Most teams either have a great defense and no offense, or great offense and no defense, but head coach Dan Lanning has cracked the code. Lanning\u2019s defense was punishing the Trojans all of last weekend, and did the same thing to Cal and Utah in the two weeks prior. The offense has also been incredibly efficient with senior quarterback Bo Nix \u2014  the most experienced college football player of all time  \u2014 at the helm. The Ducks are ready for the Big Ten, offensively and defensively. Lanning also has a great future as well, with back-to-back top-10 recruiting classes. The only concern for the Ducks is who their next quarterback will be, because their current backup, sophomore Ty Thompson, is flat out bad. Oregon also has freshman Austin Novosad, but who knows how good he\u2019ll be. Other than quarterback \u2014 where I bet Lanning will recruit from the transfer portal\u2014 the Ducks are ready for the Midwest, giving them a 9/10 on the excitement scale.\n\n\u201cThe Big Ten Breakdown, Vol. II\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)\n\nBy Will Camardella November 14, 2023 at 10:01 pm PST\n\n\u201cPac-12 Power Rankings\u201d is a column by Will Camardella ranking the Pac-12 football teams on a week-to-week basis. If you, like myself, are no longer surprised when Washington State loses to bottom-tier opponents after a 4-0 start, Week 11 in the Pac-12 was much less chaotic than weeks previous. Yes, Arizona State took down UCLA on the road, but the Bruins have a troubling quarterback situation that has made them quite vulnerable. Outside of that game, home teams went 4-1, and ranked teams were unbeaten against lower-ranked or unranked opponents. Barring a late-season surge from Oregon State, the Pac-12 Championship Game will almost certainly be a rematch between Oregon and Washington, who may have played the game of the year back in October. After both teams defended their home turf against tricky opponents, here\u2019s how my rankings stack up this week.\n\n1. Oregon Ducks (9-1, 6-1 Pac-12) | Last Week: 1\nI would not consider Oregon\u2019s most recent performance against USC to be its best-played football game. The Ducks left some points on the board with failed two-point conversion attempts while shooting themselves in the foot by losing 120 yards on penalties. However, when a team makes as many mistakes as it did on Saturday and still takes down the defending Heisman-winning quarterback without trailing at any point, you take notice. Oregon continues to deploy elite football players on both sides of the ball while asserting a physicality on its opponents one might expect from a Southeastern Conference team. The Trojans did nothing in the running game against the Ducks\u2019 front seven; MarShawn Lloyd, who has been one of the most efficient running backs in the country this year, only had 37 yards. The pass rush was no less ferocious, tallying three sacks while forcing Caleb Williams out of the pocket consistently throughout the night. On the offensive side, Oregon showed how explosive it can be in the passing game when it wants to be, while later being methodical to maintain its lead. The Ducks had six scoring drives against USC; three of them took five plays or fewer, while the other half lasted at least 10 plays. Wide receivers Troy Franklin and Tez Johnson and running back Bucky Irving all had 100-yard days. Even in a sloppy effort, Oregon remains the most well-balanced team in this conference and the most formidable opponent in a postseason scenario.\n\n2. Washington Huskies (10-0, 7-0 Pac-12) | Last Week: 2\nWashington is one of the five remaining undefeated teams in the power five, and it is just three wins away from punching its ticket to the College Football Playoff. The team beat a ranked opponent, Utah, with an excellent head coach while continuing to look strong on offense. With all that said, I still have concerns about its defense. As I\u2019ve written extensively in weeks past, Utah is a very limited offensive team, yet the Huskies allowed the first half to turn into a track meet on Saturday. The Utes scored touchdowns on their final four drives of the first half and actually took a four-point lead into the locker room. Bryson Barnes had nearly 9 yards per attempt, which is way too many for a quarterback of his caliber. To its credit, the Washington defense tightened up in the second half and kept Utah off the scoreboard, but that first half is part of a larger pattern. The Huskies have given up at least 28 points in four of their last five games, including matchups against Utah and Stanford, two of the three worst scoring offenses in the Pac-12. Scoring 35 points on the Utes is undoubtedly impressive, but Barnes had much more success against the Washington defense than he did against Oregon two weeks prior. Because of that, I am keeping the Huskies as a strong second in these rankings.\n\n3. Oregon State Beavers (8-2, 5-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 3\nWhen facing a team that has looked as bad as Stanford throughout the season, 62-17 is exactly the final score I expect to see Oregon State run up with a pair of big matchups ahead. DJ Uiagalelei played one of his better games of the season, throwing two touchdown passes and averaging 12 yards per attempt, which makes sense because of how well his supporting cast played around him. Damien Martinez had 147 yards on 15 carries and found the end zone four times on a day when the Beavers churned out 277 ground yards. Currently, they are the second-best rushing offense in the Pac-12, only behind Oregon. What makes Oregon State such a formidable foe down the stretch of the regular season is their physicality on both sides of the ball. In addition to its elite rushing attack, OSU ranks second in the conference in rushing yards allowed per game and is tied for first in sacks. For the Beavers to qualify for the conference championship game in December, they will need that pass rush to disrupt two Heisman-hopeful quarterbacks.\n\n4. Arizona Wildcats (7-3, 5-2 Pac-12) | Last Week: 5\nArizona has been my biggest riser over the course of the season, going from a team I saw as an afterthought to a team that is likely to have its first eight-win season since 2014. After taking a couple of close losses to USC and Washington early in the season, the Wildcats seemed to have learned their lesson about big games, winning by a field goal against both Oregon State and Colorado. Learning how to win close games in college football is a difficult task, but Jedd Fisch has been able to do it with his team mid-season. Arizona\u2019s skill positions are not as deep roster-wise as the teams in my top three, but Tetairoa McMillan has been steady all season long. He had 107 receiving yards and a touchdown in Boulder on Saturday, while Jonah Coleman averaged a staggering 16 yards per carry on 11 rush attempts. More importantly, Noah Fifita led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter in a hostile road environment. He is another player growing up quickly. The Wildcats will not be a conference champion in 2023, but a ton of credit has to go to Fisch and what he has built up in Tucson in a short period of time. The team lost some important players through the transfer portal in the offseason, yet they still are on a clear upward trajectory.\n\n5. Utah Utes (7-3, 4-3 Pac-12) | Last Week: 4\nI do not think there is much shame in losing to Washington in Seattle in 2023, and, unlike its previous matchup against a top-10 team, Utah put up a strong fight. I still do not see the Utes as a supremely capable offensive team, but they have gotten better in recent weeks. Utah has scored at least 28 points in four of its last five games, and the only game it didn\u2019t was against one of the best defenses in college football. Sione Vaki has been a big-play threat for a few weeks and scored another touchdown on Saturday, while Devaughn Vele is starting to emerge in the receiver room. In his best game of the year, Vele had a whopping 145 yards on just five receptions. My concern with the Utes is that, while they obviously have a very strong defense, it has not kept them in games against the elite offenses in this conference. Oregon and Washington put up 70 combined points against Utah in recent weeks. The Utes had some wins in pass coverage against the Huskies\u2019 elite pass catchers, but Rome Odunze made the plays when it counted, hauling in two touchdown passes of over 30 yards. On a day where Bryson Barnes played above his weight, Utah should have been able to steal the victory by playing to its identity. It failed to do so.\n\n6. USC Trojans (7-4, 5-3 Pac-12) | Last Week: 6\nFor all of the disappointments USC has had over the course of a tumultuous 2023, losing by nine points to a national championship contender in one of the most adversarial road environments in the country is one of the least troubling. For the first time since the Stanford game on Sept. 9, the Trojans actually covered a spread. It was unrealistic to expect a change at defensive coordinator would get the USC defense on track in the span of six days, and the unit looked just as bad on Saturday as it did when Alex Grinch was still employed. After two drives, Oregon had run just five plays but was up by 14 points, with Bo Nix averaging 80.5 yards per attempt. The Trojan secondary looked confused throughout the night when the Ducks wanted to air it out in the passing game. As long as USC faces a team with adequate offensive firepower, it will be spending most of the night playing catch-up, as happened in this game. The reason I kept the Trojans in the top half of the conference is because of the play of their quarterback. The offense has had a lot of problems this season, but Caleb Williams has returned to playing elite football in the previous three weeks and covered up many mistakes by other players. He has worked behind a shoddy offensive line against Washington and Oregon, yet still avoided most sacks and made plays downfield. His playmaking ability is something that is unique in college football and keeps USC in a respectable position for the moment.\n\n7. UCLA Bruins (6-4, 3-4 Pac-12) | Last Week: 7\nUCLA had yet to earn a signature win in 2023, something that prevented me from placing them in the upper half of the conference. Now, the Bruins have an embarrassing loss on their resume, dropping a winnable game at home to Arizona State. I could nitpick the defense for allowing 17 points to a Sun Devil offense that has one notable playmaker on it, but UCLA\u2019s problems this season have always been on the offensive side. It had some problems when Dante Moore and Ethan Garbers were running the show, but the two Bruin signal callers were unavailable on Saturday. Colin Schlee ran the ball only four times fewer than he threw it, but still could not muster 200 all-purpose yards. This was the kind of game where the ground game needed to dominate behind Carson Steele, but he only averaged three yards per carry. In seven conference games, UCLA has scored 30 points just once \u2014 against last-place Stanford. Chip Kelly\u2019s identity as a head coach has always been offense-first, but the difference between the experienced Dorian Thompson-Robinson last season and the inexperience in the quarterback room this season has been stark. Because of their injury situation, I did not drop the Bruins this week, but I will have no choice if their point totals continue to be this low.\n\n8. Cal Golden Bears (4-6, 2-5 Pac-12) | Last Week: 10\nCal has had a respectable record throughout the season, but earning a second conference win was what drove me to moving the team out of my bottom three. The reality is, I see a 4-6 record as an overperformance from a Golden Bears team that has had some quarterback instability and one consistently productive skill position player. Cal did something it has rarely done this season on Saturday: win the turnover battle. The Golden Bears forced three fumbles, returned two four touchdowns and found themselves on the winning side for once. If they had not coughed the ball up twice themselves, the game probably would not have come down to the last drive. Fernando Mendoza was serviceable with two touchdown passes and no interceptions, and Jaydn Ott was his usual self with 167 yards on the ground. The Golden Bears have had more moments of success in the second half of the season than some of the early \u201ccontenders\u201d have since conference play began. Because of that, I rewarded them with a jump in the rankings.\n\n9. Colorado Buffaloes (4-6, 1-6 Pac-12) | Last Week: 8\nColorado fought hard against a far-superior opponent on Saturday, but the continued losing has to be wearing on Deion Sanders, who was the talk of college football two months ago. The Buffaloes have now dropped four games in a row, including six of their last seven since Pac-12 play began. It has become increasingly clear that Colorado is just not a physical enough football team to be able to compete in this conference. Arizona\u2019s rushing attack had a field day against the Colorado front, while the unit sacked Noah Fifita just once. Offensively, the Buffaloes still cannot run the football; they averaged 2.6 yards per carry on Saturday. It seemed inevitable early in the season that Sanders would be able to get the pieces he needed up front this offseason to make Colorado a true contender, but I wonder if that is still the case. Boulder seems like a much less attractive option now that the Buffaloes are on this losing streak and have faded out of the spotlight. With six losses on their record and a visit to Salt Lake City coming down the pike, the window to bowl eligibility seems all but shut in 2023.\n\n10. Washington State Cougars (4-6, 1-6 Pac-12) | Last Week: 9\nWashington State\u2019s collapse continued on Saturday afternoon, falling to Cal in its sixth consecutive loss. In the last three weeks, the Cougars have dropped games to Arizona State, Stanford and the Golden Bears, teams with a combined record of 10-20. It seems every week Washington State finds a different way to lose a football game. Against the Cardinal, the Cougars could not move the ball and only scored one touchdown. On Saturday, the team allowed 42 points. However, it would be misleading to put this loss all on the defense; Washington State fumbled the ball three times and threw an interception on the last play of the game. Two of the fumbles were returned for touchdowns, while the third led to a Cal touchdown on the ensuing drive. The Cougars are tied for second in the Pac-12 in giveaways with 17. The common denominator for Washington State is a lack of attention to detail. The team turns the ball over too much, it is inefficient on 3rd down and the defense has been suspect in big moments. What once seemed like a promising season has turned into one to forget in Pullman.\n\n11. Arizona State Sun Devils (3-7, 2-5 Pac-12) | Last Week: 12\nKenny Dillingham met another milestone in his first season as Arizona State\u2019s head coach by earning his first road win over UCLA. Granted, the Bruins have not been known for incredible home atmospheres \u2014 the Rose Bowl was at 60% capacity on Saturday. However, all wins are important for a Sun Devil team that punches above its weight just about every week. Cameron Skattebo had one of his quieter games with only 93 all-purpose yards, but still found a way to account for both ASU touchdowns, including the team\u2019s only touchdown pass. Outside of a very poor showing in Utah, the Sun Devils have actually not been a terrible defensive team throughout the season. In the Sun Devils\u2019 other six conference games, they have allowed fewer than 30 points against every opponent except USC, who averages over 40 points per game. They did a great job taking advantage of a limited opponent and got off the field when they needed to; UCLA was a combined 3-for-15 on third and fourth downs. This game is likely the final bright spot of the season for Arizona State; it closes out its season against Oregon and Arizona. Dillingham is a head coach with an offensive background, so, if his recruiting improves over the next few offseasons on that side of the ball, the team might have a fighting chance in years to come.\n\n12. Stanford Cardinal (3-7, 2-6 Pac-12) | Last Week: 11\nThe story of Stanford\u2019s season continues to be one step forward, two steps back. The Cardinal seemed to show a different side to themselves after an epic comeback win in Boulder. They followed that overtime thriller by allowing a combined 84 points in back-to-back losses. Now, after winning their second conference game in close fashion a week ago, they allowed Oregon State to hang 62 on them in Corvallis. Stanford allowed three separate Beavers to average at least 9 yards per carry in a game where it gave up 277 rushing yards and allowed six touchdowns on the ground. Oregon State had 598 total yards against the Cardinal defense, and the offensive showing was not much better. Ashton Daniels was under siege throughout the game as Stanford allowed six sacks as a team. Daniels also threw three interceptions, which led to him being replaced by Justin Lamson. In relief, Lamson completed 25% of his passes and tossed another pick en route to the team losing the turnover battle four to nothing. Troy Taylor\u2019s first season as the Cardinal\u2019s head coach has had some bright spots, but they have looked like an incompetent football team far more often than they haven\u2019t. For that reason, I returned them to the basement of the rankings.\n```"}

While the Trojans have fierce historical adversaries in the University of Texas Longhorns and the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame, no feud is bigger than the one with crosstown rival UCLA. \u201cIt is one of the best rivalries in sports,\u201d said UCLA student Jason Taormina. While the two schools are only 12 miles apart, their large and ferociously loyal fan bases are always at odds in a rivalry that has a very competitive history. At the moment, USC has the better of the Bruins with a 50-33-7 in football, while UCLA leads in basketball, holding a 148-113 record against the Trojans. \u201cI believe the rivalry is amazing because it brings out the best of the players on both sides,\u201d said UCLA basketball player Adem Bona. Outside disputes on the field, the rivalry also comes with a long standing tradition of prank warfare, rumored to have begun in the 1940s after USC stole a bell from UCLA\u2019s campus. This act by the Trojans not only sparked an enduring war of practical jokes, but is  the reason behind the winning team being awarded a victory bell. Pranks between the two colleges have become historic in their own right, and even overshadowed the game at times. The Trojans once released 30,000 USC colored crickets into a UCLA library in 1989. Decades earlier in 1958, UCLA  flew a helicopter over the USC campus in order to dump manure on the Tommy Trojan statue. While the Bruins were successful, the prank backfired as the manure ended up in the rotors and blades of the chopper due to the wind. In recent years, the main targets in this never-ending prank war have remained the school\u2019s statues and monuments. Tommy Trojan and Bruin the Bear are often victims of vandalism. The most recent incident was in 2018 when two men were arrested for painting over Bruin in USC colors. The damage to the beloved statue ended up costing UCLA $15,000. Bruin the bear taped up at UCLA (Photo by Mark Armendariz-Gonzales)  Students at both universities have taken the matter into their own hands by standing watch 24/7 during rivalry week and protecting the statues with tape. At USC, a group known as the \u201cTrojan Knights\u201d have at least one person on guard throughout the day to ensure  nobody messes with Tommy Trojan. \u201cWe do our best to make sure that Tommy is safe and sound,\u201d said Trojan Knight John Bosco. Tommy Trojan taped up at USC (Photo by Mark Armendariz-Gonzales)  To help pass the time, the Trojan Knights compete in Super Smash Bros. tournaments and play board games and cornhole. Many institutions on campus also help by providing them with food and drinks for their long security shifts. The Trojan Knight\u2019s guard headquarters (Photo by Mark Armendariz-Gonzales)  Although the job may get tedious, the Trojan Knights continue to protect Tommy as they feel that the statue represents what it means to be a Trojan \u2014 something worth preserving . \u201cBeing a Trojan means never backing down, staying true to who you are while still working hard,\u201d said Bosco. \u201cWe need to be courageous and make sure that we make this university everything we want it to be, and everything we feel it has been in the past, while still addressing the ways that this university needs to grow and change.\u201d Along with the Trojan Knights, the Helenes of USC also stand guard and look after the statue Hecuba in the USC Village. The USC Helenes watching over Hecuba in the USC Village (Photo by Mark Armendariz-Gonzales)  Even though rivalry week may divide LA\u2019s two biggest colleges, it definitely brings the students within the universities together. \u201cI think it really just shows that we do come together as a school, despite all the different adversities that our students might face,\u201d said USC student Lindsay Huerta. \u201cIt is really exciting that people care about something that looks really mundane on paper, but really exciting in real life.\u201d \n```"}

Within Ireland, however, it is by far the most important organization for sports. GAA is the premier authority on almost all Irish leagues for sports such as Gaelic football, hurling, camogie, and rounders. These sports are among the oldest sports still being played today, yet they rarely leave the confines of the Emerald Isle. Here\u2019s what you need to know about some of the oldest Irish sports still enjoyed today.\n\nHurling Hurling (or Camogie, as the women\u2019s version is called) is the national sport of Ireland and one of the oldest sports in the world, pre-dating written Irish history. Originally played to prepare young warriors for the chaos and physical contact of battle, it is now the most-watched televised sport in Ireland \u2014 and perhaps one of the most complicated sports played today. Described by laymen as a combination of lacrosse, baseball, and an egg-on-a-spoon race, hurling is an intensely physical sport played between two teams of 15 players each. It is called by many, including Danny Cullen, Captain of the Hurling team in County Donegal, Ireland, as the \u201cfastest sport on grass.\u201d The ball, or sliotar, is slightly larger than a tennis ball, and can move the entire length of the 145-meter pitch in less than three seconds, thanks to \u201churleys\u201d or long sticks made of ash-wood with indented ends similar to a large shallow spoon. Players use the spoon ends of their hurleys to hit the sliotar and send it up the field. A player can also kick the ball, slap it with their palms to another player, or hit it from their hurley into their hand (no more than twice in one possession) to transport the ball. The player can catch a ball passed to them and toss it onto their hurley, but cannot throw a ball to pass. To score, a player can either hit the ball into a soccer-like goal for three points, or hit it within an H-shaped goalpost just above the goal for one point. If a player violates the rules for passing or possession or fouls an opposing team member, the opposing team is awarded a \u201cpuck,\u201d or a possession of the ball from out of bounds, similar to basketball or soccer. The GAA manages the sport of hurling in Ireland, with 35 teams across six skill-based divisions representing the various counties in Ireland, and three additional teams in England. In the first division, twelve of the best-ranked teams compete in a round-robin style of tournament after being split into two groups of six. The winners within each of the two groups then go on to play each other in the All-Ireland Hurling Championship, which takes place every year in Croke Park, the largest stadium in Ireland.\n\nGaelic Football Another exclusively-Irish field sport played by two teams of 15 players is Gaelic Football. Played in its modern form since 1670, the rules are similar to hurling and include the same regulation goals and field sizes. Just like hurling, the players can score either by shooting into the net for three points, or into the goalpost for one point. Like hurling, it is an old and intensely complicated sport. The game is split into two thirty-minute halves. If a game results in a draw, it must be replayed entirely. But perhaps the most complicated part is moving the ball up and down the field: the ball can be moved by kicking it into one\u2019s own hands, kicking it on the ground, or running with the ball in hand, so long that the player does not travel more than four steps without employing one of the other two options first. When a player chooses to kick the ball into his hands and then takes another four steps, it is called \u201csoloing,\u201d and is the equivalent of dribbling in soccer or basketball. The player can also solo the ball off the ground, but is not allowed to do this twice in a row. Therefore, dribbling for most players involves alternating between soloing off the foot and on the ground. To pass the ball, a player can \u201chandpass\u201d a ball by slapping it with an open palm, or \u201cfist\u201d the ball by hitting it with a clenched fist. The player cannot touch the ground with the ball in his hands, use his knees, or throw the ball in any way during play. Opposing players can also use their hands to block passes or shots on goal, as well as to knock the ball out of a player\u2019s hands for a steal. Further, shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed towards the player in possession of the ball. If a player \u201cfouls\u201d by making excessive contact with a player or by breaking the rules of soloing or passing, a free kick is awarded to the opposing team, where the player can either kick from the ground or punt a ball between the goalposts for a point. Sometimes, if a foul is excessive enough, an offending player can be given a yellow card as a warning. A black card can also be given to kick the offending player out of the game with the allowance for a substitute, or a red card, which kicks a player out of the game with no possibility of substitution.\n\nRounders Originally a popular game with schoolchildren in Britain and Ireland, rounders is now played by all ages and has leagues managed by Rounders England Association and the GAA. Rounders is similar to baseball, with a ball and bat and bases that a player must run around, but with a few key differences. There are nine players on the field on each team, as well as four bases that a player must go around, each with stakes in the middle that a player must touch with their bat. If a player runs around fourth base, they receive one rounder. If they only make it past second or third, it\u2019s half a rounder. Balls are thrown by the pitcher underhand, in an action called \u201cbowling.\u201d If a ball goes over the batter\u2019s head, below the knee, or bounces on the way to the hitter, it is called a \u201cno ball.\u201d The bowler is allowed two no-balls before half a rounder is awarded to the batter. Once the bowler has the ball and is back upon their original place on the mound, the batter must stop running. If they are more than halfway to the next base, then they may continue to that base. If a ball is hit behind the plate, then the batter must run to first base and stay there while the ball is in the area behind the plate. A batter is out if the ball is caught, if they fail to stay outside the markers when running, if they drop their bat or if they overtake another batter. Games are usually played over the course of two innings.\n\nThese sports, while technically complicated, are cherished as national pastimes, and so learning the rules and playing the game well is enjoyed just as much as Americans enjoy the pastimes of baseball and American football. Watching a game in any of these sports is always a rewarding experience, and you can do so in the U.S. with the GAAGO platform available on Roku, or even through YouTube Play.\n```"}

That\u2019s when ISA hosts its annual Globefest in McCarthy Quad. This event serves international cuisines to students. The aim is to promote the diversity that is represented on campus. This year they had six vendors serving a variety of foods and drinks from six different continents! You could taste, West African Chop, Ackee Bamboo from Jamaica, or Italian Tiramisu, foods from Australia/Oceana, Peruvian, Pollo Inka, and Smile Hotdogs, from South Korea!\n\nAshley Kim: I saw one of the menu items I grew up eating, so I was excited to eat it. Sophomore Ashley Kim studies media, arts and practice. Kim: Yeah. So, I originally heard about this event through Instagram, and I came here last semester, and so I wanted to come and try the new food that they had this semester.  And there were plenty of new dishes.\n\nSharon Lee:  So, we have two different types of chicken wraps. We have a spicier option and a milder option.  Sophomore Sharon Lee studies Business Administration and works with programming at ISA. Lee: Basically, as the International Student Assembly, we represent international students on campus. We usually have a lot of events to spread international culture with USC students. For example, for this event, we have six different vendors from six continents, so we\u2019re trying to share different types of food with everyone.  And we also have vegetarian options. And we also had berries and mango smoothies.\n\nSophomore Kaci Lewin studies Cognitive Science. Kaci Lewin: I think it\u2019s an awesome opportunity to get to try different foods from different cultures and bring people together in like an awesome place on campus where we have things like the farmer\u2019s market and things like that. And obviously there\u2019s a great turnout, so I think it\u2019s an awesome event.\n\nLewin\u2019s minor is Nutrition and Health Promotion, so maybe she came to the right place. Make sure to check out more upcoming events from the International Students Association to take part in the diversity and inclusion of the USC community.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Riley Rodriguez.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/11/14/homemade-thanksgiving-hot-takes/", "response": "```\nFrom the abundance of food spread across the table to the culmination of family and friends interacting with each other in the living room, Thanksgiving has provided Americans with a day filled with feasting and having a good time with others. The holiday officially started back in the year 1621, when the pilgrims held their first harvest feast with the Wampanoag people. With the typical Thanksgiving feast, food items such as ham, stuffing, cranberries and golden brown turkey create an aroma throughout the room, causing the hungry stomachs of the people to grumble while they wait to eat. Aside from the feast, Thanksgiving is also seen as a holiday where people express gratitude towards their loved ones and anyone they feel makes an impact in their lives. It is also seen as a day to give back to those in need through volunteer events such as helping out at the local soup kitchen and donating canned goods and non-perishables to food banks.\n\nAlthough many celebrate America\u2019s day of giving thanks, there are some who would consider other options for what the holiday has in store for them. Whether that be through potential substitutions for the Thanksgiving menu items or changing the way in which the holiday should be celebrated, USC students across the campus expressed the ways in which they don\u2019t like Thanksgiving and what can change to possibly make the holiday better for them.\n\nBrandon Gardner, a freshman and member of the Trojan men\u2019s basketball team, expressed his feelings toward turkey and how he wouldn\u2019t want it on the table. Gardner believes that there are better items to eat on Thanksgiving than turkey. \u201cI don\u2019t like turkey. You shouldn\u2019t make turkey. That thing is dry,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cPeople try to put cranberries on it, but I don\u2019t mess with that. I like ham, macaroni and a lot of cake.\u201d\n\nMatt Cembrano, a senior majoring in computer science games, agreed with Gardner about potentially taking turkey off of the Thanksgiving menu. But Cembrano brought up how he gets put in a \u201cfood coma\u201d after indulging in some turkey and how that affects his holiday experience. \u201cI think turkey is a super overrated meat choice for Thanksgiving,\u201d Cembrano said. \u201cYou just eat it and you just get super tired. And then you fall asleep and the rest of your Thanksgiving is gone when you could have so much more time to be doing things with your family.\u201d\n\nBoth Cembrano and Gardner suggested cooking chicken for Thanksgiving instead of turkey knowing the different kinds of recipes families could come up with and the commonality of what others would prefer. Even with that said, Gardner acknowledged the fact that all families have their own unique take on Thanksgiving and what they decide to put on the table for the feast. Gardner said he doesn\u2019t want to shame any family for the way they go about the holiday. \u201cI feel like Thanksgiving should be celebrated however you want to celebrate it, you should just be you,\u201d Gardner said.\n\nPatrick Carbone, a senior majoring in neuroscience, has a strong hatred toward cranberry sauce. Carbone wants nothing to do with it and knows he\u2019s not putting any amount onto his plate. \u201cCranberry sauce sucks. It tastes really bad,\u201d Carbone said. \u201cI know there\u2019s probably a lot of people who would disagree, but it\u2019s just not for me. Just get rid of it and don\u2019t ever make it or put it out again.\u201d\n\nLondon Wijay, a freshman looking to major in real estate development, felt that the holiday seems to add more stress to the families knowing they have to prepare everything in a timely manner. Wijay wants the holiday to not be as hectic in order to preserve the time she has with those around her. \u201cI feel that Thanksgiving should just be a sit-down dinner and not a day you should stress out about cooking all the meals,\u201d Wijay said. \u201cYou should enjoy the time with your family and have a good time while enjoying good food.\u201d```"}

The International Student Assembly, which is a program under the USC Undergraduate Student Government, hosted the event. ISA aims to promote cultural identity and serve as a voice for international students.\n\nBy checking into GlobeFest, students received one blue ticket for a dish from one of the six international food vendors: El Pollo Inka boasted authentic Peruvian food; Bronzed Aussie gave students a taste of Australian rolls; Smile Hotdog had Korean street food staples; African Chop brought classic West African flavors; Ackee Bamboo offered Jamaican wraps and smoothies; and Charlie\u2019s Trio provided tiramisu from Italy.\n\nClaire Li, a junior majoring in business administration and cognitive science and the co-executive director of the International Student Assembly, explained that ISA hosts GlobeFest to promote cultural diversity on campus by sharing food. \u201cGlobeFest is an annual event that we have where we take food from various cultures around the world, bring them onto campus and share them with the USC community,\u201d Li said. \u201cThis year we have six different vendors representing six continents from around the world, excluding Antarctica.\u201d\n\nTejaswa Javankar, a second-year graduate with an MBA at Marshall School of Business, spoke on why GlobeFest is important to him. \u201cOne of the most exciting parts about moving to the US for education is the diversity of cultures,\u201d Javankar said. \u201cThis event is a prime example of the variety of food within these cultures. I\u2019m from India, so it\u2019s nice seeing Indian food here, but there\u2019s also a lot of other food from across the world.\u201d\n\nISA sparked student interest in GlobeFest on Instagram this year. During the week leading up to the food festival, ISA posted daily videos on their Instagram quizzing students on international trivia. In order to earn an extra meal ticket, students could reference the trivia in the videos and fill out a quiz located in ISA\u2019s Instagram bio. \u201cThe main thing that we wanted to incorporate this year was an advocacy component,\u201d Li said. \u201cLucas, our advocacy chair, actually planned this quiz that students have to take before they can access the food. The quiz is in regards to the six different continents here, so they\u2019re just fun facts about each continent. That way, we hope that there\u2019s a learning process that happens before students get to indulge in the food.\u201d\n```"}

After a storage yard that contained pallets and hazardous material under the I-10 freeway caught on fire, transportation officials had to stop all traffic on both sides in order to check if the concrete was in bad condition and if it could be reinforced. According to a statement by Caltrans, the state transportation officials stated that about 450 feet of the freeway was affected by the fire.\n\nTuesday morning, there has been an update on the situation during a conference. According to Newsom, the freeway won\u2019t need to be demolished, rather it can be repaired. He also said the fire was likely started by arson. Newsom tweeted on Twitter that the freeway is expected to be closed for three to five weeks in order for the state to work on the damages. Caltrans District 7, Cal Fire and the California Highway Patrol will help repair the damages on the freeway around the clock in order to have the freeway reopened as quickly as possible.\n\nRoughly 300,000 commuters use the 10 freeway daily, making it one of the main routes in the country, CBS reported. Newsom also mentioned that the crew will be installing cameras so the public can see the progress of the project as they go day by day on fixthe10.ca.gov.\n\nDuring a conference Tuesday morning, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass urged commuters to continue taking steps to help lessen the impact on the streets and freeways by working from home or commuting through public transportation.\n```"}

And what\u2019s more, this is expected to get worse over the next 10 years. The use of fossil fuels is largely to blame, according to the new report from federal agencies. The report warns that planet-warming pollution in the US is slowly decreasing, but it is not fast enough to meet the nation\u2019s targets. We also don\u2019t meet the UN-sanctioned goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius \u2013 That\u2019s the threshold beyond which scientists warn can be really harmful to life on Earth.\n\nBrenda Mallory chairs the Council of Environmental Quality. Brenda Mallory: And the National Climate Assessment chronicles what that looks like in every region, and it tells us what we can do in order to address these issues. It takes our understanding of these issues to a new level.\n\nDr. Arati Prahbhaker is the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. She emphasized the accessibility of the report. Prahbhaker: So, one thing that I\u2019m particularly excited about, and that was really the vision of this national climate assessment from the very beginning, is the fact that this is a document that\u2019s designed for everyone to use and it\u2019s practical and really enlightening in some terrific ways. She highlighted that it can be especially useful for water utility managers, city planners, and hospital administrators and demonstrated how it can be used. Prahbhaker: Well, this tool will let you go in and zoom all the way into your city, to your neighborhood, and figure out for that area how many days of what level of extreme precipitation is coming. That\u2019s something you can plan on.\n\nThe tools can help Americans better prepare as it provides them with a better understanding of the climate in a particular moment, says Dr. Prahbhaker. Prahbhaker: This is how people across America can prepare for and take action to respond to the climate crisis.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand the role that environmental racism plays in the climate change discussion, says the director of the Fifth National Climate Assessment, Allison Crimmins. Allison Crimmins: And while climate change affects all of us, it\u2019s impacts are not felt equally. Ongoing systemic discrimination exclusion. Under-investment has left some of our communities at higher risk of harm from climate change. For example, the report finds that neighborhoods in the South that are home to racial minorities and low-income families are more exposed to inland flooding. And in the future, black communities are projected to bear a disproportionate share of future flood damages nationwide. Climate change can worsen longstanding inequities and injustices, making it harder for people to be climate ready.\n\nCrimmins highlights that the report is especially created for the American people. Crimmins: The hundreds of experts that contributed to this assessment really work to ensure that this is not just a report written by scientists for other scientists. This is a report that was informed by users, a report that people can see themselves in. It\u2019s a report that is useful and usable. The accessibility of the report gives us a chance to witness climate change firsthand in our communities.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Amrita Vora.\n```"}

The United Auto Workers\u2019 Graduate Student Worker Organizing Committee (GSWOC) advocates on behalf of employees around campus and is hoping to bargain for a wage increase in upcoming contract negotiations with the school. This potential strike is motivated by an increased cost-of-living seen across the country, as well as similar demonstrations held throughout the year by unions representing blue-collar workers.\n\nMany graduate students face housing insecurity without an immediate source of income, and University policy prohibits active students from working full-time. These issues are compounded by additional costs that may arise in transportation or medical expenses. According to GSWOC-USC, the minimum wage that USC graduate student workers receive, $35,700, is less than the Los Angeles County living wage of $44,142. This differs from other top universities like UCLA, whose previous strikes resulted in a minimum wage of $41,688.\n\nMeg Tiller, a PhD candidate and teaching assistant at USC, spoke about her own experiences on the GSWOC-USC Instagram page. \u201cMy experiences here at USC have been difficult in many ways... part of that is just the fact that we aren\u2019t paid a living wage,\u201d Tiller said. \u201cA lot of it is bad housing, but in addition to that, we\u2019re just rent burdened... meaning that rent is over a third of your income.\u201d\n\nUniversity officials have been resistant to increasing the base pay offered to student workers, as they cite the current contract\u2019s benefits of health insurance and partial tuition. \u201cGraduate student workers put around 54% of their paycheck towards rent on average,\u201d said Tiller. \u201cUSC administration has not offered us a living wage for any of their economic packages. The adjustments they are willing to make don\u2019t even meet inflation.\u201d\n\nRecently, 13 L.A. city council members and Senator Lola Smallwood-Cuevas have announced their support for graduate student workers. \u201cAs the senator representing communities neighboring the University of Southern California, I am writing to express my unwavering support for the graduate students of USC as they negotiate their first contract,\u201d said Smallwood-Cuevas. \u201cHere in Los Angeles and across the State of California, unions play a critical role in empowering workers to collectively bargain for better working conditions and fairer compensation.\u201d\n\nThe student union is also aiming to formalize protections against discrimination or harassment during these negotiations, but has yet to reach an agreement with university officials. A potential solution has been offered through a new arbitration process, although nothing has been formally adopted.\n\nKayla Love, a PhD candidate in the chemistry department, also spoke on the GSWOC-USC Instagram. \u201cTrying to find a lab was terrible,\u201d Love said. \u201cI had to reach out to 15 different labs to ultimately find a lab that would accept meEven though I could show I could do the experiments, I was told that it probably would still be \u2018too hard\u2019 for me.\u201d\n\nThe union recently organized a \u201cLast Chance Picket\u201d at the University Park Campus to further emphasize their commitment, but failed to secure the terms of the contract in the most recent negotiations. A \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d town hall is scheduled for Friday in order to prepare workers for the potential strike.\n\nAndrew Stott, dean of USC graduate school, told Annenberg Media in October that USC is \u201cdoing everything we can to avert a strike. A strike will be disruptive to everybody; it will be divisive to the community.\u201d\n\nGraduate students aren\u2019t the only ones advocating for better wages \u2014 USC bus drivers voted to unionize earlier this year \u2014 and faced similar pushback from the university regarding a number of issues. Hotel workers, Hollywood writers with actors, and other chapters of the UAW have all also gone on strike this year in order to secure financial stability.\n```"}

She said she was leaving Monday night despite having two classes Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about missing, I\u2019ve done enough,\u201d Caroll said. \u201cMissing a day of discussion in math and another day of another class is fine if I have to fly seven hours to New York.\u201d\n\nShe said she\u2019s been feeling burnt out from her midterms. \u201cClasses are hard, life is hard, midterms are like a three month process,\u201d said Caroll. \u201cWhy is that necessary? I feel like that\u2019s excessive.\u201d\n\nMidterms have been taking a toll on another USC student, sophomore Paolo Bahrami, who is studying electrical and computer engineering. \u201cThe midterms just don\u2019t stop,\u201d he said \u201cThey\u2019re all spaced out by like a week, and there\u2019s midterms one and two, so there\u2019s like six straight weeks.\u201d\n\nHis plans to go home depend on whether he has class or not; he\u2019d like to get back as soon as possible, but just can\u2019t afford to miss class. \u201cI don\u2019t show up [to class] anymore honestly,\u201d Bahrami said. \u201cWith the midterms and everything I just needed all the time I could to study, and it made me get further behind in all of my other classes. Now I gotta catch up before finals.\u201d\n\nThe decision to cancel classes in the days leading up to Thanksgiving is not unique to USC, as universities across the nation grapple with similar considerations. The amount of students leaving early raises questions about the effectiveness of the current academic calendar, and whether adjustments could better accommodate students leaving campus for the full week.\n\nCaroll said she thinks students should have the entire Thanksgiving week off. \u201cMost of my friends from home who go to school on the east coast have the full week, which annoys me because I\u2019m traveling the furthest but have the least time to do so,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a few friends going home this weekend too, and I don\u2019t blame them.\u201d\n```"}

(Image generated by Dall-E AI)\n\nBy Mathis Delestre November 14, 2023 at 4:12 pm PST\n\nIn 2020, while the world was plunging into a time of uncertainty and isolation, one of the oldest board games known to man was amid one of its most popular revivals. With the release of Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit\u201d and popular Twitch streamers challenging each other in front of thousands of viewers, the stars aligned in the first year of the pandemic for chess to experience an important surge in popularity.\n\nAt the helm of this charge towards mainstream popularity, was, and still is, Chess.com: The self-titled \u201clargest online chess community with millions of active members representing every country on the planet.\u201d According to their statistics, over 10 million chess games are played every day on their platform. On Twitch.tv, their channel Chess TV welcomes 13,000 to 20,000 viewers whenever they host an online tournament featuring prominent members of the chess community.\n\nIn general, chess as a game has an average of 80 channels streaming it consistently every day and has an audience peak on Tuesdays when the most accomplished chess celebrities compete in a weekly tournament called Titled Tuesday. Chess.com has been able to take full advantage of the streaming and esports environment to keep pushing the 1,500-year-old game to new heights.\n\nChess has become a staple of the Twitch landscape in the past few years, with professional and amateur tournaments racking thousands of viewers and GrandMasters becoming internet personalities through their streams.\n\nAnnenberg Media\u2019s Esports & Gaming desk reached out to CEO and co-founder of Chess.com Erik Allebest to get his thoughts on the recent surge in popularity of chess online, its status on Twitch as a respected esport and the future of the discipline.\n\nThis interview was conducted via email and some answers were slightly altered for clarity and to avoid promotional messages.\n\nHow did you perceive the 2020 chess boom? Can you briefly describe the before and after for your company?\n\nOver the past few years, and specifically since 2020, a series of things have helped generate a major spike in chess popularity. A lot of that can be attributed to the product we\u2019ve cultivated to attract more beginner players, but there has also been so much positive attention for chess through popular TV shows like \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit;\u201d high-profile celebrities, streamers, and influencers sharing their interest in chess; the enormous increase in esports and gaming fandom; and the expansion of mobile gaming to make chess readily available to play anywhere.\n\nOverall, the concept of what it means to be a chess player is changing, and as a lifelong chess player myself, I can\u2019t begin to tell you how cool that is to see. Chess is arguably the most cognitively demanding game there is, and yet, we\u2019re seeing more people playing the game because it\u2019s all about their enjoyment. I think the expectation isn\u2019t that you need to master the game, but instead just try it and have fun with it.\n\nChess is a piece of human history, and with that, we have a unique opportunity to expand the game even further by bringing fans and competitors closer to the game than ever before, and by making chess more engaging and accessible to everyone, everywhere, all the time.\n\nAt Chess.com, we\u2019re excited every day by that challenge and opportunity to elevate the game to even greater heights and make it that much more of a global interest and obsession.\n\nWe see a strong emphasis on creating and promoting Twitch content both from your official channels and also from day-to-day users. How important is Twitch to your platform?\n\nTwitch and livestreaming in general has helped us share chess with the world. When it comes to esports and gaming, Twitch is the go-to platform, and I think it has been an integral part of making chess a community, not just an individual game. Chess players are able to learn new skills and be a part of chess culture on Twitch.\n\nMajor chess grandmasters like Hikaru Nakamura have seen success on Twitch, furthering their careers and popularity. Hikaru has a following of over one million and is one of the best examples of a chess player who has become a successful content creator.\n\nWe see so many important tools and integrations in the works like the new Opera browser, a professional discord server, a lot of online guides, etc. What is your vision for the online chess community in the long term?\n\nPeople have been playing chess for over 1,500 years, and yet, even today, it is still one of the fastest-growing games in the world. With the rise in popularity of esports and livestream gaming, along with the advent of social media and more connected communities, chess sits in such a unique arena where it has the ability to pair so many aspects of our culture at once. It really is a game that can bring people together.\n\nAt Chess.com, we\u2019re constantly looking at ways that we can grow chess and better connect our community of hundreds of millions of chess players. We plan to continue creating exceptional experiences that span content, events, competition and so much more.\n\nWe saw Chess League, many different online tournaments with professional set/casters/ production etc. What was the influence to both host online tournaments and cover real-life chess tournaments on Twitch?\n\nWe love chess and want to share it with our audience no matter how or where it\u2019s being played. Streaming allows us to cover chess tournaments no matter what format they\u2019re in. There\u2019s something so exciting about rooting for your favorite player, even from afar, that makes members of the chess community feel more connected and excited about the game, so we will continue to follow chess wherever it goes and share it with our audience.\n\nWhat is your goal when it comes to developing esports chess? You have already developed a proper league, many professional and non-professional tournaments (Pogchamps), and even tournaments for children now. What is the next step?\n\nMuch like the recent emergence of Formula 1\u2032s popularity in the U.S., chess sits atop an incredibly exciting moment where it is gaining significant amounts of new players and fans every day. The key difference, though, is that our community is able to find deeper connections to the game that extend far beyond what traditional sports can offer.\n\nChess is a game for everyone, and it can be played anywhere, anytime, and against anyone. You set your own pace when it comes to chess. That\u2019s not just about the time it takes to complete a game, but also the rate at which you want to learn or take lessons; follow professionals and their unique journeys; or simply take part in friendly, daily competition.\n\nAt Chess.com, we see countless ways that we can continue to increase engagement with the game and bring our community even closer together.\n```"}

(Photo by Daniel Hahm).\n\nBy Marcel Lacey and Tamara Almoayed November 14, 2023 at 3:58 pm PST\n\nWith finals on the horizon, student stress levels at USC are at a peak \u2014 many Trojans feel overwhelmed and burned out. \u201cBurnout\u201d affects about 80% of college students, with 40% of them being overwhelmed to the point that it is difficult to function. As is the case at many high-ranking universities, students at USC feel pressure to maintain top grades. In fact, in 2010, USC was ranked the 18th most stressful college in the country by the Daily Beast. It\u2019s safe to say that as the school\u2019s acceptance rate has since gone down, the stress rate may well have gone up.\n\n\u201cI feel like every semester I\u2019ve experienced burnout,\u201d Reshma Ramesh, a senior studying public relations and finance, said. \u201cUsually, it\u2019s long nights in the library not sleeping a lot. And then sleeping for an entire day to make up for the lost sleep.\u201d\n\nMany students feel like USC\u2019s finals are significantly more intense than the exams they take throughout the rest of the year. \u201cI feel like midterms aren\u2019t really midterms,\u201d said Samantha Salamoff, a junior majoring in theater. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of just spread out, but I feel finals just make it a lot worse.\u201d She said that time management becomes a lot more difficult toward the end of the semester when many students are left with \u201call these projects that are piling up at the same time.\u201d\n\nTaylor Grant, a student majoring in music industry, agrees. She added that the uncertainty of post-graduate plans can add to the stress level this time of year.\n\nPhysical activity, meditation and getting enough sleep are some of the ways students manage stress and prevent burnout. While USC offers campus support resources, such as Trojans Care for Trojans (TC4T), students have also found their own outlets to manage their stress as finals approach.\n\n\u201cI like to, honestly, go to the beach,\u201d said Nora Alzahid, a graduate student studying public diplomacy. \u201cThe sound of the water and then just the sand is a good way to think about things. That helps a lot.\u201d Nora is not the only student who finds herself drawn to the outdoors when she\u2019s stressed. Salamoff also describes taking breaks between her classes to sit down and enjoy nature. \u201cThere\u2019s so many trees here and many places to sit,\u201d she said.\n\nOther students, like Grant, rely on \u201cbrain breaks\u201d to limit stress levels during finals season. \u201cMaintaining a balance within your life in general and keeping it at a homeostasis level is probably the most beneficial thing,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that you [can] reach your full potential.\u201d\n\nStudents are also finding other ways to cope with stress. An employee at the 901, a popular bar for students on Figueroa Street, confirmed over the phone that there has been an increase in the number of students who have been drinking there \u201cover the last week.\u201d\n\nIf you know anyone who is struggling with burnout or stress, Trojans Care for Trojans allows students, faculty, and staff to submit anonymous forms so action can be taken to support students. USC Student Health also offers 24/7 mental health care for students.\n```"}

Photo by Juneau Janzen.\n\nBy Liv Dansky November 14, 2023 at 1:09 pm PST\n\nHolden McRae sat at a piano when he was three years old and discovered that it suited him. His youth would see him branch out to guitar and vocals before eventually finding his niche as a singer-songwriter at the University of Southern California\u2019s (USC) prestigious Thornton School of Music. As he contemplates life after graduation in December, the 21-year-old Los Angeles native finds himself looking back at the many moments and people that have helped get him to this point.\n\nHolden\u2019s most notable inspiration is his older sister, Jensen. Five years his senior, he wanted nothing more than to copy everything she did. Naturally, as she became more entranced by the musical world, so did he. He followed her to Thornton, from which Jensen graduated in 2019.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s basically the reason why I started it [writing songs] initially and why I\u2019m pursuing it now,\u201d he said.\n\nHolden is majoring in popular music performance at USC. While he is now comfortable with his craft, songwriting didn\u2019t come as naturally to him as playing the piano or guitar.\n\n\u201cIt was always kind of daunting to me. I would kind of shy away from it. I mostly stuck to covers and the classical stuff, but the more I saw her [Jensen] do it, the more I wanted to do it myself,\u201d he recalled.\n\nHis approach to songwriting reflects his passionate and easygoing manner. He has a casual intensity about his lanky frame that shifts to quiet fervor when speaking about music. His favorite artists blend storytelling and emotion, melody and rhythm. Creators like Phoebe Bridgers, Drake, The Japanese House, Justin Bieber, Holly Humberstone, Ryan Beatty and, of course, his sister do an excellent job of striking this balance.\n\nWith his songs, Holden attempts to differentiate himself through his lyrics and melody.\n\n\u201cEspecially in pop music, the same four chords are recycled, so something is going to sound like something else. To me, the best songwriters have a way of saying the same thing differently. I\u2019m a sucker for a metaphor,\u201d he said.\n\nHis four released tracks, \u201cPretender,\u201d \u201cAlix,\u201d \u201cto forgive\u201d and \u201cEnemies,\u201d are lyric-heavy love songs that straddle the line between upbeat pop and indie rock. In his approach to writing, he looks for inspiration in stories, concepts and phrases before fleshing out the melody. One of his unreleased songs, written in collaboration with his friend Jordy, found its roots in a favorite saying of Jordy\u2019s grandfather: \u201cFish can\u2019t see water.\u201d\n\nThere are times when the reverse happens and a melody will pop into Holden\u2019s head, at which point he\u2019ll find the words to match. It\u2019s a fluid process that allows him to find nuance almost anywhere. Like on the basketball court or in the kitchen.\n\nWhen Holden isn\u2019t in a recording studio, he can typically be found dribbling a basketball or pulling something delicious out of an oven. An avid home cook since he was eight years old, he likes to weave his love of food with his music. For his final project later this year, he plans to curate a five-course meal where each dish is paired with an original composition. While he\u2019s still fleshing out the details, he knows a smoky element will accompany his song, \u201cLike Fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy favorite memories are all related to food and music, and I feel like those two things have a really unique ability to bring people together,\u201d he said.\n\nJensen is constantly impressed by his work ethic, coachability, sensitivity and is in awe of his talent. When asked what she likes about Holden\u2019s music, she wrote \u201chis lyrics are the best part. I love how he embraces so many genres. In the last couple years, he\u2019s gotten so deep into the indie folk pop world after a lifetime of loving R&B and pop and hip-hop, and I love watching him fuse genres or bounce effortlessly between them.\u201d\n\nHolden McRae with his sister, fellow singer-songwriter, Jensen McRae. Photo by Caity Krone.\n\nThe duo is embarking on their first professional collaboration this November during The Fever Dream Tour. Jensen, who previously toured with American indie pop band MUNA in 2022, is headlining the shows and has enlisted her brother as her opening act and keys player. They will be playing in Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Minneapolis and Chicago.\n\nHolden intends to capitalize on the exposure from the tour after it wraps in December.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping to get my team together, play more shows, have this tour lead to another one and another opening slot. I just want to work as hard as possible in terms of playing shows and putting out music. It\u2019s all about being proactive, diving in and making as much music as possible,\u201d he said.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/11/13/usc-welcomes-basketball-newcomers-isaiah-collier-and-juju-watkins/", "response": "```\nUSC welcomes basketball newcomers Isaiah Collier and JuJu Watkins\n\nUSC students are simultaneously interested in and excited for the potential impact of two highly recruited basketball prospects in freshmen Isaiah Collier and JuJu Watkins. Collier, who was a consensus five-star recruit, is a 6-foot-4-inch point guard who attended Wheeler High School in Marietta, Georgia. In the USC men\u2019s team\u2019s season opener last Monday, Collier posted 18 points, three rebounds and six assists in an 82-69 win over Kansas State, a neutral site matchup that was played in Las Vegas at T-Mobile Arena.\n\nJuJu Watkins, who was also a consensus five-star recruit, is a 6-foot guard who attended Sierra Canyon High School in Los Angeles. Monday\u2019s season opener for the women\u2019s team, which was played at T-Mobile Arena as well, saw Watkins put up an impressive statline, with 32 points and six rebounds to go along with five assists in an upset win over No. 7 Ohio State.\n\nBoth the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams were ranked No. 21 in the nation coming into the 2023-24 season because of the expected impact the two freshmen will have. Cinema and media studies major Jordan Renville, who was in attendance at both season openers as a photographer and videographer, said he thought the two freshmen accounted for more than simply skills and statistics.\n\n\u201cObviously, they bring skill and their basketball prowess to the team,\u201d Renville said. \u201cBut I also think they bring a sense of leadership. They\u2019re freshmen so they\u2019re still getting their feet wet, but from what I saw in Vegas, they really know how to take charge of the game and control their teammates and make sure that everyone\u2019s moving the ball, spreading it out. So, they do add that sense of leadership coupled with the veteran presences that we already have on the teams.\u201d\n\nMiles Freeman, an aerospace engineering major, holds Collier in high regard. \u201cI think that he\u2019s really special. I think he\u2019s got a really bright future,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cHe\u2019s a freshman, but he\u2019s already come in and had a huge impact, ... so I think wherever he goes he\u2019s going to produce.\u201d\n\nSamer Zidan, a history major who is on the premed track, felt similarly to Freeman, emphasizing Collier\u2019s rank in his class. \u201cHe\u2019s the No. 1 recruit coming out of his class,\u201d Zidan said. \u201cI feel like he is going to make a big impact. From what I saw, his game is pretty good. I feel like, if he gets his shot down, he\u2019ll be really good this year. He\u2019s going to make the most impact, I believe, in college hoops.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to Watkins, journalism major Marissa Russ was impressed by the women\u2019s No. 1 overall recruit\u2019s first collegiate game. \u201cI love JuJu,\u201d Russ said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting her to pop off as good as she did. I think she brings a big offensive presence to the Trojans and I think she is going to help them take that next step they need to get up to levels like South Carolina.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Watkins interests communications major Jenna Byrne for more than what she brings to the team in terms of skill. \u201cI love her personality, as far as what I have seen on social media, and I think she is incredibly talented,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cI think she is going to do amazing. I think she meshes really well with the team.\u201d\n\nIn the women\u2019s team\u2019s home opener on Friday, Watkins scored 18 points in addition to recording seven rebounds and two assists in a 67-51 win over Florida Gulf Coast. For the men\u2019s team, who played their home opener on Thursday, Collier tallied 19 points, three rebounds and five assists in an 85-59 win over CSU Bakersfield.\n\nAlong with Collier and Watkins, another highly recruited USC basketball freshman who has garnered a substantial amount of attention coming into this season is Bronny James, son of Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James. James is a 6-foot-3 point guard who was a four-star recruit and the No. 20 player in the class of 2023, according to the ESPN 100. Like Watkins, James also played high school basketball at Sierra Canyon.\n\nCurrently sidelined for an undisclosed amount of time after having suffered cardiac arrest during a practice on July 25, James hopes to return to action sometime this season when healthy. For Russ, the possibilities are limitless with Collier and Watkins at the helm. \u201cYou know I think the sky\u2019s the limit right now,\u201d Russ said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other freshmen in their classes that really showed out during the opening games this week. So there\u2019s a lot of other freshmen in their classes who might be big contenders for the title but I think the sky\u2019s the limit. I think we can get a natty with them.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Chloe Barker)\n\nBy Anthony Bottino November 13, 2023 at 9:21 pm PST\n\n\u201cUSC Unsung Heroes\u201d is a column by Anthony Bottino that talks about elite USC athletes who aren\u2019t on one of the school\u2019s Division I teams.\n\nWhen you think about California sports, what comes to mind? Probably a summer sport in the heat, with the sun shining and not a cloud in the sky. Maybe you think of the beach or the pool. Most people likely think of sports like surfing, water polo or beach volleyball, right? While California and USC house many of those athletes, it is also home to someone who competes on an entirely different terrain. Instead of the sun shining, Chloe Barker shines in the snowy mountains.\n\nBarker, a senior design major from Portland, Oregon, proves that Trojans also thrive on the slopes as USC\u2019s resident national-champion snowboarder. Growing up near the mountains, she has always been infatuated with the snow, but she wasn\u2019t originally a snowboarder.\n\nBarker grew up only an hour away from the ski slopes and was a frequent visitor there. Along with her father, Barker made the trip countless times throughout her childhood. While she loved being outside in the mountains and surrounded by snow, she didn\u2019t quite enjoy what she was doing. Her dad is an avid cross-country skier, so it seemed natural that Barker would also fall in love with the sport. However, that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nCross-country skiing works a lot differently than skiing at a resort or down a mountain. This type of skiing is racing. As Barker put it, it is essentially cross country or track, but on skis. The actual skis themselves are different, and the races are on flat snow. Barker said she found this boring and needed something more exciting.\n\nGrowing up at the peak of snowboarding with Shaun White at the Olympics, she was dying to try something like it. She would watch skiers and snowboarders speed down the mountains, do tricks and watch the Olympics thinking they looked amazing. She wanted to be a part of this action-packed sport.\n\nSince you can\u2019t mountain ski in cross country skis, Barker decided to take things into her own hands and bought her own skis. She later went the alternative route from skiing, however, and bought her first snowboard during her freshman year of high school. The only issue was learning how to ride it.\n\n\u201cI taught myself since my dad didn\u2019t know, and I didn\u2019t know how to get lessons, so I just looked on YouTube,\u201d Barker said. The first thing she searched was how to stop. From there, she learned basic edge control and how to turn. After that, Barker learned jumps and going off rails.\n\nWith the basics down, Barker was itching to get on her board. Luckily, Barker\u2019s high school had a ski and snowboarding team. She joined to get more riding experience, but she was quickly slung into the world of snowboarding competitions \u2014 something she wasn\u2019t completely thrilled with. Competing forced her to progress in her riding and learn all about the sport. Also, for the first time, she finally had a snowboarding coach.\n\nBarker said having a coach gave her the push and extra edge to start earning podiums in slopestyle competitions and racing at league competitions. She qualified for state tournaments but never found gold or a podium spot. It wasn\u2019t until she came to USC when her talent really came out.\n\nWhen it was time to apply to colleges, snowboarding was a big factor in her decision \u2013 she needed a school with a team and excellent academics. Barker was set to make her mark until the COVID-19 pandemic struck. This forced Barker to spend her freshman year online. In a turn of events, though, Barker wouldn\u2019t be where she is if it wasn\u2019t for the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI basically just lived on the mountain the whole time,\u201d Barker said. \u201cI really used that time to really get into snowboarding every single day and perfecting my riding \u2013 just constant practice no matter what the conditions were.\u201d\n\nWhen she was finally able to go to USC in person, her hard work paid off. Barker almost didn\u2019t see the results, though. When she first arrived and joined the club, she originally planned to just train and take a break to do her own thing. Then, she realized she missed competing and signed up for the competition team at the last minute. Her hard work paid off, and she qualified for the national championship.\n\nThis was her first spotlight on a big stage, and she made the most of it, helping the team earn third place in women\u2019s slopestyle. But this was only the beginning of her success at collegiate ski and snowboarding\u2019s biggest competition.\n\nThe following year, her training only intensified as she made the five-hour drive to Mammoth Mountain every weekend and competed at every opportunity possible. She even started doing new competitions like boardercross. With her skills continuing to get better and having home-field advantage with nationals being hosted at Mammoth Mountain in March Barker seemed poised for a breakout moment.\n\nBarker excelled and claimed gold in slopestyle. She was surprised and underwhelmed by the big moment. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to win at all. I was the only female out of a group of guys, so I had no one to get a team award with, and I didn\u2019t think I would get one myself,\u201d Barker said. \u201cWhen I was on the course, I was in the moment just wanting to do well.\u201d\n\nWhile the initial moment wasn\u2019t a huge celebration, partly because it didn\u2019t seem real to Barker, it set in after. Countless people praised her performance, and she finally felt like she was a national champion.\n\nNow that she has solidified herself as one of the best, she is looking toward the next national championship with a lot more confidence. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the goal is to repeat, but going into it, I have more confidence in my ability with what I can do in the moment,\u201d Barker said. \u201cLast year, I went for fun, but this year, I\u2019m going to try and get there again.\u201d\n\nBarker\u2019s talent is evident, but she doesn\u2019t plan on trying to make a jump to professional snowboarding. She wants to continue competing locally and plan her job around snowboarding, but there is no plan for her to make it her career.\n\nFor now, she is focusing on finishing her last year and enjoying her final season with the USC Ski and Snowboard team. Barker cares deeply about the team and holds a position of one of the officers. She has taken it upon herself to make the team as professional as possible and to ensure they reach their full potential. This is where her design major comes into play.\n\nBarker will leave a legacy on the team, because she created the new team logo and is currently working on the club\u2019s first-ever team uniform. \u201cThis team means everything to me,\u201d Barker said. \u201cI came into USC not knowing a single person, and I was able to connect with everyone on a level of skiing culture and love for the sport.\u201d\n\n\u201cUSC Unsung Heroes\u201d runs every other Monday.\n```"}

USC women's basketball defeated Division I newcomer Le Moyne, 93-42, Monday at Galen Center. (Photo by Wesley Chen)\n\nBy Will Simonds November 13, 2023 at 9:18 pm PST\n\nUSC women\u2019s basketball began Monday on a high note. For the first time since the final poll of the 1994 season, the Trojans are ranked in the top 10 of the AP Top 25 poll after jumping 11 spots to No. 10. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously going to pause at moments and say, \u2018Wow, it\u2019s pretty incredible where we\u2019ve come from and where we are,\u201d USC head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to be higher than that at the end of the season, so we want to take it and understand that just raises our level and our standards.\u201d\n\nLater in the afternoon, freshman guard JuJu Watkins earned Pac-12 Freshman of the Week honors after a stellar opening two games of her college career. The Trojans (3-0) continued to show out in the evening, walloping Le Moyne 93-42 Monday night at Galen Center. The phenom Watkins continued to shine with 35 points on 13-for-20 shooting, giving her 85 points in her first three college outings.\n\n\u201cThis was a little bit of a test of our maturity,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI wanted to really see how we came out in terms of valuing possessions, our discipline and the things we\u2019re working on ... more than anything on the box score. I thought we did a good job of that.\u201d\n\nThe Dolphins (0-4) never really stood much of a chance. Le Moyne\u2019s athletic programs are in their first season at the Division I level. To give the Dolphins credit, they were a very solid program in Division II, going 21-7 last year to cap off six straight winning seasons prior to their transition. Le Moyne still showed plenty of fight Monday, even as massive underdogs. At just 5-foot-9, fifth-year guard Lytoya Baker nearly stole the opening tipoff from 6-foot-4 USC junior center Rayah Marshall. Baker remained fearless all game, constantly driving right at Marshall \u2014 a preeminent shot blocker in the nation \u2014 standing under the rim. Sophomore guard Sierra Linnin wasn\u2019t afraid to take any shot, draining an impressive step-back 3-pointer early on.\n\nBut, unfortunately for Le Moyne, there aren\u2019t a lot of athletes as talented as Watkins and Marshall in D-II. The Trojans\u2019 star duo made that clear immediately, combining for 14 points and seven rebounds in the first quarter to jump out to a double-digit lead. After falling behind early on Friday against Florida Gulf Coast, USC started this game with an 11-0 run and led 21-8 after 10 minutes. A four-point play by Watkins early in the second quarter put USC up 20, allowing Gottieb to go deeper in her bench right away.\n\nGraduate guard Roxane Makalo, an offseason transfer from TCU, played just eight minutes in the Trojans\u2019 first two contests. On the floor to start the second quarter, she stole a pass at the top of the key and took it for a layup, her first points of the season. Likewise, redshirt sophomore guard Dominique Onu, who transferred midway through last season from UCLA, earned her debut minutes as a Trojan late in the first half. Onu made it count with nine total points, including a 3-pointer. Junior center Clarice Akunwafo made all three of her field goals and had four rebounds after seeing little action in the Trojans\u2019 two prior matchups. Redshirt sophomore guard Taylor Bigby continued to cement herself as a dangerous sixth player; she was the third Trojan in double figures alongside Watkins and Marshall.\n\n\u201c[We\u2019re] just treating every opponent like it\u2019s one of our biggest games,\u201d Bigby said of the bench\u2019s mentality on a night when it contributed 30 points. \u201cThat\u2019s been one of our biggest mindsets.\u201d\n\nRedshirt freshman Aaliyah Gayles made her triumphant return to the court for the last two minutes of Friday\u2019s game, but she didn\u2019t record a stat. She saw more action in Monday\u2019s contest, though it was a rather shaky appearance. Gayles missed each of her four field goal attempts and recorded four turnovers in 12 minutes of action, though she did have two assists, a rebound and a steal. With just two seconds left in the game, she drew a foul in the lane but missed both ensuing free throws; Gayles will have to wait before notching another important step \u2014 her first college points \u2014 in her recovery from being shot several times last April.\n\nDespite a rough halftime performance from rapper YG, who went 0-for-3 from behind the arc, USC\u2019s offense kept rolling after leading 46-20 at the break. Watkins continued to validate the hype around her, even as USC led by as many as 59 in the second half. She drained three more 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to finish 6-for-8 from deep. In just 26 minutes, Watkins also pulled down nine rebounds, snagged six steals and drew a trio of and-ones \u2014 a testament to her impressive physicality and defensive ability, in addition to her scoring prowess.\n\nAfter the game, Gottlieb continued to have nothing but praise for her star freshman. She mentioned a summer workout in which Watkins dove across the line to improve her time during a conditioning test. \u201cThere\u2019s not really any flaws in her game,\u201d Gottlieb said, joking that she wished a visibly embarrassed Watkins wasn\u2019t sitting directly to her left. \u201cThere\u2019s a high care factor about trying to be great.\u201d\n\nWith Watkins\u2019 star power comes, well, more star power. Over the weekend, Gottlieb received two commitments from five-star recruits in the 2024 class: L.A. native forward Kennedy Smith, the No. 6 overall recruit according to espnW; and guard Kayleigh Heckel, the No. 28 overall recruit. Additionally, the No. 23 recruit, guard Avery Howell, announced her commitment to USC in October, giving the Trojans one of the top incoming classes for next season. After all, it\u2019s hard to blame them for wanting to play with Watkins.\n\n\u201cThis coaching staff has been a dream come true,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cAs far as the recruits, ... they were courageous in making that decision and trusting us. Can\u2019t wait for them to play here next year.\u201d\n\nUSC will have a week off before traveling to the Bahamas for the Baha Mar Pink Flamingo Championship. The Trojans will play Seton Hall on Monday and Penn State on Wednesday, both at 6 p.m. PST.\n```"}

(Photo by Eric Yeh)\n\nBy Hali Mecklin and Kaitlyn Huamani\nNovember 13, 2023 at 7:23 pm PST\n\nAfter making inflammatory comments while passing a peaceful pro-Palestinian protest on the USC campus on Thursday, economics Professor John Strauss defended his statements. He said that his words, \u201cevery one should be killed,\u201d was referring only to Hamas and not to Palestinians generally.\n\nFollowing an outpouring of criticism from students regarding the incident, the university put Strauss on administrative leave with full pay Friday afternoon. He was initially only permitted to teach his Ph.D. classes over Zoom, but as of Monday, he said that he is now cleared to teach his undergraduate classes remotely as well. USC Public Relations confirmed Strauss is teaching his two classes remotely for the rest of the semester.\n\nStrauss maintained that he would not change anything about the interaction, which he described in an interview with Annenberg Media. \u201cOne of them, a woman, I don\u2019t know who, yelled out, \u2018Shame on you, Professor Strauss. Shame on you,\u2019 And I immediately yelled back, \u2018No, shame on you. You were ignorant about Hamas. Hamas are murderers. That\u2019s all they are. They should all die. Every one of them.\u2019\u201d Strauss said. \u201cEvery one of them referred, of course, to Hamas.\u201d\n\nWhile Strauss maintains that a video circulating on social media is doctored, Annenberg Media could not locate any recordings of the interaction that differ from the viral clips. The following video is unedited.\n\nStrauss said that his comments were prompted by what he perceived to be antisemitic and anti-Israel sentiments at the protest while walking to his class. \u201cI\u2019m Jewish, I\u2019m very pro-Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I yelled out \u2018Israel forever. Hamas are murderers.\u2019\u201d\n\nStudents said they felt threatened by his comments, and many filed complaints about the professor\u2019s remarks. Annenberg Media viewed a copy of one Title IX complaint with at least 15 signatories as of Friday. There is a petition calling for Strauss\u2019 firing and a competing petition calling for him to be reinstated.\n\nThe site of the incident on Thursday was near the Tommy Trojan statue, where students organized a temporary installation with names of the thousands of Palestinian civilians killed in Israeli strikes and retaliation, following the October 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas, a militant group recognized by the U.S. as a terrorist organization.\n\nSome online criticism focused on Strauss stepping on the lists of names before he made the comments. Strauss said that stepping on the list was unintentional and that he stepped closer to the protesters to speak with them, not realizing that he was stepping on the names.\n\nThe university made an earlier statement, saying they are \u201caware of a social media post showing a faculty member engaging with demonstrators on our campus [and] are looking into this.\u201d\n\nStrauss said that he hopes that the provost reconsiders the decision to place him on academic leave. \u201cI think the administration\u2019s already doing some backpedaling, which is good,\u201d Strauss said. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019d like the whole administrative leave thing to be canceled so I can come back on campus.

I think it was important for us to provide that. An older man had walked through the crowd of people and he yelled Israel forever and proceeded to walk upon the names of the Palestinian students who were killed and then circled back and stopped in front of a bunch of Muslim women and yelled, \u2018Israel forever Hamas gone.\u2019 In response to that student speaking and saying, we\u2019re here to pay respects. He then says everyone should be killed and I hope they all are. And so he had to intent was very clear to all of us there.\u201d\n\nWitnesses said that at the beginning of the event, Strauss stepped on the list of names on the ground of Palestinians who were killed by Israeli strikes. He denied doing so purposefully.\n\nStrauss: \u201cI apparently started to step on a few but not intentionally when a person yelled, \u2018Shame on you, Professor Strauss.\u2019 So when I moved towards that person and I must have stepped on a sign or two.\u201d\n\nUSC on Friday offered a brief statement on the incident. \u201cWe are aware of a social media post showing a faculty member engaging with demonstrators on our campus; we are looking into this,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe encourage everyone in the USC community to respect others\u2019 views/act with civility towards each other.\u201d\n\nThe campus climate has been tense for more than a month now and this incident has only deepened divisions.

Production and companies UniVerse and LVIN are hosting a DJ event featuring USC student artists at the Globe Theatre Los Angeles on November 30 at 9 p.m. The concert will highlight DJ performances and house music from USC students and fraternity DJs: Adam Fawal (adamoffthewall), Ali Zafar-Khan (Pak Man), Reade Hansen (Red), Dhilan Patel (dhil.p), Grant Pallokat (GKAT), Magnus Ferrell and Gabe Yaron (Let\u2019s Link), Nathan Rippy (Rippy), Nicolas Bondolowski (Nico GB), Luka Anagnos (LKS), Max Rovner (ROV), and Mark Stone (Stone). Although the companies are being marketed to USC students, it is not affiliated with the school.\n\n\u201cThis concert is an opportunity for all the top DJs at USC to show off their skills and show off what they have to the USC community,\u201d said Adam Fawal, a featured DJ and senior studying computer science. \u201cWe\u2019re mostly only playing house music...so I feel like it\u2019s kind of a way to show the USC community [and] get them in the house music and show them the culture around it.\u201d\n\nUniVerse, a production company, debuted on Instagram earlier this month after developing over the past three months. \u201cI started UniVerse with the intent to build university and multi-university experiences in the form of live events, concerts, and festivals,\u201d said Sam Freeman, UniVerse founder.\n\nChristian Shaw, a junior studying communications, works as a campus manager for this specific event and has helped Freeman connect with USC\u2019s Greek life. \u201cI\u2019ve been just really trying to unite the row. It can be somewhat of a segregated culture here,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cHouses mix only with certain houses and there\u2019s a hierarchy system that sometimes kind of gets blown out of proportion.\u201d So, Shaw wanted to contribute to a concert to unite the row.\n\nUniVerse has also partnered with LVIN, a travel company that helped produce a similar concert called Row Rave. The two companies got together in 2021 with USC students as their target audience. In preparation for this festival, LVIN has helped UniVerse with connections, venues, and promotions.\n\n\u201cI was actually very excited,\u201d Fawal said. \u201cI had heard about Row Rave after I found out I got into UniVerse, and I did some research [and saw DJs like] It\u2019s Murph, Sunday Scaries and Twin Diplomacy. They all did Row Rave, and this is supposed to be Row Rave part two, so that got me really excited because these guys are on [their] way up in the industry.\u201d\n\nUniVerse has also collaborated with USC\u2019s Duffl, a delivery service company, to help promote the concert by selling merchandise on the day of the show. \u201cBy receiving support and endorsement from local businesses like Duffl, we are able to gain larger support and attraction for the concert,\u201d said featured DJ Grant Pallokat, a junior studying real estate development. \u201cI\u2019m [also] looking forward to having all different people from USC enjoying music in the same setting with one another.\u201d\n\nThe concert venue can hold around 1500 people. Shaw says that the festival can help promote and create exposure for the DJs. \u201c[This concert] is much bigger than any venues that [the DJs are] usually able to book,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cIt gives them a [glimpse] of what a concert would feel like.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is just an event that\u2019s for the students by the students to bring students at USC together for a big end-of-semester school-wide event,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019ve brought in and focused on school-based DJs that are really involved in the community.\u201d\n\nTickets start at $28 and students can find more information about the concert and purchase tickets here.\n```"}

The Recording Academy announced Friday the full list of nominees for the 2024 Grammy Awards, which will take place on February 4 in Los Angeles.\n\nWomen are included in seven of the eight nominations for the Album, Record and Song of the Year awards, as well as five of the eight nominations for Best New Artist, according to the Grammy website. Despite these strides in highly contested awards, zero women are nominated for Producer of the Year or Songwriter of the Year, which also fall under the \u201cGeneral Field\u201d category.\n\nIcesha Sanders, a second year student studying occupational therapy and a new member of the GRAMMY U mentorship program, said she \u201cwasn\u2019t surprised\u201d by this gap in gender representation. \u201cWith a bunch of the really huge labels in the music industry, the majority of the songwriters and producers who are under them are male,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that they should definitely take more steps to scout out the artists who are not male, who are breaking boundaries in the industry.\u201d\n\nKevin Allen, a fourth year student studying classical voice and opera, said that the lack of representation of women in the Producer and Songwriter of the Year nominations was \u201cdisheartening.\u201d \u201cI know that a lot of women are in the room when it comes to songwriting,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIt just feels really disingenuous to the art form for all the nominees to be mainly men that I\u2019ve never heard of.\u201d\n\nThe lack of representation of women in the Producer and Songwriter of the Year awards is not new to the 2024 nominations. The Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which researches diversity and inclusion in entertainment, found that women only made up 1.7% of nominees for Producer of the Year between 2013 and 2023. In 2022, 2023 and now 2024, not a single woman producer received a nomination for the award.\n\nThe 2024 Grammy nominations, however, are noted for breaking records in the representation of women in the overall nominations, especially the \u201cbig four\u201d awards \u2014 Album, Record and Song of the Year, and Best New Artist. In 2023, women made up 15.1% of Record of the Year nominees, 12.2% of Album of the Year nominees, 33.3% of Song of the Year nominees and 50% of Best New Artist nominees, according to the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.\n\nSanders noted nominees such as SZA, Victoria Monet, Olivia Rodrigo and Taylor Swift, who were all nominated for Record of the Year. \u201cSeeing not just women but Black women being recognized ... made me extremely happy,\u201d she said. \u201cI know the Grammys usually fall short when it comes to that. It seems like they\u2019re taking steps in the right direction to take more notice of the amount of great music in the industry right now.\u201d\n\nAllen reflected a similar sentiment. He said he was \u201cso glad\u201d that Laufey, a Chinese-icelandic jazz pop singer, got nominated for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. \u201cI think that that\u2019s really good Asian representation being shown up there, as well as Icelandic representation and also just a different genre of music that most people in the popular mainstream don\u2019t often listen to,\u201d they said. \u201cSo I think that kind of representation, putting that music on a pedestal so it can be heard more is super, super helpful.\u201d\n\nThe announcement of the 2024 Grammy nominations came two days after a woman filed a lawsuit against former Grammy Awards CEO Neil Portnow, alleging that he sexually assaulted her in 2018. The woman also filed against the Recording Academy for negligence, per the Associated Press. Portnow was previously under fire in 2018 for telling reporters that women in music need to \u201cstep up\u201d after being asked about the gender representation of that year\u2019s Grammy Awards ceremony, where only one woman won a solo Grammy during the televised portion, according to the New York Times.\n```"}

By then, Carrillo says, it was too late to try to save her life.\n\nLuis Carillo: \u201cMelanie\u2019s law is now the law of the state of California. Hopefully in the future it will save lives because it mandates certain things. For example, it mandates that school safety plans include prevention and training for school staff so that other kids don\u2019t die of fentanyl overdoses.\u201d\n\nThe new law will give every public middle and high school in California Narcan, a nasal spray that can reverse the effects of an overdose. It will also mandate preventative training for California school employees and educate students on the growing risk of exposure to Fentanyl.\n\nCarillo: \u201cAnd so we\u2019re very grateful that the state has this kind of a law to protect kids in the future and to protect mothers from suffering like Elena Perez is suffering.\u201d\n\nPerez and Carrillo are hopeful that the law will put an end to the growing fentanyl overdose epidemic in California and in the United States at large.\n\nPerez: \u201cI don\u2019t want parents to suffer the loss of their children, I don\u2019t want them to feel the pain I\u2019m feeling.

The USC Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science will look into the marketing of tobacco products and the effects on adolescents and young adults.\n\nBy Makayla Idelburg and Nicki Berelson November 13, 2023 at 6:02 pm PST\n\nThe National Cancer Institute recently awarded USC a grant to further research into tobacco product use among teens and young adults. The $20 million will be geared towards funding the next five years of research and experiments where results could guide future tobacco product regulations. In partnership with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institute of Health (NIH), USC was one of the nine Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science (TCORS) programs to receive grants to fund their studies to aid in tobacco product regulations in 2018.\n\nThis funding allowed the university\u2019s TCORS program to develop four projects concerning the marketing of tobacco products and their effects on adolescents and young adults. \u201cWe look at the addictiveness of different flavored oral nicotine products amongst young adults who are already using nicotine,\u201d said Adam Leventhal, co-director of the Keck School of Medicine and USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. \u201c[We use these results] to inform the FDA of specific flavors and product types that might be more addictive to young people.\u201d\n\nLilit Aladadyan, the center director for USC TCORS, says all the projects are of equal importance. She added that all the aforementioned projects work in synergy to produce accurate and useful research. She emphasized career enhancement as one of the aspects that the grant will help support, which is training scientists in reducing the \u201chealth burden from tobacco product use.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the jury is still out on the effectiveness of e-cigarette noncombustible products in helping people quit,\u201d continued Aladadyan. She said that she frequently sees people use e-cigarettes as a means to stop smoking tobacco but in the end, they use both products.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease for Control and Prevention, 90% of adults who smoke started by age 18 which is the youngest age of most college students. For some USC students, this is the age they started using tobacco products, as well.\n\nLalie Gerard, a junior international relations major, said she is aware of the negative health impacts that nicotine has but has tried an e-cigarette. \u201cI think it was just in a party context,\u201d she said. \u201cI think other people were doing it, so I just tried it.\u201d\n\nSome students who have not tried nicotine products see their friends smoking in social settings. \u201cI would say one of the people I know that vape or use nicotine consistently now started at a really young age, like either in middle school or high school. So I think it\u2019s important to reach out to kids in younger age groups,\u201d said Alex Nashed, a sophomore studying industrial and systems engineering.\n\nLeventhal said the results from the four TCORS studies will likely prove the validity of the students\u2019 statements. Leventhal mentions that characteristics like stylish packaging make products look attractive and cool which convinces young people to buy them. Additionally, the marketing strategies of tobacco/nicotine companies use influencers and other platforms to promote the \u201csocial advantages\u201d of engaging in E-Cigarettes or vape products. Consequently, the glorification of this \u201cfun\u201d lifestyle can lead teens and young adults down a potential path to addiction.\n\nTo avoid this persuasion Aladadyan advises, \u201cI think the best approach to quitting is going the medical approved route which is through nicotine pouches, there\u2019s the call lines. Of course, the best way is not to start.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Danny Shuai)\n\nBy Jasmine Kwok, Makayla Idelburg and Aidan Williams\nNovember 13, 2023 at 5:53 pm PST\n\nUSC will take full control over its online programs and tuition finances after cutting ties with 2U, an online education company that provided opportunities for students to get degrees virtually, according to a joint statement released by the university and 2U Thursday.\n\n\u201cOver the next 15 months, 2U and USC will work together to effectively transition the delivery and administration of servicing these programs to the university,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe will ensure that students receive the same high standard of education and support they have come to expect.\u201d\n\nUSC was one of 2U\u2019s first college partners, and the company\u2019s CEO told the LA Times that much of their success is attributed to the university. \u201cYou can argue that 2U wouldn\u2019t exist without USC,\u201d he said on a call with his investors Friday, per the LA Times.\n\n2U has provided online courses and digital degree services to the USC Rossier School of Education, Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and the Iovine and Young Academy. According to its website, 2U\u2019s goal is to \u201cexpand access to world class online education and unlock human potential.\u201d\n\nThe university hired its own faculty and administrators to teach the courses while 2U offered the technical platform in exchange for over half of USC\u2019s online tuition. The company took a 60% cut of online tuition from the social work program, thus contributing to a budget crisis at the Dworak-Peck School, according to the LA Times.\n\nAs of 2022, USC paid at least $166 million to 2U and contributed to 20% of its revenue. According to Dean of Rossier Pedro Noguera, USC benefitted from the 2U\u2019s resources until they quickly got \u201con board\u201d with all of the online education applications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s often the case when you think about advanced technology,\u201d Noguera said. \u201cThey are popular at one point and then they run their course.\u201d\n\nDuring the pandemic, online program managers (OPMs) like 2U offered technological assets that would benefit online education for university students, according to University Business. Dean of the School of Pharmacy Vassilios Papadopoulos said that USC faculty and staff swiftly adapted to the technological tools for online learning.\n\n\u201cThis was a great idea 13 years ago\u2013it worked very well for a few years,\u201d Papadopoulos said. \u201cThe time was right for taking over in our hands our own fate.\u201d\n\nDespite their initial success with the university, the organization has had a history of controversies during its relationship with USC. According to the Wall Street Journal, USC and 2U were sued in 2022 for encouraging students to enroll in the Rossier School of Education by using manipulated data, which drew from rankings affiliated with their in-person programs to uplift their online opportunities, despite having different acceptance rates and student populations.\n\nIn a second lawsuit, USC was sued over the misrepresentation of the online Master of Social Work program, which was presented to be of the same quality as on-campus courses. Since the university advertised that their virtual and campus-based programs were equal, they charged more than $85,000 for both programs, according to USA Today.\n\nBoth Noguera and Papadapoulos said that ending this partnership was a long time coming. \u201cWhy are we spending so much of our scarce resources on a partnership when we could provide these services online?\u201d Noguera said. \u201cI saw it from the very beginning as a partnership that didn\u2019t really benefit us,\u201d he continued. \u201cI understood the history of why we entered, but I didn\u2019t think it suited us well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of the few times in my life in a leadership position that I got so many positive messages,\u201d said Papadopoulos, who also serves as the interim dean of the School of Social Work, when discussing the response to the dissolution of the partnership. \u201cThe messages from faculty, even staff, even members of the board of the council of the school of social work were very supportive.\u201d\n\nPapadopoulos said that the termination of this partnership will not pose major hardships for online students transitioning between different platforms. \u201cThe [master of social work] is a nationally accredited program,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will not change anything, except for the platform that the services are offered, but everything else will remain the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, we will face some unexpected problems,\u201d Papadopoulos continued. \u201cAnd we are ready. We are working both with the USC online people and our internal IT to ensure that everything continues seamlessly.\u201d\n\nAlthough the partnership has ended, USC will continue to build upon the programs they ran with 2U, one being the Organizational Change and Leadership program, which \u201cgoes beyond our traditional focus on education\u201d by serving students in health care, small businesses, and the military, Noguera said. Regardless of what field students pursue, Noguera said that many report back with positive feedback. Thus, USC will expand the program on its own.\n\n\u201cI would not characterize this break up as acrimonious,\u201d Noguera said. \u201cWe benefitted to some degree from the relationship, and we will continue to benefit afterward and over time.\u201d\n\nAs per the statement, the USC Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy program will continue working with 2U for its hybrid online clinical program.\n```"}

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Janette Fu and Drake Lee\nNovember 13, 2023 at 4:25 pm PST\n\nRivalry week has officially begun. With UCLA and USC football playing each other on Saturday at 12:30 p.m., both schools are gearing up for the most anticipated game of the season on Saturday. To prepare, Trojans are starting rivalry week traditions. One long-time tradition, which was created because of the Victory Bell, is the taping of the Hecuba and Tommy Trojan statues. USC currently holds the touted Victory Bell.\n\nOriginally from a Southern Pacific train, the bell was gifted to UCLA from the UCLA Alumni Association in 1939. Two years later, USC students stole the Victory Bell during the first game of UCLA\u2019s season. UCLA students retaliated by painting the Tommy Trojan statue blue. Shortly after, a tradition was born.\n\nThe significance of the bell stems back to 1942. The student body presidents from both schools signed an agreement saying that the bell would go to whichever school wins the annual football game between UCLA and USC. The Trojans lead the all-time series 50-33 against the Bruins.\n\nDuring the week leading up to the UCLA game, the Trojan Knights, a campus organization that maintains Trojan traditions, keep a 24/7 watch of Tommy Trojan. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite Knights event of all time. I love just having a spot on campus where everyone can meet up,\u201d Ivan Paredes, a Trojan Knight and senior studying health and human sciences, said about the tradition of guarding the statue. The excitement and the camaraderie and the happiness really gives you a boost throughout the week.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the USC Helenes, a campus organization that strives to make positive changes in the community, guards the statue of Hecuba, Queen of Troy, 24/7 during the week leading up to the anticipated USC-UCLA game. \u201cI think it\u2019s cool just being a part of a [USC tradition],\u201d said Ella Fukushima, a USC Helene and junior studying business administration. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the biggest reasons I joined this [organization]. My first time was last year, so it\u2019s cool doing it again.\u201d\n\nLulu Soranson Way, a sophomore studying psychology and cognitive science, has friends who are part of both organizations. \u201cI like how they protect the statues and get everyone pumped up at games. I think it\u2019s really cool and it showcases our school spirit,\u201d she said.\n\nA victory for either school on Saturday would mean 10 points in the Crosstown Cup race, which has been around since 2001, according to USC Athletics\u2019 website. The trophy is awarded to whichever school wins the most games in head-to-head matchups across all sports. USC has won the Crosstown Cup 13 times, while UCLA has won eight times.\n\nCurrently, UCLA\u2019s football team is 6-4, while USC is 7-4, according to their respective websites. USC has lost most of the games during the latter half of the season. Moreover, both teams have been eliminated from the possibility of playing in the Pac-12 Championship. Although this game will not contribute to the Pac-12 championship, the winners can look forward to bragging rights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely looking forward to gameday outfits, cheering whenever we score, and definitely just the walk to the Coliseum,\u201d said India Yeoh, a sophomore studying the music industry. \u201cIt\u2019s always filled with a lot of anticipation.\u201d```"}

Gavin Newsom said that close to 100 columns supporting the 10 Freeway near Alameda Street were impacted by the fire. He also declared a state of emergency to expedite the freeway repair and clean-up process.\n\nAccording to Newsom, around 300,000 vehicles typically drive on the interstate daily and the state will ensure that the structure can support that level of traffic in the repair process.\n\nA preliminary investigation determined that the fire was started with \u201cmalice intent,\u201d Newsom announced Monday afternoon.\n\nA city-wide alert was sent out via wireless emergency alert notifying drivers of the closure around 10:30 p.m. Sunday night. The alert advised Angelenos to \u201cplan alternative routes and expect significant traffic.\u201d\n\nThe fire, which spanned 8 acres according to the Associated Press, burned for over three hours, blackening and chipping the columns, deck, and guardrail of the affected section.\n\nNo injuries have been reported but at least 16 unhoused individuals were evacuated from the scene, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in the same news conference.\n\nThe Los Angeles City Fire Department responded to a \u201crubbish fire\u201d between 12 a.m. and 1 a.m. Sunday in a storage yard under the freeway, as reported by CBS.

Rage, tension and spite spark among familial characters since spring releases such as the fourth and final season of Succession in March and later in April, Netflix\u2019s premiere of \u201cBEEF.\u201d Both critic and audience appraisal of the choreography of a well-shot family feud peaked with the release of season two of \u201cThe Bear\u201d in June. Finally, viewers enjoyed a familiar, yet final dysfunctional family tree blueprint in Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Fall of the House of Usher\u201d from acclaimed character-horror TV director Mike Flanagan as he announced this series as his last on the platform.\n\nBy Olivia Siu November 13, 2023 at  3:37 pm PST\n\nEpisodes where all characters are merged into a single storyline within its single runtime, whether for a holiday, occasion or otherwise pivotal plotpoint, have always been a treat for viewers. Think of the \u201cExpress Christmas\u201d episode about an impromptu celebration effort from \u201cModern Family\u2019' or the non-holiday related \u201cSnipe Hunt\u201d episode about a family reunion in the form of a camping trip in \u201cAtlanta.\u201d These episodes ingrain themselves into the minds and hearts of audience members by connecting with lived experiences. Recent TV continues pulling at this heart-strung throughline, but now from a place of more raw emotion. Acts of rage and bitterness splatter across the small screen in the forms of inter-character blowouts. Show creators allow the long-ago lore to either be the premise on which the plot dangles or be brought to viewers\u2019 realization as the feuds unfold in real time. The tension caused by characters who are imbued by a sense of legacy like in season four of \u201cSuccession\u201d and the release of \u201cThe Fall of the House of Usher,\u201d create a perfect storm for these types of episodes. Both set in worlds of corporate cloaks and daggers, the shows explore character worthiness according to deeds of morality and their innate motivations to take the prize. \u201cUsher,\u201d inspired by Edgar Allan Poe works, details gory deaths that await the overly-privileged who do not heed warning to change their exploitative ways. However, the fight-for-birthright motif is not new. The most straightforward modern-day example is \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d where fantastical inter-family fights were on the scale of battlefields, drawing in viewers from franchises set in modern or futuristic times.\n\nUnlike the lore-related drama in \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d TV shows can take another route to reveal grudges between characters. The uptick of interfights in recent hit shows fits into a second type of formulaic fallout: more backstory revealed with each blow that lands. The most captivating sequences have adhered to this choreography of chaos, reappearing in social media search bars as: \u201c the fork dinner scene from \u2018The Bear\u2019 ,\u201d \u201c the road rage scene in \u2018BEEF,\u2019\u201d  \u201c the play episode in \u2018Euphoria.\u2019\u201d Why are the most revisited clips the same scenes viewers first watched through their fingers? One filmmaker/editor perspective may be that these sequences all happen in real-time. Like holiday specials, all characters are anchored to one location. The fuming mix of conflicting motivations and secrets ignite each other. There\u2019s no need for many cutaways nor flashbacks for exposition when the totality of a confession manifests in the present scene. Season two of \u201cThe Bear\u201d contains the gold standard of modern-day MacGuffins, which is a prop that pulls in the characters\u2019 focus in the current situation, but may seem insignificant to audiences who are observing the mood of the scene and are thinking about the plot as a whole. The fork represents the trigger between peace or hell in this standalone Christmas dinner episode. At the head of the dinner table, Mikey, the older son and arguably stand-in father figure, holds a fork posed to throw at Lee, a married-in-uncle relative whose abrasive presence has upended Mikey\u2019s attempt to uphold the family\u2019s status quo. Up until this point, Mikey and Carmy, the show\u2019s main character, have quietly mentioned other relatives\u2019 behaviors that have pushed the gathering closer to a breaking point.Microinteractions and inset power dynamics against a tense backdrop of family obligations can only cause built-up spite to hinge on a single fork to throw at an uncle. Audiences are met with new, old and only-heard-about characters in this flashback episode posed as an explainer for present-day ones. And at last, the long-awaited mucky lore paints this episode as \u201cgnarly\u201d  described by GQ  or \u201cthe most problematic episode of Season 2\u2032\u2032  claimed by the LA times .\n\nFinally, a new series without a recent similarity is Netflix\u2019s \u201cBEEF,\u201d which revolves around a single road rage incident. Subsequent shouting matches and eye-for-eye acts create a toxic vortex that the two protagonists, Danny and Amy, suck into and are trapped within. While Danny and Amy aren\u2019t related, their tumultuous back and forth entangles their own family members in such a way that the protagonists seem to exhibit nonsensical mood swings or are just absent completely. Although the original incident is a very ordinary experience, the push and pull of the family members\u2019 reactions and questions in response to the protagonists\u2019 white lies are reminiscent of tiny messes that make up real-life relationships. Compared to the other shows on this list, \u201cBEEF\u201d is the most full of blatant displays of anger, yet is the most grounded in scenarios that closely resemble real life.\n\nFrom witnessing an older relative succumb to mental illness to gifting an older brother with a drawing of the family restaurant or explaining to a daughter what divorce means, the TV releases of this year that have explored family drama as a genre prove that the most meaningful moments can be found in the most difficult circumstances. Almost in parallel universes, families break apart and are sewn together or sometimes not. The cycle of relational ups and downs seems perpetual with each flip of the calendar page. Yet from a holiday to a simple meal, the inherent reverence that a gathering holds space for allows for a host of quiet questioning and bare confessions alike.\n```"}

The lawsuit stems from a scholarship offered by the Fearless Fund that is \u201copen only to black females.\u201d The organization\u2019s stated mission goal is to invest in women of color-led businesses.\n\nIn a response submitted to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, Fearless Fund stated that the equal rights organization had no legal standing to file its lawsuit. Fearless Fund cited precedent that requires the suing organization to name individuals who were harmed. This precedent dates back to 2009 in Summers v. Earth Island Institute, a Supreme Court case that says a plaintiff must be able to name the individuals harmed in a lawsuit. According to the Fearless Fund, the equal rights organization \u201cfails to name any of its members [harmed by the scholarship offered].\u201d\n\nFearless Fund also stated that the Supreme Court has established judicial precedent where the First Amendment holds superiority over anti-discrimination laws, so the race-based scholarship is protected.\n\nThis is not the only lawsuit that the equal rights organization has filed on the grounds of violations of the Civil Rights Act. The organization filed a lawsuit against Perkins Coie LLC, stating that Perkins Coie has been \u201c[...]discriminating against future lawyers for decades\u201d due to their \u201cdiversity fellowships\u201d offered only to students of a minority race, students of the LGBT+ community or students who are disabled. In 2023, the organization also filed a lawsuit against Morrison & Foerster LLP, citing \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in the law firm\u2019s fellowships. The fellowships are accused of disqualifying applicants who are not \u201cAfrican American/Black, Latinx, Native Americans/Native Alaskans and/or members of the LGBTQ+ community.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time the equal rights group has filed a lawsuit regarding affirmative action in higher education. The organization has recently brought about the Supreme Court case SFFA v. Harvard. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled in a 6-2 decision that affirmative action laws are unconstitutional.\n```"}

The kids are so scared,\u201d the voice memo played through the microphone. \u201cIf anything happens to us habibti, please, please take care of mom.\u201d Those were the words of Keck physician Laila Al-Marayati\u2019s cousin, who is currently living in Khan Younis, Gaza.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to say to that?\u201d Al-Marayati said after sharing the voice message to people gathered Wednesday for the \u201cNight for Remembrance,\u201d an event hosted by the USC Muslim Student Union (MSU) to mourn the deaths of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nMore than 10,000 people have been killed in Gaza in the last 30 days, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. This follows the attacks on Israel on October 7 by Hamas, a militant Palestinian organization recognized by the U.S. as a terrorist group, which killed around 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nUSC students, faculty and community members gathered at the University Religious Center courtyard. The vigil started with a short reading of Quranic verse to grieve and pray for the innocent lives lost and went on to feature a spoken word poem along with multiple guest speakers.\n\nVarun Soni, the dean of religious life at USC, underscored the importance of recognizing that there is a community and campus resources to support those who are grieving.\n\n\u201cMy hope as the chaplain is for our students to realize that they\u2019re not alone and that people love them [and] care for them \u2014 that people are in pain with them and we can be together in our pain,\u201d he said.\n\nAn organizer of the event, a junior studying economics who requested anonymity for safety concerns, shared that the main aim of this gathering was to provide a safe space for people to express their emotions and feel a sense of connection with others.\n\n\u201cPeople are hurting. People don\u2019t feel safe on campus. I think that\u2019s one thing the university really needs to emphasize,\u201d he added.\n\nAttendees voiced what the event meant to them. \u201cI was very happy to see a lot of people in solidarity coming and showing their support,\u201d said Ivana Karastoeva, a junior majoring in global studies. \u201cEven though it\u2019s miles away, it\u2019s still hitting home.\u201d\n\nAlexis Augustine, who graduated in 2022, said she decided to come because she wanted to be around like-minded people and be in a space where she could express her grief. She said she felt disappointed at what she views as silence from many USC student organizations.\n\n\u201cOnes that are meant to be supportive are blatantly ignoring the plight of Palestinian people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really felt like a shock. I was going through the different orgs on Instagram to see what they were posting and there were just zero mentions of Gaza.\u201d\n\nAnother alum, Samiha Yusuf, echoed this sentiment, sharing that the event allowed her to feel a sense of connection. \u201cWhen I\u2019m surrounded with other people who are doing the work and organizing, sharing their stories, things like that, it just feels like there are people who actually care and want to help people process and do something so we don\u2019t feel so powerless.\u201d\n\nSome attendees said they now fear for their safety on campus. A Palestinian Christian student, out of fear of being retaliated against, asked for someone else to read their testimony. The statement, read by another organizer, accused the university of failing to show \u201cequal sympathy\u201d and \u201cdisregarded the safety\u201d of Palestinian students.\n\n\u201cAmong us in the Trojan family are students who have lost family members in large numbers in Gaza, and the university continues to ignore their pain,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe urge the university to offer equal protection, sympathy and respect for these Palestinian students.\u201d\n\nAfter the event concluded, another Palestinian student spoke with Annenberg Media condemning USC for what they see as its lack of action.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very honestly disappointed in how USC has handled this situation,\u201d said the student, who also requested anonymity out of fear for his safety. He then went on to criticize the initial statements President Carol Folt had made after Hamas\u2019 initial attack and Israel\u2019s retaliatory airstrikes that followed.\n\n\u201c[It] was a full disregard for the loss of Palestinian lives,\u201d he added.\n\nFolt released a statement on October 8 following Hamas\u2019s attacks. It received criticism from the USC community for not condemning the mass murder of Israelis or the taking of hostages. She then released a second statement on October 10, but did not mention Gazan deaths following Israel\u2019s retaliation. Her subsequent statements have been more about the general wellness of the USC community, however, people at this gathering want her to condemn Israel for killing innocent civilians in its war against Hamas.\n\nWhen Annenberg Media asked USC PR for a comment on the lack of a statement addressing the situation in Gaza, they responded through an email with a link to a list of statements Folt has made, including two statements about hate speech in which she denounced antisemitism, Islamophobia, racism and xenophobia.\n\nKarastoeva, the junior global studies major who came to the mourning event, said she believes USC needs to do a \u201cbetter job\u201d of protecting Palestinian and Muslim students and said USC was \u201clacking in that department.\u201d\n\n\u201cStudents are feeling unsafe in showing their support either at protests or even online for fear of doxxing, as has been the case in a lot of other prestigious universities,\u201d she said.\n\nColumbia University announced Friday that it would suspend the fall chapter of Students For Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace. Brandeis University similarly announced it was suspending a pro-Palestinian student group on campus.\n\nStudents throughout campuses in the U.S. remain fearful of being doxxed for statements made against the state of Israel. One of the most popular sites known for doxxing is The Canary Mission, which is an organization that displays the names and pictures of students and faculty members who have made anti-Israel statements.\n\nThe site posts information about each person including photos, videos and links to their social media, and has been criticized for impeding free speech. There are over 200 names of people associated with USC on the site.\n\nThe same sentiment of feeling unsafe and alone expanded beyond students. \u201cThere\u2019s just a huge cohort of students, faculty and staff who feel alienated and feel just completely marginalized,\u201d said a faculty member in attendance.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s very little way to even find out who those people are, because the university doesn\u2019t even keep statistics on Middle Eastern students in general.\u201d\n\nThe faculty member, who declined to reveal the school where they teach, asked for anonymity because they said they don\u2019t feel comfortable speaking out and fear retaliation for doing so. They emphasized the need for students to feel supported.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be there for them [the students] and for myself, because as a faculty person who thinks about this issue, it can be really hard because you\u2019re also isolated,\u201d they added.\n\nAn umbrella organization for all Muslim organizations nationally shared a website for anyone to share reports of discrimination or Islamophobia. Organizers said the data will be used to showcase hate crimes happening on campus on the west coast in the hopes that administrators will take action.\n\nThe night for remembrance finished with a spoken word poem, performed by Adil Khadri, a senior at USC.\n\n\u201cToday a child in Gaza woke up to the sound of a bomb. There was no snooze button. The only decision he made was whether to take the stuffed bear or the stuffed lion with him to embrace because in 7 minutes his family\u2019s apartment walls would be shaken awake, not from a call to rise but a call to die from the alarm of utter destruction by way of an Israeli airstrike,\u201d he read.\n\n\u201cToday I learned life.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives of the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund also tabled at the event to fundraise for children in Gaza, raising over $1,000 within 30 minutes, according to one of the organizers.\n\nThe event concluded with speakers encouraging attendees to greet someone they had never met before in the hopes they could find a community to share common grief.\n\n\u201cWe need to stand together,\u201d said Al-Marayati, one of the main speakers at the event. \u201cThis is not a time for hate, but a time for courage. We do not need to scream and yell or shout. We need to represent those who are screaming and crying and shouting.\u201d```"}

Twenty graduate programs from USC were present at the conference explaining the process of admissions, cost of attendance, scholarship opportunities and campus tours.

When she arrived at USC as a first-year student, she planned to study gerontology, but for Wu the study of aging soon got old. By sophomore year she was completely lost. That was until a friend in USC\u2019s Themed Entertainment Association suggested she look into the brand-new major that the School of Cinematic Arts (SCA) was launching: themed entertainment.\n\nThemed entertainment as a field is \u201cthe creation of an artificial environment where various elements bring to life a thematically driven story for immersing visitors in a strongly identified or branded setting,\u201d according to Theron Skees, a veteran of Walt Disney Imagineering.\n\nWu, sitting outside of the George Lucas International Building, discussed her first experiences with the program: \u201cI was worried it\u2019d just be about theme parks.\u201d Once she delved into her studies, Wu discovered that was far from the case. She said the program helped her not just develop her interests but expose her to subjects she never had an interest in prior.\n\n\u201cEvery discipline is possible in the world of themed entertainment, it\u2019s just a matter of harnessing your abilities and figuring out what makes you tick.\u201d\n\nThe themed entertainment major is not just new to USC but is an emerging field itself\u2014there are few programs like it in the country. The major launched at USC in the fall of 2023, with only six students in its inaugural freshman class and 15 students in the program total, including Wu.\n\nDespite the novelty of the major, the interdisciplinary nature of the cohort-based program is what drew Wu in. \u201cMy strong feeling is that we are a trade school in a sense, in that we are here to give students the ability to get a job and have a career,\u201d said themed entertainment professor Joe Garlington. \u201cSocial skills are critical to success in this industry, so everything we do in all the classes is team-based.\u201d\n\nThe students in the themed entertainment major prepare to hear from a guest speaker from Universal Studios Hollywood (Photo of Ari Rose-Marquez)\n\nThroughout the 2022-2023 school year, students of the newly-forming themed entertainment program, in a class colloquially called \u201cGolf,\u201d came together to create an immersive mini-golf course on campus. The final product was the culmination of collective woodworking, mechanical engineering, visual art and storytelling.\n\n\u201cThrough this process, I saw Amy grow into herself personally and as a creative, as she problem-solved and channeled her creativity to master her projects. I saw her grow into a great leader,\u201d said Tayler Somerville, a former suite-mate of Wu.\n\n\u201cOur industry is an \u2018industry of industries,\u2019\u201d Professor Garlington added. \u201cThe boundaries of the field are a little bit ill-defined, of course, but there are many ways to tell a story. The thing that distinguishes storytelling in our world from storytelling in other worlds is the use of physical space.\u201d\n\nSpace, sound, smell, density, flavor, color and light are all important factors students must consider when creating and developing immersive spaces.\n\nNot only is Wu a pioneer in themed entertainment, but the cross-disciplinary complexion of the program sparked other interests for her, as well. Wu is the vice chair of development for ART/EMIS, a student-run multimedia organization as well as an assistant tech director for KXSC, USC\u2019s globally broadcasted radio program.\n\nWu smiles for the camera in the courtyard of USC's School of Cinematic Arts (Photo by Ari Rose-Marquez)\n\n\u201cShe has worked as a collaborative team member for so many projects now and it seems like the major has allowed her creativity to flourish and lead to projects that truly shine,\u201d said Carissa Liu, a friend of Wu.\n\nAlong with her B.F.A. in themed entertainment, Wu is pursuing two minors: designing products at USC\u2019s Iovine and Young Academy and consumer behavior at the Marshall School of Business.\n\n\u201cOverall, I think [the program] has made Amy and others with interdisciplinary interests very happy intellectually and creatively,\u201d said Lizzie Lee, a friend of Wu.\n\nThe best part about the themed entertainment major is how each student comes from different backgrounds and expertise to \u201cmake something worth telling,\u201d Wu said. For, after all, themed entertainment would not exist without stories worth telling.\n```"}

Priebus was the White House chief of staff during the Trump administration and Demissie served as campaign manager to New Jersey Senator Cory Booker and Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nBoth Priebus and Demissie now serve as Center for the Political Future fellows for the fall semester.\n\nDemissie said he expects Biden\u2019s support to consolidate after party nominees are selected. He said the selection of Trump as the GOP nominee \u2013 which both Demissie and Priebus said they expect \u2013 would lead voters who are unhappy about the direction of the country but dislike Trump, to support Biden.\n\nBut, Demissie and Priebus also said third-party candidates could split the anti-Trump vote and potentially produce a Trump victory. They described a group of \u201c100,000 people in six states\u201d who they expect to decide the 2024 election, magnifying the effect of third-party candidates.\n\nPriebus pointed to declines in support among voters in battleground states and among Black voters as signs of Biden\u2019s weaknesses. Priebus also pointed to the national economy and geopolitical situation in the Middle East as undercutting Biden\u2019s \u201cfresh, decent, cut the nonsense kind of guy\u201d message.\n\nDemissie said that Democrats were unlikely to run on a message that focuses on portraying Trump as a threat to democracy, focusing instead on highlighting Biden\u2019s accomplishments.\n\n\u201cOur side is going to make sure for the next 372 days that this is a choice election about Joe Biden and the leadership he\u2019s provided versus the leadership that Trump would provide if he were President,\u201d Demissie said.\n\nDemissie said that would involve acknowledging the economic position of Americans while spotlighting the work Biden has done on issues like insulin pricing, climate resilience and student debt.\n\nBoth speakers highlighted economic issues as likely to play a heavy role in the campaign with Priebus also pointing to crime, the border and education as important issues.\n\nPriebus said that for Republicans, targeting messaging around nuances of issues is likely to be more important to the election outcome. He described how the GOP might present one voter with a message about gun rights to promote safety amid rising crime rates and another with a message about the protection of gun rights in the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cBroad strokes are great as a talking point. But that\u2019s really not how we win elections,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cWe win elections one person at a time, knowing everything about them, knowing what\u2019s in their head.\u201d\n\nDemissie and Priebus felt unsure about the impact of the Israel-Hamas war and the Republican speakership battle on the election. The pair agreed that the impact of Biden\u2019s decisions surrounding the war were difficult to predict given the significant time prior to the election.\n\nAt the end of the event, moderator and Center for the Political Future Executive Director Kamy Akhavan asked Demissie and Priebus to share what brings them hope in the political process.\n\n\u201cI want the kids and the students to see that you can have two folks up here that enjoy each other\u2019s company, don\u2019t agree, have a little bit of an argument, spar a little bit, have some fun and truly it\u2019s normal,\u201d Priebus said.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Cam Kauffman November 12, 2023 at 6:38 pm PST\n\nSenior outside hitter Skylar Fields and freshman outside hitter London Wijay had a combined 79 kills in the No. 25 USC women\u2019s volleyball team\u2019s final Pac-12 road trip to take on Washington and No. 9 Washington State this weekend, as USC split the decisions. The Trojans (17-9, 11-5) swept Washington (14-12, 5-10) Friday in Seattle before traveling to Pullman, falling to Washington State (20-7, 10-6) in a reverse sweep. It may be the last time the Trojans play Washington State, as the Cougars are one of the few remaining teams in the Pac-12 who have not announced a conference move yet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really disappointed with the outcome of the match today,\u201d head coach Brad Keller said of the loss to Washington State. \u201cAt the same time, I\u2019m really pleased with our effort and just our competitive spirit this entire weekend.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans jumped out to a quick 2-0 start over the Cougars thanks to a 14-5 run by USC to end the first set, 25-15. In the second, the set was tied at seven apiece before USC went on a 9-2 run to put it out of Washington State\u2019s reach. In the third set, however, the Cougars gave USC a taste of its own medicine, switching the momentum around for a 25-15 Washington State win.\n\nSophomore libero Gala Trubint, who had 22 digs during the match, said the Trojans\u2019 inability to slow the game down as things got away from them in the third set contributed to the momentum shift in the Cougars\u2019 direction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just important that we kind of hold out huddles and stay united as a team,\u201d Trubint said.\n\nUSC took Washington State to extra points in the fourth set thanks to five kills by Fields late in the game after it was tied at 19. Washington State, however, had a star player on its own in outside hitter Iman Isanovic, who contributed four kills down the stretch and 24 on the day.\n\nFields finished with 29 kills, despite most of the Cougars\u2019 frontline players having a few inches of height on the star senior. Fields, who recently surpassed the 2,000 career kills mark, has somehow heated up offensively even more the last week and is coming off of her third Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week award this season after her performance against Arizona and No. 15 Arizona State last week.\n\nDespite Fields\u2019 standout performance, Keller said that his team relied too heavily on her and Wijay \u2014 who had 18 kills in the match \u2014 in the final three sets, rather than spreading out the offensive effort like the Trojans did in the first two.\n\n\u201cWe were setting them way too much,\u201d Keller said. \u201cWe need a more balanced offense. ... Part of that is a passing issue that we had in sets three, four and five. Part of that is the decision-making of the setter. Part of it is understanding situations in those certain rotations.\u201d\n\nThe game marked USC\u2019s first reverse-sweep loss of the season, which Fields said is a good opportunity for growth as the season edges closer to postseason play.\n\n\u201cIt was a good lesson for us to understand that when we come out strong, we need to continue to do that throughout every single point,\u201d Fields said. \u201cThe game\u2019s not over until it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nKeller said a positive of the Trojans\u2019 Sunday performance was USC\u2019s fight as a team, despite losing control of the match down the stretch.\n\n\u201cI think we showed a lot of resilience,\u201d Keller said. \u201cEven at the end when we were getting blown out in the fifth set, we did not quit.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans dropped the fifth set 15-11, but fought back from a 13-7 deficit to give themselves a chance before Washington State junior opposite hitter Katy Ryan\u2019s two kills ended the Trojans\u2019 run.\n\nUSC returns home to the Galen Center Friday to take on Cal at 7 p.m.\n```"}

With preseason aspirations of playing for a Pac-12 Championship, a repeat Heisman season for junior quarterback Caleb Williams and even a College Football Playoff appearance seemingly gone heading into the game, many wondered how the Trojans would look against the Ducks.\n\nIn the first half, the struggles that have been plaguing the Trojans for several weeks remained. USC received the first half kickoff and the Trojans managed to get across midfield after a double pass play between Caleb Williams and junior wide receiver Mario Williams. However, the drive stalled on 3rd-and-9 after Williams was sacked by senior defensive end Brandon Dorlus \u2014 protecting Williams has been an issue for the Trojans as Williams has been sacked 29 times this season. Last season, Williams was sacked just 29 times in 13 total games.\n\nFollowing the sack, Oregon took the field at its 17-yard line for its first series of the game and the Ducks wasted no time getting into the endzone. Senior quarterback Bo Nix found junior wide receiver Tez Johnson for a 77-yard touchdown on the second play of the drive. Oregon\u2019s opening drive took just 49 seconds off the clock. The 77-yard reception for Johnson was the longest in his collegiate career. Johnson\u2019s score set the tone for an Oregon offense that would go on to outgain USC in both passing and rushing yards.\n\n\u201cTonight they were the deeper football team,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI thought tonight they played better on the line of scrimmage than we did and there were certainly some depth issues that showed up.\u201d\n\nFollowing former defensive coordinator Alex Grinch\u2019s dismissal, playing defense under interim defensive coordinators Shaun Nua and Brian Odom proved to be a big adjustment for USC. It did not help Odom and Nua that players like junior inside linebacker Eric Gentry and junior safety Jaylin Smith were out.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever coached a game where we had this many guys banged up, especially in the secondary,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt was a challenge and we had some guys battling and probably from a safety standpoint, should not have even been playing.\u201d\n\nAlready trailing 7-0, the Trojans opened their second drive looking to respond. After USC\u2019s opening drive ended in a sack, it looked like a sack would, again, end the Trojans\u2019 drive when Williams was taken down by freshman outside linebacker Teitum Tuioti, bringing up a 2nd-and-20. When the drive was in danger of stalling, Williams danced around the pocket and found junior wide receiver Dorian Singer for a 44-yard completion to set the Trojans up inside the redzone. From there, junior running back MarShawn Lloyd ran the ball in for a 5-yard touchdown to help USC tie the game at 7-7.\n\nTied at seven ten minutes in, it looked like USC had a chance to hang with Oregon. Then the Ducks answered right back with another touchdown. Nix found junior wide receiver Troy Franklin wide open on a slant and Franklin took it all the way to the house for an 84-yard score on 3rd-and-13. Nix only needed to complete two passes to get up to 161 yards on the game, more passing yards than Michigan and Penn State combined for earlier in the day. The Ducks ended that drive up 13-7 after a failed two-point conversion.\n\nFollowing that scoring drive, the game began to get out of hand for USC. The Ducks got the ball back and Nix found junior tight end Terrence Ferguson for a 15-yard touchdown to put Oregon up 19-7 following another failed two-point conversion. On Oregon\u2019s next drive, it was once again Franklin who gave the Trojans defense problems. On 1st-and-10, Franklin ran right past sophomore cornerback Domani Jackson and Nix found him down the sideline for a 63-yard gain. The Trojans were able to hold the Ducks to a field goal, but still found themselves down 22-7.\n\nDown 15 in front of nearly 60,000 fans with under two minutes left in the half, the Trojans needed to put a drive together to seize the momentum. They managed it. The drive started with 1:21 remaining on 3rd-and-6 when Williams found redshirt sophomore wide receiver Kyron Hudson for a 9-yard gain to keep the drive alive. On the next play, Williams hooked up with redshirt senior wide receiver Tahj Washington for a 59-yard gain to set USC up inside Oregon\u2019s 5-yard line. Two plays later, Williams finished off the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run up the middle. At halftime, Oregon led 22-14.\n\nThe Ducks started off with the ball in the second half and scored yet another touchdown to a wide-open receiver, Johnson\u2019s second of the game. The drive took nearly half the quarter. The Trojans could not get much going on the offensive side of the ball in the third quarter. A fumbled read option exchange between Williams and redshirt senior running back Austin Jones ended another promising drive. At the end of the third quarter, the Trojans found themselves down 29-14 and through three quarters, Nix was 18-for-24 passing for 336 yards and four touchdowns.\n\n\u201cThe theme of the last several weeks has been that we\u2019re not that far off, and we\u2019re not,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe got work to do, but that\u2019s kind of big picture right now.\u201d\n\nThe Ducks capitalized immediately after recovering the fumble to start the fourth quarter as junior running back Bucky Irving took a 19-yard run to the house. Irving had 118 of Oregon\u2019s 140 rushing yards. Now trailing 36-14, it was do-or-die for USC. With the game on the line, Williams led a 10-play, 75-yard touchdown drive that ended with senior wide receiver Brenden Rice hauling in a back-shoulder throw for a 9-yard score. Trailing 36-21 with 11:27 remaining, the Trojans needed to get stops on defense to give Caleb Williams and the offense a chance to steal a victory. Luckily for USC, Oregon drove the ball down the field again, only to miss a 41-yard attempt that could have put the Ducks ahead by 18.\n\n\u201cI think we had the right mindset going into tonight,\u201d redshirt senior defensive end Jamil Muhammad said. \u201cI think we responded well in certain situations, but there were other situations where we could have been better.\u201d\n\nWith possession and needing a score, Caleb Williams and the Trojans put together another scoring drive to cut deeper into Oregon\u2019s lead. After Williams found Rice twice for 49 yards, Jones capped off a six-play 77-yard drive with a 13-yard rushing touchdown. Following the score, the Trojans trailed 36-27 and failed a two-point conversion, keeping it a two possession game. After a failed USC onside kick attempt, the Ducks then ran out the rest of the clock and preserved a home victory over the Trojans. Their 552 yards of total offense and five total touchdowns proved to be too much for the Trojans to overcome.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to lose and not be in a position to win championships,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou train super hard for years to be in positions to win championships, so it\u2019s a weird feeling.\u201d\n\nUSC now looks ahead to its final game on the schedule against UCLA next Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Following an 11-win season last year, the Trojans will end the 2023 regular season with their sixth single-digit win season in the last ten non-Covid years.\n```"}

(AP/Rusty Jones)\n\nBy Ben Cohen\nNovember 11, 2023 at 3:12 pm PST\n\nINGLEWOOD, Calif. \u2014 Led by its newly healthy defense, the Chargers host the Detroit Lions this Sunday with a chance to improve to their first winning record of the season. L.A. held its last two opponents, the Tyson Bagent-led Bears and the Zach Wilson-led Jets, to nineteen total points, thanks to good play everywhere on defense. The line, led by the emergence of a healthy Joey Bosa, set a new season-high in sacks on Monday when they brought Wilson down eight times.\n\nBut Detroit\u2019s high-flying offense will pose a unique challenge. The Lions rank second in the NFL in yards per game\u2014behind only the Dolphins\u2014and have accumulated the sixth-most rushing and passing yards per game this season. Rookie running back Jahmyr Gibbs has come into his own both as a rusher and receiver over the past two weeks, registering 315 total yards and two touchdowns. Free agent signing David Montgomery is also \u201ctrending the right way\u201d towards playing on Sunday, according to head coach Dan Campbell.\n\n\u201cThey do a really good job of forcing you to defend everybody on the field,\u201d Staley said. \u201cThey have a lot of different guys who touch the football.\u201d\n\nFormer Trojan Amon-Ra St. Brown has emerged as one of the premier receivers in the game, and the Lions\u2019 offensive line has helped Jared Goff have one of his most productive seasons to date.\n\nRookie edge rusher (and another former Trojan) Tuli Tuipulotu broke out of his sack drought against New York, registering the first multi-sack game of his NFL career. After the game, Tulipulotu said he didn\u2019t feel like a rookie anymore, a statement with which his coach agrees.\n\n\u201cHe may be 21, but there\u2019s a lot of wisdom in the way he plays already,\u201d Staley said.\n\nThe 2022 FBS sack leader said he felt a change of energy in the Charger defensive unit thanks to a \u201ccelebration committee\u201d started by defensive coordinator Derrick Ansley.\n\n\u201cWhen you see somebody make a play you shouldn\u2019t just look at him like \u2018good stuff\u2019. You should go over there and give him that confidence, that energy boost because [when] you give him confidence, it gives you confidence,\u201d Tuipulotu said.\n\nSafety Alohi Gilman has provided a much-needed spark for the Chargers\u2019 secondary since returning from injury. The former sixth-round pick forced a fumble and recovered another against New York, and was just two yards away from what would have been his first career touchdown.\n\n\u201cYou see that trust that he creates for everybody else on the defense,\u201d Staley said. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be that quarterback back there that makes everybody play calm.\u201d\n\nOn offense, L.A. will look for some improvement after a tough outing against one of the league\u2019s best defenses in New York. Detroit, though, allows the fifth-fewest yards per game this season, with the second-best rushing defense. Staley has emphasized the importance of establishing the run all season, but an air attack on Detroit will likely be necessary for the Chargers this weekend.\n\nFortunately, Keenan Allen is playing as well as anyone in powder blue. The 31-year-old reached 10,000 career receiving yards against New York with a fittingly absurd one-handed catch. Like so many of his receptions, it resulted in a third-down conversion for a Charger first down.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best to ever do it, and I\u2019m privileged and honored to be able to throw him the ball,\u201d said Justin Herbert.\n\nAlong with Allen, the return to form for Austin Ekeler will be key for the Chargers as they try to keep up with the 6-2 Lions. While rushing opportunities may be limited, Ekeler remains one of the NFL\u2019s best pass-catching backs.\n\nAfter winning each of their last two games by multiple scores, L.A. will likely need to edge out a close game to win this weekend, a glaring weakness for the team in recent years. Detroit, however, hasn\u2019t played a one-score game since Week 2, when it blew a fourth-quarter lead to lose in overtime to Seattle.\n\nWith all the defensive talent and momentum they have, I believe the Chargers can win this weekend. As 2.5-point underdogs at the time of writing, an upset would give L.A. its first winning record of the season.\n\nThe Chargers kick off at SoFi Stadium against the Lions at 1:05 p.m. Sunday.\n```"}

(Photo Courtesy of AP Photo/Bernat Armangue)\n\nBy Valerie Fang November 11, 2023 at 1:12 pm PST\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d is a column by Valerie Fang dedicated to the sport of figure skating. We are witnessing the rise of a figure skating franchise. It is growing at an unparalleled speed and grabs the world\u2019s attention with magnificent force. Hanyu Yuzuru held two solo ice shows named RE_PRAY last weekend at Saitama Super Arena in Japan, kicking off his first national tour. The headline is that Hanyu has done it again. But this time, RE_PRAY is less symbolically abstract than GIFT, his last solo ice show, and uses the analogy of gaming to convey a more structured and universal narrative.\n\nWe often say sports provide a \u201cnatural laboratory\u201d for us to examine social values. \u2018RE_PRAY\u2019 portrays something that he picked up from the gaming world that influenced his competitive figure skating career and continues to be telling of life in general. Just like those incredible moments when he stepped off the ice to expand the performances during the show, many of the ideas Hanyu expressed in RE_PRAY extend beyond the rink and can make a comment on aspects of our lives outside of sport.\n\nThe concepts of life and freedom are two of the repeating themes in RE_PRAY. Although not explicitly stated, I think the show\u2019s story arcs make some meaningful references to Hanyu\u2019s figure skating experience so far. \u201cSurvival.\u201d \u201cCollision.\u201d \u201cSuffocation.\u201d \u201cAchieve what I\u2019ve always dreamed of, and I won\u2019t be caught up in the current again.\u201d \u201cRepeat.\u201d The first half of the show seems to address the issue of ethics when someone decides to relentlessly pursue the end goal. This end goal, when put into the context of athletics, could refer to the idea of perfection. Perhaps every athlete is inspired, motivated and also tormented by this idea of perfection. What comes after \u201cCitius - Altius - Fortius?\u201d\n\nBefore \u201cMegalovania,\u201d Hanyu mentions \u201cthe other side,\u201d \u201cthe unknown world\u201d and \u201cthe unknown story.\u201d Do you question the decisions you make while chasing after those ideas? In that video, Hanyu eventually decides to come through with the \u201cno mercy\u201d route, as the efforts and sacrifices that have already been made have pushed him well past the point of no return. We can connect it to the seasons between PyeongChang 2018 and Beijing 2022 and, of course, the quadruple axel challenge. A lot was at stake during that time. Could it be that the expectations from the world became a burden? Even though there was a tiny voice telling him to let it all go all along, could it be that this \u201csense of duty\u201d prevented him from doing so?\n\nTo be honest, during the six-minute warmup before \u201cMegalovania,\u201d I genuinely thought he was going for the quad axel (despite how I said that he has made peace with it, there is still a dream in me). In a way, this program can be interpreted as the new \u201cOrigin.\u201d The old version, which Hanyu created after PyeongChang 2018, was him pushing himself to the limit. It was a challenge primarily in terms of athleticism \u2014 the technicality and stamina of the jumps. It was also him playing by the rules that value jumps more than the overall completion of the program. But as Hanyu has turned pro and started to chart his own path, this \u201cother side\u201d and \u201cthe unknown story\u201d should now mean endless possibilities for his self expression. He is painting his own world and making his own art.\n\n\u201cGentle.\u201d \u201cEphemeral.\u201d \u201cBeautiful.\u201d \u201cFragile.\u201d \u201cWalking alone in the darkness.\u201d \u201cThe world without rules.\u201d The second half of RE_PRAY seems to explore what happens when we transition from relentlessly fighting with life to letting the vicissitudes of life take us to where it leads to. Hanyu says \u201cthere are no (default) settings\u201d during one of the video clips. Without a set goal in mind, Hanyu briefly delves into the possibility of predestination and likely an existential crisis as he ponders the questions of \u201cwho am I?\u201d and \u201cwhere did I come from?\u201d\n\nTo me, \u201cRequiem of Heaven and Earth\u201d and \u201cHaru yo, Koi\u201d are the two most memorable programs skated during the second half. Weaving these two performances into the half of the show makes perfect sense as Hanyu now concentrates on cherishing and appreciating the lives around us. The sentimentality, fueled by the surrounding context of those two programs, are what truly makes them timeless and powerful. I think it\u2019s interesting how \u201cHaru yo, Koi\u201d juxtaposes with \u201cHope & Legacy\u201d from the previous half. While the latter also depicts Hanyu striving to find hope in hardships, he is portrayed more as a fighter who devotes everything and kills off whatever or whoever is in his way for the final prize.\n\nJust think about the 2017 Worlds, when he placed fifth after the short program and managed to pull off the greatest comeback using his free skate, breaking his own world record to seize the title. So, if \u201cHope & Legacy\u201d is like trying to find the hope for spring in a cruel winter, the \u201cHaru yo, Koi,\u201d as Hanyu now performs it, has the feeling of arriving in spring. It shows us someone who is now comfortable with this world \u2013 someone who has gone through yet another cycle of evolution. And, in this sense, the story arc of RE_PRAY should be completed at this point.\n\nHanyu uses the two halves of RE_PRAY to outline two kinds of freedom. The first type is gained through outplaying everyone inside the arena. The rules and structures provide a clear path to victory and all the scores and statistics say you have the power to reach that victory on the other side. The second kind of freedom is perhaps Hanyu\u2019s message to us through this show. It\u2019s OK to feel lost. \u201cTomorrow arrives with the light.\u201d Despite turning pro, he is still looking forward to the unknown. But this time, he keeps continuing forward with a renewed faith. The courageous get to experience the world first. Whatever used to seem like it might swallow you whole \u2014 let it be grief, agony or simply the feeling of being lost \u2014 might breed new possibilities and opportunities if we look at them under a different light. At least, this is his way to protect \u201cour hope, our dream, our continuation of life.\u201d\n\nAnd maybe, what I\u2019ve said does not reflect Hanyu\u2019s intentions at all. But I\u2019m glad to see this quote from Mikiko: \u201cIt gave me joy and filled me with the desire to want to do even more. (Yuzuru\u2019s) words, and a world only he can paint, become complete only when they are joined by the lives and experiences of the audience.\u201d Just like any other true work of art, perhaps it does not matter what Hanyu expresses exactly, but what the whole thing makes you feel, makes you think and makes you imagine.\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d runs every other Friday.\n```"}

(AP/LM Otero)\n\nBy Dylan Luden November 11, 2023 at 12:58 pm PST\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver is one of the most daring leaders in sports. He isn\u2019t afraid to push the boundaries of American sports and try something new, which is exactly what he set out to do with the brand-new NBA In-Season Tournament. For soccer fans, this tournament format should look very similar. All 30 teams have been split up into six groups of five, with three groups from the Eastern Conference and three groups from the Western Conference. The tournament\u2019s group stage games will count towards each team\u2019s regular season record. Group stage games will take place on \u201cTournament Nights,\u201d which are now every Tuesday and Friday in November. Each team will play four group stage games where the top team from each group will move on to the knockout rounds. Besides the six teams that will automatically qualify for the knockouts, there will be one wild card team from each conference. Wild card slots will be given to the teams with the best record of those that placed second in their groups. The tiebreaker, if needed, would be a head-to-head record in the group stage. All of the knockout games will take place in December, with the championship game for the In-Season Tournament, the NBA Cup, taking place in Las Vegas on Dec. 9.\n\nTwo days of \u201cTournament Nights\u201d have already passed, but the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers played their first games Friday against the Phoenix Suns and Dallas Mavericks, respectively. The Lakers bested the Suns 122-119, and the Clippers fell to Dallas 144-126. Here\u2019s the rest of both the Lakers and Clippers\u2019 In-Season Tournament schedule:\n\nLakers: Tuesday, Nov. 14 vs Memphis Grizzlies; 7:30 p.m. Friday, Nov. 17 @ Portland Trail Blazers; 7 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 21 vs Utah Jazz, 7 p.m.\n\nClippers: Tuesday, Nov. 14 @ Denver Nuggets; 7 p.m. Friday, Nov. 17 vs Houston Rockets; 7:30 p.m. Friday, Nov. 24 vs New Orleans Pelicans; 7:30 p.m.\n\nThe Lakers certainly have the easier group between the two Los Angeles teams. The Clippers group features the top two teams in the Western Conference in the Nuggets and Mavericks. Meanwhile, the Lakers\u2019 group is relatively easy on paper. The Grizzlies, Jazz, and Trail Blazers currently have the three worst records in the West. The Suns also sit below .500 to begin the season even though their roster is loaded with all-stars.\n\nThe Lakers and Clippers have each struggled to start the season. Both teams are currently around .500 and haven\u2019t looked up to the expectations built last offseason. The battle for Los Angeles matchup between these two teams was riveting, but the victorious Lakers couldn\u2019t capitalize on that momentum as they\u2019re 1-5 on the road. The Clippers are still trying to figure out how to balance their offense. The system has arrived, according to James Harden, but that system has been ineffective through his first three games. Even though he\u2019s shooting well (13-21), he\u2019s only scored 43 total points. Plus, his passing may need a bit of work.\n\nFor the Lakers to move on, it\u2019ll be key for them to grind on the road and put up tough contests. The Purple and Gold responded extremely well on the road against the Suns after being blown out by the Rockets 128-94 and letting Dillon Brooks actually back up his trash talk on defense.\n\nThe Clippers\u2019 perspective may seem easier as it\u2019s more of an in-house issue that has a resolution: just have your four star players play together on the court to build their chemistry and develop a rapport with each other. The clock is ticking, though, if the Clippers want to win the NBA Cup, as their knockout games are this month.\n\nOverall, based on their respective groups, the Lakers have a much easier path. It\u2019ll be hard for the Clippers to jump the Mavericks and the reigning NBA Champion Nuggets to make it onto the knockout stage.\n```"}

It was a part of a larger nationwide \u201cshutdown for Palestine,\u201d which at USC included a walkout, a march and a temporary installation \u2013 a printout of the thousands of names of Palestinian civilians killed in Israeli strikes and retaliation, following the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas, a militant group recognized by the U.S. as a terrorist organization. It was at this installation that a number of eyewitnesses first saw Strauss step on the list of names of the dead Palestinians.\n\nAt the start of the event, Strauss \u201cwalked on a list of names memorialized intentionally and was asked not to by student organizers,\u201d according to Nada, a Global Studies and Human Biology student who helped organize this and other protests.

That\u2019s all they are.\u201d With students clearly taking video on their phones, Strauss then continued to say, \u201cEvery one should be killed, and I hope they all are.\u201d Several angles of the moment are circulating. Annenberg Media has reviewed raw clips in addition to the videos on social media.\n\nIn an email, Strauss referred Annenberg Media to another individual he said \u201chas the actual words I said which are completely different and not offensive except to Hamas supporters.\u201d That person, a USC alumni who is based in New York, said she was upset by Strauss getting \u201cvilified.\u201d In an interview, Daisy K. said she doesn\u2019t know the professor and did not witness the event, but she wanted to support him after seeing the video. She said she has been deeply troubled by the unrest on campus, including the removal of posters showing Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that we unite in solidarity with Professor Strauss and the Jewish students who rely deeply on his support during these distressing times,\u201d Daisy K. said Saturday. Daisy K. shared a version of the video she called full and unedited. It is the same video that went viral on Twitter, but which had faces of attendees blurred out to protect the identity of protestors from surveillance.\n\nMore than a dozen people, including students and faculty, filed complaints about the professor\u2019s remarks. One was through the Office of Community Expectations. Annenberg Media viewed a copy of one Title IX complaint with at least 15 signatories. Social media campaigns have directed people to email USC President Carol Folt and her team.\n\nIn an Oct. 31 email titled \u201cUpdate on Campus Hate Speech and New Government Actions Regarding Antisemitism and Islamophobia,\u201d Folt noted, \u201cUSC publicly and unequivocally denounces antisemitism, Islamophobia, racism, and xenophobia. Hate speech is antithetical to our values and any threats of violence are unacceptable. Anyone who incites violence will be referred immediately to law enforcement for investigation and prosecution.\u201d\n\nThe university responded to the incident in an official statement to Annenberg Media. \u201cWe are aware of a social media post showing a faculty member engaging with demonstrators on our campus; we are looking into this,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe encourage everyone in the USC community to respect others\u2019 views/act with civility towards each other.\u201d\n\nThere is no legal definition in the U.S. for \u201chate speech.\u201d The USC Student Handbook notes that, \u201cacts shall not be considered \u2018hate violence\u2019 based on speech alone, except upon a showing that the speech itself threatens violence against a specific person or group, that the person or group against whom the threat is directed reasonably fears that the violence will be committed because of the speech, and that the person threatening violence had the apparent ability to carry out the threat.\u201d\n\nNada characterized Strauss as using hate speech. He \u201chas threatened us as students,\u201d she said, \u201cmaking us feel unsafe in our academic environment.\u201d Strauss is a tenured professor at the Dornsife School of Letters, Arts and Sciences. According to his bio, he specializes in issues of \u201cdevelopment economics\u201d and \u201ceconomics of the household.\u201d He is listed as a Resource Person with the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC), and a Chang Jiang Professor with the China Center for Economic Research at Peking University. He has published numerous book chapters and has a long list of research projects focused on aging in China, and is also affiliated with the USC Davis School of Gerontology. He has taught at Michigan State University, Yale University and the University of Virginia and has been at USC since at least 2006.\n```"}

(Photo by Shantala Muruganujan)\n\nBy nikki thomas November 10, 2023 at 11:55 pm PST\n\nFreshman guard JuJu Watkins and junior center Rayah Marshall notched 18 points apiece in a home-opening win for the No. 21 USC women\u2019s basketball team against Florida Gulf Coast Friday at the Galen Center in the first ever meeting between the two. USC came looking to defend its home after a strong season-opening win against No. 7 Ohio State on Monday. Against the Buckeyes, Watkins had 32 points and Marshall added 18 points and had 17 rebounds to lead the Trojans to a win.\n\nThe Trojans struggled to generate offense early against the Eagles and were down 9-0 before Marshall scored USC\u2019s first points of the game nearly halfway through the first quarter. But USC went on a 14-4 run to end the quarter, and a recalled Eagles basket led to a 14-11 Trojan lead heading into the second quarter.\n\n\u201cThey established themselves after that,\u201d head coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cI thought Rayah really got us going at that point because she scored a couple of buckets inside, and from there we started getting stops.\u201d\n\nUSC continued its dominance in the second quarter, limiting FGCU to eight points on 20% shooting from the floor. USC had 16 points off of 12 Eagles turnovers in the first half, and FGCU didn\u2019t attempt a single free throw. The Trojans led 33-19 at the half.\n\nIt was all USC in the second half thanks to Marshall and Watkins, and the Trojans led 58-38 after three. USC shot 59% from the field in the third and outrebounded FGCU for the first time in a quarter all game.\n\n\u201cI wish you had the chance to play with JuJu,\u201d Marshall said about her chemistry with Watkins. \u201cIt\u2019s actually really nice to play with a high-IQ, elite-caliber player.\u201d\n\nWatkins and Marshall each contributed two blocks as well. Graduate forward McKenzie Forbes had a team-high six assists and added two steals. Redshirt sophomore guard Taylor Bigby contributed nine points and four rebounds, while Watkins and graduate forward Kaitlyn Davis led the team with seven rebounds each.\n\n\u201c[There are] definitely a lot of emotions, just anticipating this moment for so long,\u201d Watkins said of her Galen Center debut. \u201cBeing in Galen for the first time, wearing SC across my chest, [I\u2019m] just very grateful and always thinking of what got me here.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s win was also a celebration for Trojan fans, as part of the night was dedicated to honoring USC\u2019s 1983 and 1984 NCAA Championship teams. 2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the first women\u2019s basketball title in USC history, and the back-to-back titles in 1983 and 1984 symbolize an iconic era in the program\u2019s history. Cheryl Miller, Pam and Paula McGee, and former head coach Linda Sharp were honored among others during the championship celebration.\n\n\u201cIt was like a dream,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWe had the honor of actually hearing from some of those players before the game, and they just gave us that motivation, a little insight on what it\u2019s like to wear this SC jersey. We were fortunate enough to go out there and get a win out in front of them. It was a really fun feeling.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans haven\u2019t returned to the championship game since 1986, but the team is excited for what the upcoming season might bring.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a unique feel with this team that is very rare,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI think when you have that, anything is possible.\u201d\n\nUSC returns to the Galen Center on Monday to take on Le Moyne at 5:30 p.m.\n```"}

In a low-scoring affair, USC women\u2019s soccer took down the Grand Canyon Lopes 1-0 in front of a home crowd Friday afternoon. The win avenges a first-round home defeat in the tournament last season for Alukonis and the Trojans.\n\n\u201cI did a lot of work trying to understand how to break spells because when I was at UCLA, it was the same thing; we got upset first round after a good season,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cWe know [come] tournament time, teams play different because if you concede or if you lose, you\u2019re out. Some teams might sit-in because you can go to PKs. Just making sure we found a way to get the ball in the net.\u201d\n\nDespite only managing one goal, the Trojans dominated in nearly all facets of the game, possessing the ball for 67% of the time and keeping it on GCU\u2019s side of the pitch for extended periods of time. Because of the large discrepancy in time of possession between the two teams, the Lopes were only able to muster four total shots to the Trojans\u2019 14. None of the shots proved any danger to USC, as only one of them made it through to sophomore goalkeeper Hannah Dickinson.\n\n\u201cA big reason why we like to dominate possession is to try to tire out the opponent,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cObviously, you want a goal as soon as possible, but typically around the 70th minute mark is when they really start to show if they\u2019re tired.\u201d\n\nThe lone goal of the game came from junior midfielder Helena Sampaio on a penalty kick in the 66th minute drawn by junior forward Izzy Kimberly, Sampaio\u2019s sixth goal of the season. The midfielder knocked it into the net with ease, placing it in the bottom left corner as GCU\u2019s goalkeeper, junior DeAira Jackson, dove toward the opposite post.\n\n\u201cAfter the ball went into the net, I was just gonna hug Izzy [Kimberly],\u201d Sampaio said. \u201cI was just happy because I knew as soon as we scored, we were going to win the game.\u201d\n\nSampaio nearly outshot GCU with three shots on the afternoon and was inches away from a second goal later in the half, if not for Jackson\u2019s sprawling save.\n\n\u201cI thought it was going to go in,\u201d Sampaio said. \u201cI was ready to celebrate.\u201d\n\nPrior to the penalty-kick score, the Trojans still had plenty of scoring chances, with multiple hitting the crossbar or becoming one of Jackson\u2019s five saves, like one of Sampaio\u2019s shots. For much of the game, the Trojans\u2019 performance was reminiscent of their past month of play \u2014 a stout defense without much scoring, as USC went 1-2-3 dating to October 14. But Alukonis said she knew that, despite USC\u2019s poor luck on scoring this past month, it would eventually turn in the Trojans\u2019 favor.\n\n\u201cWe said, \u2018we know our luck and our karma is gonna come back around,\u2019\u201d Alukonis said. \u201c[I\u2019m] happy it did today. Really good job by Izzy [Kimberly] drawing [the penalty kick] and Helena [Sampaio] is pretty much flawless when she takes PKs.\u201d\n\nIt was the stout backline of Trojan defenders that afforded the USC attack to miss so many chances, but still have USC come out with the win. While the Trojans dominated in possession, the Lopes came in with a plan to implement fast breaks as their counter-attack. This allowed multiple GCU players to play one-on-one against a USC defender \u2014 battles which the Trojans often won. Minutes before Sampaio scored her goal, GCU had a particularly dangerous attack brewing on a fast break, but freshman defender Alyssa Gonzalez made a successful tackle, which kept the ball out of harm\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always kind of the downside of playing the style that we play that\u2019s very expansive,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cTons of goals \u2014 probably most in college soccer \u2014 [are when] our team is getting caught in transition.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans now look to the next round as they will face off against BYU on the road on November 16.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Danilo Lauria)\n\nBy Paige Shea November 10, 2023 at 5:38 pm PST\n\nThe theme for fashion\u2019s biggest night has finally been announced. The Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute has unveiled its 2024 spring exhibition, which serves as the inspiration for the subsequent Met Gala, also known as the Costume Institute Benefit. The Met announced on Wednesday in a press release that the Spring 2024 exhibit and Gala theme will be titled \u201cSleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\u201d a departure from the more straightforward themes that the Met Gala has taken on in previous years, such as last year\u2019s \u201cKarl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,\u201d \u201cIn America: An Anthology of Fashion\u201d (2022), and \u201cCamp: Notes on Fashion\u201d (2019).\n\nThe exhibition will be on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from May 10 - Sept. 2, and the highly anticipated Gala will take place on May 6. Advanced technology such as AI, video animation, soundscapes and light projection will make the exhibit possible, conveying \u201cthe smells, sounds, textures, and motions of garments that can no longer directly interact with the body,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nThe exhibition will feature about 250 pieces, some of which are rarely shown to the public, from the Costume Institute\u2019s permanent collection that spans 400 years of fashion history. This includes the central 15 historically significant pieces that are too structurally fragile to ever be worn again. Among the pieces in the collection are a 17th-century Elizabethan-era bodice, a 19th-century ball gown by Charles Frederick Worth and a World War II-era dress by the French designer Madeleine Vionnet.\n\nThe exhibit will also display archival looks from iconic fashion houses Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior and Elsa Schiaparell. The Met describes the upcoming show as \u201cthe natural world as a uniting visual metaphor for the transience of fashion,\u201d explored through the cyclical nature of rebirth and renewal.\n\nThese historical and archival pieces will also be shown alongside contemporary works from fashion powerhouses such as Stella McCartney, Philip Lim and Connor Ives. TikTok will be lead sponsor for both the exhibition and gala, in collaboration with Loewe and Cond\u00e9 Nast. This sponsorship by TikTok may heavily influence another rising trend from previous years\u2019 Met Galas: internet influencers on the red carpet.\n\nMadison Hong, co-president of the USC Fashion Industry Association (FIA), isn\u2019t a fan of the new trend of TikTokers at the Met Gala. \u201cFashion is getting so commercialized. I understand [it], but I also think that this year\u2019s theme is the very opposite of commercialization of fashion, it\u2019s more about history and tradition,\u201d Hong said. \u201cI feel like people who have no connection with the industry or history with the industry shouldn\u2019t just go there to be in the spotlight.\u201d\n\nMaddy Brown, an E-board member of the events team at USC FIA, thinks that the invitation of TikTok stars to the Met Gala promotes inclusivity. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Met Gala should be closed off or just [for] A-list celebrities. I think that inviting TikTok is inviting young people who, even a couple of years previously, would not have had this chance,\u201d said Brown. \u201cI think it does make that whole world, which is pretty closed off to us, a little bit more accessible.\u201d\n\nBut this begs the question: How will celebrities and influencers alike translate this thematic call to past and present into Met Gala looks that are timeless? Some may wear designs inspired by the historical garments on display. Many celebrities last year took inspiration from the past when interpreting the 2023 \u201cKarl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\u201d theme, where guests were encouraged to dress in honor of the late designer. Many arrived in tweed, vintage looks inspired from Lagerfeld\u2019s long and iconic tenure at Chanel.\n\nIt would not be surprising to see looks inspired by the historically significant ball gowns on display, new takes on the archival pieces from prominent fashion houses, or even the use of technology to enhance the \u2018wow-factor\u2019\u2014 think Zendaya\u2019s light-up Cinderella gown in 2019, or Blake Lively\u2019s dramatic Statue of Liberty-inspired gown in 2022.\n\nWhat will be intriguing, though, is how the designers may choose to focus on the sustainability or natural beauty aspect of the theme for their designs. Alexis Zoto, associate professor of teaching art and design at USC Roski School of Art and Design, echoed this sentiment regarding the eco-conscious nature of the Met Gala theme. \u201cOne can imagine a very literal idea of using the image of Sleeping Beauty from fairy tales, to thinking about garments and outfits celebrating aspects of nature or signaling renewal,\u201d Zoto said. \u201cI also think someone will respond with a garment that rethinks an industry that is one of the worst polluters of the earth.\u201d\n\nEffie Trinket\u2019s stunning Alexander McQueen butterfly dress from \u201cThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire\u201d was the image for Vogue\u2019s Instagram announcement of the 2024 Met Gala theme, which could inspire designers to utilize the natural world as inspiration for their Met Gala looks. Additionally, celebrities may choose sustainable designers for their looks. Conner Ives, a new leader in the fashion industry, is heralded for his emphasis on sustainability in his work. Having dressed Natalia Bryant, a fellow Trojan, for the 2021 Met Gala, he is no stranger to the event.\n\nThe official dress code has not been released to guests yet, but the open-ended theme means that there\u2019s sure to be some surprises on the red carpet in May.\n```"}

Its schedule does not get easier Saturday, as the Trojans take on No. 6 Oregon in Eugene. Oregon is 8-1, having lost to Washington on a late missed field goal, but the Ducks find themselves in the center of the playoff race. A win at home would keep them in control of their own destiny. If they win out, they more than likely give the Pac-12 its third ever playoff appearance as the bell tolls on the conference.\n\nUSC is fighting to keep this season vaguely respectable. Losses to Notre Dame and Washington were disappointing for a team which, whatever head coach Lincoln Riley now says, started the season with National Championship ambitions. The loss to a Utah team decimated by injury was more shocking. The Trojans only play two more games \u2014 this week, against a highly-competitive Oregon team and next weekend against crosstown rivals UCLA. They will have to play much better football than they have the last few weeks if they want to avoid ending the year at 7-5.\n\nTuesday\u2019s news that defensive coordinator Alex Grinch was leaving the program was welcomed with open arms by the Trojans fanbase. It remains to be seen what his interim replacements, DL coach Shaun Nua and LB coach Brian Odom, will be able to improve, if anything. But if USC wants to win this weekend, those improvements better come fast.\n\nTHE DEFENSE\n\nUSC\u2019s defense tries to bend without breaking \u2014 it accepts that opposing offenses will gain yardage, but aims to keep them out of the end zone and prevent explosive plays. It didn\u2019t do well at avoiding those breaks, hence Grinch\u2019s ousting. Over the last six games, the team has allowed 44 points per game. Only nine teams allow more points per game this year, none of which have a winning record. USC\u2019s 34.5 points allowed per game \u2014 121st out of 130 teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision \u2014 would be the worst in the program\u2019s history.\n\nWith only four days since the news of Grinch\u2019s departure, Odom and Nua haven\u2019t had much time to improve the defense\u2019s discipline. Oregon is a tough matchup for that style of defense, even when they aren\u2019t debuting new DCs. The Ducks\u2019 offense, which is predicated on the short pass game and run game, aims to bend opposing defenses until they break. The Ducks score more points per game than any other team in the nation \u2014 USC is second.\n\nTo have a chance at winning Saturday, USC will need to see a sharp improvement in the unit allowing the second-most explosive plays in the whole FBS. It\u2019s one of many areas where USC and Oregon greatly differ. Oregon has the 11th best scoring defense in college football. In three of its last six games, Oregon has allowed just six points each. Against Washington\u2019s more talented offense though, the Ducks allowed 36 points. Dan Lanning has built a strong unit, but an offense of USC\u2019s caliber should be able to remain competitive against it.\n\nTHE RUN GAMES\n\nUSC\u2019s offense is known for its pass game this year. That\u2019s not necessarily surprising, since it ranks fifth in the nation in pass yards per game and is led by the reigning Heisman winner in junior quarterback Caleb Williams, but that\u2019s not the only strong facet of the offense. USC averages the ninth most yards per carry in college football. Redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd is third in the nation in the same stat.\n\nDespite that success, the team has not stuck with the run game consistently. The Trojans average 160 rushing yards per game \u2014 roughly the median in the FBS. As impressive as USC has been when it chooses to run the ball, the Trojans are not the most impressive ground team in this game. Oregon leads the nation in yards per carry and is 10th in rushing yards per game. Its thunder-and-lightning duo of sophomore running back Jordan James and junior running back Bucky Irving has had remarkable success on the ground this year.\n\nThe Ducks\u2019 stats are even more ridiculous when considering the simultaneous success of their passing game. The Ducks are fourth in passing yards per game, narrowly beating the Trojans to that spot. Part of why USC has put up so many passing yards every week is its abandonment of the run in the second half. By my count, the Trojans moved the ball on the ground 15 total times in the second half against Washington and Utah, five of which were Caleb Williams scrambles. That leaves just 10 intentional runs in two whole halves of close football when the run was working. Williams took the passing option on some form of run-pass option eight times \u2014 one scramble was on such a play.\n\nLloyd\u2019s absence against Washington may have played a role in the team\u2019s shift to the pass game, but it shouldn\u2019t play a role against Oregon \u2014 Riley said Thursday that the redshirt junior is expected back. To have a good shot against the Ducks, USC will need to embrace some semblance of a run game if it continues to work.\n\nUSC faces one of the toughest tests of its season Saturday. The Trojans need to limit the mistakes they\u2019ve made in the last few weeks if they want to have any chance at toppling the No. 6 team in the country.\n```"}

Huskies running back Dillon Johnson, who had never rushed for over 100 yards in his collegiate career prior, totaled 267 yards and four touchdowns on 28 touches. Penix was efficient, completing 22 of his 30 pass attempts for 256 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. As for the Trojans, reigning Heisman trophy winner Caleb Williams arguably outplayed Penix. Williams threw for 312 yards and accounted for four total touchdowns. He commanded the Trojans offense down the field consistently, finding Tahj Washington for 122 yards and a score. Running back Austin Jones also performed well had a nice day for USC, rushing for 127 yards. With the score knotted up at 42 apiece heading into the fourth quarter, it was clear that whichever defense made key stops first would come out victorious. Washington answered the call, pitching a shutout in the final frame. Johnson added to his historic day with a 1-yard rushing touchdown with just above two minutes remaining to lay the final blow on the Trojans. Washington (9-0) remains ranked No. 5 in the CFP Poll. USC (7-3) finds themselves unranked after a heartbreaking conference loss.\n\nTexas survives Kansas State at home, 33-30 (OT)\nUp by 13 heading into the fourth quarter, Texas looked to be in prime position to win their eighth game. In a turn of events, the Wildcat defense would go on to force two early turnovers, allowing their offense to tie the game up at 27. Quarterback Will Howard looked poised in this contest, throwing for 327 yards and four touchdowns with one interception. The Wildcat passing attack was on point with four receivers accounting for 65+ yards. The running game was a different story, as the team totaled just 33 yards on the ground. The Longhorns offense looked opposite to that of Kansas State, finding much success on the ground with 230 total yards. Running back Jonathan Brooks led the team with 112 yards and one touchdown on 22 carries. Quarterback Maalik Murphy, who started his second straight game in relief of an injured Quinn Ewers, completed 19 of his 37 pass attempts for 248 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. Receiver Adonai Mitchell led the team with 149 receiving yards and a score. Both teams would trade field goals late in the fourth to send this game into overtime. A stagnant drive from the Longhorns saw them settle for three. Kansas State would drive down to Texas\u2019 four-yard line facing fourth and goal. The Wildcats opted to go for the touchdown and win, which proved to be a bad idea as Howard was sacked. Texas (8-1) remains ranked No. 7 in the poll. Kansas State (6-3) exited the poll.\n\nOle Miss holds off Texas A&M, 38-35\nIt took a last-minute touchdown run from running back Quinshon Judkins for the Rebels to avoid the upset loss at home. Judkins and the Rebels offense had a nice day offensively, as the sophomore running back rushed for 102 yards and three touchdowns. Quarterback Jaxson Dart had himself a day too, completing 24 of his 33 pass attempts for 387 yards and two touchdowns. But perhaps the most impressive player on the Rebels offense was receiver Tre Harris, who hauled in 11 of his 15 targets for 213 yards and a score. A blocked field goal returned for a touchdown in the second quarter put A&M on the board, but Ole Miss found themselves up by 10 heading into the fourth. The Aggies offense kept on fighting to take the lead late in the fourth. Quarterback Max Johnson was solid in this bout, throwing for 305 yards, one touchdown and one interception whilst completing 73 percent of his passes. The Aggies saw solid contributions up and down the box score offensively, but their defense could not stop Ole Miss\u2019 final drive. Ole Miss (8-1) slid up one spot to No. 9 in the poll, while Texas A&M (5-4) remains unranked.\n\nClemson outduels Notre Dame, 31-23\nThe Tigers rode an interception returned for a touchdown midway through the second quarter to an upset victory at home. Clemson found most of their offensive success from running back Phil Mafah, who rushed for 186 yards and two touchdowns on 36 attempts, accounting for 65 percent of the team\u2019s total offense. Quarterback Cade Klubnik had a rough statistical performance in the win, throwing for just 109 yards, one touchdown and one interception. Neither signal caller shined in this contest, as Fighting Irish quarterback Sam Hartman also had an uninspiring performance. Hartman threw for just 146 yards and two interceptions, completing just 43 percent of his passes. Notre Dame did find success on the ground, rushing for 186 yards collectively. Standout running back Audric Estime led the way for the Irish with 120 total yards and a score. Hartman added 68 yards on the ground and a score. Down by 15 at halftime, Notre Dame was able to claw back into this one, heading into the fourth down by just eight. A scoreless fourth quarter from both programs saw the Tigers hold on to an impressive victory. Notre Dame (7-3) comes in at No. 20 in the CFP rankings. Clemson (5-4) remains unranked.\n\nGeorgia sneaks past Missouri, 30-21\nA 10-10 halftime score assured Bulldog fans this game was going to be closer than they may have initially anticipated. A balanced attack on offense from the Tigers saw a stout Georgia defense tying their highest allowed point total of the year. Missouri quarterback Brady Cook had a concrete solid outing against the highly touted Bulldogs, throwing for 212 yards, one touchdown and one interception. Running back Cody Schrader led the team with 112 rushing yards and a score on 22 carries, while receiver Theo Wease hauled in five catches for 90 yards. Georgia\u2019s offense came alive in the third quarter, outscoring the Tigers 14-3. Quarterback Carson Beck was efficient, completing 21 of his 32 pass attempts for 254 yards and two touchdowns. Beck is still without his top target in tight end Brock Bowers, turning to receiver Ladd McConkey, who caught eight balls for 95 yards. The Bulldogs sustained long, methodical drives down the field to keep the ball out of Cook\u2019s hands. They were able to hold on during the fourth quarter and win a sloppy game by their standards. Georgia (9-0) remains ranked No. 2 in the CFP rankings. Missouri (7-2) sees a slight dip to No. 14 after hanging with one of the best teams in the country.\n\nOklahoma State tops Oklahoma in Bedlam Series, 27-24\nA domination in time of possession for the Cowboys saw an otherwise equal statistical contest lean in their favor. Oklahoma State running back Ollie Gordon, who leads the nation in rushing, ran for 137 yards and two touchdowns on 33 attempts. His big day allowed the Cowboys to control the clock in this contest. Gordon wasn\u2019t alone in his contributions, as quarterback Alan Bowman was also performing for the Cowboys. Bowman threw for 334 yards and rushed for a touchdown, protecting the ball in the process. Bowman found three receivers for more than 70 yards, including Rashod Owens, who led the team with 10 receptions for 136 yards. While the Sooners had a solid day offensively, they succumbed to turnovers. The offense turned the ball over three times, two of which came from quarterback Dillon Gabriel. Gabriel was otherwise stable, throwing for 344 yards and one touchdown. Running back Gavin Sawchuk led the team with 111 yards and one touchdown on 13 carries, while receiver Drake Stoops hauled in 12 catches for 134 yards and a score. Oklahoma found themselves with an opportunity to tie or win the game with just under two minutes remaining. After just one first down, the Cowboy defense stopped the Sooners on 4th-and-5, killing their last hopes of a win. Oklahoma State (7-2) jumped seven spots to No. 15 after its biggest win of the season. Oklahoma (7-2) drops eight spots to No. 17 in the rankings after the heartbreaking rivalry loss.\n\nAlabama defeats LSU, 42-28\n31 carries, 318 yards and five touchdowns. These were the combined rushing statistics for the two quarterbacks in this contest. Milroe, who has come into his own as of late, continued to show his dual-threat ability. He finished with 20 rushes for 155 yards and four touchdowns. The Crimson Tide signal-caller was also efficient through the air, throwing for 219 yards with a completion percentage of 65. But it was his day on the ground that took Alabama over the edge. He led the team\u2019s effort of 288 total rushing yards, and it seemed the Tide could do whatever they wanted offensively. Tigers quarterback Jayden Daniels also showed off his dual-threat ability, rushing for 163 yards and one touchdown on 11 carries. He continued to impress through the air, throwing for 219 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. Daniels left the game early in the fourth after taking a brutal hit. He was later diagnosed with a concussion. Receiver Malik Nabers added to his impressive 2023 campaign with 10 receptions for 171 yards and a score. Alabama was able to hold off the Tigers in a classic rivalry game with almost 1000 total yards of offense and just three total punts It is impossible to predict how the game would have resulted had Daniels not been injured. Alabama (8-1) climbed one spot to No. 8 in the CFP rankings, with playoff hopes somewhat still intact. LSU (6-3) slides down 5 spots to No. 19., with Daniels\u2019 injury being the biggest what if of the week.\n\nArizona impresses at home vs UCLA, 27-10\nThe Wildcats have quickly become a team no one wants to see as they continue winning games they aren\u2019t supposed to. Quarterback Noah Fifita continued to impress, completing 25 of his 32 pass attempts for 300 yards, three touchdowns and an interception. Bruins quarterback Ethan Garbers resumed his inconsistent play, throwing for just 143 yards and one touchdown. UCLA struggled to find contributions from any of their skill position players, failing to net anyone over 50 total yards. Simply put, the Wildcats substantially outplayed the Bruins on both sides of the football. They punted twice, committed just three penalties and dominated time of possession 35:14-24:46. All of this against one of the best defenses in the country made for a very impressive win. Arizona (6-3) finally cracks the rankings at No. 21, a much-deserved spot for possibly the grittiest team in college football. UCLA (6-3) finds themselves unranked after a tough loss.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Universal)\n\nBy Alexandra Tan November 10, 2023 at 11:44 am PST\n\n\u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s,\u201d adapted from the games of the same name, written by Seth Cuddeback, game creator Scott Cawthon and director Emma Tammi, brings to life the franchise that has been beloved since its initial release in 2014. Following newly-hired security guard Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson), who grapples with his haunted past and custody battle of little sister Abby (Piper Rubio), the two work together with friendly yet suspicious cop Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) to uncover the story behind the decrepit pizzeria.\n\nThe film is a great watch for the spooky fall season, combining humor, jumpscares and gore\u2014as well as references to fan content to pay tribute to the games themselves. Not only that, but it rewards new and longtime enjoyers with a sense of nostalgia, inviting them to revisit childhood.\n\nHumor\n\nSurprisingly, the humor interjected into the film wasn\u2019t out of place, and it does its work of grounding the viewer into this world. There may be ghosts possessing run-down killer animatronics, but in the end, this is taking place in a family diner, amidst flashing mini-games, colored wallpaper and an oddly nostalgic atmosphere of the past. I found myself laughing quietly in the way the animatronics stared into the security cameras, eyelids lowered in a cartoonish, annoyed expression\u2014nearly \u201cThe Office\u201d reminiscent, a scary and silly moment all at once. While this tends to work, in some scenes it feels overdone, like in the controversial fort-building scene. Bonnie flashes a comical thumbs up when he falls over after stacking a table, and while it can be read as a tactical move to lull Abby into a false sense of security, some moments especially in this scene bordered too close to ridiculous.\n\nJump scares\n\nFNAF isn\u2019t FNAF without jump scares, and with the games being traditional click-and-point horror games that rely on shock factor to scare, the film surprisingly doesn\u2019t lean too heavily on this idea. Instead, a more ominous feeling of dread builds and ebbs through the scenes\u2013amplified by the eerie analog props; white noise, fuzzy VHS tapes and flickering security screens. A masterfully done scene playing on this notion occurs near the end of the film, when Foxy is chasing Abby. He is shown first in his human body\u2014stepping back behind the curtain and then coming into the light as Foxy, eye alight and hook ready. Terrifying, and perfect, even by long time fan\u2019s standards.\n\nGore\n\nA major concern was the level of gore that would be present in the film. With established events in the community like the  bite of \u201883 , which is actually a reference to when Max (Kat Conner Sterling) is cleaved in half by an animatronic, enthusiasts made it clear they want the gore to be brought on strong. Naturally, the discussion shifts to the highly anticipated \u201cspring-locked\u201d scene, where villain Willliam Afton (Matthew Lillard) meets his demise. The scene was done as gracefully as it could have been under the PG-13 rating, and while paying homage to a certain level of anticipated grisliness. While some desired more gore, I feel that Afton\u2019s sharp intakes of breath as the metal stabbed his body, the eerie glow of the spotlight transforming him into a spectacle and the famed line \u201cI always come back,\u201d strained from the puncturing of his lungs, made for a quietly horrifying wrap-up to the film.\n\nFandom Fun\n\nThe film also makes references in an effort to appeal to long-time fans with appearances and hints to late games, and maybe a  sequel . Most notably, theorizer  MatPat  appears as a cafe waiter and even spouts his trademark phrase, \u201cIt\u2019s just a theory.\u201d Fellow gamer Youtuber  CoryxKenshin  also plays a role as a cab driver, taking Freddy and Abby to the pizzeria, and even getting jumpscared in end credits by Balloon Boy\u2014a nod to the 2016 game \u201cSister Location.\u201d Even \u201cThe Living Tombstone,\u201d a band that has been dubbed by FNAF lovers as a staple of the fandom, also plays in the end credits, with the song \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s.\u201d\n\nNostalgia and Old Media\n\nRegardless of how mixed the reviews were on the movie, it undoubtedly has its own lovely reminiscent charm.  The first game was released in 2014, and many young adults consider it an integral part of their childhood.  While the nostalgic, Chuck-E-Cheese-related memorabilia and anthropomorphic animals that bring back memories of childhood birthday parties, the movie sends across an important message. In an environment that adapts so quickly to new media, new tech and new entertainment, bringing back the bittersweetness of growing up is always a worthwhile thing to celebrate.  This sentiment has taken the community by storm on social media, especially on TikTok. Using the slideshow features, the  trend  compares the poster\u2019s current appearance, with the caption \u201cwho\u2019s seeing the FNAF movie,\u201d and a second image of their childhood selves (usually decked out in FNAF merch), with the caption \u201cWho\u2019s really watching it.\u201d In that way, the film isn\u2019t just another video game adaptation, but a heartwarming way to reflect on the poignant sweetness of adolescence, yellow around the edges with age and tinged gold with happiness.\n\nOverall, the movie is a mixed bag. It\u2019s a good stand-alone film for a new viewer\u2014and still includes popular references for long-time fans. It\u2019s silly, and scary, and occasionally wholesome\u2014and whether you\u2019re an avid follower or completely new, there\u2019s an element of nostalgia that permeates the film. So, give it a shot!  Lose yourself in the light bouncing off the plastic ball pit, in the starchy smell of worn, well-used crayons and the laughter of childhood. The revamping of FNAF, or any media that is directly linked to so many people\u2019s bittersweet memories, leaves viewers with this message: no matter what age you are now, it\u2019s time to wake up your inner child and play.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/11/10/the-cookbook-recipes-to-nfl-week-10/", "response": "```\nThe life of being a Cowboys fan wasn\u2019t one that I chose but was assigned by birth-right. As a baby I didn\u2019t know what I was getting myself into, but how would I? I couldn\u2019t predict a botched snap from Tony Romo, the inevitable Aaron Rodgers game-winning drives, or more recently the continuous beat down from NFC rival the 49ers. The Cowboys sure know how to make every loss more miserable than the next. In an opportunity to win the game on the road in Philadelphia, and set up ourselves for a prime position in the division and conference. Dak Prescott takes a sack, and completely turns my newfound excitement in the last two minutes of the game into a spiral of more depression. Dak can\u2019t even be blamed for the loss, notching over 370 passing yards and three touchdowns. For a team loaded with talent, and one I believe is a contender in the NFC, losing in bad fashion to both the 49ers and Eagles makes me worried for my hair.\n\nWhile the Cowboys had their lows this week, others around the league showed out. This week\u2019s Michelin Star Player of the Week is C.J. Stroud. If you haven\u2019t been watching Texans football, now might be the time to start tuning in. Houston has found something in their rookie quarterback, and last Sunday versus the Buccaneers was another reason why. In the final 40 seconds of the game, Stroud orchestrated an impressive 75-yard game-winning drive to give the Texans a 39-37 win With only half a season under his belt, Shroud already has more passing touchdowns (14) than Kenny Pickett over his two-year professional career.\n\nThe waiter has arrived, what\u2019s first on the menu? First Course | Houston Texans (4-4) vs. Cincinnati Bengals (5-3), 10:00 a.m. PST, CBS This week will be the first meeting in the league between two former Ohio State quarterbacks, C.J. Stroud and Joe Burrow. Stroud is leading the Texans to their most exciting start in recent years, beginning the season 4-4 with a shot at a possible playoff berth for the first since 2019. Joe Burrow and the Bengals have bounced back big time, winning their last four games. Joe \u201cBrrrr\u201d is back in business.\n\nThe engine for the Texans new found success on offense this year has been the explosive plays C.J. Stroud has been able to make. I\u2019ve already discussed the player wide receiver Nico Collins is, but another name making waves in the Texans receiver room is rookie Tank Dell. Dell is impressive with his small frame but lighting quick speed that\u2019s led him to 454 yards through seven games. Even former Texan receiver Deandre Hopkins commented, tweeting \u201cYoung Bull going to be special.\u201d The Texans have an opportunity to win if they can get both Dell and Collins heavily involved.\n\nI love that Joe Burrow has his confidence back and is dishing out dots on a weekly basis. The last two weeks are what Bengals fans have been waiting to see from their golden boy this season. The Bengals can continue their success if playmakers like Chase and Higgins continue to show up. And for the sake of my fantasy team, a few more 100-yard games like Higgins had last week would be helpful.\n\nFries: D.J. Reader, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle \u2014 Defensive tackle is one of the more forgotten positions on the field because of the difficulty seeing their true impact compared to skill positions. Reader has been a premier defensive tackle since joining the Bengals four years ago. He is largely responsible for the recent success they had holding star running back Christian McCaffrey to 57 rush yards and the Bills to 78 total yards on the ground.\n\nDessert: WHOOO DEYYY. Both offenses have the ability to run up the scoreboard, with two of the best quarterbacks in the league right now. However, the Bengals have come back to form, and against a comparatively weaker Texans defense, I see a clear winner.\n\nSecond Course | San Francisco 49ers (5-3) vs. Jacksonville Jaguars (6-2), 10:00 a.m. PST, FOX The Jacksonville Jaguars are sneakily 6-2 and currently the third seed in the AFC. Most of the wins have come against teams just above .500. Trevor Lawrence has played well, yet what I thought was going to be a special year for receiver Calvin Ridley has been underwhelming. The Jaguars haven\u2019t shown much against the best teams, but the 49ers are a perfect chance to correct that.\n\nThings are looking a little better for the 49ers. Deebo Samuel is likely to return this week, and Trent Williams is slowly getting healthier. Their missing presence has been felt in all parts of the game. It\u2019s not just the players they both are, but the spark plug they can be. Everytime, it\u2019s the two of them leading out the team for warmups with their big blasting boombox. The 49ers are missing that swag the two of them bring to the squad. Getting Williams back for this game will be key, with protecting Purdy and allowing him to make plays.\n\nMac and cheese: Christian McCaffery, 49ers running back \u2014 It\u2019s now expected that Christain McCaffery will find his way into the endzone every game. The Stanford product has done nothing but dazzle since arriving in the bay last season.\n\nDessert \u2014 BANG BANG NINER GANG. The 49ers get back to their winning ways with a strong performance on the road. Purdy needs to utilize Ayuik and Kittle to exploit the weaker Jaguars passing defense.\n\nThird Course | Cleveland Browns (5-3) vs. Baltimore Ravens (7-2), 10:00 a.m. PST, FOX It should tell you something when all three games on the cookbook this week are on morning sides. But yet again for another week, we have the Browns in the recipe. The AFC North has come to play this season, with every team above .500 and the Ravens leading at 7-2. A win here for the Browns could mean a lot of potential for grabbing the division title in January.\n\nLast week\u2019s Michelin Star Player of the Week Lamar Jackson is continuing to show up and make his case for the best quarterback in the league. Another dominant performance from No. 8 has the Ravens flying high. What makes it more impressive is he does all this without an established number one receiver. The Browns defense poses problems for Jackson, making it vital he protects the ball versus a Browns team that is run through their defense creating turnovers.\n\nWhatever pregame meal Deshaun Watson and Amari Cooper had last week, should be on this week\u2019s menu as well. The duo showed out big time in a blowout win versus the lowly Arizona Cardinals. The defensive unit for the Browns has been elite all year, but eventually this offense will need to pull their own weight. Because the Ravens can score and at a high volume, developing the passing game for Watson is key to any sort of success on the road at Baltimore.\n\nGarlic bread: Amari Cooper, Browns wide receiver \u2014 It still pains me every time I walk in my closet and see my Cowboys Cooper jersey hanging there. Cooper\u2019s route running is one of the best in the league, almost looking like a basketball player with how easy he is able to cross over cornerbacks.\n\nDessert \u2014 BIG TRUZZ. Lamar Jackson is going to continue to show why he is one of the best at the position. The Browns inefficiency on the offensive side of the ball on a week to week basis, continues to have me staying away from picking them.\n\nLast week\u2019s record: 1-2 Overall record: 10-11\n\nRecipe of the week If you\u2019re into spice, this is right up your alley. For this week\u2019s game day recipe, I present Jalapeno Popper Dip.\n\nIngredients\nPrep - 15 mins\nBake - 20 mins\n2 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese, softened\n1 cup mayonnaise\n1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese\n1 can (4 ounces) chopped green chiles\n1 can (4 ounces) diced jalapeno peppers\n1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided\n1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs\n1 tablespoon olive oil\nSliced green onions, optional\nCorn chips, tortilla chips or assorted crackers\n\nDirections\nIn a large bowl, beat the cream cheese, mayonnaise, cheddar, chiles, peppers and 1/4 cup Parmesan until blended. Spoon into an ungreased 1-1/2-qt. baking dish.\nIn a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, oil and remaining Parmesan. Sprinkle over the cheese mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350\u00b0 for 20-25 min. or until golden brown. Sprinkle with green onions, if desired. Serve with chips or crackers.\n```"}

(Photo by Elijah Patterson)\n\nBy Will Camardella November 09, 2023 at 10:45 pm PST\n\nIn a star-studded evening at Galen Center, the No. 21 USC Trojans did not disappoint their home fans. Caleb Williams, Natalia Bryant and even Chris Rock watched on as USC took down CSU Bakersfield, 85-59, in its home opener. The game was a quintessential team effort by the Trojans, as five different players reached double figures.\n\nIn his second collegiate outing, freshman guard Isaiah Collier showed the Galen Center crowd his five-star talent. Collier scored a career-high 19 points on 6-of-11 shooting and was lethal throughout the night finishing at the rim. His prowess as a finisher was never more apparent than it was in the final two minutes of the first half. Collier switched hands to execute a reverse layup against double teams twice in three possessions to help USC end the first period on a 16-2 run.\n\n\u201cI learned a lot in the summer,\u201d Collier said. \u201cIt took me a while to learn Trojan basketball as far as defending at a high level. The offense came with it, but it took a while. It is hard-nosed basketball, and we compete every day.\u201d\n\nCollier\u2019s second-half highlights included a full-court sprint into the paint to score an and-one and an alley-oop feed to freshman forward Arrinten Page. The true freshman displayed his court vision throughout the night, leading the team with five assists. When he was playing his best basketball, the Trojan offense was just about unstoppable. When he struggled, the entire unit suffered as a result.\n\nThe only downside of Collier\u2019s performance was his team-leading four turnovers, three of which occurred early in the second half, contributing to a five-and-a-half-minute scoring drought for USC. The Trojans turned the ball over 12 times as a team, with seven during that stretch.\n\n\u201cWe give our guards a lot of freedom to play basketball, and they have to make decisions,\u201d head coach Andy Enfield said. \u201c[Collier] has to figure out what to do when he gets [where he wants to on the court]. The decision-making has to keep improving, to know when to stop, when to pass the ball and when to shoot it.\u201d\n\nThe scariest moment of the night came during that scoreless streak. As Collier attempted to drive to the basket, he collided knees with a defender and hit the Galen Center floor hard. He remained down, right in front of the USC bench, for a few moments and then slapped the hardwood in utter frustration. As an eerie silence came over the arena and Enfield made his way over to check on his player, Collier jumped right back up to inbound the ball. At no point afterward did he appear to be affected by the injury.\n\nDespite the momentary offensive struggles, Bakersfield could never chip into USC\u2019s lead. The Roadrunners were wildly inefficient from three, shooting 4-of-16. Until the last stretch of the second half, when the Trojans had the game well in hand, Bakersfield was shooting below 40% from the field. The Roadrunners\u2019 low-scoring total was also a result of USC\u2019s pesky defensive approach. The Trojans recorded 11 steals as a team, with seven coming from Collier and fifth-year guard Boogie Ellis. Junior guard Kobe Johnson, who led the team in steals last season, was out of the lineup due to an undisclosed injury he suffered on Monday.\n\nDespite his absence, the USC guards routinely deflected passes and turned steals into easy fast-break opportunities. The team outscored Bakersfield 21-9 off of turnovers.\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of deflections,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cI was disappointed in our field goal percentage defense in the second half. I thought our guys were lax a little bit, and there were some uncharacteristic errors by some of our veterans. ... It\u2019s part of our defensive philosophy to deflect the ball, whether we block shots or steal the ball, and tonight we did a good job.\u201d\n\nIn a game where Johnson was unavailable and Ellis shot 4-of-11 from the floor and 1-of-6 from three, the Trojans needed some surprise offensive performances. Those breakout games came from sophomore guard Oziyah Sellers and graduate forward DJ Rodman. Rodman made his mark on the game early, draining back-to-back 3-pointers midway through the first half, ballooning the USC lead to 16. He finished with 15 points on 4-of-6 shooting and was 3-of-4 from beyond the arc.\n\nSellers was the biggest surprise of the night, contributing 16 of the Trojans\u2019 23 points off the bench. He was also one of the team\u2019s most efficient scorers, shooting 6-of-9 from the floor and draining a pair of triples. He was also the recipient of perhaps the nicest-looking play of the night. With 7:30 remaining in the game, Collier lobbed a pass from his own 3-point arc to under the Roadrunner basket. Without hesitation, sophomore forward Kijani Wright then dished the ball out to Sellers in the corner. Sellers faked senior guard Kaleb Higgins out of his shoes, took one dribble upward and drained a perfect baseline jump shot.\n\n\u201cIt was nice to have D.J. and Oziyah Sellers step up and make shots because they are very good shooters and very capable,\u2019\u2019 Enfield said. \u201cThe reason Osiyah is playing more is because he\u2019s much better defensively. He\u2019s gained 15 pounds of muscle during the offseason and is a much better basketball player than he was last year. Tonight, he played very good defense and made some shots. We hope this gives him some confidence because we are very confident in him as a coaching staff.\u201d\n\nRedshirt senior forward Joshua Morgan was the fifth Trojan in double-figures, recording 12 points on 5-of-6 shooting. With Johnson out of the starting five, junior forward Harrison Hornery took his place and led the team with five rebounds.\n\nThe win improves USC to 2-0 on the season. The Trojans will continue their three-game homestand on Tuesday night when they host UC Irvine at 8 p.m.\n```"}

The root of these dramatic changes? The ongoing El Ni\u00f1o weather conditions. El Ni\u00f1o is the climate phenomenon along the Pacific that\u2019s characterized by its higher-than-normal sea levels and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. The last El Ni\u00f1o occurred during the winter five years ago. It was considered weak, without drastic temperature changes. This year\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o, however, is projected to be much different.\n\nA NASA analysis released earlier today found that the 2023-2024 El Ni\u00f1o winter season could cause five instances of 10-year flooding. That\u2019s a flooding event defined by its one-in-10 chance of happening in any given year. This winter, cities across the West coast are being urged to prepare for an increase in high-tide flooding that can swamp roads and spill into low-lying buildings.\n\nTodd Richards is a meteorology expert and former Editorial Director for The Weather Channel. Todd Richards: It\u2019s what happens as a result of El Nino and as a result of that warming water being in a different location that prompts changes in the jet stream and where storms storm tracks go and where the storms actually flow. So last year was not El Nino that was causing the crazy weather we had during the winter. But we\u2019ve already gotten a taste of what can happen when storms like that hitting here.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization reports that El Ni\u00f1o is likely to peak sometime between late this month and early next year and the weather conditions could last until at least April 2024. Todd Richards: We know in advance that we should expect this to happen. I mean, that\u2019s rare for us to be able to say in the world of forecasting the weather that we can look ahead and say, you know, three months out, six months out, that we anticipate an increased likelihood of these types of flooding events. You would hope that that would get people talking about it, get them to prepare individually, individuals that live near the coast. Think about what you would do if there were flooding events. At least prepare that way on the individual level. And then for municipalities, it\u2019s typically a longer term process. So it\u2019s not about sandbags for this weekend. It\u2019s more about, you know, walls and, you know, building codes and other restrictions as far as building on the coast for longer term planning. It probably is going to lead to a little bit longer than just the January, February, March timeframe, primarily because it takes a while for water to warm up. It takes a while for water to cool down.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s economy would be affected. Todd Richards: The construction industry in Southern California relies on the fact that the weather is good or great just about every day. So when it rains, it\u2019s such a rare event that, you know, it can be very costly to schedules and things like that. There\u2019s only so much that they can build in to their schedules to accommodate things like rain because they don\u2019t need to typically. Rain in Southern California... They say it never... no... we won\u2019t go there... This one is real... El Nino, could turn that song that was never true anyway.. on it\u2019s head.. Our new song could be.. Stormy Weather.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Solana Espino.\n```"}

In his first time donning Clippers whites, the Beard left a lot to be desired, and the team dropped a road game to the New York Knicks 111-97. Harden himself actually played somewhat well, but the Clippers will take time to figure out how their offense works with so many cooks in the kitchen. He shot six for nine from the field and two for four from deep, dishing out six assists on just two turnovers. If Harden was the Clippers\u2019 third-best performer at Madison Square Garden, his numbers would\u2019ve indicated a Clippers win. But no other Clipper took the reins in this game. Kawhi Leonard was the only player who exceeded Harden\u2019s 17 points, with a less efficient 18 of his own. Westbrook also scored 17 and Paul George contributed just 10 in over 34 minutes on the court, shooting 18.2 percent from the field.\n\nDespite the loss, Leonard found positives in Harden\u2019s performance. \u201c[Harden] did a good job his first game in a while,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cAnd it takes time to get his legs under him as far as conditioning, but he did a great job to me. Got everybody involved, running pick-and-roll very well.\u201d The former Raptor notably brought up Harden\u2019s conditioning, or lack thereof, in that comment. Harden participated irregularly in the Sixers\u2019 training camp before his trade to Los Angeles, so just playing a productive 30 minutes should encourage Clippers fans about his readiness to contribute.\n\nJust two days later, Harden returned to the Barclays Center and lost to the Nets 100-93. Beyond going on a discouraging three-game skid, the Clippers have struggled to score in these past couple of games, which you wouldn\u2019t expect for a team that just added Harden. Most glaringly, the Clippers seemed to lack a three-point shot, especially in contrast to the Nets\u2019 clutch shooting. Leonard and George launched a combined 16 threes against the Nets and made just three of them. Of course, we know that the two All-Stars are better shooters than we saw against Brooklyn, but a performance like that certainly doesn\u2019t help a team win games.\n\nBut the difference was glaring on Wednesday night. The Nets had three players shoot 40 percent or better from three on at least seven attempts, including some of the more important shots of the game. Despite being down by 10 late in the fourth quarter, the Clippers managed to cut the deficit to four thanks to some clutch shots from Westbrook and Leonard. Head coach Ty Lue and his crew had a glimpse of hope, only for Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie to hit an effectively game-ending three that put the Nets up seven with under 1:30 left in the game and forced the Clippers to take a time out. Royce O\u2019Neal sealed the deal with another triple a minute later.\n\nAgain, the Clippers will need time to discern a playmaking hierarchy between their stars. Harden didn\u2019t show his best playmaking self in Brooklyn, contributing five assists on five turnovers. Perhaps the ghosts of forgotten promises in the Barclays Center were messing with him.\n\nIn-season tournament update\n\nAnyone who follows the NBA will surely have an opinion on this year\u2019s introduction of an In-Season Tournament, the league\u2019s effort to spice up what can otherwise feel like an 82-game slog. For those unaware, the Tournament will have a six-group pool play stage and a single-elimination knockout round, with the six group winners and two best second-place teams advancing to the quarterfinals. Crucially, with the exception of the championship game, all tournament matches will count towards a team\u2019s regular season standings.\n\nAs a soccer fan used to non-league tournament play, I think the NBA has devised a great solution for making the regular season more intriguing. For one, the league refrained from adding more games to the players\u2019 schedules. Sure, for the two teams who make it to the championship game, they\u2019ll play an 83-game regular season instead of an 82-game one. Big deal. With designated Friday night \u201ccup\u201d matches and funky courts, the In-Season Tournament will at least break up the monotony. And who doesn\u2019t love a knockout tournament? Imagine a couple of stars, let\u2019s say LeBron James and Joel Embiid, going at it in a March Madness-style competition. If you\u2019re a real basketball fan, you\u2019re salivating at that thought.\n\nMost teams have yet to play their first group stage game, including the Clippers. But that\u2019ll change on Friday night, when the Clippers travel to Dallas to face off against the Mavericks. The Mavs are an impressive 6-2 so far this season, and have figured out how to play Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving together. Don\u010di\u0107 has scored 31.5 points per game and is a triple-double threat on any given night, while Irving has settled into a secondary role with just over 20 points per game, but an impressive 7.3 assists per outing. Not to mention Dereck Lively II, whose draft selection the Mavs appeared to have nailed so far as he plays like a solid, rim-running young center.\n\nThe Clippers have their work cut out for them as they try to win their first road game of the season. L.A. will tip off against Dallas at 5:30 p.m. PST Friday.\n```"}

Trojansforpalestine planned the walkout, promoting it on their social media platform and encouraging students, faculty workers, and staff to demand an end to the siege on Gaza. In conjunction with the walkout, an exhibit was held in front of Tommy Trojan honoring some of the lives lost in Gaza. A silent protest followed as students made their way across campus to Marshall.\n\nWe were able to talk with a student organizer about this event. She requested anonymity because she is fearful of retaliation.\n\nOrganizer: Today, we\u2019re very happy to be here because there is actually an exhibit that we\u2019re holding. This exhibit holds an incomplete list of all the names of people who have died so far that are known and registered in Palestine. At first, this list was made because the Western media did not believe the count of all the people that did die in the Gaza area. We spent hours and hours and hours working on these papers because they were a lot of work. However, we were only able to get 5,000 out of the 10,000 names and we can still barely fit them in this space.\n\nAn array of protests on both sides of the conflict have ensued throughout the last month on campus, and we asked her why it\u2019s important to keep raising awareness.\n\nOrganizer: It\u2019s so important to continue showing up because genocide is not something that should ever be taken lightly in any historical time. If you were wondering what you would have done when slavery was occurring, what you would have done when the Holocaust was occurring, what you would have done when any genocide on earth that occurred was occurring. You\u2019re doing it right now. It\u2019s not only Palestinian students coming together, but students from all different backgrounds.\n\nClara Carrasco, a senior at USC, explained why she as a Latina felt compelled to show solidarity.\n\nClara Carrasco: I\u2019m here to show support for my Palestinian brothers and sisters. I know that their population may be small here at USC, but that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s very important as a woman of color to show support. I\u2019m not Palestinian, but it doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t be here to support them.\n\nCarrasco: So Palestine is the most current version of settler colonialism. As a Latina, I understand that my ancestors were subjected to the same things that are presently happening to the Palestinian people.\n\nCarrasco: And that\u2019s why when we say in Spanish, \u201cDe Mexico a Chile, Palestina sera libre,\u201d it\u2019s saying that we are acknowledging our own roots, but also acknowledging the present that is occurring now.\n\nCarrasco also emphasized that supporting liberation should be for everyone and she will always stand up for those with the quietest voice in the room.\n\nCarrasco: At the end of the day, we\u2019re here to say we don\u2019t like settler colonialism, we don\u2019t like the oppression of people. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re favoring the oppression of others. In order for all of us to rise above, we have to support the people that are below. And that doesn\u2019t mean we tear down everyone else to do so.\n\nStudents attending the walkout were asked to bring signs, inform classmates and professors about the walkout, protect their identity from backlash with a mask or a keffiyeh, and to abstain from interacting with counter-protesters. Event organizers made clear that their efforts will not be stopping anytime soon.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Isa Johnson.\n```"}

The digital feminist outlet focused on stories that impact women around the world. Their parent company G/O Media cut ties because of financial reasons. This resulted in the lay off 23 staffers, including the entire Jezebel staff. Jezebel has lived on the internet for 16 years. Feminist writers freely expressed themselves as they covered topics ranging from politics to celebrity news. Although their last story focused on the SAG-AFTRA strike, there are over 90 comments of readers expressing their sadness about the end of Jezebel.\n\nSome USC community members were readers of Jezebel. Like Annenberg\u2019s Adjunct Social Media Coach, Shreen Khan, who shared her reaction to the shutdown. Shreen Khan: I first I was shocked to hear that Jezebel was shutting down, and I think it speaks to the broader complication in media that we don\u2019t have sustainable funding sources. So when reporting and newsrooms rely on ads entirely, then it makes it a really unstable ground.\n\nWith the loss of a feminist publication, journalists fear that this could be precedence for other feminist publications. Shreen Khan: I think in a post society it sucks because there\u2019s another place that we can\u2019t turn to for coverage, and I think we see a lot of women\u2019s content kind of. Pushed to these two like single narrative sources. And then when we lose it, it just feels like there is an even greater the space is shrinking, even greater.\n\nCurrent students, such as Grace Harrington are already feeling the impact of the publication shutdown. Grace Harrington: I know there have been a lot of cuts this year, and this is definitely a loss, especially for people who want to get into that specific section of journalism. This up and coming journalist reflects how this change may affect her career. Grace Harrington: It\u2019s not great. There are hopefully other women\u2019s publications that can kind of take take up that space.\n\nWith Jezebel\u2019s departure, student journalists have found the need to create their own space.

On the back of the shirts, their motto --- \u201cU-S-C works because we do.... \" They carried signs warning USC\u2019s administration -- \u201cLights out... last chance... out of the labs... into the streets... ready to strike.\u201d They\u2019re advocating for access to union representatives, protections against discrimination, and mostly a livable wage.\n\nLauren White: I have two kids and one on the way, Lauren White is a 30-year-old native Angelena. She\u2019s a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in English. White: It\u2019s just difficult to survive, especially as a mom with with kids. I can\u2019t even try to go out and get a second job to make ends meet because it\u2019s not allowed with my contract. White says she\u2019s also fighting to get more protections into the grad student\u2019s contracts. White: Usually in the state of California, your baby, your newborn babies is covered under the mom\u2019s insurance for the first 30 days. But USC has an exception to that. So when I had my son last year, he didn\u2019t end up having any insurance coverage for the first 30 days because I didn\u2019t know that that was like going to be an issue.\n\nOther issues upset White. She says she felt discriminated against for being a mother. White: I was told that I was the first person ever in my program to have a baby. And I had to give a reason for why I wanted to go on parental leave and the timing and stuff like that.\n\nAt the Exposition Metro stop today, 26-year-old computer science candidate Anand Balakrishnan picketed. He\u2019s in the last year of his Ph.D. program working as a teacher\u2019s assistant and a residential advisor. Anand Balakrishnan: I was getting paid like near poverty levels during the whole pandemic and there was hyperinflation happening. I had to move a couple of times because I couldn\u2019t make rent. You should be able to make a living wage, a living rent, pay rent, and also have good health care to be able to not worry about those things and just deal with research, which is a huge thing for us. See, we create so much intellectual property every single day for them.\n\nAndrew McConnell Stott is the Dean of the Graduate School. Andrew McConnell Stott: Our graduate students have received generous raises to a package that is already one of the most competitive in the country, and we\u2019ve been bargaining with them since they formed a union in February, and we\u2019ve been bargaining since April looking to reach agreement on a number of proposals that would enhance that competitive package even further.\n\n5th-year Cinema and Media Studies Ph.D. candidate Jackie Johnson says she and her peers are at the heart of USC\u2019s talent.

(Photo by Charlotte Calm\u00e8s)\n\nBy Jude Reynolds Oca\u00f1as, Katie Simons and Paulena Edelman\nNovember 09, 2023 at 6:13 pm PST\n\nUSC Graduate Student Workers held a \u201clast chance picket\u201d event Thursday in hopes of showing the university\u2019s administration that they\u2019re willing to go on strike if their demands are not met.\n\n\u201cI think people think it\u2019s because we kind of hate USC or we hate our jobs, but we really care about our jobs,\u201d said Jackie Johnson, a fifth year PhD candidate in cinema and media studies. \u201cPeople work tirelessly hours and hours and hours every day in labs on this campus doing really, really critical research that\u2019s at the cutting edge.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who is a member of the union\u2019s bargaining team, said they were on the picket line because their working conditions directly impact \u201cthe very learning conditions of the undergraduate student population, and we are trying to make the university better.\u201d\n\nLast February, USC\u2019s graduate student workers voted overwhelmingly to form a union with United Auto Workers. However, the newly formed union, GSWOC-UAW, and the university have been bargaining since April but have yet to come to an agreement.\n\nMost recently, the university rejected GSWOC-UAW\u2019s request for an immediate pay increase and a minimum stipend increase from $35,700 to $43,000. Andrew Stott, dean of the Graduate School and Vice Provost for Academic Programs, said the university has already offered \u201cgenerous raises to a package that is already one of the most competitive in the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to the MIT living wage calculator, the living wage in Los Angeles County for a person with no dependents is $44,142. A survey done by GSWOC-UAW found that 88% of USC graduate student workers were rent burdened, meaning more than one-third of their income is spent on rent.\n\n\u201cI personally know a lot of friends, peers in my program, who are having to scrounge together whatever source of income they can,\u201d said Rose Nguyen, a second year PhD student in creative writing and literature. \u201cAnd then on top of that \u2014 that insult to injury \u2014 our contract stipulates that we can\u2019t even work full time during the [academic] year, which further exacerbates the unaffordability.\u201d\n\nIn Johnson\u2019s experience, the lack of discretionary money can make it challenging for graduate students to afford out-of-pocket, extra expenses. \u201cI\u2019m always kind of at the edge, and the smallest emergency can really kind of push people over into debt,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cSo, most recently, I had to pay for neuropsychological testing and I can\u2019t really have enough savings based on what the university pays me to pay for kind of extra expenses like that.\u201d\n\nAccording to the union, USC pays graduate student workers less than Stanford, Columbia, Princeton, MIT and UCLA, whose graduate students participated in the UC graduate student strike last fall. According to the union, a PhD candidate in the USC physics department would make nearly $10,000 less than their UCLA counterpart for the 2024-2025 academic year.\n\n\u201cI think what [the USC administration] are going to have to realize is that they, like these other institutions, will have to actually improve the working conditions for the graduates,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cAnd then it has to be comparable to these institutions.\u201d\n\nBut Stott said the comparison of wages did not take into account that USC\u2019s graduate student workers are under contract for 20 hours per week for nine months out of the year, while UCLA\u2019s graduate student workers are contracted for 12 months, which he said accounts for the 25% increase. Stott also said graduate workers receive health, vision and dental insurance. He said they additionally receive free tuition for up to 36 units, a value of roughly $67,000.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a generous package,\u201d Stott said.\n\nMany union members have compared USC graduate student wages to UCLA\u2019s higher graduate student wages. (Photo by Charlotte Calm\u00e8s)\n\nIn addition to wage increases, the graduate students are also seeking the creation of an independent arbitration system for harassment and discrimination. The university has pushed for all student complaints to go through its Title IX office.\n\n\u201cUSC administration also is not meeting us for our demand on actually having enforceable protections against harassment and bullying and discrimination,\u201d said Nguyen. \u201cThey want to route everything through their Title IX office, which is where we know cases go to die.\u201d\n\nStott said that the university has spent a lot of time building out its discrimination and harassment policy procedures in a way that was \u201cvery deliberate and intentional and invokes best-in-class best practices,\u201d and that the union\u2019s proposal could lead to \u201call kinds of potential issues,\u201d by creating a separate process meant just for graduate students in the union.\n\n\u201cThe university believes that we need one process for everybody and that the process we have in place is best in class,\u201d said Stott.\n\nIn a video posted to the graduate student workers of USC Instagram page, Kayla Love, a fourth-year PhD candidate in the chemistry department, said she felt \u201cbullied\u201d by the department. When she was six months pregnant and needing to go on parental leave, she said the department told her that if she went on leave, \u201c[she] wouldn\u2019t have enough research to continue into the program.\u201d Love couldn\u2019t afford the consequences of leaving, which meant losing her student housing, so she continued to work.\n\nUltimately, the students hope that the picket event shows USC administration that they are ready and willing to go on strike if their demands are not met.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to fight for all the things that we care about,\u201d said Anand Balakrishnan, a sixth year PhD candidate in the computer science program. \u201cIf USC does not respond to this, then it shows that they\u2019re not necessarily negotiating in good faith.\u201d\n\nHowever, Stott said that the university feels a strike would be \u201cunnecessary\u201d because of the progress the two parties have made at the bargaining table.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had 18 bargaining sessions, we\u2019re meeting weekly for the foreseeable future,\u201d Stott said. \u201cWe want to continue to make progress at the bargaining table because the discussions are producing results, and we believe we\u2019ll get there that way.\u201d\n\nAt this point in the semester, a strike would be disruptive, but the university said it was preparing for this scenario and held a meeting with faculty this afternoon to discuss preparations.

The National Hot Rod Association is hosting their final competition of the season, where champions will be crowned and cars will be hitting speeds above 330 mph. Racers are anticipating a great weekend ahead, with the competition kicking off on Thursday and concluding on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Annenberg Media had the opportunity to get onto the track in Pomona and have some pre-race fun. Of course, the media day at the In-N-Out Pomona Dragstrip was catered by the iconic California-based burger chain. Like the media, fans will have the opportunity to speak with drivers one-on-one if they visit the track this weekend. But the best part of the trip out? Getting behind the wheel.\n\nAfter a couple of rides darting down the 1000ft track with the professionals behind the wheel, reporters took control and felt what it\u2019s like to be at the starting line. With three time champion Robert Hight at the wheel, we were able to clock a 9.1 down the track in a Chevrolet Camaro. With Annenberg Media behind the wheel (and Austin Prock co-piloting and translating the Christmas tree), our best time was 9.4. Not too bad for a rookie, if you ask us.\n\nDrag racing has a seasoned history in California, with the state being credited as the motorsports birthplace. Back in the 1930s, car enthusiasts began racing in the California desert with speeds topping out around 100 mph. As cars became more advanced, racing developed as well and the NHRA was founded in 1951. The organization held its first official race in the spring of 1953 at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds in Pomona. The track, which was renamed the In-N-Out Pomona Dragstrip, hosts the season opener in February and finale in November.\n\nAnnenberg Media visited the track and met with some of drag racing\u2019s top competitors. John Force has been racing for over 50 years, has collected 16 Funny Car Championships and is still racing today. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of stress. It\u2019s a lot of anxiety. It\u2019s a lot of \u2018I got to win,\u2019\u201d Force said. \u201cThe fear, that\u2019s what makes you get up and go after it.\u201d\n\nThe fastest speed Force has clocked is 337.3 mph, and his fastest time zooming down the track equivalent to three football fields is 3.823 seconds. With top end speeds exceeding 300 mph, Force says there is a lot to keep in mind as drivers are competing to win: \u201cYou got to react to that Christmas tree, number one, then you got to hit that gas.\u201d Force described more critical details of the race: \u201cYou got to stay off the wall, you can\u2019t cross center lines, can\u2019t hit walls, you lose points.\u201d And as the season is coming to an end, he emphasized the importance of these details, saying, \u201cevery point matters, especially at the end of the year.\u201d\n\nThrough his success in the sport, Force has created a dynasty and cemented himself in the history books. He also created John Force Racing, the first multi-car team in the sport. Hight serves as President of John Force Racing and is currently one of Force\u2019s fiercest competitors, holding three Funny Car Championships. Hight originally joined Force\u2019s team as a crew member. After years of working on the cars, Force presented Hight with the opportunity to become a team driver in 2005. \u201cYou know, I always wanted to drive,\u201d Hight said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like wanting to be a baseball player, you know? The chances of that happening weren\u2019t very good, but John Force gave me the opportunity.\u201d\n\nForce doesn\u2019t regret giving Hight a chance behind the wheel as he is in the running to win his fourth championship this weekend. \u201cRobert\u2019s got a shot at [winning the championship] right now,\u201d Force said about his teammate heading into the weekend. Hight emphasized the strength of the team at John Force Racing: \u201cYou can\u2019t win without good people, and we\u2019ve been very fortunate at John Force Racing to have a lot of good people.\u201d\n\nHight\u2019s team is headed by Jimmy Prock, whose sons are also involved with John Force Racing: Sam Fabiano, who manages Force American Made in Indianapolis, Ind., Thomas Prock, who is also on Hight\u2019s crew, and Austin Prock, who is a driver for John Force Racing. Similarly to Hight, Austin Prock got his start with John Force Racing working on cars. Prock is a fourth generation racer, with his great grandfather having competed in the Indianapolis 500. \u201cI\u2019ve been born and raised around motorsports,\u201d Prock said. \u201cIt\u2019s a family affair out here and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d\n\nThis weekend, Prock, Hight, and Force will be racing, along with Force\u2019s daughter Brittany who is a two-time Top Fuel Champion. You can catch the races, interact with drivers, and feast on the iconic In-N-Out all weekend at the track.\n```"}

My list of replacements for the disgraced Alex Grinch.\n\nDefensive coordinator Alex Grinch coaches the defense during USC football practice on March 8. (Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Terence Holton November 09, 2023 at 4:58 pm PST\n\nIt took a while, but the root of USC\u2019s defensive issues has been dug up. Defensive coordinator Alex Grinch has been fired. Lincoln Riley must have finally read my article from last year, calling for Grinch\u2019s dismissal after the collapse against Tulane. However, with the firing of Grinch, it leaves a massive hole in the Trojans\u2019 coaching staff. It has already been announced that defensive line coach Shaun Nua and linebackers coach Brian Odom will be interim co-defensive coordinators for the remainder of the year. Yet, I am more curious to see who will be named defensive coordinator starting next season.\n\nHere are some names I hope are swirling around head coach Lincoln Riley\u2019s and athletic director Jennifer Cohen\u2019s heads.\n\nMy top choice: Jim Leonhard\n\nLeonhard, in my opinion, should be the clear-cut No. 1 choice for defensive coordinator. Leonhard was the defensive coordinator at Wisconsin for six seasons before electing to not join new head coach Luke Fickell\u2019s staff and instead taking a job as a senior analyst at Illinois. In 2022, Leonhard\u2019s Badgers ranked 11th in the country in total defense, ninth in rush defense and 21st in scoring defense, allowing only 20.2 points per game. In 2021, Wisconsin\u2019s defensive stats were even more impressive, as his team ranked first in total defense, fourth in points per game allowed and second in allowed yards per play, allowing a measly 4.1 yards per play to opposing offenses. For comparison to this year\u2019s USC defense, the Trojans rank 120th in total defense.\n\nLeonhard has an impressive defensive resume, and I think he\u2019d fit right in alongside Lincoln Riley. My concern would be that he would be playing alongside a different type of offense. Wisconsin ran a very run-heavy offense while he was there, while USC runs an air raid offense, which means a whole lot of passing. They are very different to plan for as a defensive coordinator, so playing alongside a completely different offense may take some adjusting. Nevertheless, I think Leonhard would be a phenomenal hire, and his resume speaks for itself.\n\nFrom Athens to Troy: Will Muschamp\n\nMuschamp is currently the co-defensive coordinator for the Georgia Bulldogs. Muschamp has taken over for current Oregon head coach Dan Lanning. Georgia had arguably the best defensive unit in college football over the last three seasons, and this year is no different. Muschamp\u2019s squad ranks ninth in total defense and seventh in scoring defense. The Bulldogs beat down a pretty great offense in TCU last season during the 2023 national championship game, allowing the Horned Frogs to score only once the entire game.\n\nSeeing as Muschamp is still not even the full defensive coordinator, I bet he\u2019s looking for a higher-paying and more exclusive job. While Muschamp\u2019s defensive mind is impressive, one of the main reasons I\u2019m drawn to him as defensive coordinator for the Trojans is his recruiting. The Georgia Bulldogs have ranked in the top five in recruiting classes each of the last five years, and a whole bunch of those five-star recruits they bring in are defensive players. USC is phenomenal at recruiting skill position players, but what the Trojans need is some guys doing the dirty work in the trenches. Muschamp can clearly recruit well and is a great coach; it seems like a win-win to me.\n\nIt would be hard to sway Muschamp away from his comfortable, national championship contending Bulldogs, but I believe with a salary boost and the label as \u201cdefensive coordinator\u201d over co-defensive coordinator, he could be brought over to the West Coast.\n\nCross-town robbery: D\u2019Anton Lynn\n\nOne guy I\u2019ve had my eye on for a while now is none other than USC\u2019s rival defensive coordinator: D\u2019Anton Lynn. Lynn\u2019s defense is incredibly impressive for the talent he is given at UCLA. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the Bruins have some stars, but what he\u2019s doing is remarkable with a group that on paper is much worse than the Trojans. UCLA ranks 13th in the country in total defense as well as second in rush defense. The Bruins are also tied for the 13th best scoring defense, allowing just over 16 points per game. What I would do for the second-best rush defense, alas.\n\nWhat Lynn has done in only his first season with the Bruins is incredibly impressive. Just imagine what he could do with Lincoln Riley\u2019s portal recruiting, especially with players like sophomore defensive tackle Bear Alexander. He would become a monster.\n\nI think Lynn is a sleeper for this job, and it would also be hilarious if the Trojans take UCLA\u2019s defensive coordinator after only one season of him being with the Bruins.\n\nWhile there has to be a lot more improvements in the defense rather than just a change at coaching, I believe firing Alex Grinch was the first step to something great.\n```"}

Organized by USC\u2019s Student Business Association, the all-day event will feature panels and discussions with sports industry leaders like Under Armour founder Kevin Plank and Seattle Seahawks president Chuck Arnold.\n\nMaximo Speiser, a senior majoring in business and head of operations for the summit, said tapping into the Trojan network was instrumental in bringing the event back after the pandemic. \u201cThe networking connections you get from USC are pretty incredible,\u201d Speiser said. \u201cWhen we were brainstorming who we wanted initially, we had no idea how to contact them but as we spoke to alumni and expressed our vision for the summit, they allowed us to have a vast outreach process.\u201d\n\nPanels at the event will range from women in sports to finance and tech start-ups. Students can stay for the full day or drop in to hear from specific speakers. \u201cThe guest speakers are so anxious and excited to speak in front of a group of kids and explain to them their story, their mishaps, and how they recovered from that,\u201d Speiser said. \u201cThis gives students such an incredible opportunity to gain insight into a specific industry and see what resonate[s] for them.\u201d\n\nSports journalism professor and SBA faculty advisor Jeff Fellenzer said students should come to the event with an open mind to find their niche in the industry. \u201cStudents need to be informed on key issues and develop their own perspectives and opinions,\u201d Fellenzer said. \u201cWhat professionals look for is not for students to already be an expert in the field, but [to] find a student who has a feel for the industry and who brings forward good ideas about how to make improvements.\u201d\n\nAccording to Forbes, anywhere from 50% to 80% of all jobs are filled through networking, even if the position is posted publicly. Additionally, Fellenzer said that going to professional development events can make an impact on how recruiters view applicants. \u201cIt\u2019s really competitive to get internships, but if you come in and say \u2018I recently learned about the metaverse at the Sports Business Summit,\u2019 the recruiter on the other end will see your dedication to the industry,\u201d Fellenzer said. \u201cStudents are busy and pulled in so many directions and you made it a priority to be there and attend a panel.\u201d\n\nFellenzer, who teaches the Sports, Business and Media in Today\u2019s Society course at Annenberg, hopes to provide students with similar opportunities. \u201cOne of my biggest goals every semester is to open the eyes of students to what the future could look like for them in the sports business or sports media,\u201d Fellenzer said. \u201cBecause the landscape is so vast, it\u2019s changed so much. The phrase, \u2018see the possibilities,\u2019 is a big one for me.\u201d\n\nThe Sports Business Summit will be held Thursday from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Grand Ballroom.

(AP Photo/Mohammed Zaatari)\n\nBy Selina Kausar November 09, 2023 at 4:22 pm PST\n\nMahmoud Chour\u2019s dream was to build a family home in his village in South Lebanon. A dream that, after almost a decade of sacrifice, he had finally achieved. \u201cHe was looking forward to living peacefully with his nice family after the pain of being far away from them for a long time,\u201d Mohamad Abouzaid, a friend and former co-worker of Chour, said in an interview. \u201cBut Israel had another plan.\u201d On Sunday evening, Chour\u2019s daughters, aged just 10, 12 and 14 years old, were killed by an Israeli airstrike in Ainata, South Lebanon, alongside their grandmother. Their mother, his wife, is still in critical condition. Chour was in the Ivory Coast for work when he heard the news. Abouzaid said his friend\u2019s goal was to \u201csecure a prosperous future for his family\u201d \u2013 a family that will now never be the same after losing their three daughters. \u201cWords can\u2019t express his feelings but unfortunately the world we live in right now lacks ethics, mercy, and justice,\u201d said Abouzaid, who is a business development manager originally from Marj, a city in the Western Beqaa district of Lebanon, and now living in Saudi Arabia.\n\nDaniel Hagari, an Israeli army spokesperson, told both Al Jazeera and the Associated Press that Israel, \u201cexamines every event that occurs in Lebanon to know the details.\u201d They did not issue an apology for the attack on the family, according to the news reports.\n\nNestled beside Israel and the Palestinian territories, the Lebanese people have been inextricably pulled into the ongoing conflict. Their lives have been disrupted by the war; their peace shattered. A Contentious History Home to over 210,000 Palestinian refugees and now with a civilian death toll that stands at 14, no other Arab country has been more affected by the events in Israel and Gaza than Lebanon.\n\nIsrael and Lebanon have an extensive history, according to Asher Kaufman, professor of history and peace studies at Notre Dame University and a regional expert on the Middle East. He explained Lebanon\u2019s history through \u201cvery violent years\u201d and described the creation of Hezbollah as a response to the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon. Kaufman said the unrelenting situation is taking its toll on Lebanese civilians.\n\n\u201cMy mother was crying [after hearing the news of Chour\u2019s family on Sunday evening],\u201d said Shireen Nakhle, a member of the Lebanese diaspora living in Canada. \u201cShe made me cry on the phone when she was talking about them and telling me that maybe if tomorrow I call and she doesn\u2019t answer, it\u2019s probably her turn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThings are not looking good, and it seems like they\u2019re escalating,\u201d said Alaa Yammine, a 29-year-old Lebanese citizen who currently lives in Beirut. \u201cWe\u2019re unsure what the upcoming weeks will hold, and we\u2019re stuck in Lebanon with no plan B, so things are worrying.\u201d\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nNajib Mikati, Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, has condemned the drone attack, calling it a \u201cheinous crime.\u201d Lebanon will file a complaint to the U.N. Security Council, but Kaufman said he doesn\u2019t believe this will have significant political repercussions. Mikati has cautioned against a war with Israel, and it\u2019s a matter that\u2019s already dividing the Lebanese people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s causing inside tension,\u201d Yammine said. \u201cThere\u2019s a side that wants to fight Israel (the resistance side) and another side who doesn\u2019t want to be involved in a war that could further destroy the country. I guess the third side is just stuck in the middle, where they want to support Palestinians but are afraid of a full-scale war.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost Lebanese people don\u2019t want war; war is never a walk in the park.\u201d Nakhle said. This matter, however, is out of Mikati\u2019s hands. The decision of war rests with Hezbollah, which has military hegemony in Lebanon.\n\nWith further escalation still a distinct possibility, that leaves the Lebanese people living through a period of great uncertainty and unrest. \u201cSo far, Hezbollah has stayed under the threshold of a full-scale war against Israel,\u201d Kaufman said, adding that in his view, Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary-general of Hezbollah, \u201ckeeps all the doors open.\u201d\n\nShortly after the attack on Chour\u2019s family, Hezbollah fired retaliatory rockets into the northern Israel town of Kiryat Shmona. The Israeli military said one civilian died, but the AP reported that it wasn\u2019t clear whether this was because of Hezbollah\u2019s attack or an earlier one.\n\n\u201cProtecting civilians is a main pillar of the rules of engagement with the enemy,\u201d Hezbollah legislator Ali Fayad said during the funeral of Chour\u2019s family, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nA regional war may be on the cards Nasrallah has stated that the group\u2019s principal aim is to defend Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. Kaufman said Lebanon \u201cwould be devastated as a country\u201d if it joined the war. \u201cLebanon has been in a state of economic freefall for over four years now. A war with Israel would only add to an already agonizing economic situation in Lebanon,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cInfrastructure would inevitably be damaged. Recovering from such a war would be difficult. Who is going to pay to rebuild Lebanon?\u201d\n\nKaufman said he also fears Lebanon could be the first to fall in a line of Levantine dominoes. He speculated that Israel could target other regions as well. According to Kaufman, the volatility and intensity of a possible wider war is what makes this resurgence different to prior clashes. A regional war could involve additional Middle Eastern players, as well as the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe risk of the U.S. joining this war is not small,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cThey have a significant military presence in the Mediterranean, and this may be why we\u2019re seeing more caution from Hezbollah and other Middle Eastern leaders this time.\u201d\n\nKaufman thinks one of the most unique facets of the current resurgence is that it blurs traditionally sectarian lines in Lebanon. The Sunni group Hamas are on the same page politically as the Shia Hezbollah and Iran. \u201cA case of my enemy\u2019s enemy is my friend,\u201d Kaufman said.\n\nDespite the complex political landscape, Lebanese civilians remain apprehensive of which direction their country will take next. \u201cInnocent people are dying, and nobody cares,\u201d said Abouzaid, still mourning his friend\u2019s family.\n```"}

Of course, the media day at the In-N-Out Pomona Dragstrip was catered by the iconic California-based burger chain. Like the media, fans will have the opportunity to speak with drivers one-on-one if they visit the track this weekend. But the best part of the trip out? Getting behind the wheel.\n\nAfter a couple of rides darting down the 1000ft track with the professionals behind the wheel, reporters took control and felt what it\u2019s like to be at the starting line. With three time champion Robert Hight at the wheel, we were able to clock a 9.1 down the track in a Chevrolet Camaro. With Annenberg Media behind the wheel (and Austin Prock co-piloting and translating the Christmas tree), our best time was 9.4. Not too bad for a rookie, if you ask us.\n\nDrag racing has a seasoned history in California, with the state being credited as the motorsports birthplace. Back in the 1930s, car enthusiasts began racing in the California desert with speeds topping out around 100 mph. As cars became more advanced, racing developed as well and the NHRA was founded in 1951. The organization held its first official race in the spring of 1953 at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds in Pomona.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore)\n\nBy Kyle Frankel\nNovember 09, 2023 at 1:18 pm PST\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d is a column by Kyle Frankel about fantasy football. This week had it all. There were statement victories like the Ravens 37-3 trouncing of the Seahawks and barnburners such as the Texans dramatic 39-37 win over the Buccaneers. We even got treated to another primetime snoozefest, as the Jets essentially beat themselves in their 27-6 home defeat at the hands of the Chargers on Monday Night Football.\n\nAbove all else, we witnessed one of the most impressive feats I\u2019ve ever seen on a football field. Quarterback Josh Dobbs was traded from the Cardinals to the Vikings last Tuesday, giving him virtually no time to learn the playbook, get integrated with the team or even practice with the offense. By gametime on Sunday he hadn\u2019t even taken a snap during practices in Minnesota yet. Dobbs hadn\u2019t thrown one pass to his receivers or taken a single snap with his center.\n\nThis meant that when Dobbs replaced an injured Jaren Hall with the Vikings trailing 3-0 in the first quarter, the prospects of a Minnesota victory seemed grim. They got even more grim after Dobbs proceeded to take a safety and lose a fumble on his first two offensive series. Then, he completed 20 of 30 pass attempts for 158-yards and two touchdowns. He also was the Vikings top rusher, going for 66-yards and another score.\n\nDobbs literally had to go over the cadences with his linemen for the FIRST time ever on the sideline right before taking the field. He asked his receivers in the huddle what routes they were running because he didn\u2019t know the playbook. All of this and the part-time NASA astronaut found a way to lead his new team to a 31-28 win.\n\nThe Josh Dobbs magic is still permeating throughout the Twin Cities, but let\u2019s try to make some magic happen on the waiver wire this week.\n\nTexans Stock is Booming\n\nYou can say it\u2019s too early, but I\u2019ve seen all I need. C.J. Stroud is a franchise quarterback. He is elite. Not only does the eye test prove this theory, but numbers don\u2019t lie and Stroud\u2019s are stellar. He currently ranks seventh among all quarterbacks in 2270 passing yards and sports an immaculate touchdown to interception ratio of 14 to one. In fact, he\u2019s tossed the least INTs among all full-time starters.\n\nJust to tack on some more, he broke the rookie single game passing record in Sunday\u2019s win over the Buccaneers with 470-yards through the air. Now if you\u2019re somehow able to pick Stroud up off the waiver wire, do it immediately. Odds are you can\u2019t though, given that he\u2019s rostered in 77% of ESPN leagues and that number should only rise once waiver claims for the week process.\n\nHowever, you can snag the playmakers he\u2019s throwing the ball to, and their value has only increased now that Robert Woods is down with an injury. There are two names I\u2019ll mention and the one you have probably heard of is rookie wide receiver Tank Dell. I actually gave him a shoutout in this column prior to Week Four, but his performance this past week offers further recognition.\n\nDell was a focal point of the Texans offense on Sunday and it paid dividends. He saw 11 targets, catching six of them for 114-yards and a pair of touchdowns. One of these scores was a clutch reception in the end zone to take the lead in the final moments of play. Not only did this 29.6 PPR outing (the highest of his career) show his explosive ability, but it also displayed the immense trust his signal caller has in him.\n\nIn the three games this season where he\u2019s received at least seven targets, he\u2019s produced 20-plus point PPR performances. He appears to firmly be at least Houston\u2019s No. 2 wideout, if not their No. 1, and should continue to see the ball come his way. He won\u2019t be easy to add, as he\u2019s rostered in 55.8% of ESPN leagues at the time of writing, but if he\u2019s still out there on your waivers you have to find a way to fit him on your team.\n\nNow this next name you probably didn\u2019t know before this week, but you should remember it going forward: Noah Brown. Brown had a monster day, catching all six of his targets for 153 yards and a touchdown, summing up to 27.3 PPR points. Hold your horses. Let\u2019s be careful not to overreact. Brown is definitely not going to do this every week. He\u2019s only appeared in four games this year and his six targets were his highest single game total this season.\n\nHowever, he did showcase how dangerous he is both downfield and with the ball in his hands. He\u2019s probably the No. 4 pass-catcher on the Texans, but with Robert Woods out for Week 10 he\u2019s worth streaming this week in deeper leagues. Plus, he\u2019s only on a roster in 1.0% of ESPN leagues.\n\nKeep Feeding Keaton\n\nThis is someone you\u2019re going to hear a lot of chatter about during the week and for good reason \u2013 Keaton Mitchell. On the same day the rookie running back received his first carry in the NFL, he also torched the Seahawks defense. The halfback saw a moderate nine carries, but he definitely made the most of them, rushing for 138 yards and a touchdown.\n\nHe adds some blazing speed to this already incredible offense and should continue to be involved. Even though Justice Hill out-touched him and Gus Edwards will probably continue to steal goal line carriers, Baltimore head coach John Harbaugh emphasized that Mitchell will remain in the rotation.\n\nHe\u2019s definitely not a sure thing, but similar to Devon Achane, he offers incredible upside if the Ravens already explosive offense continues using him more. He\u2019s only rostered in a mere 1.1% of ESPN leagues prior to waivers processing, a figure that will surely rise.\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

While the Canucks haven\u2019t seen the postseason since 2020, they look like a serious Stanley Cup contender through 12 games, with a 9-2-1 record. Center Elias Pettersson leads the team and is second in the NHL in points with 21, and has been a great fit with right wing Andrei Kuzmenko on the second line. Pettersson is coming off a spectacular 102-point season in 2022-23, with career highs in both goals and assists. The 24-year old is clicking with the rest of the roster and I wouldn\u2019t count him out as a Hart Trophy contender, despite it being this early in the season.\n\nRight wing Brock Boeser has 10 goals and is on pace to have the best season of his career. Boeser is coming off a solid 55-point campaign, when he stayed healthy throughout most of the season, something he hasn\u2019t always been able to do. Despite trade talks last season, the right wing is surging and finding his place in the Canucks\u2019 system as a catalyst in their early success.\n\nDefenseman Quinn Hughes has the third most points in the NHL and has been a force for Vancouver. In the Canucks\u2019 recent win over the Edmonton Oilers, he recorded a goal and three assists, and was dangerous on the power play unit. Hughes was the NHL\u2019s first star of the week and is making a legitimate case for the Norris Trophy. His league-leading plus-minus of 16 shows his consistency and ability to connect with his teammates.\n\nThatcher Demko is an elite goaltender and is showing his talent on a nightly basis. Demko\u2019s .948 save percentage has helped him achieve seven wins for Vancouver thus far, with two of them being shutouts. The Canucks haven\u2019t just been winning games; they\u2019ve been victorious in dominant fashion. Vancouver leads the NHL in goal differential at +30.\n\nThe Canucks have a solid roster all-around and have been blessed with a weak Pacific Division to play in. I\u2019d expect the Canucks to make a deep playoff run if they can stay healthy. They have the combination of talent and experience and are a force to be reckoned with. The Canucks have lost all three of their Stanley Cup Final appearances (1982, 1994, 2011) and are determined to end the 50+ year drought this season.\n\nConnor Bedard, one month in\n\nNo. 1 pick Connor Bedard has already lived up to expectations a month through the season. At just 18 years old, the rookie center leads Chicago in points, goals and shots. Despite being at the bottom of the Central Division, the Blackhawks already look better than their dismal performance last season. Although it\u2019s early, Bedard has been consistent for a Chicago team that\u2019s shifting toward a new identity on the ice.\n\nNow for my observations on Bedard. The centerman\u2019s productivity on offense is immense. In addition to his rookie-leading stats, Bedard looks comfortable at the NHL level and has been stable despite his inexperience. His wrist shot has been his main strength and he\u2019s also shared the puck well. He\u2019s been able to evade defenders nicely thanks to his shiftiness. The Blackhawks have utilized him a lot more than I would\u2019ve expected for such a young player, as he\u2019s averaging almost a full period of ice time per game. But, Bedard is embracing his role on a rebuilding team.\n\nEven though much has gone well for him, Bedard still has room to improve. His main concern has been his inability to win faceoffs. He\u2019s only won 39.7% of them, but this is not an uncommon struggle for young players. Aside from that, however, Bedard looks like the real deal. He appears to be adapting to the pro level with ease despite being so young.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to make any long-term predictions for Bedard since it\u2019s only been one month, but if the rookie can keep up this level of play, we should anticipate the Blackhawks\u2019 rebuild to attract high-level players wanting to play with him, as well as a culture shift in the city of Chicago. The city hasn\u2019t seen the thrills of Stanley Cup-caliber hockey since the Blackhawks last won it back in 2015, but with a generational player like Bedard, another banner could be in the rafters within the next few years.\n\nWith immense amounts of pressure on the young player, the main test for him will be playing a full season of elite hockey while also staying healthy. I\u2019ll be curious to see if his minutes become more limited over the course of the season so that he can be developed further. Bedard is ineligible to play in the AHL until he\u2019s 20 years old because of an obscure rule, so he\u2019ll be hanging at the main stage for at least until then.\n\n20 goals, two games: a Sharks story\n\nI already talked about how miserable the Sharks were last week, but their two-game stretch against the Canucks and Penguins must be talked about. San Jose managed to allow 10 goals in not one, but two consecutive games, becoming just the fourth NHL team to ever reach this low. Vancouver was the first team to put up double-digits on the Sharks. San Jose fell victim to a lethal Canucks team whose power play unit scored four times on five attempts. Vancouver\u2019s 10 goals in the game matched the Sharks\u2019 total amount on the season at the time.\n\nEight different Canucks scored and 13 recorded points. This game was a total rout. Kaapo K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen had an abysmal time between the pipes, allowing six goals on just 19 shots. He was later avenged by Mackenzie Blackwood who allowed the Canucks\u2019 next four goals on 14 shots. This loss was the biggest home defeat in franchise history for the Sharks, who are by far the worst team in every single aspect imaginable.\n\nAgainst Pittsburgh the Sharks faced a familiar friend, Erik Karlsson, for the first time since trading the Norris Trophy winner this past offseason. San Jose received a very similar beatdown to that of the game before, with a 10-2 final score. The Sharks\u2019 11th straight loss to start the season tied the NHL record. The Penguins were struggling coming into this game with five losses in their last six games, but definitely got an ego boost after manhandling the lifeless Sharks.\n\nSeven Penguins recorded goals, including former Shark, left winger Matt Nieto. Karlsson was one of 13 Penguins that had at least one point, with two assists against his old team, whose not-so-happy crowd let him know how they felt about his expensive, lengthy contract that really wasn\u2019t worth it.\n\nThe goaltending duo of Magnus Chrona and Blackwood couldn\u2019t handle Pittsburgh\u2019s offense, and wasn\u2019t supported by the Sharks defense at all. In a sport that relies heavily on defense, the Sharks have let theirs wither away. San Jose leads the NHL in goals allowed with 56, and their -42 goal differential makes Edmonton\u2019s -18 look decent. The NHL\u2019s goal leader is Auston Matthews with 13 thus far, while the entire Sharks team barely edges him with 14 collectively.\n\nThe tank is real; the only win that really matters for San Jose is the draft lottery. The Sharks got their first victory against the Flyers and will take on the struggling Oilers (2-8-1) next.\n\n\u201cThe Silver Shield\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

Victorville has undergone significant demographic changes regarding ethnicity with a major population of Latine, but aren't represented in local government. Photo by Adrian Mendoza\n\nBy Adrian Mendoza November 09, 2023 at 12:42 pm PST\n\nSince 2018, the median cost of housing in Los Angeles County has increased from under $600k to nearly $800k. It began a trend of a shrinking population in the county with many flocking to other cities like San Diego and Las Vegas as well as rural communities in inland California like the High Desert. This migration of LA residents to these small rural towns has led to major population growth in the High Desert. As the town goes through its growing pains, it adjusts to a shifting political climate and an even more rapid ethnic shift in its population.\n\nElaine Gonzales, a community leader and former board member of the Adelanto School District, was one of many who moved from LA to the High Desert 28 years ago. At the time she moved, she and her husband were a young couple and new parents to four young girls. They had rented an apartment for 11 years in LA and sought to buy a house to fit their large family. \u201cWe had been told by an uncle who had moved to the High Desert that we could find what we were looking for here,\u201d Gonzales said.\n\nNearly 28 years later, Elaine and her family still reside in Victorville. Victorville has undergone significant demographic changes regarding ethnicity. In 2000, 33.5 percent of the town\u2019s population was Hispanic or Latino, now that figure is 55.3 percent. Despite this clear majority in the region, Latinos in the High Desert are not adequately represented in local government. This is largely because the area receives many immigrants from Mexico. Therefore, many who are not US citizens become residents of the High Desert, but are unable to vote, creating what Victorville City Council Member Blanca Gomez believes to be a more stagnant political climate than the demographic change would suggest.\n\n\u201cWe are a majority,\u201d Gomez said regarding the Hispanic and Latino population, \u201cbut the majority is not being seen as the majority because immigrants are not literally counted.\u201d Some of this demographic change can be attributed to people moving from places like LA where the population is now 48.4% Hispanic or Latino. Many who have fled Los Angeles have found opportunity in the once-small town of Victorville, CA and the surrounding rural High Desert community. Now, Victorville\u2019s population has nearly doubled in the past two decades.\n\nOne reason for this population growth, according to Gomez, is that people are coming from \u201cdown the hill,\u201d a term used in the Inland Empire to refer to areas west of the Cajon Pass, to the High Desert for affordability. Gomez explained that because the housing market in areas like LA values houses higher, people will sell their homes, and then go where the housing market is more affordable. People can then buy larger houses for cheaper with the money they receive from selling their homes in LA. Opposed to LA County\u2019s $800k median housing cost, San Bernardino County\u2019s median price is under $500k. There also remains much unowned, and undeveloped land for businesses to move into.\n\nAs the town grows, however, so do the costs of living begin to increase there too. \u201cOn Highway 395...I could go about ten miles without seeing a home, any establishments, or even any stop lights,\u201d Gomez said, \u201cNow, commerce is king.\u201d Gomez explained that in addition to people moving from areas like LA, population growth is also fueled by factors such as the movement of unhoused people in surrounding areas to Victorville, where more shelters are available, and people being brought to be tried in Victorville\u2019s criminal courts and imprisoned in the area.\n\n\u201cHaving the court here being all criminal,\u201d Gomez said, \u201cit brings a lot of people from outside this area.\u201d After serving their sentences formerly incarcerated people are then let go on Seventh Street in Victorville, according to Gomez. \u201cThey\u2019ll end up in Victorville and they end up staying here because they\u2019re stranded. They don\u2019t have money to move,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nThe story of the High Desert is consequentially intricately connected to that of Los Angeles and the whole of Southern California. It houses large numbers of underrepresented groups and continues to grow as more people seek the opportunities offered in a rural community or otherwise find themselves residing in the High Desert.\n```"}

(AP/Erik Verduzco)\n\nBy Channin Zhao\nNovember 08, 2023 at 10:16 pm PST\n\nOn Oct. 5, Lionel Messi was nominated for the Landon Donovan Most-Valuable-Player (MVP) award, along with Newcomer of the Year, in the 2023 MLS Year-End Awards, despite only having one goal and two assists in a mere four appearances and 273 minutes in the MLS league regular season. Although he wasn\u2019t on the list of finalists released by the MLS on Oct. 26, considering the impact Messi has had on Inter Miami, and on the entire MLS league, he fully deserved the recognition of the nomination.\n\nLionel Messi is undoubtedly one of the GOAT soccer players. The Argentine has scored 819 goals for club and country, with his 672 goals for Barcelona being the most for a single club. Messi has won the Ballon D\u2019or, the highest award a footballer can earn, eight times, the most out of any player in history. His influence on the world is phenomenal, with Messi fans present everywhere around the globe, as demonstrated by his 489 Million Instagram followers.\n\nOn July 15, 2023, Inter Miami FC confirmed the free signing of Lionel Messi from Paris Saint\u2013Germain (PSG), causing a complete shock in the soccer world, as well as a complete transformation on the MLS league. The first 24 hours of Messi jersey sales, confirmed by Fanatics, were the best for any player across all sports, beating Cristiano Ronaldo joining Manchester United in 2021, Tom Brady joining the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020 and LeBron James joining the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018. Ticket prices skyrocketed due to the \u201cMessi Effect,\u201d too. Prior, the overall average MLS ticket price was up to $98, while the average ticket price for the Leagues Cup overall was $152. For games that Messi has played in, the average ticket price is more than double that at $329, according to StubHub. One estimate showed higher ticket prices and sold-out stadiums he\u2019s inspiring could generate up to $265 million in revenue for Inter Miami, with ticket prices as much as 1,700 percent higher in some cases. Inter Miami could see its value increase by as much as 30 percent.\n\nHow does Messi affect the league, then? The 34 regular-season MLS matchups aired in 2022 on ABC and ESPN\u2019s networks averaged 343,000 viewers. However, just after the confirmation of Messi\u2019s signing, the Sports Business Journal reported this week that Apple TV boasted roughly 700,000 MLS Season Pass subscribers in early June, which rose to nearly a million by Messi\u2019s debut vs. Cruz Azul. That\u2019s nearly four times the original amount just before his debut, and the numbers are still rising. Messi\u2019s appearance in away games at other clubs saw price raises wherever he went. For example, when Messi visited our very own LAFC, tickets started at $550, with celebrities such as Selena Gomez, Leonardo DiCaprio and Prince Harry in attendance. Mind you, average LAFC ticket prices starts around $80 for the regular season!\n\nMessi\u2019s impact on the league could definitely be a lasting one. With the increase in viewership and popularity of the MLS due to the Messi signing, the league could heavily increase its stature amongst all U.S. sports.

City Council moves to require hotel developers replace lost housing\n\nLos Angeles City Council members wait to start a Los Angeles City Council meeting on Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2022. (AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu)\n\nBy Veronica Towers and Melissa Grimaldo\nNovember 08, 2023 at 6:23 pm PST\n\nAn initiative that will require hotel developers to replace any permanent housing lost due to hotel construction was advanced by a 14-0 vote of the Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday. While the vote for what was titled Item 35 did not solidify the ordinance, it does allow the council to submit a draft ordinance to the city attorney, who will report back to the council with an official ordinance for voting.\n\nAccording to the L.A. Times, the move comes after City Council President Paul Krekorian came to an agreement with the hotel workers\u2019 union, Unite Here Local 11, to replace a ballot initiative that would have required hotels to provide vacant rooms to unhoused individuals. The new ordinance will not require hotels to provide housing or disclose room vacancy to the city, but rather require hotel developers and city officials to consider how these developments are impacting the livelihood of the greater Los Angeles community.\n\n\u201cThis ordinance would move us significantly forward in requiring developers to replace housing lost to hotel construction,\u201d Krekorian said during Tuesday\u2019s city council meeting. The ordinance also contains verbiage that will require home renters and Airbnb owners to obtain a permit from the Los Angeles Police Department, in efforts to better monitor public safety in rented spaces. These permits would \u201cstrengthen public oversight over short term rentals, hotels and other properties that create public nuisances,\u201d Krekorian said.\n\nNot all at the meeting shared his positive sentiment towards the ordinance. While voting yes on the item, First District Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez expressed her distaste for how the added labor will impact the police department. \u201cI just think it\u2019s an additional load that seems unnecessary to add already to all the work that [the LAPD carries],\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel feasible, considering how hard it\u2019s been to recruit.\u201d\n\nAccording to Krekorian, additional studies and discussions on permit fees and labor distribution will continue to take place.\n```"}

Our star-studded No. 1 recruits, Juju Watkins and Isaiah Collier showed their skills in the wins. Watkins shot for 32 points, 5 assists and 6 rebounds while Collier scored 18 points and 6 assists.\n\nQuestions as to whether Bronny James will play for the Men of Troy are contingent on whether or not the freshman passes a medical examination later this month, said father and Lakers star Lebron James in a press conference. Lebron James: \u201cHe\u2019s doing rehab every week. He gets to do more and more and more and more. We have a big moment at the end of this month to see how\u2013if we can continue to go forward, if he\u2019s cleared then we\u2019ll be not too long away from him being back on the floor and back with his teammates and practicing with the notion of being back on the floor and playing the game situation.\u201d\n\nUSC students are stoked for basketball after an underwhelming football season, including Viterbi student Victoria Pinkett. Victoria Pinkett: \u201cI\u2019m excited for both, especially since we have like the number one recruits for both men\u2019s and women\u2019s. I think it\u2019ll be an exciting season.\u201d\n\nBusiness analytics major Muchiri Macharin is looking forward to women\u2019s basketball, more specifically our top female recruit. Muchiri Macharin: \u201cJuju is nice as hell. She had 32, five and six. But she\u2019s probably gonna average something like that honestly, I don\u2019t see anyone stopping her.\u201d\n\nSophomore Ryann Smith wants to see more this season. Ryann Smith: \u201cI just want to see the fight. I mean I saw it last year, but even more, I mean they bring it every year. I would love to see, you know, my Cardinal Divas out there, maybe a one, two, three time. It would be so nice to see them out there with, you know, Trojan Dance Force and the Song Girls and everybody else.\u201d\n\nCome out this season to support your fellow Trojans!

While details around the specifics of the agreement have not yet been released, the negotiating team representing SAG-AFTRA unanimously voted to accept the most recent deal proposed by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which includes Netflix, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, and NBCUniversal.\n\nThe announcement came just minutes before the 5 p.m. deadline set by the AMPTP. The strike began on July 14 when the previous agreement expired, and negotiations since then have been long and contentious, with negotiations breaking down on multiple occasions. Issues surrounding the use of AI to copy and supplement actors\u2019 appearances without compensation and residuals for actors in the ever-growing streaming model have been at the forefront of the discussion for both those union members negotiating the deal and manning the picket lines.\n\nSAG released a statement Monday saying that they had responded to the AMPTP\u2019s \u201clast, best and final offer,\u201d but that there was still disagreement over \u201cseveral essential items,\u201d including the issue of AI. On Tuesday, the union reported that they had spent 10 hours continuing negotiations.\n\nThe tentative agreement means that the strike will end, though further negotiations are still possible. The deal needs to be reviewed by the union\u2019s national board, and if not approved, would mean both sides would return to the table for further bargaining. As no official report has been provided about the provisions in the agreement, the entertainment industry may need to hold its breath a bit longer.\n```"}

Memorial Coliseum celebrates its centennial in 2023 as it also prepares to host a third Summer Olympics in 2028.(Photo courtesy of Marina Fote)\n\nBy Dylan Brashier November 08, 2023 at 6:11 pm PST\n\nAfter a century of hosting big time events, the Coliseum is known for many things. The first Super Bowl. A place where JFK and Dr. Martin Luther King spoke. The Olympics. And sideways rain? As USC and the Coliseum celebrate the 100th anniversary of \u201cThe Greatest Stadium in the World,\u201d Annenberg Media talked to former Trojan football players \u2013 linebacker Michael Hutchings, running back Aca\u2019Cedric Ware, and wide receiver De\u2019Quan Hampton \u2013 about their best memories from \u201cthe Coli.\u201d\n\nAlthough the three players started at USC in different years, they all played for the historic 2016 USC football team. The team that started the season with a record of 1-3, but rallied to a nine game win streak and brought USC its 25th Rose Bowl win.\n\nHutchings and Hampton said their favorite memory was the 2016 home game against rivalry Notre Dame. It was a day the Trojans encountered some very un-SoCal weather.\n\n\u201cIt was a very live atmosphere,\u201d former wide receiver De\u2019Quan Hampton said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s the rivalry for the [Jeweled] Shillelagh. So we\u2019re playing the game and ... it started raining sideways.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was a game where Adoree Jackson went crazy. He had a reception that he took to the crib. He had a punt return to the crib and then that was the same game where he had a kick return to the crib and he hurdled their kicker! The Coli was rocking.\u201d\n\nSome may have been worried about the fans leaving due to the intense rain, but not Hampton.\n\n\u201cThey stayed and watched and it was very thrilling to see the whole sideline rocking, jumping up and down, rooting for the defense, and it was definitely one to remember for the books,\u201d Hampton said.\n\nHutchings added, \u201cwe had been on a winning streak and it was the perfect ending to the last home game of the season.\u201d\n\nAca\u2019Cedric Ware recalled another memory as his favorite: \u201cwhen I scored my first touchdown ever as a USC Trojan my freshman year. It was like I was a kid again starting over doing what I loved.\u201d\n\nAll the players agreed that one of the most unique things about the Coliseum is its lively environment with a rowdy student section that will make itself heard if it is unsatisfied with the performance.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere in the Coliseum was like no other, walking down the tunnel getting ready to step on the field and seeing all the raving fans going crazy. It gave me chills every time,\u201d said Ware.\n\n\u201cThe Coli is one of the most electric and historic stadiums I\u2019ve got the chance to shine in,\u201d he added.\n\nWare said the fans gave him the energy he needed to perform, \u201cespecially the student section \u2013 there was nothing like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve experienced different versions of the Coli based on the years we were having as a team,\u201d Hutchings said. \u201cDuring the 2016 season you experienced a truly electric coliseum weekly, because we were winning.\u201d\n\nHutchings praised the USC fanbase for its truthfulness, saying \u201cyou will know how the team is playing based on the crowd\u2019s energy, and I think it\u2019s completely fair. The standard is the standard at USC.\u201d\n\nHampton felt the same way, saying \u201cthe fanbase in the Coliseum was very picky \u2013 AKA bougie \u2013 with high expectations, they are not settling for nothing else. \u201cBut let me tell you, when USC is performing how USC is supposed to perform, the Coli is rocking. That joint is jumping, and fans are going bananas.\u201d\n\nWhen comparing the Coliseum to other stadiums the trio have played in, the history, especially in star-studded the tunnel, is what sets it apart from other powerhouses.\n\n\u201cThe coliseum is by far one of my favorite stadiums, and that\u2019s saying a lot because I\u2019ve played in some big time stadiums,\u201d Ware said.\n\nHe explained that he\u2019s played in NFL stadiums \u2013 many Pac-12 stadiums with crazy fan bases \u2013 but nothing compared to the feeling he got walking through that tunnel in the Coliseum.\n\n\u201cKnowing the history of how many great backs came before me, walking that same path and knowing it was my home stadium. It was a different type of love,\u201d Ware said.\n\n\u201cThe Coliseum differs from other stadiums because of the history; other stadiums and teams have loud stadiums and great fanfare, but its the history of the coliseum,\u201d Hutchings said.\n\n\u201cGrowing up and watching historic performances, national title teams take the field. That\u2019s what you are playing for at the Coli.\u201d he added.\n\nSimilar to Ware, Hampton feels a connection to the tunnel, saying \u201cby the time I get out the tunnel, it\u2019s go time. ...all the family problems, all the whatever, are gone. Because when I step on this field it\u2019s time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are about to meet at a godly center destination by the time we get out the end of this tunnel man,\u201d Hampton said.\n\n\u201cYou see the lights on, you can see through the curtains, but they can\u2019t see you. They open the curtains and the crowd goes wild, the Coli is rocking and it\u2019s welcoming. The Trojans are here, and it\u2019s popping.\u201d\n```"}

Piper Vaughn has the story.\n\nFirefighters fought to put out a fire that erupted at the historic former Marine Corps Air Station throughout early Tuesday morning at the north hangar in Tustin, just over 37 miles from Los Angeles.\n\nThe flames started inside one out of the two wooden hangers that used to house blimps used in World War II. The blimps were used to patrol U.S. coastlines and to watch for enemy combat submarines. The Tustin base was built in 1942 and the hangar... was massive. The building stood at 17 stories high, over one thousand feet long, and three hundred feet wide. Making the Tustin hangers among the largest wooden hangars ever built according to the website, Tustin Hangars. The hangars can be seen from miles away from any nearby elevation and from as far away that visibility will allow. According to the Tustin History website, the base employed almost five-thousand military personnel. It also housed about 4,500 residents who lived on the base. The iconic hangers have since been locations for numerous air shows and community charity events. The hangars have also been featured in famous television shows and films including: \u201cStar Trek,\u201d \u201cAustin Powers,\u201d \u201cPearl Harbor,\u201d \u201cJAG,\u201d and \u201cThe X Files.\u201d\n\nSeveral people gathered around the burning hangar, as the building, glowing in flames, collapsed. As of today, there is still an ongoing investigation as to how the fire started. But, because of the continued small spark ups in the debris, arson investigators have not been allowed inside the building. In a brief phone call with a spokesperson from the Orange County Fire Department, the information officer said that it is too early to tell if any artifacts or items can be recovered, and if they are, they will be apart of the investigation that\u2019s going to take quite some time to uncover. The Spokesperson also told Annenberg Media that they are closely monitoring the debris.. and if any spots flare up throughout the day... they are continuing efforts in putting out the flames and also cleaning up debris at the site.\n\nFor Annenberg Radio News, I\u2019m Piper Vaughn.\n```"}

Now, for anyone not familiar with the terminology, a censure is essentially a form of public reprimand. The Speaker of the house reads out a resolution rebuking a member for a specified misconduct. That member usually stands in the well of the House and listens to it, but the Representative did not have to.\n\nThe three-term congresswoman has long been criticized for her stance on the conflict in the Middle East and her support for Palestine.

We are human beings just like anyone else.\u201d\n\nThe Anti-Jewish Defamation league viewed the post as an antisemitic call for the destruction of Israel, a standpoint shared by other Representatives like Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Marjorie Taylor Greene: \u201cThe form of the resolution is as follows. A resolution censuring Representative Rashida Tlaib for antisemitic activity, sympathizing with terrorist organizations, and leading an insurrection at the United States Capitol complex.\u201d\n\nTlaib defended herself on X and said the post represented \u201can aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction or hate.\u201d Rashida Tlaib: \u201cI\u2019m the only Palestinian American serving in Congress, Mr. Chair, and my perspective is needed here now more than ever. The idea that criticizing the government of Israel is antisemitic sets a very dangerous precedent and it\u2019s being used to silence diverse voices speaking up for human rights across our nation.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released the day before, Tlaib said quote \u201cI have repeatedly denounced the horrific targeting and killing of civilians by Hamas and the Israeli government and have mourned the Israeli and Palestinian lives lost.\u201d\n\nTlaib is the 26th person to ever face a censure by the Chamber, after California Representative Adam Schiff who was sanctioned in June 2023.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Thomas Legrand.\n```"}

At noon, the university\u2019s branch of the Students for Justice in Palestine led a march of protesters across the campus, calling for a ceasefire in the Middle East and remembering the lives of killed Palestinians.

As she approached, an officer told her to \u201cback up.\u201d Moments later, she was thrown to the ground.\n\nHuang could be heard screaming in pain, shouting for help and calling out \u201cI\u2019m a reporter\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m with KPCC\u201d multiple times as she was handcuffed and put into a sheriff\u2019s vehicle. The incident left her with scrapes and bruises to her knees, ankle and face.\n\nThe day after the arrest, Huang said in a social media post that the experience was \u201clike being tossed around in the ocean and then slammed into rock.\u201d Freelance reporters also captured video of Huang\u2019s arrest. She can be seen struggling on the ground and screaming while several deputies gathered around and handcuffed her.\n\nThe settlement explains that the LASD deputies detained her \u201cwithout legal justification and using unjustified force\u201d while she was reporting news in a public place. As part of the settlement, informational briefs will also be issued to sheriff\u2019s department personnel. The documents explain that the public \u2014 and members of the press \u2014 have a right to record video and audio in any public place. It also describes that it is unlawful to arrest someone because they are recording.\n\nThe briefs also explain that officers aren\u2019t allowed to search or seize video and audio recordings without consent or a court order. Sheriff\u2019s department personnel must go through required training on the information in the briefs before they head out on patrol services \u2014 at places like protests \u2014 where they will likely come in contact with members of the press.\n\nThe trainings also include information on Senate Bill 98 \u2014 which California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a year after Huang\u2019s arrest. The bill protects reporters when covering protests and demonstrations and creates exemptions for journalists from being cited for failure to disperse.\n\nHuang was represented by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a D.C.-based organization that provides pro bono legal representation and other legal resources to protect journalists\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cThis settlement sends a strong message and, importantly, holds officials accountable for what happened to our client,\u201d Katie Townsend, deputy executive director and legal director for the organization, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to have reached a resolution with LA County that will not only provide our client redress, but also will help prevent future unlawful arrests of journalists.\u201d\n\nHuang was originally accused of resisting arrest and interrupting the arrest of a protestor. But a separate court filing called for Huang to be found \u201cfactually innocent\u201d \u2014 which would mean she did not commit any crime she was accused of. A judge found Huang factually innocent earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThanks to my lawyers who worked years to arrive at this settlement,\u201d Huang wrote in a social media post Wednesday. \u201cI hope it helps deter future assaults on journalists and can be used as a benchmark in other 1A cases. You\u2019re free to film law enforcement without fear of injury or your device getting broken. It is our right.\u201d\n\nJulie Patel Liss, president of the L.A. chapter of the Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA), said it\u2019s positive to finally see some form of accountability for how Huang was treated.\n\n\u201cWhen AAJA L.A. saw the video of Josie being swung around and pushed to the ground on that night of Sept. 12, 2020, we recognized that as something that affects our whole profession and her as a member,\u201d she said. \u201cThe settlement sends a message that if you\u2019re doing something that is harming the public then there are going to be consequences.\u201d\n\nBut she was also surprised to see the sheriff\u2019s department didn\u2019t offer any admission of guilt or wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cIt would have been very powerful for the current leaders at LASD and law enforcement to make a statement that we all make mistakes and we all do things we regret,\u201d Patel Liss said.\n\nThis settlement is just one in a string of media rights debates nationwide. Journalists across the country are also reaching settlements after wrongful arrests during protests from several years ago, particularly in 2020 when millions took to the streets to protest the killing of George Floyd.\n\nLast year, a federal judge approved a $825,000 settlement prohibiting Minnesota authorities from arresting or using force against journalists after a freelance video journalist was struck and pepper sprayed while covering protests following the killing of George Floyd.\n\nIn March, the city of Atlanta agreed to pay $105,000 in a settlement after a photojournalist was arrested while covering a protest in 2020.\n\nIn April, officials in Washington, D.C. agreed to pay $175,000 to settle a lawsuit from two journalists who said they were unlawfully detained while covering protests during former President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017.\n\nAnd in August, St. Louis officials reached a $180,000 settlement with a reporter who was covering a protest in 2017. He was caught in a mass arrest of over 80 people, who also received approximately $58,000 per person in settlements. The city paid nearly $5 million in total after arresting protesters, videographers and bystanders in a technique known as \u201ckettling\u201d \u2014 where police close in on a large crowd from multiple sides, not allowing them to leave.\n\nHuang encouraged reporters to keep recording when they find themselves in a protest situation in order to create evidence.\n\n\u201cIf others and I hadn\u2019t documented my arrest, it\u2019d be my word against the highest-ranking law enforcement official in L.A. County,\u201d Huang wrote in a social media post Wednesday. \u201cSo many others have been in a similar situation but didn\u2019t have the evidence. Without it, I\u2019d be in a very different place right now.\u201d\n```"}

Figueroa was supposed to be complete in August, but residents still have yet to move in. (Photo by Robert Westermann)\n\nBy Alea Motwane November 08, 2023 at 4:41 pm PST\n\nHub L.A. Figueroa, an apartment complex for USC students located near Fraternity Row, was supposed to be ready for move-in on Aug. 14. However, it has yet again postponed its move-in date. At the beginning of August, Hub sent out an email letting future tenants know that the apartment complex would not be ready for another three to four weeks. Since then, the Hub has postponed the move-in date three more times, while giving their tenants stipends of either $100 a day with alternative housing, $200 a day with tenants finding their own alternative housing or the option of not paying rent till move-in day. Hub also allowed students to break their lease within a limited timeframe.\n\n\u201cAt first, I really trusted them. I wholeheartedly believed it would only be a delay of one-to-six weeks,\u201d Sophia Manley, a sophomore studying communications, said. \u201cBut now, my views on the Hub have definitely changed. But at first, I was so trusting. And I was kind of optimistic that in one-to-six weeks I would have a home.\u201d\n\nAfter placing the future tenants in alternative housing at the J.W. Marriott and the Moxy, Hub gave students a three-day notice to move into The Lorenzo, another student apartment complex \u2013 as they said that the hotels could not accommodate the students anymore. Hub then updated future tenants that the apartment complex would be ready for move in Nov. 4. But they then sent out an email that a contractor died in a \u201ctragic accident\u201d at Hub, pushing back the move-in date for a third time to Nov. 11.\n\nOn Nov. 6, Hub sent out another email. \u201cEverything in our control is on track to move in this weekend,\u201d the email said. \u201cHowever, if the city does not prepare paperwork in time, there is a potential that we will not be able to make the November 11th move-in date. In which case, we will shift move-in to next Thursday, November 16.\u201d In the email, Hub also wrote that progress continues to be made, and they expect to receive approvals by Nov. 8. Hub then advised future tenants to postpone the travel of friends or family who are helping students with their move to Nov. 16, promising reimbursement of any non-refundable travel expenses.\n\nSophia Joseph, a sophomore studying Psychology, said she \u201cpredicted\u201d that the Hub would not be ready on time. \u201cI tried getting out of the lease around March, April, but at the time, it was just impossible to get off the lease. And then they sent so many emails promising it would be ready that I sort of just like, I don\u2019t know, felt trapped,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cI know of some other complexes that haven\u2019t been built, and the students can\u2019t even get like half of that compensation. So for that, I was really grateful to be given alternative housing with the hotel and $100 with it.\u201d\n\nJoseph said she had to share the hotel room with her roommate. \u201cI love my roommate, but we were sharing a tiny space where I didn\u2019t even have a closet,\u201d she said. \u201cI was living out of a suitcase.\u201d Joseph also touched on the fact that she felt \u201csuper uncomfortable\u201d at times at the hotel. \u201cIt was a nice hotel, but I was also really anxious about the other people living in the hotel. There would be times where I\u2019d be alone in an elevator with like seven grown men.\u201d\n\nArya Hanumara, a sophomore studying acting and public relations, took a different approach when it came to housing. Hanumara and his friends pooled the $200 a day that they received from Hub to split an Airbnb. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually pretty great because [the Airbnb] is a home,\u201d he said. \u201cWhenever I call the Hub, I always try to have an open mind and be as kind as possible, because it really isn\u2019t all their fault,\u201d said Hanumara. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s come to the point where it\u2019s just about the city and permits because [the work] is pretty much done.\u201d\n\nManley also chose the option to receive $200 a day to find her own alternative housing, and purchased a stay at the USC hotel. When asked how she felt about Hub postponing the date for the fourth time, Manley said, \u201cI\u2019m in disbelief, but at the same time, we have heard so many dates that I\u2019m not surprised at all.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think back \u2013 it was supposed to be built back in June. And now here we are nearing Thanksgiving break. So I would not be surprised if we still don\u2019t have a home by the beginning of [next] year,\u201d she added.\n```"}

The directive seeks to help contractors build more affordable housing in L.A. (Photo by Cam Kauffman)\n\nBy Cam Kauffman November 08, 2023 at  4:29 pm PST\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass signed an executive directive Wednesday in an attempt to make housing construction more affordable and streamline permit approval processes throughout Los Angeles. The directive seeks to address barriers to homeownership, help convert existing buildings into housing and incentivize new projects to be built faster for people of all income levels, emphasizing affordable housing for mixed-income families.\n\n\u201cWe have to look for ways to prevent people from falling into homelessness,\u201d Bass said, \u201cbut we also have to make sure that our city is open and available to everyone to be able to purchase a home.\u201d\n\nThe directive comes in part as a response to the 2013-21 Regional Housing Needs Assessment, which showed that L.A. reached only 10 percent of its target for moderate income housing units, and less than half of its goal for low and very low income units. As of November 2023, the city is on track to meet only 40 percent of the assessment\u2019s targets under the current 2021-2029 RHNA plan for all income levels.\n\nDue to this discrepancy, Bass said it is crucial to make housing more affordable for contractors to build by speeding up the permitting process. Currently, the permit approval process takes one and a half years for multi-family developments, according to the L.A. Business Council\u2019s May 2023 report. The study also found that projects take almost four years on average to be permitted and eventually built.\n\nBass\u2019 directive sets forth procedures to reduce processing timelines for permit and clearance-related services by 25-30% for \u201chousing development projects of five or more units that contain at least 20% lower income restricted affordable housing units.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have just heard from developers all over the place, they can go down the street to another town like Downey and get something done very quickly,\u201d Bass said. \u201cWhy is it when it comes to building in our city everything takes so long?\u201d\n\nThe directive orders the Department of City Planning to come up with ways to reduce the need for discretionary review, the process by which city officials review and approve construction of housing projects and report them to the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nL.A. City Councilmember Nithya Raman, chair of the council\u2019s Housing and Homelessness Committee, said the directive will push to allow more housing projects, particularly those that are going to be producing the largest number of housing units, to skip the formal discretionary process.\n\n\u201cNow we have an opportunity to take decision-making processes in the city that have slowed down housing because they\u2019re sequential and make them simultaneous,\u201d Raman said.\n\nThe formal process typically includes meetings with neighborhood councils, the City Planning Commission and potentially the City Council itself.\n\n\u201cAll of these processes increase the length of projects so much before they can even put a shovel in the ground,\u201d Raman said.\n\nThe directive also ordered eight city departments to come together to form a working group led by the mayor\u2019s office to \u201cfocus on organizational and procedural improvements, pre-development review, and interdepartmental permit clearance coordination.\u201d\n\nL.A.\u2019s biggest healthcare employer sees benefits to the order. Michelle Gaskill-Hames, president of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals of Southern California and Hawaii, thanked the city for implementing the directive, which she said will positively affect her employees.\n\n\u201cSignificant increases in affordable and accessible housing is crucial if Los Angeles is to successfully compete with other cities and states across the country as we all strive to recruit and retain nurses and other health care professionals,\u201d Gaskill-Hames said.\n\nWith nearly 24,000 physicians and staff at Kaiser, it is one of the largest employers in L.A.\n\n\u201cWe need help to meet the housing needs of a workforce that is already stretched thin,\u201d Gaskill-Hames said.\n\nBass said the community-based approach to the plan will cut living costs for families and young adults just starting their careers who have been \u201cpushed out\u201d too many times.\n\n\u201cCreating a future where Angelenos can live more affordably must center around Angelenos in their communities,\u201d she said.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Jonathan Kemper on Unsplash)\n\nBy Lana Diab and Sethan Perez\nNovember 08, 2023 at 3:51 pm PST\n\nTop experts and scholars at USC gathered Tuesday on an online panel to discuss the impact Generative AI could have on journalism \u2014 the good and the bad. With more journalists and students utilizing GenAI more often, is AI an inevitable contribution to journalism in the new age?\n\nThe use of ChatGPT has been popularized among students, scholars and other seekers of knowledge over the past year. ChatGPT represents only one form of GenAI. Other GenAI tools that can help create images, music and other creative expressions.\n\nStudents and journalists, including those within Annenberg Media, have already started to consider the role of AI in their work. Annenberg Media has started experimenting with GenAI by generating summaries for its capsule section. However, like all sources of information journalists employ, skepticism is necessary.\n\n\u201cI am just extremely leery of presuming that there is necessarily a future for generative AI in some types of work when the premise of what journalism is is that it has to be accurate,\u201d Matt Pearce, a reporter for the LA Times, said during Tuesday\u2019s event.\n\nJournalism publications cannot afford to make an error with misinformation, which is why navigating AI may pose a problem if used incorrectly.\n\n\u201cA lot of us are covering the Israel-Gaza conflict right now, and you have to be able to account for every word that you choose to use in a story because people are watching like a hawk,\u201d Pearce said. \u201cAnd they expect that you\u2019re going to be using highly accurate and justifiable language in every element of this entirely contentious conflict.\u201d\n\nAlthough GenAI aids in decreasing research time and eliciting creativity for its users, some experts speculate it could lead to an increase of misinformation within journalism \u2014 not only from relying on it for information but also in the way it can alter the reader\u2019s intake of news.\n\n\u201cThe question is answered in that first search result. It\u2019s not a link that you\u2019re getting. You\u2019re getting a blurb,\u201d USC journalism professor Gabriel Kahn said during the event. \u201cSo imagine people stopping right there and never make it to the actual news site.\u201d\n\nLike the introduction of computers and other technological advancements in the past, AI could become an integral part of the research process.\n\n\u201cWhat we always drill it down to in the end is that AI is really, hopefully, going to give the student an assist and not do it for them,\u201d Christina Bellantoni, journalism professor and director of the Annenberg Media Center, said during the event.\n```"}

(Photo by Yannick Peterhans)\n\nBy Amanda Murphy\nNovember 08, 2023 at 3:38 pm PST\n\nSunday, Nov. 3 marked the end of daylight savings time, and almost all Americans gained an hour of sleep to accommodate for more daylight in the morning. The purpose of daylight savings time is to make greater use of natural daylight by adjusting clocks so that the sun rises and sets earlier. The fall back to standard time is meant to jumpstart the mornings, but some USC students are not feeling motivated by the change.\n\n\u201cI hate it,\u201d said Kendall Huggins, a sophomore business major. \u201cIt makes me really tired, really fast. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get used to it, but right now I just feel really sleepy.\u201d Now that the sun is setting before 5 p.m., Huggins said that they are struggling to stay productive and study.\n\n\u201cI just feel like my day gets cut shorter. It\u2019s 6 a.m. and the sun is already out. It goes through my window and it messes up my time,\u201d said english major Joselyn Ramos. Cade Huggins, another business major, added, \u201cIt\u2019s not fun. Before, I used to wake up before the sun rose, and then I could watch the sunrise. Now I wake up and the sun\u2019s already out, and I don\u2019t like that. And it gets dark really early and I get tired.\u201d\n\nSome students are trying to accept the change. Rohit Dsouza, who studies architecture, said \u201cit does limit my productivity when I\u2019m transitioning into it, but that happens to me every year.\u201d Another Thornton major, Andy Brems, said \u201cI\u2019m cool with it in the fall, but in the spring I hate it.\u201d\n\nMany expressed that the shift feels unnecessary and dated. However, there were some early-birds that were more welcoming to the early morning rays: \u201cI like daylight savings because I like when it\u2019s brighter in the morning. I\u2019m in ROTC so I wake up really early, but I don\u2019t like when it gets dark really early and it\u2019s not even late,\u201d said Bella Sanchez, who is trying to stay positive but has felt that her body has needed to adjust.\n\nNot all states observe daylight savings time. Hawaii and Arizona (with the exception of the Navajo Nation) do not participate in daylight savings time. Nor do the U.S. territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In 2024, daylight savings will begin again on March 10 and end on Nov. 3. When we \u201cspring forward\u201d in March, students can look forward to sunnier summer evenings.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Geoffrey Chandler)\n\nBy Yvonne Abedi\nNovember 08, 2023 at 12:08 pm PST\n\nThe nature of celebrity culture continues to become more and more bizarre with the rise of social media. After the unfortunate death of Matthew Perry, thousands took to social media to pay their respects. As a fan of an individual, when that person passes it\u2019s natural to be affected by it. But there was an overwhelming amount of people who called out Perry\u2019s co-stars to share their mourning with the world.\n\nParasocial relationships are one-sided relationships, where one person extends emotional energy, interest and time, while the other party, the persona, is completely unaware of the other\u2019s existence, according to the National Register of Health Service Psychologists. We\u2019ve seen continuous examples throughout history of \u201cfans\u201d exhibiting abnormal behavior regarding their favorite celebrity.\n\nIn 2012, a woman named Mariah Yeather filed a lawsuit against Justin Bieber after claiming he was the father of her child. The lawsuit was later dropped and Bieber came out with the song, \u201cMaria\u201d, recounting his own \u201cBillie Jean\u201d moment. This doesn\u2019t only end with Bieber. Celebrities like Harry Styles, Gigi Hadid, and Kendall Jenner have encountered situations where \u201cfans\u201d turned into stalkers. These encounters sometimes even turned deadly, as we\u2019ve seen with celebrities like Christina Grimmie and John Lennon, where their obsession becomes all-consuming.\n\nAfter a celebrity passes away, fans can feel entitled to know insight into the situation surrounding their death. Fans want to know their cause of death, where they died, or how their loved ones are grieving. Just hours after Perry\u2019s death, fans began flocking to social media intrigued to know how the \u201cFriends\u201d cast was grieving. While some fans may be genuinely concerned about the cast\u2019s well-being, others feel as though they owe them a reaction.\n\nJennifer Aniston has limited her comments on Instagram, while David Schwimmer turned his off completely. The rest of the main cast\u2019s comments are flooded with people berating them for not posting about Perry. On Lisa Kudrow\u2019s most recent Instagram post, of her singing happy birthday to her son, user @itz_asim17 commented, \u201cWhy none of the friends have posted about the loss of Chandler whyyyyyy????\u201d While on Courtney Cox\u2019s latest Instagram post, @ranmal_fitness4life said, \u201cNot posting about Matthew immediately after his death is one thing, but to post funny videos instead is weird and heartless. Disappointing.\u201d The post was a lighthearted video of Cox racing her dog, which was posted a week before Perry\u2019s death. So not only was this person insensitive, but they were also wrong.\n\nEven if this was after his death, it doesn\u2019t seem fair to judge how a person grieves. It\u2019s a continuous pattern that occurs after any celebrity\u2019s death if you scroll through their comments section on any platform. You\u2019ll find horrible comments like these and a war transpiring about how a person should grieve.\n\nThe dehumanization of celebrities plays a huge role in addition to parasocial relationships. It begins with the culture around celebrities and how we as \u201cnormal people\u201d view them. But there are levels to that, a person who isn\u2019t a major fan of a person may see them on the street, react, and go about their day. A person who may be a die-hard fan of a celebrity may experience a sense of disconnect or idolization causing them to react hysterically.\n\nWhen I saw Beyonc\u00e9 and Harry Styles for the first time in concert, I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around the fact they were standing right in front of me\u2014they didn\u2019t seem real. Obviously, I knew that they were real, but seeing them in the flesh forced me to acknowledge that they are indeed human like us.\n\nThis feeling toward celebrities continues to play out throughout their lives, explaining why people disregard them as such once they die. This transpires onto their loved ones, who are given the weight to commemorate and support their fans instead of grieving privately.\n\nOn a TikTok edit of Perry, appreciating his role on \u201cFriends,\u201d @chocolatechipcroissants commented, \u201chonestly celebrity\u2019s death don\u2019t usually get me but this one has me devastated bro.\u201d Not every celebrity\u2019s death will affect you because you may not have a relationship with them; however to state that a person\u2019s death hasn\u2019t affected you because they\u2019re a celebrity is insensitive, it almost diminishes their being.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to navigate where that line is crossed sometimes because fans feel as though they are owed certain things in exchange for giving them fame. But they are giving you their art, so why isn\u2019t that enough? Although celebrities are a source of entertainment to us and give us a certain level of insight into their lives. This doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that they are humans, who sometimes want to keep certain aspects of their lives private.\n```"}

(Photo by Ethan Thai)\n\nBy Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier November 07, 2023 at 10:43 pm PST\n\nWith USC head football coach Lincoln Riley making the decision to relieve defensive coordinator Alex Grinch of his duties, co-defensive coordinators Shaun Nua and Brian Odom hope to help the Trojans find their way back into the win column in their final two games of the regular season.\n\n\u201cWe gotta find the spark, gotta get the guys playing as a unit and executing at a high level,\u201d Nua said. \u201cObviously a change was made so we can go for that spark and go for a different outcome.\u201d\n\nOdom acknowledged that despite the change, the defense is trying to get better and is excited for this weekend\u2019s matchup against the Oregon Ducks.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s our job every week; to make it a little bit better,\u201d Odom said. \u201cThings are changing now, but obviously, I could kinda compare that to the linebacker room this year, you see a lot of guys out there, trying to find the right combination. They\u2019ve been great this week, guys are very aware of the situation, and they\u2019re excited to go play this week.\u201d\n\nSenior inside linebacker and team captain Mason Cobb spoke about his initial reaction to hearing that Grinch had been fired, and how influential Grinch has been on him as both a person and a player.\n\n\u201cI was surprised, you know? It\u2019s part of the game, but it\u2019s sad to hear, one of your coaches, one of your mentors, ultimately loses his job,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cAnd that guy, he taught me a lot about life. Not just about football, but he was always there for me and I could talk to him about anything. And he was very motivational, I\u2019m sure y\u2019all have heard stuff he\u2019s said. A lot of stuff I\u2019m gonna keep with me. This is how the game goes, and I wish him the best of luck.\u201d\n\nCobb had previously gone through a change in defensive coordinator near the end of his sophomore year at Oklahoma State, when Jim Knowles left the Cowboys to take the same job at Ohio State.\n\nNua acknowledged that from watching film, the Trojans had opportunities to stop the Washington Huskies\u2019 offense last Saturday, but the team found itself unable to capitalize on those chances as the Trojans lost 52-42.\n\nNua\u2019s focus now is making sure everyone is keeping a positive mindset and is getting ready for the game against the Ducks this weekend.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is trying to rally these guys,\u201d Nua said. \u201cMake sure that their mindset is right, and making sure that whatever we try to change, if we do change anything, that it\u2019s with a positive mentality. That\u2019s the challenge.\u201d\n\nOdom spoke to the challenges that the defense faces, especially considering how USC\u2019s coaches and players must account for the differences in how opposing offenses call and execute plays.\n\n\u201cEvery week, you play a different offense. They put you in stress at different moments,\u201d Odom said. \u201cThis week is just like every other week in terms of saying that they put stress on the defense, and they do a great job doing it. Schematically, what do we digest, what do we need to change, what do we not need to change?\u201d\n\nOregon\u2019s offense is one of the best in the country under senior quarterback and Heisman hopeful Bo Nix. Nix, who has thrown for 2,723 yards and 25 touchdown passes while also proving himself capable of running the ball, has led the Ducks to an 8-1 record.\n\nBut despite the challenge that playing in Eugene poses to the Trojans, Cobb has confidence in both Nua and Odom and is spending the week rallying and motivating his teammates.\n\n\u201cToday man, guys were fighting. I think guys understand that we don\u2019t have many options, but to go to work every day. And that\u2019s kinda all brought us together, through practicing,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cWhy not go around and hit people and fly around and be loud? ... This is a dream right here. Why would I lay down? For what? Cause something didn\u2019t go the way I wanted it to? No. I wasn\u2019t raised that way, and I\u2019m gonna keep preaching to the guys, \u2018We got two more games left, we gotta finish right.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will look to play spoiler to the Ducks this weekend, whose Pac-12 and national championship aspirations are still very much alive.\n```"}

The meetings about information and projects regarding USC student life formerly took place in The Forum on the top floor of Ronald Tutor Campus Center.\n\nUSG was advised to move future meetings online ahead of the Oct. 31 meeting by campus administrators for safety purposes, according to multiple USG senators. Last month, protestors filled the USG meeting, criticizing the USC administration for comments on the Israel-Hamas war that were described by the demonstrators as pro-Israel and unsupportive of Palestinian students on campus. Most critiques were aimed specifically at USC President Carol Folt\u2019s Instagram, where several statements on the conflict were made. Issues of safety on campus were raised at the following meeting.\n\nUSG\u2019s last in-person meeting was held Oct. 17.
