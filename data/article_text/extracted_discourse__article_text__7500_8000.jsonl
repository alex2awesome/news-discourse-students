(Photo: Business Wire)\n\nBy Zhengxing Aiden Yan September 25, 2023 at 11:58 am PDT\n\nIn a push to boost international travel and improve diplomatic ties, the U.S. Department of Transportation has unveiled plans to expand the number of weekly round-trip flights between China and the United States. Since Sept. 1, the number of trips increased from 12 flights to 18. The Department of Transportation has laid out ambitious goals to raise this number to 24 flights per week after mid-October. Although these figures remain well below the pre-pandemic average of approximately 150 weekly flights, the increase marks a promising step toward normalization.\n\n\u201cDirect flights are essential for increasing mutual visits between Chinese and American peoples. We hope that the restoration of more flights will do good to the flow of people and trade between the two countries,\u201d said the Chinese Embassy in Washington to Reuters.\n\nThe Chinese government lifted the zero-COVID restrictions in December 2022. Consequently, the resumption of more direct flights between the two nations began. Direct flights between China and the U.S. have experienced a sharp decline since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020, the Civil Aviation Administration of China implemented a flight suspension mechanism, temporarily halting specific flights when COVID-19 cases were detected on board. Despite China\u2019s efforts to adjust this policy to accommodate different airlines\u2019 commercial needs, the mechanism remained in place within the framework of China\u2019s zero-COVID strategy.\n\nAn order issued by the Department of Transportation defined the act as an impediment to the agreed \u201cbilateral right to conduct scheduled passenger air services to and from China\u201d under the US-China Civil Air Transport Agreement, and responded by suspending all carriers to and from China.\n\nThe announcement of increased flights has elicited enthusiasm among merchants and international students. \u201cDirect flights are so much cheaper now,\u201d said Junyi Huang, a Chinese student studying at USC. \u201cI am seeing more Chinese students planning to go back home for the winter recess.\u201d\n\nChina Eastern Airlines is offering direct flights in November from Los Angeles to Shanghai for about 6,000 RMB, equivalent to approximately 825 USD, reflecting the recent price drop.\n\nAirfare prices have seen a substantial drop on various booking platforms. A group of USC Chinese students said that the majority of students paid around $1,200 for economy cabin seats from Shanghai to Los Angeles in August to attend school, often necessitating layovers due to limited direct flight options. But, as of Sept. 21, the Chinese booking website ctrip.com started offering direct flight tickets from Los Angeles to Shanghai operated by the China Eastern Airlines for late-November onwards starting from 6,000 RMB, which is approximately $825.\n\nStudents also view this expansion as a potential sign of improved relations between the United States and China. \u201cThere are always multiple reasons behind such decisions. This news isn\u2019t just about students. It likely also reflects increased commercial cooperation and diplomatic efforts,\u201d said USC student Zitong Wang.\n```"}

The CDC recommends that people with no allergies to the vaccine who are over the age of six months get it each flu season. The vaccination has many benefits: \u201cit can reduce flu illnesses, visits to doctor\u2019s offices, and missed work and school due to flu, as well as make symptoms less severe and reduce flu-related hospitalizations and deaths,\u201d per the CDC.\n\nUSC students have the chance to remain in class and out of the doctor\u2019s office thanks to Student Health\u2019s \u201cFlu and U\u201d program. Their website includes a calendar of the different dates, locations and times that the vaccination is offered. The program also has outreach in the USC village on Tuesdays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and McCarthy Quad Farmer\u2019s Market on Wednesdays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Several schools and programs on campus are also offering walk-in vaccination days, including Annenberg, Marshall, Viterbi and Roski. Walk-in vaccinations are also available at the Engemann and Eric Cohen Student Health Centers, as well as USC pharmacies.\n\nStudents can also schedule vaccination appointments using their Student Health account. Student Health recommends that students be vaccinated before the end of October, as September and October are the prime months to receive vaccination from the flu.\n\nStudents who are currently on the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) can receive the vaccination at any of these locations without any out-of-pocket costs. Students who are on independent health insurance plans can receive the vaccination from any of these locations, as well but will be billed $20 on their account. This charge is often reimbursable with students\u2019 insurers, but it is important that students check their insurers\u2019 policies beforehand.\n\nFaculty and staff can receive flu vaccination from any of the locations free of charge because the USC Health Plans is sponsoring vaccinations for USC faculty.\n\nStudent Health hopes to halt the spread of the flu through this program so students and faculty stay healthy during the fall semester. Visit the program\u2019s website for more information on the walk-in vaccination sites and to schedule an appointment.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Charles Sykes/Invision/AP)\n\nBy Kaitlyn Huamani\nSeptember 25, 2023 at 10:00 am PDT\n\nSweat dripped from Ed Sheeran\u2019s face onto his guitar as he stood on a simple circular stage, all alone, in an ever-so-casual black tee and jeans in front of over 80,000 people at Sofi Stadium on Saturday. The red-headed star made one of the final stops on his \u201cMathematics\u201d North American Tour in Inglewood after playing a more intimate show featuring his latest album, \u201cSubtract,\u201d at the Shrine Auditorium on Friday. And it was certainly nothing like the shows of the stadium\u2019s recent notable headliners, Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9. It wasn\u2019t different because it didn\u2019t share the packed crowds or stunning visuals of his peers, but because it was just him, his guitar and a simple contraption that is responsible for a truly outstanding live music experience.\n\nSheeran has been performing with a loop pedal station at all of his live shows since the start of his career 18 years ago. He explained to the crowd that the equipment allows him to record vocal and instrumental lines that he can repeat on a loop, so as he\u2019s creating sounds, he layers the music and performs without any backing tracks. He demonstrated the loop pedal system after explaining it, with his classic boyish charm and slight awkwardness, noting that everything the audience heard Saturday was live and could never be recreated in the same way.\n\nThe setlist spanned his lengthy career and his various mathematical-based album titles, hence the tour\u2019s name, and tracks like \u201cGive Me Love,\u201d \u201cSing\u201d and \u201cShape of You\u201d made it clear how Sheeran\u2019s loop pedal performances are unlike any other. To listen to a simple line of three notes start on its own and build to a chorus we all know and love is astounding. The loop pedal system, which is about the size of a keyboard, is just plain impressive.\n\nFans watched as the singer darted from one mic to another and futzed with the pedals in his neon-colored sneakers (a signature Sheeran look), all while executing flawless vocals and switching gears from guitar lines to instrumental lines.\n\nBeyond his sheer skills and raw performance style, Sheeran is known for his quirks and self-deprecating humor, both of which were on full display at this performance. Even with a crowd of about 81,000 that broke SoFi\u2019s one-day ticket record, Sheeran made the show feel as intimate as the prior day\u2019s at the Shrine. \u201cWhen I close my eyes in this song, I imagine being 18 and playing it to no one in London, and then I open my eyes and I see 81,000 people in Inglewood here tonight,\u201d he said before introducing his first career hit, \u201cThe A-Team,\u201d a song that he said \u201cno one liked\u201d when he first wrote it. He also cheekily invited the crowd to sing along if they knew the words.\n\nDespite not having the support of a band for the majority of the two-hour set, Sheeran kept the experience interactive, asking attendees to sing backup and even to harmonize. \u201cMy name is Ed Sheeran and I will be your vocal coach tonight,\u201d he quipped before splitting the stadium in half and instructing fans to sing either a low or high line as he sang the melody. He kept the humor alive in the stories he shared while he caught his breath in between songs and in his introductions, noting at one point before singing mega-hit \u201cPhotograph\u201d that if anyone didn\u2019t know the lyrics to this one, they were at the wrong concert.\n\nTrue to his persona since he skyrocketed to fame over a decade ago, Sheeran struck a balance between charming and odd. He shared vulnerable stories and profusely thanked the audience for being there, but also sat on the floor as he sang at times and awkwardly darted across the rotating circular stage.\n\nAfter chugging through back-to-back radio sensations like \u201cGalway Girl,\u201d \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d and \u201cLove Yourself,\u201d Sheeran changed into an L.A. Rams jersey emblazoned with his upcoming album title and release date and performed one of his final songs of the night. He played the frenetic and surprising \u201cYou Need Me, I Don\u2019t Need You,\u201d an early career rap song with killer rhymes and an unexpected air of confidence that he hadn\u2019t yet displayed. He followed this wild anthem with the sheepish confession that he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure if anyone was going to turn up\u201d to Sofi that night, and that he had so much fun with all 81,000 in attendance.\n\nEven as a four-time Grammy winner with several record-breaking shows at some of the biggest venues in the world, Sheeran still thinks of himself as a singer-songwriter. \u201cWhat I love is being on stage and being in the studio,\u201d he said. \u201cI love making music, I love being on stage. I don\u2019t know anything else. It\u2019s the thing that I love most.\u201d\n```"}

Even though the Dodgers took the series, Sunday\u2019s final game went down to the wire.\n\nIt took a little bit for both teams to get started in game one. The Dodgers and Giants were scoreless through two innings. With a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the third inning from Enrique \u201cKike\u201d Hernandez, the Dodgers broke the score open 1-0. J.D. Martinez added to the Dodgers\u2019 score after hitting a solo home run in the bottom of the fourth inning, his 30th of the season, increasing the Dodgers\u2019 lead to 2-0 heading into the fifth inning.\n\nEmmet Sheehan put on a show for the Dodgers during game one, pitching four innings without allowing a single run and striking out nine Giants batters. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts pulled Sheehan from the game after walking in the Giants\u2019 first run in the top of the fifth inning.\n\nDuring the top of the sixth, with the Dodgers still winning 2-1, Joc Pederson tied the game for the Giants with his 15th home run of the season. In the bottom of the sixth, Martinez responded by hitting a sacrifice fly to push the Dodgers ahead of the Giants 3-2.\n\nAfter two wild pitches from Giants pitcher Luke Jackson in the bottom of the seventh inning, both Chris Taylor and James Outman scored, giving the Dodgers a 5-2 lead. In the bottom of the eighth, Martinez added another run to the scoreboard after hitting an RBI single increasing the Dodgers lead 6-2. Taylor then hit another RBI single later in the inning, putting another run on the scoreboard and increasing the Dodgers lead 7-2.\n\nEvan Phillips closed out the game in the top of the ninth inning, securing the Dodgers win 7-2. Dodgers relief pitcher Shelby Miller picked up the win, pitching one inning and striking out two batters. Giants pitcher John Brebbia picked up the loss.\n\nThe Giants did not hesitate to respond in game two. After both teams were scoreless through three innings, Giants outfielder Mike Yastrzemski hit a two-run home run in the top of the fourth inning to break the lead open 2-0. The Giants then added another run, widening their lead to 3-0, after Thairo Estrada hit a solo home run in the top of the sixth inning, his 13th of the season.\n\nGiants pitcher Sean Manaea shut the Dodgers offense down. Manaea pitched seven innings with no runs, only giving up three hits. After seven scoreless innings, the Dodgers finally scored after a Freddie Freeman RBI single, narrowing their deficit to 3-1. But the Giants tacked on two more runs in the top of the ninth inning after Tyler Fitzgerald hit his first-ever big league home run. The Giants then closed the game out at 5-1 with Camilo Doval picking up his 38th save of the season and evening up the series at 1-1.\n\nDuring game three, it was all about the Dodgers. Dodgers starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw took the mound for five innings, striking out five batters and only allowing two hits. Dodgers relief pitchers Joe Kelly, Michael Grove and Caleb Ferguson all followed after Kershaw was pulled. The Dodgers pitching staff didn\u2019t allow the Giants to score the entire game, with the three relievers tallying six strikeouts through four innings with no hits.\n\nOn the offensive end, the Dodgers bats were hot. In the bottom of the second inning, Martinez got the Dodgers score started by hitting his 31st home run of the season. Martinez then followed up in the bottom of the third inning by driving in two runs on a double, increasing the lead to 3-0. Freddie Freeman joined the mix in the bottom of the fifth inning with his own RBI double, making the score 4-0. Max Muncy then followed Freeman later that inning with an RBI single to make it 5-0.\n\nThe game was steady after the fifth inning until Mookie Betts added two more runs to the Dodgers total in the bottom of the eighth. The Dodgers took game three with a score of 7-0 and Kershaw picked up his 13th win of the season.\n\nIn game four, the Dodgers and Giants went down to the wire. The Dodgers started off the game strong in the bottom of the second inning. James Outman opened up the game for the Dodgers with a two-run homer, giving the Dodgers an early 2-0 lead. The Dodgers and Giants went scoreless for the next two innings.\n\nThe Giants then upped the score in the top of the fifth when Lamonte Wade Jr. hit a two-run homer to tie the game 2-2. Both teams went scoreless for the next four innings, with each team going deep into their bullpen. After nine innings, the score was still tied 2-2.\n\nHeading into extra innings, the Giants had a chance to win the game but failed to convert. In the bottom of the tenth inning, the Dodgers\u2019 second base runner Ahmed Rosario advanced to third base after pinch hitter Kolten Wong grounded out. With one out, Taylor drove in the game-winning run with an RBI single to walk it off in the tenth inning.\n\nThe Dodgers improved to 96-59. They\u2019ll hit the road this week for a four-game series with the Colorado Rockies starting Tuesday.\n```"}

(Photo by Luis Perez)\n\nBy Qais Adawiya September 24, 2023 at 6:10 pm PDT\n\nUSC women\u2019s soccer boarded a flight to Salt Lake City to match up against the Utah Utes on Friday in what was the first conference game for the Trojans. A good start to the road trip, USC notched their fifth victory in seven games on the back of a masterclass defensive performance.\n\nThis past week, second year head coach Jane Alukonis echoed the importance of getting off to a strong start in conference play. \u201cOur goal is to win the conference,\u201d Alukonis said on Trojans Live. \u201cStarting out strong is super important. You don\u2019t get games back, we have to come out with a bang.\u201d\n\nAn early goal in the seventh minute from junior forward Kayla Colbert gave USC that strong start and the ability to settle in. In spite of the early goal from the Trojans, the match proved to be a defense battle throughout the night. USC did not have many opportunities but took advantage of the few that came.\n\nColbert\u2019s goal came from a set play, which allowed USC\u2019s leading goal scorer to sneak through Utah\u2019s defense. A 37th minute goal from senior defender Zoe Burns was the only other semblance of offense for USC. This was Burns first goal on the campaign, showcasing her versatility evidenced by her three assists on the year, one of which came on Colbert\u2019s goal.\n\nGoing into the half Utah outshot USC 5-3, however most of Utah\u2019s shots were from distance and did not threaten sophomore goalkeeper Hannah Dickinson. In the second half, USC focused on protecting the lead, playing more conservatively. The offense earned themselves a few scoring opportunities coming out of the half, however could not capitalize.\n\nIt was the Trojan backline, consisting of freshman Alyssa Gonzalez, junior Brooklyn Courtnall, Burns and graduate Kayla Duran, which starred in the second half to complete the shutout of Utah\u2019s offense. All game they were quick to the ball, and gave Utah no space to operate.\n\nDuran and Burns\u2019 play throughout the game were key to USC\u2019s victory. Duran, anchoring the defense, covered the entire pitch. Her clearances and effective communication with the backline and midfield gave Utah\u2019s offense nothing to work with. Burns was phenomenal in the midfield, scoring one of the two goals for USC. The senior\u2019s passing and defense forced long shots and put Utah\u2019s offense out of rhythm.\n\nAs a result of her stellar play, Burns won Woman of the Match honors, her first of the season. Dickinson got the start in goal, only her second of the year. Alukonis has been giving reps to both her and freshman goalkeeper Hannah Poulter, with Poulter receiving a bulk of the minutes in the early part of the season.\n\nWhile the defense did not allow Utah to get through to the goalie, Dickinson made her presence known late in the game. With Utah mounting an attack late in the game, Dickinson made two incredible stops to secure USC\u2019s 2-0 victory.\n\nUtah earned four corner kicks, however nothing came of them. Both teams managed five shots on target with USC\u2019s coming closer to the goal. USC improves to 5-2 on the year, good for third in the conference, while Utah drops to 4-3-3.\n\nThis was the 17th matchup between USC and Utah, with USC earning its 10 win over the Utes as it improves its record over Utah to 10-3-4. USC is looking to build on the momentum of back-to-back shutout victories. The Trojans head to Pullman to take on the Washington State Cougars this upcoming Thursday, with kickoff scheduled for 5 p.m. at Lower Soccer Field.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Ethan Galbraith\nSeptember 24, 2023 at 3:22 am PDT\n\nUSC hit the road for its final Pac-12 matchup against Arizona State Saturday night, and the Trojan offense set the tone early. Junior quarterback Caleb Williams marched the offense down the field on the game\u2019s opening possession, culminating in a 1-yard rushing touchdown from the 2022 Heisman winner. However, it was the Trojans\u2019 self-inflicted errors that made this season\u2019s road debut a back-and-forth battle.\n\nAfter forcing a three and out, Williams fumbled the handoff to redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd, setting Arizona State up in USC\u2019s redzone. It only took the Sun Devils three plays to capitalize with a 15-yard rushing touchdown to even the score early.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our first road game. There\u2019s going to be things that happen on road games that doesn\u2019t happen at home games,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe kept fighting. We responded to all the events that happened throughout the game and we have things to get better at.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans nearly fumbled the ball again during the following kickoff, but a call reversal spared them. USC took advantage, with Williams connecting on a 43-yard touchdown to senior wide receiver Brenden Rice nine plays later.\n\nArizona State refused to back down. The Sun Devils responded to Rice\u2019s touchdown with a pair of field goals on both sides of Williams\u2019 second rushing touchdown of the game to make the score 21-13 entering the half.\n\nUSC\u2019s first drive of the second half ended in a 53-yard field goal from sophomore Dennis Lynch. Arizona State, however, continued its first half momentum into the third quarter. Gaining 75 yards in just five plays, the Sun Devils finished the drive with a 25-yard touchdown pass and successful two-point conversion to bring the score within three points.\n\nThe Trojans looked to respond on the next drive with a touchdown pass to freshman wide receiver Zachariah Branch, but an offensive pass interference called the score back. USC head coach Lincoln Riley opted for another Lynch field goal, this time from 36 yards.\n\nJunior defensive back Calen Bullock halted Arizona State\u2019s momentum with an interception on the Sun Devils\u2019 next possession, but the offense sputtered. The Trojans gave the ball back to the Sun Devils following a turnover on downs, USC\u2019s second turnover in three quarters.\n\n\u201cFor the first three quarters, it was an example of how the road games can challenge you,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt was an example of how mistakes tend to show up on the road a little bit different than they do at home.\u201d\n\nRedshirt senior defensive end Solomon Byrd shifted momentum back with a forced fumble recovered by junior defensive end Romello Height. The second defensive takeaway, combined with eight sacks, highlighted a big night from the Trojan defense.\n\nThe defensive effort gave the offense prime real estate on Arizona State\u2019s side of the field, and USC capitalized. Two plays later, Williams found Rice for a 29-yard score, their second connection of the game.\n\n\u201cAdversity struck us. It struck us hard, and we went ahead and took care of it and that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d Rice said. \u201cWe bounced back. We got things that we needed to get right.\u201d\n\nBut, again, the Sun Devils would not go away. They responded with a 52-yard touchdown pass, capping off a six play, 75-yard drive that brought the lead back to one score.\n\nWilliams and the offense struck back less than a minute later with a long touchdown pass of their own. A 45-yard dart to redshirt senior wide receiver Tahj Washington put the Trojans ahead for good, and capped off Williams\u2019 five-touchdown, 322-yard passing performance.\n\n\u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t our cleanest performance. We know we\u2019re going to have to get a lot better,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a lot of things to learn from, and I think this team will do that and look forward to our next road challenge.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans are on the road again next Saturday for a conference matchup against Colorado on Sept. 30.\n```"}

L.A. once again demonstrated their ability to win this week, holding a narrow 24-20 lead late into the fourth quarter before their defense faltered again when it mattered most. Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehills\u2019s 49-yard completion on the first play of their final drive in regulation positioned the team for an easy four-yard touchdown pass with 2:22 remaining to put them ahead.\n\n\u201cDefensively, we\u2019ve got a lot of closers,\u201d head coach Brandon Staley said after the loss. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to do it together as a team.\u201d Quarterback Justin Herbert was able to drive his team into field goal range as time wound down, with 60 of his 305 passing yards coming in the Charger\u2019s final drive, but ran out of time for a winning touchdown.\n\nThe Chargers made it into the endzone on just two of their five trips to the Red Zone against Tennessee, allowing the Titans to stay within touching distance throughout the game. Chargers Kicker Cameron Dicker sent the game to overtime as time expired with a 33-yard field goal, but Herbert and the offense were unable to move the ball in overtime. The Chargers defense was also unable to stop Tennessee from mounting a game-winning field goal drive the following possession.\n\nAfter losing two close games in a row, L.A. looks ahead to the Minnesota Vikings, a team in a similarly precarious situation. Minnesota also sits at 0-2 after two one-score losses of its own, but has established a reputation for winning close games. The Vikings went a whopping 11-0 in one-score games last season, propelling them to an unexpected division title.\n\nIn their latest loss, quarterback Kirk Cousins threw for 364 yards and four touchdowns, including eleven completions to star wideout Justin Jefferson for 159 yards. Having already given up 215 yards and two touchdowns to Tyreek Hill, one of the league\u2019s top receivers, this season, L.A. will now look to contain Jefferson, arguably the best of the best.\n\nFor the Chargers to end their losing streak, they\u2019ll likely have to find a way to contain him, especially in the clutch. 51 of Hill\u2019s yards as well as one of his touchdowns came in Miami\u2019s game-winning drive, and a similar negligence for Jefferson would be a death sentence for L.A.\n\nStaley will look to his defensive line to put pressure on Cousins, who was hit ten times and sacked twice in Philadelphia last week. The Chargers defensive line had a bounce-back game in Tennessee, headlined by Joey Bosa\u2019s two sacks. Staley noted Bosa\u2019s \u201caggressive\u201d performance against the Titans, after a hamstring injury kept the edge rusher\u2019s game status in doubt throughout the week.\n\nSimilar production from L.A.\u2019s defense, who had five sacks as a unit, will be necessary to get a victory against Minnesota. While the Chargers offense has its standouts\u2014Keenan Allen dominated Tennessee\u2019s secondary with eight receptions for 111 yards and two touchdowns\u2014it missed dearly running back Austin Ekeler, especially on third down.\n\nAfter gaining 233 yards on the ground in Week 1, L.A. rushed for just 61 on Sunday. On 14 third down attempts, Herbert and the offense moved the chains just twice. Staley said there is \u201cno update\u201d on Ekeler\u2019s ankle ahead of Sunday\u2019s trip to Minnesota.\n\nWith both teams eager to win their first game of the season, the Vikings\u2019 close-game prowess may be too much for the Chargers, especially if L.A.\u2019s third down and Red Zone struggles continue. The Chargers will play the Vikings Sunday in Minneapolis at 10:00 a.m. PDT.\n```"}

It\u2019s Saturday eve, and an exciting one at that, with six ranked matchups and conference play beginning for most teams across the country. Last week had its ups and downs, but most importantly...HOW BOUT THEM GATORS. You heard it here first, and then it happened when the Florida Gators pulled off a 29-16 upset victory over the then-No. 11 Tennessee Volunteers. This week\u2019s AP Poll rewarded the Gators with a return to the rankings at No. 25, and sent the Volunteers crashing down to No. 23. The upset came behind a MONSTER game from sophomore running back Trevor Etienne, who put up 172 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries. Expect big things going forward out of Etienne, who now ranks third in rushing yards in the SEC.\n\nI do apologize, however, to anyone who happened to tune in to the slaughter of a game that was No. 12 LSU vs Mississippi State. My pick for game of the week was a rather unimpressive one, with the Tigers handling the Bulldogs 41-14 in a game that LSU led for all four quarters. Mississippi State just couldn\u2019t get their pass attack going, with quarterback Will Rogers completing only 11 of his 28 passes for 103 yards. Meanwhile, LSU passer Jayden Daniels had a banner day, going 30 for 34 for 361 yards and two touchdowns. Daniels also led the team in rushing with 64 yards and two more touchdowns on the ground.\n\nThis Saturday has a lot more to be excited about, leaving me way more competitive matchups to choose from for this week\u2019s column. I couldn\u2019t pick every single one, and you may be wondering about a few notable omissions. I\u2019ll admit I was impressed by No. 19 Colorado\u2019s Week 1 victory over TCU, until a few weeks went by and I realized TCU scored more points on the Buffs than they gave Houston or even Nicholls State. Yes, Coach Deion has a flashy, high-powered offense. But Colorado doesn\u2019t have the defense to stop a legitimate top-25 team like No. 10 Oregon, especially after losing supposed Heisman candidate Travis Hunter to a chest injury in last week\u2019s game. A game, I should add, in which the Buffs went to double overtime against a Colorado State team that won three games last year. The Prime Time bubble is about to burst; if not this week, then certainly next. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad for Deion and the boys to pull out one more W in Eugene \u2014 then we\u2019d get to watch and laugh as our Trojans send them tumbling down the AP ranks in Boulder next week.\n\nThe start of what may be the last season of PAC-12 conference play has a stacked lineup of great games, and another West Coast showdown that didn\u2019t make the cut was No. 11 Utah vs No. 22 UCLA. This game will be crucial to eventual CFP rankings, especially after Utah jumped one spot last week from Florida, their best win so far, climbing back into the AP Poll. A second ranked win is just what the Utes need to become a legitimate playoff contender, and this should be manageable against a UCLA squad that has yet to face a Power 5 opponent.\n\nEnough talk, let\u2019s get into it. Happy Saturday eve.\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK\nNo. 14 Oregon State (3-0) vs. No. 21 Washington State (3-0)\nPullman, Washington\n4:00 p.m. PDT on FOX\n\nI got a good chuckle seeing ESPN call this the \u201cPac-2 Championship\u201d but in all seriousness it\u2019s a game you should definitely catch, especially if you care about our Trojans\u2019 path to the Pac-12 title that will be crucial to our playoff hopes. There are currently eight 3-0 Pac-12 teams, but with six of them playing each other this weekend, that has to drop to at most five. Presumably, those will be USC, Washington, Utah, Oregon and ... ? Of all the games on the Pac-12 slate this weekend, the Pac-2 title seems the most up in the air.\n\nOregon State has a strong offense led by Clemson transfer quarterback DJ Uiagalelei, who\u2019s been looking a bit better in orange and black than orange and purple \u2014 so far he\u2019s tallied 630 passing yards and six touchdowns. The Beavers also have a strong 1-2 punch in the backfield between running backs sophomore Damien Martinez, who has rushed for over 100 yards in three straight games, and senior DeShaun Fenwick (I had to shout out a fellow Bradenton, Fla. native). The defense is stout, too, holding their last two opponents under 10 points \u2014 an impressive stand regardless of the competition.\n\nThe odds have Oregon State winning this one, but counting Wazzu out would be unwise. The Cougars upset then-No. 19 Wisconsin in their home opener to bounce the Badgers out of the AP Poll, and held Colorado State to 11 fewer points than Prime Time managed for a decisive 50-24 victory over a team that took No. 19 Colorado to 2OT. Especially given the win over Wisconsin, Wazzu\u2019s offense looks even more impressive than Oregon State\u2019s. Junior quarterback Cameron Ward has started hot with 986 passing yards and nine touchdowns in three games \u2014 on 72.2 percent completion with no interceptions. He\u2019s surrounded by a deep receiving core, with three receivers averaging 40+ yards per game and six different players recording touchdown receptions.\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see a traditional Pac-12 shootout for potentially the last time between these teams, and no matter the result, it\u2019s a game that will surely be important down the road in conference play.\n\nMOST PLAYOFF RELEVANT GAME\nNo. 6 Ohio State (3-0) vs. No. 9 Notre Dame (4-0)\nSouth Bend, Indiana\n4:30 p.m. PDT on NBC\n\nThis is one of those games you just have to watch because of how important it will become later in the season. Whoever wins this Top 10 matchup will likely get vaulted up the rankings into a prime seat at the playoff table, with the loser likely waving such hopes goodbye.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Ohio State. While they haven\u2019t exactly faced prime competition yet, they started the season off with something so rare for Power 5 programs these days: a conference matchup. There were certainly hiccups, but the Buckeyes pulled out a decisive 23-3 victory over Indiana and never looked back, holding both of their next opponents to 10 points or less. This defense is truly suffocating, allowing the fewest yards per play and second-fewest yards per game in all of Power 5, and will certainly be a massive test for Notre Dame.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the offense is bad. Like I said, they haven\u2019t played anyone amazing yet, but they\u2019re averaging 475 yards per game across their first three weeks. After winning a tight quarterback battle in camp, junior Kyle McCord has started 53-for-76 for 815 yards with six touchdowns and only one interception. Expect to see McCord air it out on Notre Dame\u2019s untested defense to Marvin Harrison Jr., arguably the best receiver in the nation and a shoe-in favorite for the Biletnikoff. Harrison has already recorded 14 catches for 304 yards and three touchdowns, and looks to keep those numbers up this Saturday.\n\nWhile Notre Dame looks slightly less impressive on paper, anyone who\u2019s spent time on a gridiron will tell you that especially this early in the season, an extra game under their belt gives the Fighting Irish a MASSIVE advantage. They\u2019ve worked out an extra week\u2019s worth of the misalignments, blown plays and bad reads that happen at even the most elite levels during a season\u2019s beginning. And their offense is looking even better than Ohio State\u2019s \u2014 averaging the fifth-highest yards per game in Division 1 with 509.\n\nThis game will truly be must-see television out of South Bend in a game that will surely be remembered as pivotal regardless of the victor.\n\nUPSET ALERT\nNo. 4 Florida State (3-0) vs. Clemson (2-1)\nClemson, South Carolina\n9:00 a.m. PDT on ABC\n\nLet me be clear: I don\u2019t want this to happen. If a genie gave me three wishes, the Florida boy in me would use them all to guide FSU to playoff gold. But if you hear a blood-curdling scream of defeat coming from the general area of 29th and Hoover at around noon Saturday, you\u2019ll know that Will Shipley ran all over Florida State\u2019s lackluster run defense, crushing their hope for a return to the playoff for the first time since the CFP\u2019s inception in 2015.\n\nLast week I highlighted FSU as a team on the rise, warning that while they seemed to have a nearly complete team, their work defending the run left room for concern against a Boston College offense led by mobile quarterback Thomas Castellanos. Well, what do you know \u2014 Castellanos ran for 95 yards and a score on top of 305 passing yards. BC rallied late in the game after returning an FSU fumble, narrowing the Noles\u2019 lead to 31-22. At this point, FSU\u2019s offense sputtered, punting the ball after just five plays to set up for a 95-yard BC touchdown drive to bring the score within a field goal at 31-29. The Seminoles were lucky to win at all, as BC had what would\u2019ve been a three-and-out stop to recover the ball with 1:08 left in the fourth, if not for a facemask penalty that allowed FSU to run out the clock. The Noles left Doak Campbell Stadium to chants of \u201coverrated!\u201d and it\u2019s pretty hard to argue otherwise. True top five teams don\u2019t win by two points against unranked opponents, and FSU will have to prove they belong against a Clemson team whose biggest strength lies in running back Will Shipley. If the junior continues his stellar play Saturday (he\u2019s averaging 6.3 yards per carry and adds more value as a receiver), and the Seminole defense continues to struggle, quarterback Jordan Travis will need to throw a Heisman coming-out party in order for FSU to end up on top.\n\nON THE RISE\nNo. 8 Washington, 3-0 vs. California, 7:30 p.m. PDT on ESPN\n\nIt\u2019s been hard to keep your jaw off the floor watching Washington\u2019s offense this season. They currently sit at first in Division 1 in yards per play and second in yards per game behind the arm of senior quarterback Michael Penix Jr. Don\u2019t sleep on Penix for Heisman \u2014 through just three games, he leads Division 1 with 1,332 passing yards, has found the end zone 12 times to only one interception, and ranks first among all Division 1 signal callers with a 94.2 QBR. Penix has the skills to carry this team all the way as long as the defense doesn\u2019t give it up. That shouldn\u2019t be a worry this week, at least, as the Huskies take on an unranked Cal at home.\n\nMissouri, 3-0 vs. Memphis, 4:30 p.m. PDT on ESPN U\n\nBesides Florida defending the swamp against Tennessee (again, I told you so), Mizzou\u2019s upset of then-No. 15 Kansas State was perhaps last week\u2019s most shocking result. Junior quarterback Brady Cook had a tight game, going 23 for 35 for 356 yards and two touchdowns, both into the hands of sophomore receiver Luther Burden III. Burden has been the spark plug in this Tigers offense, and through three weeks ranks 13th in Division 1 (fifth in Power 5) in receiving yards with 327. Missouri received just 31 fewer votes in this week\u2019s AP Poll than No. 25 Florida, and a win against Memphis to move to 4-0 could be just what they need to climb into the Top 25.\n\nSOMETHING TO PROVE\nNo. 13 Alabama, 2-1 vs. No. 15 Ole Miss, 12:30 p.m. PDT on CBS\n\nAfter seeing them lose to Texas at home in Week 2, I doubt I was alone in expecting Alabama to steamroll South Florida in their Week 3 matchup. Instead, I watched a garbage fire of a game in which Alabama benched quarterback Tyler Buchner (who himself had replaced the benched Jalen Milroe) after he failed to score a single touchdown in the first half. Obviously, the defense is still there, but this is a team with very little offensive identity, and the quarterback carousel has definitely lowered the offense\u2019s confidence as a whole.\n\nOle Miss was so close to knocking off the Tide last year, and Jaxson Dart and company will enter Bryant-Denny on Saturday smelling blood and the chance for a potentially substantial climb up the polls \u2014 a win would put them at least as high as No. 12, and that\u2019s without considering the shakeup that this week\u2019s wide slate of ranked matchups is sure to incite at the top of the poll.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Grettel Cortes Photography)\n\nBy Caitlin Roehmholdt September 22, 2023 at 5:58 pm PDT\n\nOur not-so-beloved characters, CioCio from \u201cMadama Butterfly,\u201d Kim from \u201cMiss Saigon,\u201d and Kumiko from \u201cKumiko, the Treasure Hunter,\u201d all have one thing in common. But it\u2019s not what you\u2019re thinking. Yes, they all commit suicide, but what they really share is the desperation of being trapped in a script already written for them.\n\nIn association with Artists at Play and Latino Theatre Co., Preston Choi and Reena Dutt premiered their play, \u201cThis Is Not a True Story,\u201d at the Los Angeles Theatre Center on Saturday. Marie-Reine Velez, an Artists at Play producing assistant leader, is also the assistant director of Vision and Voices at USC. The play stars Julia Cho, an actor and production assistant leader of Artists at Play, as CioCio; Zandi De Jesus, a UC San Diego theater graduate and actor, as Kim; and Rosie Narasaki, an actor and playwright, as Kumiko/Takako.\n\n\"This is Not a True Story\" plays at the Los Angeles Theatre Center through October 15. (Photo courtesy of Artists at Play)\n\nThroughout this story, the three characters, CioCio, Kim, and Kumiko, are reliving their tragic lives and deaths over... and over... and over. These characters interact with each other in a place deemed \u201cThe Void,\u201d where they must follow their written stories, otherwise an unidentified male presence screams at them, \u201cThis is not your line!\u201d\n\nThe lives of these young Asian American women have already been crafted for them by a white male who becomes angry whenever they attempt to break free from their scripts. Hmm... sound familiar? These characters are literally in a cycle of their stereotypical false narratives that don\u2019t make sense.\n\nHow can CioCio and Kim have children without ever having intercourse or giving birth? And why is CioCio marrying an adult man at 15 years old? And why is Kim, a 17-year old Vietnamese bargirl and prostitute, paid to stay with a man who she falls in love with until he ultimately leaves her... and at the end she also decides to shoot herself.\n\nComedy accentuates the absurdity of these stories, where baby dolls that represent the characters giving birth come flying onstage from the stage ceiling, and each character dramatically transcends into a trance out of nowhere as they repeat their lines and commit suicide repeatedly.\n\n\u201cI think we need comedy to be able to really examine and process the harm that we\u2019ve had to deal with through these pieces of media. It skewers and pokes holes at these characters that have been revered for so long. It\u2019s like a cathartic experience to laugh through the show and go through this emotional journey by the end,\u201d said actress Julia Cho about the importance of the comedic effect in heavy moments of the play.\n\nJulia Cho, Zandi De Jesus, and Rosie Narasaki deliciously tackle the contrast of their characters in the original opera, musical and film, to these new, more realistic and complex versions of their characters that humanize them a little more.\n\nThrough this comedic choice to have all the actors ridiculously jump between passionate monologues and intimate dialogue, the play poses the question of why they must blindly follow their scripts.\n\nCioCio (Julia Cho) and Kim (Zandi De Jesus) receiving their babies as they fly down from the top of the stage, as Kumiko/Takako (Rosie Narasaki) watches. (Photo courtesy of Grettel Cortes Photography)\n\nThe third character, Kumiko is from a film called \u201cKumiko, the Treasure Hunter,\u201d which claims to be a true story but is heavily misinformed. The real woman who the film follows isn\u2019t even named Kumiko. Her name is Takako Konishi, and she died by suicide in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota.\n\nThe film portrays Takako as a very stereotypical Japanese immigrant in America who is on a quest to find so-called hidden treasure after watching the film, \u201cFargo,\u201d which results in her ultimate demise as she freezes to death during this search.\n\nPlaywright Preston Choi said the inspiration behind the title, \u201cThis Is Not a True Story,\u201d came from the film\u2019s false attestation of stating that it was \u201cbased on a true story.\u201d Choi expands on the idea of his title choice, saying \u201cthis history of Orientalism isn\u2019t true, it\u2019s a story that\u2019s been fed to us. Hopefully through those lies we\u2019ll get to some truth.\u201d\n\nThe character of Takako in this play struggles with remembering her real name and her true story. By changing her name to Kumiko, the creators of the original movie are erasing her history and redirecting her narrative instead of relaying the truth.\n\nIn the play, Takako struggles with renouncing her truth because the world, or the unidentified male speaker in this case, refuses to accept it.\n\nChoi\u2019s choice to delve into the battle of finding the truth behind stories that are completely hidden behind Hollywood\u2019s perceptions highlights this constant fight throughout history to remember the truth behind false stories that are told.\n\n\u201cWhen does nonfiction become fiction and fiction become nonfiction, and when do those blurred lines happen? These [stories] all involve the tragic death of the heroin character to fulfill the emotional arc of the white man. The story [of Kumiko/Takako] uses a fictionalized version of this happening. Filmmakers transform stories for public consumption,\u201d Choi said when asked about his original inspiration behind creating this play.\n\nKumiko/Takako (Rosie Narasaki) and Kim (Zandi De Jesus) attempting to remember their truth. (Photo courtesy of Grettel Cortes Photography)\n\nThe movie \u201cKumiko, the Treasure Hunter\u201d came out in 2014, so Takako is the only character from modern times. Through her conversations with CioCio and Kim, she exposes the absurdities of their stories as they begin to deal with the knowledge that they are stereotypes.\n\nAs these characters start to understand that it doesn\u2019t make sense for them to drop everything for an American man and kill themselves for honor, their narratives change, and they start to break free from \u201cThe Void.\u201d\n\nBecause someone has told these characters to be a certain way for their entire lives, they don\u2019t recognize how problematic their actions are. These characters release themselves from their poorly written narratives and overcome their identity crises, while eventually remembering their family names.\n\nThe importance of this moment in the play is that, similarly to these characters, many young Asian American girls grow up watching themselves portrayed through harmful stereotypes, and eventually realize that those stories aren\u2019t representative of their lives and culture.\n\n\u201cWhen you see figures that look like you or resemble you, portrayed in the same way over and over, I think it definitely affects how people view you and then consequently how you\u2019re forced to navigate the world,\u201d Cho said of seeing Asian American characters in shows and movies while growing up.\n\nAs CioCio and Kim reclaim their power by rebelling against \u201cThe Void,\u201d they become real people, and their stories evolve. However, Takako cannot join them, as she is already a real person, and in her real life, she died by suicide.\n\nCioCio wants to rewrite Takako\u2019s story in an attempt to reveal her truth. All of these characters begin to create a new narrative for themselves.\n\nCioCio (Julia Cho) and Kim (Zandi De Jesus) viewing the story of Takako Konishi. (Photo courtesy of Grettel Cortes Photography)\n\nThese harmful stereotypes and typecasts of Asian American women affect how the world views them through the eyes of white male creators. To inspire change, it is essential to bring awareness to the past of film and theater that is rooted in racism and misogyny.\n\nSo, next time there is a promo poster for \u201cMadama Butterfly\u201d or \u201cMiss Saigon,\u201d or you happen to find \u201cKumiko, the Treasure Hunter\u201d when you are scrolling through your streaming services, remember how detrimental these pieces of media are to Asian American women and how we can continue to correct these falsely written stories.\n\n\u201cI think part of what can help further progress is no longer accepting or enforcing the previous portrayals that are more one dimensional, and learning to embrace and highlight the more multidimensional portrayals that are out there. The writers are writing these stories and these characters, but are we doing what we can to spotlight these new stories? I think that\u2019s partly what we\u2019re trying to do with \u2018This Is Not a True Story\u2019,\u201d Cho said about the future representation of Asian American women in film, TV and theater.\n```"}

Narcan, an over-the-counter product, is being offered to all students on the USC Student Health Insurance Plan at no charge. Narcan, more generically known as Naloxone, is a drug with life-saving capabilities meant to remedy opioid overdoses.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Opioids were involved in 80,411 overdose deaths in 2021 in the United States (a little over three-quarters of all drug overdose deaths). According to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), preliminary data indicates there were 6,843 opioid-related overdose deaths in California in 2021, and 5,722 of these deaths were related to fentanyl.\n\nState Public Health Officer and CDHP Director Dr. Tom\u00e1s J. Arag\u00f3n said that Naloxone can save lives. \u201cMany overdose deaths can be prevented with Naloxone, a life-saving drug that\u2019s available to many colleges and universities at no cost,\u201d said Dr. Arag\u00f3n. \u201cSome colleges already make Naloxone and overdose education a top priority, and our goal is to continue supporting them while also breaking additional barriers and stigma that may be preventing us from talking about overdose and keeping students alive.\u201d\n\nVice President and Chief Campus Health Officer Sarah Van Orman said overdoses are unfortunately frequent, but \u201ccarrying naloxone (Narcan) can save someone\u2019s life, \" she said in an email sent to students, faculty and staff on Thursday. \u201cUnfortunately, opioid overdoses are too common in both our community as well as in the overall city of Los Angeles,\u201d said Dr. Van Orman. \u201cAnyone can get and carry Narcan in their room, in their car, in their backpack and potentially use it if they\u2019re in a situation where they suspect somebody may be having an opioid overdose.\u201d\n\nThe CDPH warns that there are ways to tell if someone is having an opioid overdose. These signs include constricted \u201cpinpoint pupils,\u201d a loss of consciousness, cold or discolored skin, choking and gurgling sounds, limpness, slowness, and weakness.\n\nThe drug has only been offered over-the-counter in California since July 2023, but there is already legislation approaching the governor\u2019s desk that would require insurance companies to cover over-the-counter Narcan. USC has made it available through USC Pharmacies and other locations. \u201cNarcan has been available as a prescription product since 2015... DPS officers have been trained in using Narcan (and carrying it) for opioid reversal since 2019,\u201d USC stated.\n\nStudents can pick up Naloxone at USC Pharmacies free of charge at any time needed.\n```"}

(AP/Evan Vucci)\n\nBy Katherine Havens and Jennifer Nehrer\nSeptember 22, 2023 at 3:50 pm PDT\n\nPresident Joe Biden had a busy week. Announcements range from additional involvement in Ukraine to the launch of both the new Office of Gun Violence Prevention and the American Climate Corps, here\u2019s what you should be paying attention to:\n\nGun violence\nOn Friday, Biden announced the launch of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention. This office will be overseen by Vice President Kamala Harris and looks to implement executive orders and other presidential actions regarding gun violence prevention. Throughout his time in office, Biden has made efforts to contain the epidemic of gun violence, including the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that he signed into law in June 2022. This act administered new gun violence prevention policies and took action in improving the quality of mental health in schools to promote community safety.\n\nRecent Republican control of the House of Representatives has made federal action on gun violence prevention gun control more difficult, but in his announcement Biden renewed his promise to make progress. \u201cWhile we push for Congress to do more, we\u2019re going to centralize, accelerate and intensify our work to save more lives more quickly,\u201d said Biden. \u201cLet me be very clear. If members of Congress refuse to act, then we\u2019ll need to elect new members of Congress that will act, Democrat or Republican.\u201d\n\nAction for climate change\nOn Wednesday, the White House announced the formation of the American Climate Corps, a climate job training program made to encourage climate activists and bring about positive change. The program is modeled after the New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps. The purpose of the American Climate Corps is to \u201ctrain young people in clean energy, conservation and climate resilience related skills,\u201d according to the White House fact sheet on the matter. Biden hopes to provide up to 20,000 people with jobs in the movement\u2019s first year of projects.\n\nThe newly announced American Climate Corps is the result of much pressure from climate activism groups such as the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led coalition who previously pitched the idea to the administration.\n\nThe United Nations and Ukraine\nAt a UN General Assembly meeting hosted Tuesday in New York, President Biden made a statement regarding the importance of continuous, widespread support to Ukraine during the ongoing war. \u201cThe United States, together with our allies and partners around the world, will continue to stand with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity and their freedom,\u201d Biden said.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. During the meeting Biden announced that an additional $325 million will be allocated to Ukrainian military aid. Biden is looking to congress to allocate an additional $24 billion to Ukrainian aid, according to NBC. Biden received high praise from Zelenksyy during their meeting, in which the Ukrainian president thanked him for his continued support. Afterwards, the presidents joined a larger meeting of top White House officials as well as the two first ladies.\n\nA looming shutdown\nIf congress does not pass 12 appropriations bills by the end of the fiscal year on September 30, the government will be forced to shut down. These bills are supposed to allocate funds to the necessary government agencies and keep the government running. If the government shuts down, all non-essential functions of the government will stop, affecting the payment of government employees and potentially costing the economy billions of dollars.\n\nAs of now, none of the 12 bills have even passed the U.S. House of Representatives, making a shutdown likely if they are not resolved in the next eight days. During the last government shutdown, which occurred from December 2018 to January 2019, the U.S. economy lost approximately $3 billion, according to CBS. In addition, immigration court hearings were canceled and government contractors and businesses suffered financial losses. This 34 day shutdown was the longest in U.S. history.\n\nKevin McCarthy (R-CA), the speaker of the House, has disagreed with many Republican House members in regards to the defense funding bill, which is causing negotiations and bill drafting to stall. In the meantime, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has told reporters that the senate may need to pass emergency legislation through his chamber first and send it to the house, instead of the other way around.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of government shutdowns,\u201d McConnell told CBS news. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few of them over the years. They never have produced a policy change and they\u2019ve always been a loser for Republicans politically.\u201d\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s achievements this week have been met with praise, they may not lead to immediate action if congress cannot avoid a shutdown.\n```"}

Also committed to hosting better events, HackSC expressed that they will be sharing feedback forms to really understand what the USC community wants.\n\n\u201cOne thing is that people who are planning this night never attended a Hack Night, but heard a lot about it,\u201d said hacker experience lead and computer engineering major junior Lynn Nguyen. \u201cWe heard great things about it and we\u2019re trying to bring in our perspective of how to create a space that\u2019s inclusive for all tech enthusiasts to come together.\u201d \n```"}

Expand Taylor Swift performing at her Reputation Tour in Seattle in 2018 (Photo courtesy of Ronald Woan). \n\nBy Valerie Fang September 22, 2023 at  3:34 pm PDT\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d is a column by Valerie Fang dedicated to figure skating. I cannot even describe how much fun I am having as I write this. Finally, this is the time when I merge my identities as a figure skating columnist and a Swiftie and see what happens. So, drop everything now, here is my list of the top three Taylor Swift tunes that can make sparks fly even on ice.\n\nNo. 1 \u2014  \u201cLong Live (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d\nThe top spot goes to the national anthem of Taylor Nation, \u201cLong Live\u201d from Swift\u2019s timeless classic, Speak Now. Crashing through walls. Holding up trophies. The crowds in stands going wild. Remembering this moment. And, of course, having the best time of life fighting dragons with somebody. So many images and symbolisms from this song fit perfectly into a sports narrative. I can see \u201cLong Live\u201d being skated to in both singles and pair competitions. Given the performative nature of figure skating, \u201cLong Live\u201d can deepen and give new meanings to the bond between the skaters and the audience. In this story, the fans are the ones who fight dragons alongside the skater. The fans are the ones who stand by the skater forever before fate forces them into a goodbye (yes, I mean the inevitable retirement). The fans are the ones who, when they have children someday, will point to the pictures and tell them how the crowds went wild. If I live to see the day when Hanyu Yuzuru skates to the bridge of this song, I will be moved to tears.\n\nNo. 2 \u2014  \u201cThe Man\u201d\nOf course, I want to see this one being skated to during women\u2019s single competitions. It would be a nice little comment on the fact that the ISU (International Skating Union) still does not allow women to do quadruple jumps in the short program. Currently, only men are allowed to add one quadruple jump to their short programs. Well, I do not understand the logic here. Why ban female skaters from jumping quads when it has been proven,  over and over again , that they are perfectly capable of doing so? I am aware that this rule was set up when no quadruple jump had been landed by women. But it is about time to update that rulebook. It would be amazing if Evgenia Medvedeva, the 2018 Winter Olympics silver medalist known for her artistic prowess, could take on this powerful masterpiece. Her incredible talent for storytelling and emotional expression through skating to music would surely bring out the narrative as intended by Swift.\n\nNo. 3 \u2014  \u201cChristmas Tree Farm\u201d\nRemind me again \u2014 what time of the year do we have the most people participating in ice skating? Just listening to this song makes me miss the holiday season already. This very festive piece would be most ideal for skaters to perform at exhibition galas, which happen after all the actual competitions and skaters perform to thank the audience. Skaters are normally under much less pressure and just want to have fun with it. This song will easily hype up the audience because, frankly, it is just too jolly to not vibe with. Another place for \u201cChristmas Tree Farm\u201d to be in style would be at public outdoor ice rinks. Think of The Rink at Rockefeller Center and the Wollman Rink at Central Park in New York City. I am picturing families and friends, hand in hand, skating to this song and around a lovingly decorated Christmas tree with their Santa hats on: \u201cEverything is icy and blue, and you would be there, too.\u201d\n\nThe list could go on. \u201cYou\u2019re On Your Own, Kid,\u201d \u201c22 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d \u201cthe last great american dynasty\u201d and many other songs would all leave us enchanted if performed on ice. Maybe one day I will write a second edition of this column. But that is it from me for now. I hope you had as much fun reading it as I did while writing it. Thank you for staying with me until the end. Ciao. \u201cIn the Loop\u201d runs every other Friday.\n```"}

According to reporting from the Los Angeles Times, the 4-0 vote was a result of an emotionally charged board meeting. During the board meeting, one of the proponents of this policy, Rick Ledesma, the school board president stated that \u201cWe believe it is important to clarify communication between the school district and parents and guardians on these important matters pertaining to the mental health and social and emotional issues of their students in order to prevent or reduce potential issues of self-harm.\u201d\n\nThe school will notify parents if their child starts identifying as a gender other than what was assigned to them at birth. Additionally, the school will also alert the parents if their child begins using a different name than their legal one (this does not include nicknames). Lastly, if the child uses bathrooms that do not reflect their assigned gender, the parent will be notified.\n\nMadison Miner, another supporter of the policy mentioned that this notification is meant to protect children since children who are transgender are more likely to suffer from self harm and suicide. \u201cA parent is a child\u2019s best advocate,\u201d Miner said. \u201cIf we (the parents) can save children from suicide by bringing their parents alongside them, I think it\u2019s a great idea.\u201d\n\nHowever, not everyone thinks that the policy has the students\u2019 best interests at heart. Another board member, Kris Erikson, acknowledges that the there are already policies within the school district that revolve around suicide. \u201cI have three concerns: one is the targeting and discrimination of trans and nonbinary students,\u201d Erikson said. \u201cTwo is the high likelihood of expensive litigation that I think will come from this, and three is the blatant government interference in the family unit that this mandates.\u201d\n\nThe Orange Unified District is not the first to enact such a policy. California\u2019s attorney general, Rob Bonta, recently sued the Chino Valley Unified School District over a very similar policy, which required parents to be notified by the school when their child chooses to change their pronouns or gender. The attorney general stated that it was a \u201cforced outing\u201d of students and that \u201cit tramples on students\u2019 rights.\u201d The lawsuit itself states that the policy breaches the state\u2019s right of equal protection regardless of gender and sexual orientation while also stripping students\u2019 of their privacy rights.\n\nWhile some believe that parents have a right to know what is occurring in their child\u2019s life in order to protect them, others agree that such policies discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community by forcing them into environments where they do not feel comfortable or safe. An argument that the opposition has is that children may be forced to return to homes where they are no longer supported or valued because of their gender identity.\n\nStudents, too, echo this sentiment. Max Ibarra, a trans teenager who uses they/them pronouns from the Chino Valley Unified School District discussed how these policies do more harm than good. They mentioned that students have resorted to using their deadname, a term that denotes the birth name that children are assigned but no longer identify with. Ibarra pointed out that, while some students have spaces to go home to, not all children have the privilege of being accepted for who they are. \u201cThey [students] can\u2019t start their new school year by being themselves, because if they do, they will be outed to their families, and there are many cases where that\u2019s not safe,\u201d Ibarra said.\n\nSchool districts all over the state such as Murrieta Valley Unified, Temecula Valley Unified and Rocklin Unified have all adopted the controversial policy. While certain parents strive to assert their involvement in their children\u2019s lives by advocating for such policies, it is important to note that many of those actually affected by the policies can be harmed by being forced to come out and returning home to environments that may not necessarily be supportive of them.\n```"}

This two-day event will take place at the Columbia Memorial Space Center in Downey, California, and will welcome an in-person crowd for the first time since 2020.\n\nJason Vega, the founder of the festival, wanted to create a space for Latinx people in the video game industry to promote themselves and also gain knowledge from others in the industry. The event hosts a variety of panels from people working for companies such as Blizzard Entertainment, Respawn Entertainment, SEGA of America, and more. These panels are meant to encourage inclusivity in an industry that has historically been straight, white, and male, which Jason has actively spoken against.\n\nActivision Blizzard, parent company of Blizzard Entertainment, which has several panels for this event, recently went through major internal shifts after being accused of creating a \u201cfrat boy workplace culture\u201d. Now, the video game industry wants to turn away from that image and create workplaces that are as diverse as their games.\n\nLatinx Games Festival will also feature a variety of games made by Latinx teams or from companies based in Latin America, and their official game selection for 2023 can be seen on their website. These games will serve as nominations for the future winners of the Latinx Game Awards, which will also take place during the event.\n\nThe event is sponsored by Respawn Entertainment, responsible for Apex Legends and the Star Wars Jedi series, and ID@Xbox, which is Microsoft\u2019s platform for promoting indie games on Xbox. Tickets for Latinx Games Festival 2023 are currently on sale on their website up until the day of the event. If you want to support Latinx in gaming but cannot attend, the event is also being streamed for both days on their Twitch channel.\n```"}

(Photo by Anthony Clingerman)\n\nBy Anthony Clingerman September 22, 2023 at 12:25 pm PDT\n\nPatrons of the Fiesta Mini Mall, an affordable marketplace in South Los Angeles, are confronting the loss of their livelihood following an eviction notice from the city for the end of October. The swap meet provides a communal space for residents of the South Park neighborhood to gather together and purchase low-cost goods, but is slated for demolition in order to create space for an affordable housing development.\n\nVendors originally received a notice to vacate the premises by the end of May, but received two extensions that now place the deadline next month. Maria Briseno, a vendor at the mall, told Annenberg Media about some of the services that the swap meet provides. \u201cThe Mini Mall is important to South Central because it provides accessible merchandise to the community,\u201d she said. Briseno also shared her insight about the importance of communal spaces in neighborhoods like South Park. \u201cIt reduces vandalism and bad things that can happen in the community,\u201d she said.\n\nAt a city council meeting on August 8, vendor Maria Francisca Peralez explained the importance of the mini mall location for the sellers. \u201cWe have no place to go \u2013 where do we take our things? There\u2019s a lot of sellers there of advanced age,\u201d Peralez said. \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive to move and we don\u2019t have the resources.\u201d\n\nThe closure of the swap meet would have dire ramifications for the neighborhood\u2019s current residents, as the shopkeepers will need to find new locations for their shops. The stretch of South Main Street that the mall occupies already hosts a large number of street vendors, and Briseno worries that additional shops will draw complaints for removal.\n\nSouth Park is home to a strong Latino community, and almost half of the residents were born outside of the United States, according to census data. Esmeralda Briseno, who works alongside her sister Maria as a vendor, worries about the impact for older residents. \u201cI see a lot of elderly people come every Saturday and Sunday to take a walk and buy water, their shampoo, their coffee or clothes. It\u2019s the closest affordable store,\u201d Esmerelda said. \u201cThis community is mostly low income. It\u2019s important for them to have access to affordable things.\u201d\n\nAs in many neighborhoods, people in South Park fear that new developments could lead to more expensive housing and the ultimate displacement of local residents. \u201cThey want to close the Mini Mall to make the apartments supposedly affordable... It\u2019s not going to be really affordable for low income people,\u201d Esmerelda said. Many apartment complexes enforce strict income checks for new applicants, and Esmerelda worries that current residents will be unable to meet the requirements. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re pushing the people away from this community,\u201d she said.\n\nSome people see a contradiction in City Hall, where Mayor Karen Bass \u2013 who is from South Los Angeles \u2013 has staked her first term on making progress against the housing crisis. The mayor\u2019s \u201cInside Safe\u201d initiative aims to create both temporary and permanent housing for people without either, but people who work and shop at the Fiesta Mini Mall fear that progress will come at their community\u2019s expense. \u201cA message I have for Karen Bass is to help us, because she said that she was going to help,\u201d Esmerelda said. \u201cWhen she ran for her campaign she said she was going to end the homeless crisis, but soon, if this thing shuts down, there\u2019s going to be a wave of Latino people being homeless.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Diego Ynzunza September 22, 2023 at 9:39 am PDT\n\nConsistency and aggressiveness. USC will surely reach their desired destination if they continue to exhibit these two traits, both on the field and off. The Trojans\u2019 offense has been dominant, and they continue to prove that their defense is not far behind. In his Thursday media availability, head coach Lincoln Riley assured reporters that his team leaders have spearheaded this charge heading into their road matchup with Arizona State, and they will continue to step on the gas.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those groups that the leaders have got to continue to push,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWhen we do, they respond. Our guys have seen when they\u2019ve been really aggressive, present and not passive, that our guys have really responded well to the leadership.\u201d\n\nTwo important pieces to that leadership are set to return in Tempe. Coach Riley confirmed that senior linebacker Mason Cobb, as well as redshirt senior defensive lineman Tyrone Taleni, are both expected to be available on Saturday. The bye week gave them time to get healthy. For Cobb\u2019s return specifically, Riley said that the staff is looking to give opportunities at linebacker to multiple guys, to try to establish some continuity.\n\n\u201cGonna be great to get [Mason] back,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIn the meantime, guys like Raesjon [Davis], Eric [Gentry], Tackett [Curtis] and Shane [Lee], all of those guys have taken advantage of time on the practice field and have done some really good things in games. I would imagine we\u2019ll play a few different guys there. I would expect to see some of all of those guys.\u201d\n\nThe common theme from Riley was that the bye week helped the team recharge, get healthy, and didn\u2019t come with any repercussions as the team returned to practice after the weekend.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t seem to come back on Monday with any kind of bye-week rust or any kind of bye-week hangover. We came back with intent, and we were really sharp. We\u2019ve had three really good days. I think they\u2019re serious about [the game],\u201d Riley said. \u201cThey know that for us to be the team we want to be, these road games are important.\u201d\n\nFor ASU, it is currently plagued heavily by injuries, especially on the quarterback front. They could be rolling out fourth-string quarterback Jacob Conover, as the top three on its depth chart are all nursing injuries. The defense trying to stop Conover, as previously mentioned, has grown leaps and bounds since last season. Riley touched on three key contributors.\n\n\u201c[I\u2019ve] been really pleased with Solomon Byrd. He got hurt, missed all of spring. It\u2019s interesting to see where he was gonna be coming back, and he\u2019s been awesome. I think Jamil [Muhammad] has been productive,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe think Anthony [Lucas] had his best game against Stanford, did some really really good things. You can tell that Anthony is still young, but he\u2019s making fast progress.\u201d\n\nWith the developments on the defensive side, the sky is the limit for this Trojan team. With those expectations, there also needs to be an intensity that is brought about each and every week, no matter the opponent.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any preconceived notions about this week,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at a place like USC, you can watch how people play on film, and a lot of the times you go and play them and it\u2019s a totally different deal.\u201d\n```"}

If they have these things pre-motivated and have in their hearts, it creates a disconnect with people who may not look like you.\n\nTanishka Khanduja, a junior international student studying neuroscience, said she\u2019s surprised this is a debate at all.\n\nTanishka Khanduja: Like here, everything is so polarized. So given that the people in power are saying things that are objectively wrong, it\u2019s just concerning. He probably shouldn\u2019t be reelected.\n\nJunior Civil Engineering student Nancy Moran said that De Leon\u2019s announcement is indicative of the government\u2019s disregard for its minority voters.\n\nNancy Moran: And it just kind of shows that people of color aren\u2019t really at the top of their priority. I don\u2019t want that for the community of L.A.\n\nVanderbilt said she believes that government leaders must strive for more tolerant attitudes.\n\nChirsten Vanderbilt: I think moving forward, if we want to create a more inclusive environment for our children, for our future children, it starts off with listening, starts off with our leaders who are able to really see everyone\u2019s point of view.\n\nDe Leon is the only council member heard on the controversial tapes who is still in office. He will face more than 10 opponents in the March 2024 primary, many of whom called on De Leon to step down after his remarks.\n```"}

(Photos courtesy of World Economic Forum licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0.)\n\nBy Shivani Gupta and Anthony Clingerman\nSeptember 21, 2023 at 6:16 pm PDT\n\n92-year-old Rupert Murdoch is leaving behind a mixed legacy following his departure as the shepherd of the Fox media empire. Lachlan Murdoch, Rupert\u2019s 52-year-old son, will now assume the full responsibility of leading both the Fox and News corporations. He has served alongside his father as co-executive chairman, and this decision should avoid potential infighting among Murdoch\u2019s heirs.\n\nRupert began his career in Europe about 70 years ago after inheriting multiple publications from his father. He later transitioned to the American market following the purchase of The San Antonio News. Murdoch would later form the Fox News corporation and garner controversy due to the network\u2019s outwardly conservative reporting. An article from The New York Times called it, \u201cthe most important and politically influential media empire on the planet. His companies... have amassed the power to shape, and at times make or break, presidents and prime ministers.\u201d\n\nMurdoch\u2019s philosophies were on display during his introduction of former President Donald Trump in 2017. A damaging blow to Fox came in 2016 - after former CEO Roger Ailes resigned amid sexual harassment allegations from female contributors. Ailes and Murdoch had maintained a close working relationship during the former\u2019s tenure, and it was after Ailes\u2019 departure Murdoch assumed CEO responsibilities. This controversy was dramatized in the fictional 2019 film Bombshell.\n\nMurdoch\u2019s transition to chairman emeritus follows a potential legal battle for the Fox Corporation against Dominion Voting Systems. That lawsuit was related to misinformation surrounding the 20-20 election and the settlement cost Fox almost eight-hundred million dollars. Dominion CEO John Poulos spoke at a press conference following the settlement decision.\n\nFox News has long-dominated cable television ratings. The network regularly ranks number one according to Nielsen rankings. Murdoch left a message to Fox employees in an internal memo revealing his resignation that said, \u201cWe have every reason to be optimistic about the coming years \u2014 I certainly am, and plan to be here to participate in them.\u201d\n\nFor Annenberg Media - I\u2019m Anthony Clingerman\n```"}

(Photo by Ling Luo)\n\nBy Lily Coleman, Kate Stuzin and Aerianne Collantes\nSeptember 21, 2023 at 6:08 pm PDT\n\nThe Student Union\u2019s fourth floor revamp has received mixed reactions from the organizations with spaces there. According to organization leaders on the floor, the revamp included the reassignment of rooms to different clubs. Some of the organizations affected were the Daily Trojan and several cultural organizations. Many in these groups said they were unaware of the changes that were happening and did not find out until they tried to use the space only to find it was closed.\n\n\u201cWe never received an official email notification that they were renovating it, but when it reopened, we did receive an email from the new director who oversees the cultural affirming lounges that it was back open,\u201d said Nizhoni McDonough, a law, history and culture student. \u201cBut I know I wouldn\u2019t say we never received any specific emails saying what they were renovating and to what extent.\u201d\n\n\u201cPersonally, I was not aware that they were renovating the fourth floor in general,\u201d said Tatiana Sataua, Vice President of the Pacific Islander Student Association (PISA). \u201cIt was kind of a surprise to me when the first week of school I wanted to go to that study space and I see that the fourth floor, we\u2019re not allowed to go in there. So I was kind of taken aback from there.\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement from USC Student Life, \u201cThese renovations are part of ongoing work and commitment to prioritize community development and student engagement at USC, as well as expand and modernize our student spaces.\u201d\n\nSome organizations worked in temporary spaces until their renovated spaces were reopened weeks into the school year. Others had a difficult time adjusting to the changes, given they did not have a temporary space to work in, according to organizations on the floor.\n\n\u201cThe first two months were really hard because we didn\u2019t have another space to go to, unlike other cultural organizations that had temporary spaces,\u201d Sataua said.\n\nRooms on the fourth floor slowly started to reopen this month.\n\n\u201cSo the lounge this year was actually delayed opening until, I think, September 11 it actually opened,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cSo we were promised that it would be open before school started, but that was delayed.\u201d\n\nPrior to the rearrangement, some of the rooms not only provided space for members of student organizations, but also contained a history that associated directly with the group in the room. The change affected both leaders and members in various ways, making it difficult to readjust.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard that we were going to be switching spaces, I was pretty disappointed since our old newsroom carried such a legacy,\u201d said Aubrie Cole, a Daily Trojan Arts & Entertainment Editor. \u201c[The newsroom] had been in there for around 60 years. It was such a homey space that I\u2019d grown to love.\u201d\n\nOther organizations said they were moved to smaller or shared spaces, leaving some members feeling overlooked and questioning the university\u2019s thought process.\n\n\u201cLast year, the space was more able to accommodate both of our clubs [PISA and the Native American Student Assembly (NASA)], and this semester with the move, it feels smaller. There are two clubs sharing this one smaller room,\u201d Sataua said. \u201cWe are severely underrepresented within many communities, including the Asian community, and I just feel like both us and our partner organization were overlooked in this process.\u201d\n\nWhile students are still getting used to the new layout, the updated aesthetic has been popular with some.\n\n\u201cComing into this new newsroom, it\u2019s so nice,\u201d said Cole. \u201cIt\u2019s much nicer than I thought it was going to be. Everybody in there seems super excited about the future.\u201d\n\nBut organizations on the fourth floor are not the only ones affected by the changes. According to Maideh Orangi, co-executive director of the Middle Eastern North African Student Assembly (MENASA), the organization hopes they will be able to get a bigger space as a result of the fourth floor\u2019s shuffling.\n\nCurrently, the space for MENASA is the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) lounge, located inside the Center for Black Students. According to Orangi, MENASA members have to walk directly through the MENA lounge, sometimes even during an event.\n\n\u201cOther cultural centers like the Latin American Student Association, I think the LGBTQ+ student lounge, the sustainability one, those things that are all opening up their own individual entities and renovation while we are left to share a space,\u201d Orangi said. \u201cI think we are for sure open to moving to a different space and getting the same opportunity as other organizations in the reshuffling of the student union.\u201d\n\nAccording to organizations Annenberg Media spoke with, the floor is still not completely open. A date for a grand opening of the fourth floor has yet to be announced.\n```"}

Figueroa is still under construction, forcing many students to accommodate in nearby hotels. (Photo by Robert Westermann)\n\nBy Robert Westermann, Catherine Stuart-Chaffoo and Paulena Edelman\nSeptember 21, 2023 at 5:55 pm PDT\n\nHub LA Figueroa is an upscale apartment complex located near Fraternity Row catering to USC students- or at least it will be once it opens. The complex broke ground more than two years ago and was expected to be completed this summer, according to construction company Milender White. But at the beginning of August, Hub sent an email letting future tenants know their apartments would not be ready for move-in on Aug. 14 as previously planned. Instead, students were told they should expect to get their keys in one to four weeks.\n\nSince their apartments were not going to be ready on time, students were given a number of options. \u201cWe could either receive $100 a day and they would find us housing, which was at the J.W. Marriott downtown, or they would give us $200 a day and we could find our own housing,\u201d said sophomore Charlie Adams. Adams opted for the second option, paying for a room at the USC Hotel. Despite being close to campus, Adams said living in the hotel has its drawbacks. His room does not have a kitchen, and the hotel does not have any laundry machines, forcing Adams to eat out for every meal and haul his laundry to and from his friends\u2019 apartments.\n\nJunior Anish Kilaru chose the first option \u2013 receiving $100 a day and living at a hotel provided by Hub \u2013 while continuing to pay his monthly rent. \u201cYou have to pay your rent to get the stipend which is ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cI somewhat understand having to pay the first rent in August to start getting stipends, but having to pay September rent too is kind of ridiculous because we\u2019re just paying rent for something that we\u2019re just not getting at all.\u201d\n\nIn one of its weekly email updates to tenants, Hub said it would allow residents to break their lease in early September. However, Hub only gave tenants a three-day window to take the offer and find alternative housing options. \u201cI honestly think it was an attempt by them to be able to have a legal defense where they can say \u2018Hey, we gave them an option to break the lease,\u2019\u201d junior Luke Morreale said. \u201cBut when you actually think about it, they weren\u2019t actually really giving people a fair option.\u201d\n\nJunior Luis Cacayoren, who took Hub\u2019s third option of receiving a prorated rent and finding his own housing, considered breaking the lease but in the end stayed with the apartment complex. \u201cI kind of looked into it, but most of the places that were open are a few miles away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of trapped in the lease right now.\u201d Cacayoren said they were told on Wednesday to expect an update on Friday regarding when tenants can move in.\n\n\u201cHoping we can move in as soon as we can,\u201d Kilaru said. \u201cEven if they just put me in an empty room, I will furnish it myself. I will build my bed. I just want a place to stay.\u201d\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/09/21/fantasy-football-start-em-sit-em-week-3/", "response": "```\nNFL fans are starting to get a taste of what to expect this season as a third weekend of football approaches. While squads like the Chargers, Bengals, and Vikings all have serious cause for concern after starting 0-2, other teams like the Dolphins and Cowboys (it pains me to say) are looking like serious Super Bowl contenders behind a dominant first two weeks. While the Fantasy landscape is far from set following the first two weeks (I can guarantee you the Cowboys D will not finish as a top 3 fantasy player), players like Puka Nakua and Jordan Love are proving that they are here to stay.\n\nWith this in mind, let\u2019s take a look at how I fared in Week 2 and what overreactions I bought into to start the year: As always, good news first: I was lights out with my tight-end predictions last week, correctly hitting on Hunter Henry (snoozer) and Sam LaPorta, who ended up finishing the week as TE2 and TE8, respectively. I also sniped the bust out of Freiermuth, who hauled in just one catch for two yards, good enough to make him the TE51 on the week. Daniel Jones also made things very interesting this week, entering the second half of the Giants\u2019 contest against the Cardinals with less than 6 points. But after leading their team to victory on a 31-8 run to end the game, Jones finished with over 30 fantasy points, concluding as the QB1. Cam Akers watched the Rams game from the sideline after he was a healthy scratch so while he didn\u2019t play, I would still consider this a hit. Finally, James Cook shredded apart a weak Vegas defense as I projected, having over 150 total yards, good enough for 19.9 fantasy points and the RB11 spot on the week.\n\nThe Bad: Aside from Hunter Henry balling out on SNF, all of my snoozer picks decided to sleep in and not show up to work over the weekend. Michael Thomas and Tyler Allgeier both finished outside of the top 40 for their positions, and Mac Jones finished outside the top 20 at QB this week. I also missed a few times with my sit predictions, as Dak Prescott and the Dallas pass offense proved me wrong as Prescott threw to the tune of 250 passing yards and 2 touchdowns, good for QB17 on the week. While he didn\u2019t reach the endzone, Joe Mixon had an alright day as well, having 4 catches and nearly 100 total yards, making him RB18. Finally, Terry McLaurin had five catches and a touchdown, placing him at WR25 on the week. You can take a closer look at last week\u2019s picks at the bottom of this page.\n\nNow, enough banter, let\u2019s dive right in to this week\u2019s Start \u2018Em Sit \u2018Em.\n\nQuarterback\nSTART: Kirk Cousins (MIN) vs. LAC\nAfter the Vikings\u2019 offense started off slow against the Eagles, I expect Kevin O\u2019Connell to come out of the gates hot with one of the best passing offenses in the NFL. The Chargers have given up the sixth-most Fantasy points per game (FPPG) through their first two weeks to opposing quarterbacks, and in a game of two winless teams desperate for a W, I expect Cousins to rely heavily on Justin Jefferson and the passing game.\n\nSIT: Joe Burrow (CIN) vs. LAR\nAfter signing his new contract extension to make him the highest-paid player in the NFL, Joe Burrow simply hasn\u2019t looked like himself, averaging less than 10 FPPG. After reinjuring his calf last week, I\u2019m even lower on him. While many will see this as a revenge spot for Burrow, I conversely see a tough matchup against a gritty defense that allowed the seventh-fewest FPPG to QBs last season and is top 10 again in that category this season. With all things considered, I would steer away from Burrow, especially if his calf is not 100%.\n\nSnoozer: CJ Stroud (HOU) @ JAX\nThe Houston offense has been very surprising to open the year, relying heavily on the pass behind rookie CJ Stroud. The Texans have thrown the ball at the fourth-highest rate to open the season and I don\u2019t see that changing against a Jaguars defense that\u2019s been top 10 in FPPG to opposing QBs each of the last two seasons. After having over 350 passing yards last game, I expect another big day offensively for the rookie.\n\nRunning back\nSTART: Isaiah Pacheco (KC) vs. CHI\nThe Chiefs offense looks out of sorts this season, causing many to believe that Mahomes and Kelce are the only two viable options in fantasy for the team. However, against a Bears defense that allowed the second-most FPPG to RBs last season and is top 10 again this year, I expect Pacheco to feast with a positive game script that will likely yield him 15+ carries, especially when the Chiefs are up big at the end of the game.\n\nSIT: James Conner (ARI) vs. DAL\nThis one is simple. The Cowboys are going to rout the Cardinals, and in a game where Arizona will be trailing the entire time, they will have no need for the run game and James Conner. Conner has not proven to be a true receiving back either, so unless he reaches the endzone on Sunday, I expect a dud from Conner after two solid weeks. Oh, and the Dallas rush defense has been top-five in the NFL the past two seasons, so if you had any last hesitation to start Conner, let that be the cherry on top.\n\nSTART: Breece Hall (NYJ) vs. NE\nBreece Hall was visibly upset last week after getting just four touches in a loss to Dallas, voicing his frustrations in a Tweet that he eventually deleted. The Jets\u2019 window to compete this season has plummeted drastically with Rodgers ruled out and the last thing they want is to make their stud running back unhappy. The Patriots gave up over 38 receiving yards per game to running backs last season and are ranked in the top 10 for FPPG allowed to RBs this season. Considering this, I expect Hall\u2019s touches to triple in a bounce-back game against the Patriots.\n\nSIT: Browns RBs (Ford and Hunt) vs. TEN\nFirst and foremost, prayers up to Nick Chubb after that horrific knee injury that removed him from the game on Monday. Jerome Ford relieved Chubb after his injury and looked phenomenal, finishing as the RB6 on the week and if it weren\u2019t for getting tripped up at the 1-yard line, he would\u2019ve finished as the RB1. However, in a very difficult matchup against the Titans who have been top-five in the fewest FPPG to RB both this season and last, I would steer away from Ford or Kareem Hunt, who the Browns just signed on Wednesday. While they seem enticing given the Chubb injury, keep the Browns RBs on your bench this week until they have a more favorable matchup and are more settled into the system.\n\nSnoozer: Jaylen Warren (PIT) @ LV\nIn Monday night\u2019s game against the Browns, Jaylen Warren looked like the better back in Pittsburgh. He had more acceleration, speed, and explosion than Najee Harris and while Harris outcarried and outrushed him, Warren exploded in the passing game, tallying 66 more receiving yards than Harris. Warren has proven to be the explosive runner in this backfield, and against the Raiders, who rank top 5 in FPPG allowed to RBs for both this season and last, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Warren sneaks into the endzone \u2013 and the top 10 RBs for the week.\n\nWide receiver\nSTART: Zay Flowers (BAL) vs. IND\nZay Flowers has looked like a human joystick in his first two NFL games, and if the Ravens utilize him correctly, we could be in for a Deebo Samuel 2.0 season from him. The Colts have given up the most FPPG to receivers this season and with Odell Beckham Jr. questionable for Sunday, I expect Flowers to tear apart the weak Colts secondary. With Anthony Richardson likely suiting up on Sunday, I think the Colts will be able to hang with the Ravens, forcing Lamar to throw the ball for the most of the game. With a very favorable matchup against the Colts, I anticipate to see Zay Flowers\u2019 breakout game.\n\nSIT: DeAndre Hopkins (TEN) @ CLE\nMany still believe that DeAndre Hopkins has the capability of dropping 15 fantasy points a game. Wake up, it\u2019s no longer 2018. DeAndre Hopkins is still a phenomenal wide receiver, don\u2019t get me wrong. But his days of being a viable fantasy starter are over, and the fact that over 50% of leagues are still starting him is beyond me. As I mentioned last week, the Titans aren\u2019t going to throw the ball more than 30 times every game like they did Week 1 when Hopkins had 13 targets. After busting last week with just five targets and 8 fantasy points, I expect another disappointing performance from Hopkins this week as he faces the Browns secondary which has been top-five is fewest FPPG to opposing WR each of the past two seasons.\n\nSTART: Elijah Moore (CLE) vs. TEN\nOn the other side of the ball, Elijah Moore got the second-most targets last week for the Browns after Chubb\u2019s injury, and I expect that to continue as the Browns adjust to their star running back\u2019s absence. The Browns face a Titans secondary that gave up the most FPPG to opposing WR last season and is continuing that trend again, already allowing the fifth most this season. With 16 targets already through the first two weeks, I expect a more pass-heavy approach from the Browns this week, yielding the potential for a big week from Moore.\n\nSIT: Michael Thomas (NO) @ GB\nMichael Thomas has returned as a reliable fantasy option this season now that he\u2019s healthy with Derek Carr under center, but with a tough matchup against the Packers, you might want to reconsider starting him this week. The Saints are 2-0 this season but have scored less than 21 points in each of their first two games, both against bottom 10 pass defenses. Traveling to Lambeau to now face the Packers, who were top 5 in least FPPG allowed to receivers last season, I expect Thomas and the entire Saints offense to struggle, coming back to reality after a flukey first two weeks.\n\nSnoozer: Drake London (ATL) @ DET\nDrake London had a huge bounce-back performance last week against a difficult Green Bay secondary after dropping a goose egg in Week 1. The Falcons have showed that they are going to rely heavily on the run in 2023, but in a probable shootout against the Lions, they will likely need to throw the ball in order to compete. The Lions have ranked top-five in most FPPG allowed to receivers each of the past two seasons, and after losing defenders CJ Gardner-Johnson and James Houston to injury over the weekend, the Lions defense should get shredded by London as long as Bijan Robinson doesn\u2019t take all of his touches (I do think Robinson finishes as RB1 this week \u2014 but he should be in everyone\u2019s starting lineup already).\n\nTight End\nSTART: Hayden Hurst (CAR) @ SEA\nAfter a down week last week against the best defense to opposing TEs, I expect a big bounceback spot from Hurst against the Seahawks who gave up the second most FPPG to TEs last season and have already given up the 6th most points this season. Rookie quarterback Bryce Young is questionable to suit up with an ankle sprain. If backup Andy Dalton makes his first start in a new system, I expect Hurst to continue in the safety blanket role he\u2019s held in the Panthers offense through Week 2, especially with head coach Frank Reich announcing Wednesday that the team would stick to their same offensive game plan regardless of the man under center.\n\nSIT: Kyle Pitts (ATL) @ DET\nI feel like this one is obvious but there\u2019s still thousands of people who are starting Pitts. In fact, he\u2019s starting in over 70% of ESPN leagues. While this guy has all the talent in the world, his situation couldn\u2019t be any worse, and last week we even saw Jonnu Smith out-target and nearly out-snap Pitts in their victory over the Packers. Even with a favorable matchup against the Lions who have given up the most FPPG to TE this season, I still don\u2019t have an ounce of trust in Pitts \u2014 the consistency just isn\u2019t there.\n\nSnoozer: Dalton Schultz (HOU) @ JAX\nAs previously mentioned, the Texans pass attack has been hard at work this season, and in a divisional matchup against Jacksonville, I expect Houston to continue trusting Stroud\u2019s arm. Schultz quietly had seven targets last week and with a favorable matchup against the Jaguars, who gave up the eighth-most FPPG to tight ends last season and are top 10 again to start this year, I anticipate a sneaky game from Schultz. While all the buzz will be around receivers Nico Collins and Tank Dell, don\u2019t be surprised if Schultz finds his way into the endzone and into the top 10 TEs of the week.\n\nWeek 2 results\nQB Start: Daniel Jones (30.74, QB1)\nSit: Dak Prescott (19.6, QB17)\nSnoozer: Mac Jones (13.74, QB24)\nRB Start: James Cook (19.9, RB11)\nStart: David Montgomery (12.4, RB21)\nSit: Cam Akers (0, RBN/A)\nSit: Joe Mixon (13.5, RB18)\nSnoozer: Tyler Allgeier (4.8, RB49)\nWR Start: Mike Williams (16.6, WR24)\nStart: Brandon Aiyuk (7.3, WR65)\nSit: DeAndre Hopkins (8.0, WR62)\nSit: Terry McLaurin (16.4, WR25)\nSnoozer: Michael Thomas (12.5, WR42)\nTE Start: Sam LaPorta (11.3, TE8)\nSit: Pat Freiermuth (1.2, TE51)\nSnoozer: Hunter Henry (17.2, TE2)\n```"}

(Photo by Ethan Thai)\n\nBy Qais Adawiya September 21, 2023 at  2:31 pm PDT\n\nAfter last week\u2019s bye, the Trojans are preparing to go on the road for the first time in 2023, as their 3-0 record will be put on the line against the 1-2 Arizona State Sun Devils. Heading into the bye, USC\u2019s potent offense was on full display against longtime rival Stanford, and USC looks to continue its stretch of historic offense against ASU on Saturday.\n\nThe Trojans did not look at last week as a bye, though, instead focusing on continuing the dominant play they have showcased to start the season. \u201cThe bye week we were still working. It was a bye week, not an off week,\u201d senior wide receiver Brenden Rice said.\n\nA large part of the team\u2019s success has been junior quarterback Caleb Williams\u2019 remarkable start. Coming off a year which saw him winning the Heisman Trophy, his coaches are still looking for him to improve. \u201c[Williams deep throws are] something we have wanted to work on ... it\u2019s been transferring over to gameday, something we will continue to be able to utilize,\u201d outside wide receivers coach Dennis Simmons said.\n\nCoaches were not shy to mention the incredible play of junior wide receiver Dorian Singer. Just three games into the year, Singer already has two scores, one-third of the touchdowns he had all last year. Singer has been a beneficiary of Williams\u2019 incredible elusive play. Singer\u2019s production and, more importantly, trust gained from his coaches and teammates has shown. \u201c[Singer] has done a great job of getting to his spot and understanding spacing \u2014 something that we work on several times a week. [Williams] has done a great job finding him,\u201d Simmons said.\n\nRedshirt senior wide receiver Tahj Washington\u2019s impact on the team has been felt. The senior\u2019s leadership has received high praise from fellow teammates. \u201cHe is ready whenever his name is called. He will do anything coach asks of him. He is such a selfless player,\u201d redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd said.\n\nFreshman wide receiver Duce Robinson\u2019 continues to impress in practice. Coaches and players have taken note of his progress, leading to more opportunities for playing. \u201cHe is going to be an animal. He is only going to get better. I see him doing great things this year because he is such a good player,\u201d Lloyd said.\n\nArizona State\u2019s defense has been a bright spot on an otherwise struggling team. With USC looking to keep pace with the other undefeated teams in the Pac-12, this matchup will surely provide a test for Williams and his team. \u201cThey have a great motor,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cEveryone flies to the ball. They have good size upfront. It\u2019s going to be a really fun game to play.\u201d\n\nAmid their second straight year starting 3-0, the Trojans are not satisfied, a credit to the high expectations the coaches routinely set. If last December is any reminder, it\u2019s to stay prepared. The heartbreaking loss to Utah in the Pac-12 Championship game hasn\u2019t deterred this resilient group.\n\nKickoff between the Trojans and Sun Devils is scheduled for 7 p.m. on Saturday at Mountain America Stadium in Tempe, Ariz.\n```"}

(Photo by Sarah Yoo)\n\nBy Alea Motwane, Tamara Almoayed, Natalia Osuna, and Lana Diab\nSeptember 21, 2023 at 2:00 pm PDT\n\nGet ready for a side of chaos with your coffee. Every Thursday through the month of September, Starbucks is offering its rewards members a buy one get one free deal (BOGO) for every fall beverage they purchase after 12 p.m. local time. On the first Thursday of this month the USC Village\u2019s Starbucks was mobbed by a crowd of customers taking advantage of the company\u2019s deal. Two employees said the Village store was the second busiest cafe-only Starbucks in the country that day.\n\nAn employee working at Starbucks on the busy Thursday said, \u201cpeople were literally standing on the chairs at Starbucks just to hopefully get a vantage point of their drink and maybe spot it.\u201d The Starbucks employees requested anonymity as they are not authorized to speak on behalf of the company. They provided photos and other documentation for Annenberg Media review.\n\nThe employees said that in one 30-minute time period, the store processed more than 200 transactions. \u201cPeople were pushing through each other, people were getting rude,\u201d one said. Another employee said that on the second week of the fall deal, \u201cwe heard that our sales for the week were upwards of over a hundred thousand. So over the course of the week, we had genuinely made, just our store, over $100,000.\u201d\n\nThe employees said the store keeps breaking records for California and that a manager congratulated them that day. Starbucks would not confirm that the Village Starbucks was the second busiest store on the first day of the fall deal. A representative told Annenberg Media that in the event any store achieved this milestone, there would not be any internal communications sent out recognizing it. As a publicly listed company, Starbucks also said that the only financial figures they release are through their quarterly earnings results.\n\n\u201cStarbucks is a staple in a lot of college students\u2019 lives, especially because caffeine intake is so important,\u201d said Emily Ley, a sophomore studying applied math. Some USC students believe the reason the Starbucks at the USC Village is so popular and busy is because of the lack of sleep among college students, so they need the caffeine to \u201ckick in,\u201d according to Christina Guerrero, a junior studying psychology at USC.\n\n\u201cStarbucks is more accessible,\u201d said Guerrero. \u201cPersonally I like Starbucks better than Dunkin. It\u2019s stronger. I\u2019ve only had [Dulce] once, there\u2019s more options at Starbucks than there are at other places.\u201d Maddy Brown, a junior studying journalism, said, \u201cIf you\u2019re living in the USC Village, why would you go off campus to get Starbucks. It\u2019s more affordable than Dulce so I can see why they\u2019re picking Starbucks over that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso it\u2019s a college campus so everyone can just walk to it because it\u2019s so easy and close,\u201d Ley said. Katie Jung, a sophomore studying fine arts, said, \u201cThere\u2019s like a thousand students and we all just go to the same one so that\u2019s probably why [Starbucks at the USC Village] is so busy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think [Starbucks] is just so convenient for students,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThey need their sugary coffee drinks to get through the day. Especially with the announcement of the two fall drinks - the buy one get one free - students just need to go and get their coffee, and they don\u2019t have a lot of other convenient places to go.\u201d\n\nThere also is a smaller location on campus, but the Starbucks located at the USC Village proves to be the most easily accessible source of caffeine for most USC students. \u201cYou have USC students coming in here, but it\u2019s also open to the public,\u201d said senior Faith Smith. \u201cPeople who work in the University Park area come here for grocery shopping and to run errands, so I think that\u2019s probably why they get a wave of a lot of people.\u201d\n\nBut the consequence of the BOGO free deal at the USC Village Starbucks was absolute chaos. \u201cI actually ended up never getting my drink,\u201d said Shei Marcelline, a graduate student studying journalism who was at the USC Village Starbucks on Sept. 7. \u201cI waited, I shuffled through the 60 people just to look at all the names and didn\u2019t see mine. And you know, that\u2019s my break. So I had class and was like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna leave coffeeless, but it\u2019s okay.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough she almost never goes to Starbucks when off campus, Marcelline said she frequents the USC Starbucks locations about three times a week due to its convenience and reliability. There were about 10 workers that day, eight behind the counter and two handing out drinks, said Marcelline. Guerrero, who works at another store in the Village, said, \u201cThe other day I was working and it was Thursday and one of our co-workers waited over an hour for his coffee - because of the deal on Thursdays.\u201d\n\nFor the entire month, Starbucks goers can enjoy a variety of their specialty seasonal drinks such as the famous Pumpkin Spice Latte, Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai Latte, and Iced Apple Shaken Oatmilk Shaken Espresso.\n```"}

In this legally gray area, even if convicted on such grounds, the final verdict may not solely rest in the courtroom, but could also be influenced by the broader political landscape.\n\nThe question of Trump\u2019s eligibility for a second term in office isn\u2019t just about laws\u2014 it\u2019s about who has the power to interpret or even change them.\n\nCan Trump even be on the ballot?\n\nTrump\u2019s legal woes are one thing; his ballot eligibility is another. The question surrounding the Jan. 6 insurrection isn\u2019t just about indictment charges\u2014 it\u2019s about Constitutional interpretation, too.\n\nThis unprecedented case evokes the 14th Amendment, which some scholars, including Professors William Baude of the University of Chicago and Mike Paulsen of St. Thomas University, say automatically disbars former President Trump for running for reelection due to his alleged actions in the raid of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe 14th Amendment states that no one can hold government office if they\u2019ve taken an oath to support the U.S. Constitution and then \u201cengaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to enemies thereof.\u201d\n\nWhile the Supreme Court claims to uphold the original intent of such clauses, it remains undetermined whether they would disqualify a presidential candidate based on this interpretation.\n\nNotably, Trump appointed three of the five conservative justices currently sitting on the Supreme Court during his presidential term, raising questions about impartiality when interpreting the 14th Amendment in this particular context.\n\nEspecially as it relates to the definition of \u201cinsurrection\u201d and his alleged role in inciting the violent actions that took place.\n\nMcGinnis argues the term \u201cinsurrection\u201d laid forth in the 14th Amendment implies a direct attempt to overthrow the American government, whereas University of Pennsylvania Professor Kermit Roosevelt suggests that even trying to overturn an election falls under the definition.\n\nAs Trump stares down potential conviction for his role on Jan. 6, 2021, Professor Kimberly Wehle of Baltimore Law School points out in The Atlantic that one criminal law Special Counsel Jack Smith might use to charge him could specifically bar Trump from future office.\n\nBut even if he were convicted of an insurrection-related charge, accountability under the law would require legislative majority, along with Republican action.\n\nCan he serve a second term after being convicted?\n\nThe short answer: yes, but it\u2019s complicated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re venturing toward unprecedented territory as it relates to American jurisprudence,\u201d said McGinnis. \u201cBut the path of Trump\u2019s potential reelection, despite a criminal conviction, is not only legally feasible, but currently constitutionally sanctioned.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Constitution outlines three basic eligibility requirements: the candidate must be a natural born citizen, at least 35 years old and a U.S. resident for at least 14 years.\n\nBut, there is no mention of criminal convictions that could disqualify an American from running for or even serving as president.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution is unambiguous about the qualifications for a U.S. presidential candidate. It would necessitate a constitutional amendment to preclude Trump from reentering office,\u201d said McGinnis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s uncharted territory, but the Constitution and U.S. law, as I understand it, wouldn\u2019t disqualify him,\u201d said Daniel Farber, professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nRoosevelt added, \u201cif the electorate wishes to vote for former president Trump in 2024, that is their constitutional right.\u201d\n\nRoosevelt said history can also provide instructive precedents. He noted the case of Eugene Debs, a Socialist party candidate, who ran for president from behind bars in 1920.\n\nRoosevelt says this historical precedent suggests the American political landscape has dealt with similarly complex legal and ethical questions, making the notion of a legally embattled candidate like Trump not without some basis in history.\n\nIf Trump were elected while still facing criminal charges, these cases might be deferred until he leaves office, according to Farber.\n\nHe could also direct the Justice Department to dismiss federal cases against him, which requires the attorney general\u2019s support.\n\nOn the state level, however, Roosevelt said that a state government cannot obstruct or frustrate federal functions.\n\nWhile it remains unclear, he said it\u2019s likely that Trump would see release from state incarceration.\n\n\u201cState governments can\u2019t interfere with federal government functions, so as it stands, state incarceration likely wouldn\u2019t prevent Trump from assuming office again,\u201d said Roosevelt.\n\nYet, legal opinions differ around self-pardoning.\n\nMcGinnis and Farber believe that while presidents can pardon those affiliated, the question of self-pardoning remains unresolved.\n\nRoosevelt, however, suggests that a self-pardon may be possible, viewing pardoning as an executive action, rather than judicial.\n\n\u201cIn terms of federal charges, there\u2019s some division of opinion among scholars. My own view is that it would be absurd for someone to have the power to pardon their own crimes,\u201d Farber said.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Amanda Murphy, Sarah Arencibia, Heather Mimikos, Jakob Tatoy, and Ruben Flores\nSeptember 21, 2023 at 12:11 pm PDT\n\nUSC football defended its suspension of reporter Luca Evans on Wednesday, citing \u201cmultiple policy violations,\u201d but would not elaborate as to which or how many policies had been violated. Evans, a beat reporter for the Orange County Register and Southern California News Group, had his media access suspended for two weeks from the USC football team after publishing a story that sourced quotes outside media availability, sparking outrage from other members of the media.\n\nEvans reported that Braylan Shelby asked a \u201cvisibly nervous\u201d Quentin Joyner \u201cdid they tell you what to say?\u201d before Joyner made his first media appearance. USC head football coach Lincoln Riley took issue with Evans\u2019 reporting of an overheard conversation between student athletes Joyner and Shelby, and addressed the suspension at a press conference earlier this week.\n\n\u201cMy first job is not to the media, it\u2019s not to the fans, it\u2019s not to anybody else. It\u2019s to protecting our players, that is first and foremost,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThere were multiple policies broken - I felt like it was far enough where we needed to act.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed for further clarification, Riley stated that he would \u201cnot go into specifics\u201d of which policies were violated by Evans. Katie Ryan, director of football communications at USC, reiterated on Wednesday to Annenberg Media that the decision to suspend Evans was the result of \u201cmultiple policy violations.\u201d Ryan did not clarify what specific policies were violated, but instead referred back to Riley\u2019s statements.\n\nAccording to the Orange County Register, Ryan brought up concerns about Evans to SCNG editors earlier this season. These concerns included \u201casking a question when a press conference had been concluded and talking to players and coaches in areas on campus that weren\u2019t designated as media availabilities.\u201d\n\nEvans was approved to cover USC football under the media credentials policy, as detailed on the USC athletics website. The policies outline certain restrictions on when and how reporters can speak to student-athletes, staff, and coaches.\n\n\u201cUsually, if you\u2019re covering a college football team for a season, you get a season credential,\u201d said Alan Abrahamson, a USC Journalism professor with experience in sports journalism. \u201cIf you want to cover a game, you get a special credential for the game. You have to apply for the credential, and part of that credential says you will abide by the guidelines and policies of the rules for covering that game that are set forth as part of the application process.\u201d\n\nRyan said that the policies are designed \u201cto protect the wellbeing of our student athletes,\u201d and the suspension is a step in ensuring that safety. The athletics website outlines that USC has the right to limit, suspend or terminate media credentials at any time.\n\n\u201cWhat I do know is that a private institution is allowed to set its own guidelines and rules for things that are a privilege to cover,\u201d said Christina Bellantoni, the director of the USC Annenberg Media Center. \u201cThat policy does not say if you hear something, you may not report on it, right? That is up for interpretation.\u201d\n\n\u201c[What] is peculiar to college athletics is the amount of power that individual coaches have and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re running into at USC,\u201d said Jim Alexander, a sports columnist at the OC Register who has covered sports in Southern California for five decades. \u201cWhat I see instead is coaches, and it\u2019s not just Lincoln, because its coaches throughout the country, figure that they can set this up, they can have absolute control.\u201d\n\nDuring the press conference, Riley said that the program \u201clooks forward to welcoming back\u201d Evans once the suspension ends. Evans made a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, reflecting his views on the situation.\n\n\u201cI will be continuing to cover the program as best I possibly can, and [I] have some exciting stores in the works,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI appreciate the support from members of the media, and [I] am determined to continue to tell engaging stories that capture these athletes as people.\u201d\n\nUSC football as an institution is a nationally recognized brand that acts as an important aspect of the university\u2019s culture and financial focus. Part of the intrigue around the program is how, despite the school setting, its run and treated similarly to professional sports leagues, including its relationship to reporters.\n\n\u201cSports writing, sports journalism is a relationship business,\u201d Abrahamson said. \u201cIf you\u2019re quoting a player on the team, or you\u2019re going to tell you\u2019re doing the story, it\u2019s incumbent upon the reporter to let people know what\u2019s going on before they see print so people don\u2019t feel sandbagged.\u201d\n\nFollowing the suspension, numerous members of the media came out in support of Evans saying that the decision was an overreaction to the situation. They called for an immediate rescinding of the suspension.\n\n\u201cWhen it happens to one, you know, the rest of us have to take note,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBecause if it happens to them, it could happen to you, it could happen to me, it could happen to anybody, depending on the mood that the coach is in at a given time.\u201d \n```"}

After five sets with paper thin margins, USC bested its Southern California counterpart by claiming victories in the second, fourth and fifth sets of the matchup.\n\n\u201cI thought it was two teams that were trying really hard and making a lot of really unforced, uncharacteristic errors by both squads,\u201d head coach Brad Keller said. \u201cIt was a little bit more ugly volleyball tonight but you have to sometimes try to win ugly and try to figure out ways to score points at the most inopportune times and we just got two more than they did tonight.\u201d\n\nKeller is someone who has experienced this rivalry on both sides of the net. Hired in February, 2020, Keller has led the Trojans to five wins in seven total matchups against the Bruins, with an overall record of 51-38 since his arrival. The Trojans have four consecutive wins over the Bruins, their longest such streak since 11 consecutive wins over the Bruins spanning from 2001 to 2005.\n\nGraduate setter Emily Fitzner delivered the final block of the game, earning the Trojans a 17-15 victory in the fifth and final set. \u201cI felt very confident because of my teammates and I know that they\u2019ve been in this position before, so I was able to look up to them and see from their past experiences of playing a rivalry game like this,\u201d Fitzner said.\n\nDespite losing the first set, the Trojans commanded the second set ultimately winning 25-20. The third set saw momentum shift back in favor of the Bruins, with UCLA taking it 25-23. After regrouping as a team, USC fought back to win the next two sets 25-17 and 17-15.\n\nFreshman outside hitter London Wijay led the team with 23 kills, 10 digs and one block. As one of the newest additions to the Trojan lineup, Wijay has already made a name for herself after recently being selected as Pac-12 Freshman of the Week. \u201cI just feel like they are already my family, it\u2019s so nice. I\u2019ve played on different teams before and I\u2019ve just never felt this family atmosphere,\u201d Wijay said. \u201cThey are just so patient with me and I really enjoy playing on this team.\u201d\n\nAs USC\u2019s first Pac-12 game of the season, Trojans entered the game with a 6-4 non-conference record and a five game win streak under their belt. With the friction of the rivalry, every point was a battle. The crowd in Pauley Pavilion was relentless in their support for the Bruins, yet the Trojans kept a clear mind throughout the noise.\n\n\u201cEverything is a learning opportunity,\u201d Keller said. \u201cWhen you start realizing that it\u2019s just noise and you start realizing you have a job to do and focusing on it, the more you are in those types of environments the more comfortable you are going to get.\u201d\n\nThe fourth set saw both teams match each other kill-for-kill and block-for-block. Neither team had more than a two point lead for the majority of the fourth set until Trojans ran away with the fourth set win 25-17. This was the largest deficit for either team throughout the match.\n\nThe match point needed for the Bruins to win the fifth set was interrupted by a kill from senior outside hitter Skylar Fields. Fields collected 18 kills Wednesday night on the way to a Trojan triumph.\n\nUSC will continue Pac-12 play at the Galen Center Sunday, September 24, against Oregon State. Looking for a seventh consecutive win, USC women\u2019s volleyball will compete in the Pac-12 for one last season.\n\n\u201cUCLA and USC need to be good,\u201d Keller said. \u201cWe need to be ranked. We need to be up there in the top 10 in the country so we bring volleyball a little bit back to L.A. I think it\u2019s been lost for a minute so we gotta continue to get better.\u201d```"}

A \u201cCelebration of Flight\u2019' is hosted before each match where LAFC\u2019s mascot, a falcon, flies around the stadium at 120 mph. According to the LAFC website, this ritual symbolizes LAFC and their playing style: \u201cfast, aggressive and relentless.\u201d\n\nWilliams, the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner, is not the first high-profile figure to embrace the role of Honorary Falconer for LAFC. Celebrities including Meghan Trainor and Owen Wilson have participated in the pre-match ceremony, as well as LAFC Co-Owners Will Ferrell and Mia Hamm Garciaparra.\n\nDuring Williams\u2019 appearance as falconer, he handled one of three LAFC falcons, this one being named Olly. According to the LAFC website, Olly is a Shaheen falcon who is \u201csupremely confident and loves being around people.\u201d Olly holds the LAFC speed record at 210 mph.\n\nThe quarterback was Honorary Falconer at the cross-town rivalry game, in which LAFC was victorious, winning 4-2.

Miknuk gave Williams a ten out of ten score in bird handling, which will come in handy later this season as the Trojans take on Oregon, where Williams can hopefully handle the Ducks as well.\n```"}

Galaxy on Saturday. Photo by Ben Cohen.\n\nBy Jack Hallinan September 21, 2023 at 11:25 am PDT\n\nBouanga rules the night\n\nLAFC needed this win more than it showed in the standings. And the club secured it with ease. Regardless of Saturday night\u2019s result, LAFC was going to qualify for the playoffs. It had been one of MLS\u2019 best teams all season and looked like a threat to repeat as MLS Cup champions. But going into El Tr\u00e1fico, the team endured a concerning three-game slide of losses, including an embarrassing 3-1 loss at the hands of Messi and Friends.\n\nThe LA Galaxy, on the other hand, hadn\u2019t lost for four matches and were looking to surge into the playoffs. With a 4-2 win, LAFC restored this season\u2019s natural order in Los Angeles. As we\u2019ve typically seen from the black and gold, they dominated the match without dominating the ball.\n\nNew signing Cristian Olivera, a 21-year-old Uruguayan right winger, started his first match for the club and offered speed and dribbling in behind, playing a similar role to Bouanga\u2019s on the left side. Carlos Vela started as the nominal striker, but would frequently drop deeper to receive the ball in front of the Galaxy\u2019s centerbacks and play vertical passes to Bouanga or Olivera.\n\nWhile LAFC\u2019s offensive structure worked and Olivera shined in his full debut, the club\u2019s midfield was as chaotic as usual. LAFC only maintained 38% possession during the match \u2014 at home, it should be said \u2014 but still outshot the Galaxy 14-to-5.\n\nSpanish midfielder Ilie S\u00e1nchez sat just in front of LAFC\u2019s centerbacks to help distribute the ball while the 22-year-old Mateusz Bogusz pushed forward relentlessly. In LAFC\u2019s formation, Bogusz looks like a No. 8, but in attack, he looks much more like a No. 10, hovering around the box while trying to play deadly balls to Bouanga and company.\n\nKellyn Acosta, meanwhile, didn\u2019t make much of an impact on the game. He played the full 90 minutes and only attempted 17 passes, just over half of Bogusz\u2019s 32. But head coach Steve Cherundolo doesn\u2019t instruct his team to keep possession for possession\u2019s sake. He wants his players to get the ball forward quickly in order to catch the opposing defense off guard. And that they did.\n\nLAFC opened the scoring in the 24th minute when Vela slid a ball into left back Diego Palacios, who crossed it quickly onto the head of an unmarked Bouanga. It was a slick move that also gave the Gabonese forward his first MLS goal since July 8 against San Jose.\n\nBouanga scored in the Leagues Cup, but had gone on a five-game MLS drought. The Galaxy then gave LAFC a taste of its own medicine, catching LAFC off guard right from the restart. A quick counterrack led to Billy Sharp\u2019s third MLS goal in five games, so I suppose I owe him another apology!\n\nIn all seriousness, it was an impressive sequence from the Galaxy, who immediately forced LAFC back into its high-risk, high-reward style. It only took another eight minutes for Ryan Hollingshead to restore LAFC\u2019s lead with a tricky, low long shot into the bottom right corner.\n\nThe Galaxy\u2019s Maya Yoshida equalized for the Carson club again, but ultimately LAFC\u2019s attack just outpaced its opponents, as Bouanga and substitute Timothy Tillman scored their team\u2019s third and fourth.\n\nThe fourth goal came from a controversial sequence in which LAFC striker Mario Gonz\u00e1lez committed a foul shortly before LAFC won possession, but the referee gave a questionable advantage to the Galaxy.\n\nThe performance should serve as a huge boost to Bouanga, who now co-leads the MLS in goals with 14, alongside Nashville\u2019s Hany Mukhtar and Atlanta\u2019s Georgios Giakoumakis. Bouanga now has six matches to secure the MLS Golden Boot award, although it won\u2019t be easy, as five of the six teams he\u2019ll play currently occupy a playoff place.\n\nHe remains a sleeper MVP candidate as well, with 19 goal contributions (which includes assists), which is tied for fourth in MLS. Earning a win in goalkeeper, Maxime Cr\u00e9peau\u2019s first start for LAFC in about ten months should also be a huge boost to the squad.\n\nThe Canadian broke his leg in the MLS Cup final last season against the Philadelphia Union and missed the World Cup as a result, but he has battled back with impressive dedication. While John McCarthy has held up well as a starter in Cr\u00e9peau\u2019s place, it\u2019s clear that Cr\u00e9peau commands great respect among his teammates and will probably be the first-choice keeper for the rest of the season.\n\nHollingshead had only positive things to say about Cr\u00e9peau in the post-match press conference. \u201cWe might have to be here for a half hour to let me talk about Max Cr\u00e9peau,\u201d Hollingshead said. \u201cThis guy is unbelievable in every sense of the word. His work ethic, his professionalism, ... there\u2019s not an ounce of ego.\u201d\n\nBeyond his mentality, Hollingshead praised Cr\u00e9peau\u2019s ability to play the ball with his feet and his natural command of the penalty area. \u201cThis guy\u2019s one of my favorite teammates I\u2019ve ever played with,\u201d the 32-year-old Hollingshead said.\n\nReviewing the team\u2019s recent performances and its result against the Galaxy, Cherundolo wasn\u2019t worried about LAFC\u2019s ability to bounce back. \u201cI get to see the guys everyday,\u201d Cherundolo said, \u201cand that has a calming effect. They understand, they do it, they apply it. ... These are human beings, a lot going on, and sometimes it doesn\u2019t click during games.\u201d\n\nBut ultimately, Cherundolo said he knew the losses were just a bump in the road. \u201cIt\u2019s like riding a bike. The qualities that the players have, they don\u2019t go away. Sometimes you get a flat tire, but it\u2019s easy to fix,\u201d Cherundolo said.\n\nPuig fails to show up\n\nI\u2019ve been singing Riqui Puig\u2019s praises in recent columns, but I also have to hold myself accountable when it doesn\u2019t go so well. Blaming Puig for a loss when his whole team struggled would be unfair. But it\u2019s also unfair that Galaxy head coach Greg Vanney places his team\u2019s entire creative burden on Puig\u2019s shoulders.\n\nSo when the La Masia graduate repeatedly couldn\u2019t unlock the LAFC defense, it stuck out like a sore thumb. LAFC\u2019s midfielders swarmed Puig at every opportunity. In particular, LAFC\u2019s S\u00e1nchez screened Puig well and allowed time for his teammates to provide help defense in dangerous areas.\n\nTo be clear, Puig still had an extraordinary number of touches. He completed 74 of 84 attempted passes and tallied two successful dribbles from four take-ons. It\u2019s just that he wasn\u2019t able to turn those touches into real offense.\n\nPuig took only one shot all match \u2014 a blocked free kick in the 90th minute \u2014 and accumulated just 0.03 expected assists in shots he set up for teammates. When Puig has space to operate, no defense is safe, but LAFC\u2019s defensive structure stayed diligent and didn\u2019t present him that space.\n\n\u201cIf you can shut the middle of the park down,\u201d Cherundolo said, \u201cyou have a good chance of beating this team.\u201d Cherundolo didn\u2019t want to single Puig out by name, but it\u2019s clear who he was referring to, and LAFC executed that plan with near-perfection.\n\nAngel City stutter in Chicago\n\nThe unbeaten streak remains intact, but Angel City needed three points from a match it left with just one. Coming off two straight wins since the World Cup, Angel City has been one of the NWSL\u2019s most consistent teams all summer, while the Chicago Red Stars plummeted to the bottom of the table.\n\nThe Red Stars, however, had a recent uptick in form themselves, entering the ACFC game with a 2-0 win against the Washington Spirit and 1-1 draw against the fourth-place North Carolina Courage. That being said, Angel City should have won this match.\n\nWith 13 shots to Chicago\u2019s 10 and five \u201cbig chances,\u201d as defined by FotMob, to the Red Stars\u2019 three, head coach Becki Tweed\u2019s team created enough chances to secure the victory.\n\nAngel City opened the scoring through captain Ali Riley in the 39th minute. Riley capitalized on a second-chance opportunity in the box after Chicago goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher made a point-blank save from an Amandine Henry header.\n\nAva Cook equalized for Chicago in the 69th minute and Angel City showed strong resolve to take the lead again two minutes later through Jun Endo. But poor individual defending from Mary Alice Vignola gifted Cheyna Matthews a golden opportunity to pull Chicago even again, an opportunity she did not refuse.\n\nWhat should frustrate Angel City fans about this match is that the mistakes Tweed\u2019s squad made seemed like they had been mostly stamped out over the summer. Tweed appeared to instill her team with greater resolve, discipline and focus, but all those attributes seemed lacking in Chicago\u2019s goals, which both came from poor one-on-one defending.\n\nRegardless, Tweed can keep her unbeaten record and Angel City will continue its playoff push with just three matches left in the season.\n\nNext games: LAFC: Saturday, Sept. 23 vs. Philadelphia Union (away) Angel City: Monday, Oct. 2 vs. Orlando Pride (home) LA Galaxy: Sunday, Sept. 24 vs. Austin FC (away)\n\n\u201cSoCal Soccer Spotlight\u201d is a column by Jack Hallinan about the professional soccer landscape in Los Angeles.\n```"}

And once again, Nacua shined, catching 15 passes for 147 yards. Through his first two career NFL games, Nacua has 266 receiving yards on 25 receptions \u2014 the most receptions by a player in his first two games in league history.\n\nThis time four years ago, Nacua was also getting a lot of hype as a college football recruit, ranked as a four-star and the number 115 overall player in the class of 2019 (On3). Nacua committed to play college football at the University of Washington. But his time in Seattle did not go as planned. In two seasons with the Huskies, he caught just 16 passes for 318 yards and three touchdowns. Looking for a fresh start, he entered the NCAA Transfer Portal and returned to play for his hometown team, the BYU Cougars.\n\nAt BYU, Nacua was finally able to make a major impact on the field. In two seasons with the Cougars, Nacua caught 91 passes for 1430 yards and 11 touchdowns. Despite the strong conclusion to his college career, Nacua was not seen as a high-end prospect in the 2023 NFL Draft. The Rams selected him in the 5th round of the draft with the 177th overall pick. He was the 20th of 33 receivers selected.\n\nAfter a strong training camp, however, Nacua got his shot when the Rams placed Kupp on injured reserve to begin the season. And through two games, he has more than made the most of that shot. The NFL rookie record for most receptions in a season currently belongs to Ja\u2019Marr Chase, who caught 81 passes as a rookie with the Cincinnati Bengals in 2021. Through just two games, Nacua is already more than 30% of the way to breaking that record.\n\nWith Kupp once again out this coming week, Nacua will have another shot to continue his hot start. With a nationally-televised Monday Night Football trip to Cincinnati to take on Chase and the Bengals on deck, the nation will be watching as the Rams\u2019 young star continues to shine.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\n\nBy Kyle Frankel\nSeptember 20, 2023 at 11:24 pm PDT\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d is a column by Kyle Frankel about fantasy football.\n\nTwo weeks is all it took for the injury monster to start tormenting football fans and fantasy managers alike. As I expressed last week, Aaron Rodgers\u2019 torn achilles just four snaps into his career as a Jet was an especially gut-wrenching experience for Gang Green\u2019s faithful, such as myself. Other than that, though, Week 1 largely saw the league\u2019s star players emerge unscathed, at least of major season-altering ailments. The same can\u2019t be said about Week 2, as multiple ride-or-die superstars went down with injuries that could derail both NFL and fantasy franchises alike.\n\nThe headliner was of course the events that transpired in Pittsburgh on the Monday Night Football doubleheader. Browns running back Nick Chubb took an inside handoff with goal-to-go less than a minute into the second quarter. Steelers safety Minkah Fitzpatrick dove in to make the tackle, connecting with Chubb\u2019s left knee and resulting in the gruesome injury that has now officially ended the Cleveland star\u2019s season.\n\nAmong the other casualties was Giants running back Saquon Barkley, who suffered a sprained ankle and is expected to be out-of-action for the next three weeks. His ailment is of course significantly less severe than Chubb\u2019s, but highly impactful in the football world nonetheless.\n\nIf you were relying on these guys, or anyone else whose health may be up in the air, to carry you to fantasy football glory this season, I offer my deepest condolences. Now that that\u2019s out of the way, it\u2019s time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and to put in the work to overcome these setbacks, starting with reading this column.\n\nRunning Back Replacements\n\nJust as Nick Chubb\u2019s unfortunate injury was the main story of the week in fantasy football, his backup is this week\u2019s hottest waiver wire target. After Chubb left the game, Browns RB Jerome Ford took over in Cleveland\u2019s backfield, dominating the touches. The run-first Browns did not shy away from their style of play when their workhouse back was out of the picture. Instead they fed Ford, who took his 16 carries for 106 yards. It was a good sign that he got involved in the receiving game as well, catching three of his four targets for 25 yards and a touchdown. All this summed up to a stellar 24.1 PPR points that was largely wasted out on leagues\u2019 waivers.\n\nCleveland brought in another veteran rusher to alleviate some stress, signing former Browns RB Kareem Hunt to a one-year deal Wednesday morning, but Ford\u2019s RB2 value in fantasy should hold. Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski has stated that the plan is for Ford to be the team\u2019s featured back going forward. As we saw Monday Night, the Browns\u2019 identity as a run-first offense should not change no matter who\u2019s taking the handoffs.\n\nFord is currently rostered in just 9.5% of ESPN leagues at the time of writing. That won\u2019t hold by the time you see this. If he\u2019s still out there, scoop him up ASAP.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for more of a short-term solution at the running back position (that\u2019s you, Saquon owners), look no further than Zack Moss. With Jonathan Taylor out of action until at least Week 5 on the PUP list, the Colts backfield has largely been a mystery as to who would play the lead role. We got that answer on Sunday, as Moss was in control of Indianapolis\u2019 rushing attack all game long. Moss took 18 carries for 88 yards and score, and he snagged all four of his targets for a moderate 19 yards.\n\nNot only is Moss secured as a solid fantasy starter for the next two games, but his reign within the Colts\u2019 depth chart could last longer. Taylor and the team still are not on very good terms, and it is a real possibility that he does not play for the Colts this season, whether that be the result of a trade or simply a healthy scratch. Further, dual-threat quarterback Anthony Richardson is currently in concussion protocol and could miss this weekend\u2019s game. If he does not play, Moss will have even more touches and should receive every goal line opportunity.\n\nHe\u2019s rostered in 32.3% of leagues at the time of writing. That will spike, but many owners will lay off of him simply due to the \u201cimminent\u201d Jonathan Taylor effect.\n\nCan Garrett Wilson Survive in the Post-Rodgers Era?\n\nTo keep with the theme of injuries, what can be expected of the Jets offense without the future hall-of-famer under-center? Even though Zach Wilson played just about the entire game back on opening night, we got our first full taste of this Wilson-led team on Sunday in Dallas. It was not pretty, as Micah Parsons and the Dallas D-Line manhandled the Jets offensive front, pressuring Wilson on what felt like every play.\n\nAs a Jets fan I\u2019m conditioned to be a pessimist, but I\u2019ll be nice and give No. 2 some credit. Head coach Robert Saleh is right, he has gotten better. His footwork has improved, he looks a little more comfortable at settling in the pocket and making confident throws. However, he is still a bad starting quarterback. I\u2019d be thrilled if he proved me wrong, but it\u2019s just the truth. He misses too many easy throws, and his poor accuracy too often turns what could have been huge plays into average (or even negative) ones.\n\nWith him at the helm, the outlook for the Jets offense looks very different than if Rodgers was slinging it. The impact is largest for Jets wide receiver Garrett Wilson. The reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year was poised for a massive season. Unfortunately, Rodgers\u2019 absence likely takes him from a possible top-five receiver (in both fantasy and real life), to maybe a top-20 guy.\n\nThe upside is definitely still there, as he received a team-leading eight targets in Dallas. But he only reeled in two of those passes for 83 yards, one of which being the slant he took 68 yards to the house. While he will be the Jets clear-cut WR1, he likely won\u2019t have big plays like that to bail him out every week. He\u2019ll definitely still explode for insane weeks, but his quarterback cannot effectively get the ball to his receivers, which means Wilson will also have weeks where you wish you did not even start him.\n\nIf you can still get top-end value for him, trade him immediately. Make sure you don\u2019t do anything too crazy, though. He went from a bonafide fantasy WR1 to a WR2 in most leagues. Treat him as such and don\u2019t overreact.\n\nThe injury bug comes for most teams eventually, so coming from someone who\u2019s already bit the dust, if your squad is still healthy, make sure to enjoy it while it lasts.\n\n\u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}

How does it affect USC\u2019s ranking?\n\nStudents walk past the Tommy Trojan statue at USC on Sept. 12. (Photo by Sangmin Kim)\n\nBy Lifan Zhang\nSeptember 20, 2023 at 7:40 pm PDT\n\nUSC is ranked 28th in the latest U.S.News&World Report university rankings, three places lower than last year. Some USC students believe the slight drop in the ranking is not a big deal. Junior Jon Dekker doesn\u2019t think dropping three spots will negatively impact USC\u2019s reputation.\n\nJon Dekker: I mean, I think it means a little for sure. If it\u2019s a drop within three or four places, then I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll really mean that much in terms of, you know, the eyes of employers. Um, so overall, you know, slight drops, I don\u2019t think it would matter that much.I mean, you know, obviously still has tremendous reach in terms of its alumni program and other programs to international reach. So ultimately, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll matter much.\n\nHayley Block is a junior at USC. She believes the rankings don\u2019t affect the prestige and reputation of the university either.\n\nHayley Block: I mean I don\u2019t really care. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s based on. The alumni is very like there\u2019s a lot of positive, uh, I guess, connotations around it. Um, I don\u2019t know, when you tell somebody you go to USC, they\u2019re like, Oh wow, that\u2019s really good. I still think the prestige and the reputation is still there.\n\nHowever some students are not clear about how U.S. News determines the rankings or what specific changes happened to the methodology this year. Tatiana Melguizo is a professor at the USC Rossier School of Education.\n\nTatiana Melguizo: The clue is that there has been a lot of pushback against the old rankings because you are just valuing that these institutions are very selective and they select the best students that they will graduate no matter what. And they would take the best faculty that would mostly be focusing on research instead of teaching. So the rankings change in order for there to be a lot of push towards these changes.\n\nProfessor Melguizo says this year, U.S. News updated the criteria for calculating university scores. They introduced a new metric accounting for the graduation rates of first-generation college students. The weighting for graduation rate performance and the student-faculty ratio were both increased, as was the emphasis on the graduation rates for Pell Grant recipients, who are students receiving federal financial aid due to low-income backgrounds.\n\nTatiana Melguizo: So what I think happens is that they are trying to find indirect measures of whether the students a, let\u2019s say that you come from a family that was like at the median, a income average in the U.S. and then they want to see if they can estimate their earnings and they can abstract the cost of location. And they want to see if indeed getting that degree translated into higher earnings and potential increase in the socioeconomic structure of that fund. What I would emphasize is that the rankings change in order to identify whether the institution is really bringing talent and providing the education and support for these students to graduate on time, get a job and are not drowning in debt.\n\nProfessor Melguizo believes the change in U.S. News\u2019 ranking method and USC\u2019s drop in rankings this year should prompt USC to think about how to better support its students.\n\nTatiana Melguizo: My hope is that USC, instead of trying to become more selective and select less students, they\u2019re going to be more mindful and they\u2019re going to take advantage of the talent of, you know, Pell eligible students and really create the conditions to increase the number of students that are admitted and to support them so they graduate on time. They have outcomes that are recognized in the job market and that they are in the USC, serving as an engine of opportunity instead of an engine of sustaining privilege.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Lifan Zhang.\n```"}

Executive Director of Communications at USC Health, Minnie Ho shares insight on ways to battle the upcoming flu season.\n\nMinnie Ho: The recommendation is for all USC faculty, staff and students to get their flu shots and optimally to get vaccinated in the September and October timeframe right before November one. So everyone is well protected against respiratory season illnesses like flu.\n\nWith November 1st around the corner it is important to learn the repercussions of skipping out on the Flu shot this season. Ho: Some experts are predicting a what has been called a triple-demick, which is a combination of illnesses, respiratory illnesses that can include both flu, COVID 19 and RSV, which is also another respiratory illness.\n\nBattling the triple-demic can seem difficult, but following Ho\u2019s advice can limit the spread of these illnesses. Ho: Staying home if you are sick, that\u2019s one of the more important things you can do if you have symptoms. And until you can figure out what\u2019s going on, stay home. We also have COVID tests, the antigen kits available throughout the campuses for pick up. These are available at the USC bookstores, at the customer service centers in USC Housing, and they\u2019re also available at the student health centers.\n\nMany students also expressed the importance of getting vaccinated. Vishnu Reddy, a junior majoring in Journalism, says that getting vaccinated helps keep immunocompromised students safe. Vishnu Reddy: There\u2019s a lot of people out there who are immunocompromised and cannot maybe get their own flu shots. It\u2019s important that we all do our part.\n\nAvery Lord, a freshman, also suggested that other students should do their part in keeping each other safe. Avery Lord: Everyone\u2019s in such close tight quarters stuff spreads super easily. So having this event for free can really help promote student health and diseases like that, especially for people who are in ... a more vulnerable state or maybe have other underlying health conditions to not catch things like the flu.\n\nTrojans can get their flu shots at no additional cost at a USC Pharmacy.

This afternoon, a panel on the topic of \u201cWomen in Sports\u201d took place at the USC Annenberg School. The panel was moderated by Farren Benjamin, and features the panellists Erin Bice, Olivia Cheng, Savannah Foster, Jennifer Prince, and Charlene Riofrio. The panelists discuss their experiences, career journeys, and the lessons they learnt. Some of the top highlights include discussing pivotal career moments, advice about the sports industry, and, surprisingly enough, horror stories about student emails. But beyond the event, panelists reflected about how much progress women were making in the industry.\n\nOlivia Cheng, who is the Senior Director of Marketing and Brand Engagement at LA28, said she sees some progress in gender equality. Olivia Cheng: I think we\u2019ve been on a very rapid pace and it\u2019s been actually really intriguing to really see the fact that there\u2019s a lot of women from a lot of different cultural backgrounds that are starting to actually celebrate the fact that there are women in sports. So I do think that there is a major push and we\u2019ve done a fantastic job of, say, within the last decade to really push more women in sports.\n\nAnother panellist and the Senior Manager of Digital Strategy and Operations at FOX Deportes, Charlene Riofrio, also comments on what change she would like to see for women in the sports industry. Charlene Riofrio: I would like to see more executives. I think, you know, there is still room for growth in that area. And I think what can help women become executives is, you know, continuing your academic journey, don\u2019t limit yourself to an undergraduate degree. Strive for a graduate degree, but at the same time, always make sure in order to become an executive, you have to get that sort of hands on experience early when you are a student so that you can move up that corporate ladder quicker. If you wait too late to get that sort of experience, the competition is harder.\n\nEvents like this one are important for students, especially for women, in order to fully understand the types of jobs and the different paths available to them. In fact, this panel even attracted students from beyond USC. One of the attendees, a pre-Business Economics student at UCLA, Sienna Claiborne explains why she attended this panel.

Textile fair. The fashion event, hosted biannually, has been hampered by the pandemic, but this year exhibitors are hoping for a resurgence. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how many people will come this year,\u201d said Sabu Nath of Spandex House in New York City. \u201cThe last three, four years were hard because it was Corona-time and we didn\u2019t get anything out of it.\u201d\n\nHosted by the California Market Center (CMC), the LA Textile showcases the newest collections for textile, design and production resources. With an estimated turnout of 7,000 visitors and 120 exhibitors flocking to the CMC, LA Textile has become a cross-cultural hub in the fashion industry. Designers, manufacturers and fabric retailers fly from Canada, China or the East Coast to attend the event.\n\n\u201cOur objective at LA Textile is always to curate an event that showcases the latest trends and innovations in fashion and textiles to provide a unique platform for designers and suppliers to connect,\u201d said Events Director Moriah Robinson in a press release. \u201cWe aim to create an inviting atmosphere that will educate, inspire and create meaningful and long term partnerships.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 1993, the LA Textile show is celebrating its 30th anniversary. This year more than ever, the show has grown to being a multicultural destination. New pavilions will open, including a Turkish Textile section featuring Turkish mills and a Taiwan Textile exhibition showcasing over a dozen of Taiwan\u2019s mills. Exhibitors from around the world are planning to attend the fair.\n\nHasan Erdal of Yarn Mavens said in a press release, \u201cThere has been a shift taking place over the last decade where the epicenter of the fashion industry has shifted from New York to Los Angeles. LA is really one of the few places around the world where new brands are born daily. These brands take a different approach to knitwear compared to their predecessors who thought of knitwear as an afterthought, instead it is a ubiquitous part of their collections.\u201d\n\nEduardo Fleck, the international business manager of Savyon Textil located in Brazil, said that he sees shifts in the clients who attend the show because of the rise of fast-fashion businesses fostering low-quality materials to bring inexpensive pieces of clothing to consumers. \u201cWe have been working with CMC for 15 years, so we have many clients there,\u201d said Fleck. \u201cThe LA Textile show used to be good when people were looking for more traditional products. Then the market started changing when they started importing from China, which had cheaper supplies. But now it seems to be going back to how it used to be, so I\u2019m hoping that we can find new potential clients.\u201d\n\nSavyon Textil will be presenting their specialty: knitted Jacquard yarns, a type of fabric with motifs woven into the weave on a Jacquard loom. Exhibiting products at the LA Textile doesn\u2019t come cheap though. \u201cWe paid $4,000 for a booth at the fair, and we do it every year,\u201d said Nath.\n\nThe CMC showcases talents that are involved in sustainable fashion. Fleck touched on the effort of Savyon Textil to use greener garment production leverages and opened up about the real struggles of the company. While the company adopted the OEKO-TEX certification to ensure the use of sustainable raw materials and smart machinery, the real challenge remains the management of the water consumed during the dyeing process, he said. \u201cInside the factory, the real challenge of producing textile is the design process and the treatment of water,\u201d said Fleck. \u201cWe don\u2019t use any aggressive chemicals so we can reuse 100% of the water and pour it back into the river. Regarding the material, we use biodegradable yarns, and are doing some trials with a recyclable yarn company. But it\u2019s not been successful so far.\u201d\n\nCatering to every market niche, the LA Textile show is at an intersection of cultures.\n```"}

Eddie Anderson, a senior pastor at McCarty Church in West Adams. \u201cThat means that there are only 10 grocery stores in the entire area, that fresh produce is a premium and we don\u2019t have a lot of it. There\u2019s more liquor stores per square mile and fast food restaurants than there are grocery stores.\u201d\n\nAnderson is the co-founder of Partnership for Growth LA, a nonprofit, community organization formed by McCarty Church and the Jewish Center for Justice. The partnership is tackling three major issues: education and reading loss; lack of workplace development; and lack of fresh food in their communities.\n\nTo help address the third problem, the partnership is working to create more community gardens in South and West L.A. The Freedom Farms program was established. The Freedom Farms program, launched in July, is \u201cinspired by a long history of Black-owned farming co-ops,\u201d according to a press release from the Partnership.\n\nThe program began as a three-year pilot, with the goal of establishing five new urban farming spaces and expanding upon 10 established farms in the first year, Bansal said. The goal in three years is to create or build upon existing farms until there are at least 37 serving the area.\n\nThe Good Earth Community Garden is one of the established spaces that Freedom Farms is working on. Access to fresh produce in South and West L.A. has long been an issue for residents. The CDC found in a 2020 study of three neighborhoods in South Los Angeles that over 55% of food retail stores in that area did not sell any fresh fruits or vegetables. The study also found that there was only one food pantry and no farmers markets in those neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cWe say food is life and that garden is community,\u201d said Anderson. Another aspect of the Freedom Farms program is the hiring of formerly incarcerated people, seniors, and youth by the partnership to work together on the farm as an educational endeavor.\n\n\u201cThe healing power of gardening is what it boils down to,\u201d Brendan Wilson, master gardener, said as he walked the rough dirt path of the Good Earth Community Garden. He says the formerly incarcerated workers are \u201creentering\u201d life through gardening. \u201cIt\u2019s hiring people who would not be able to get this experience.\u201d\n\nRight now, Bansal said, Freedom Farms is using money from a $7 million grant it received from the state of California in July to build itself up. They have a lot of ideas: plots of land to grow on and community gardens and farms to join. The end goal is not just to grow food, but to provide a \u201cmodel of economic development,\u201d said Bansal.\n\nAnderson agreed. He said that merchandising the produce they grow and getting it into farmers markets, grocery stores, and restaurants is the plan for the future. \u201cFreedom Farms really is an idea that we can have fresh organic food in our community farm to table, but the farm is South L.A., the farm is churches, synagogues, it\u2019s schools, it\u2019s parking lots, underpasses, community gardens and that those farms then will feed into a network of farmers markets, grocery stores, and restaurants,\u201d said Anderson.\n\nAt the Good Earth Community Garden, 28 plots are shared by the community members that surround the land. The squares of soil overflow with pumpkins and tomatillos, corn and peppers. It\u2019s the start of a sustainable urban farming vision Freedom Farms is hoping to spread throughout L.A., Bansal said.\n\nIn the meantime, she and Wilson believe that the importance of the farms is not just the food they produce - it\u2019s the \u201cspace for community.\u201d \u201cWhen our hands are in the soil, how do we build community? How do we organize our neighborhoods?\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWe make meaning out of place, and the sacredness of food and soil.\u201d```"}

The Village consists of several popular restaurants including CAVA, DULCE, greenleaf, Stout Burger, Trader Joe\u2019s and Starbucks, among others. Hudson suggests that The Village should send more timely notifications. \u201cWhat they can do is have a way that has updated waiting times at specific times when you go to order,\u201d she said.

Mahsa Day, the one year anniversary of Amini\u2019s death, marked the continuation of the \u201cWoman, Life, Freedom\u201d movement, with protests occurring at City Hall in downtown Los Angeles on September 16, 2023.\n\nNegar Karameti, one of the organizers of the L.A. protest, saw attendance from a couple thousand people continuing to urge for governmental change in Iran. \u201cWe are looking for regime change in Iran and government change because it is cruel and going against its people,\u201d Karameti said.\n\nAt a previous protest in February denoting the 44th anniversary since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 the crowd was noticeably more packed. \u201cWe had another event on February 11; there were about 100,000 people here,\u201d Karameti said. \u201cThe best way to show support is to become united and to inform everybody what is going on, what people are going through and what is actually happening,\u201d Karamati said. \u201cThere are lots of different views, different parties [from the] left [and] right for Iran, but like I said there is just one enemy; so we have to be united to overcome this.\u201d\n\nPolitical guest speakers were present at the event, including city council members and members of Congress. The former acting Director of National Intelligence and former U.S. Ambassador to Germany under the Trump Administration, Richard Grenell, criticized the Biden administration\u2019s prisoner swap deal. \u201cI am outraged to see our government giving $6 billion to this crazy regime,\u201d Grenell said. \u201cThis money will fund more terrorism, it\u2019ll fund more chaos... it\u2019ll fund more killings of Mahsa and other women.\u201d\n\nThe White House has defended the effort by noting sanctions are still in place and saying that it won\u2019t turn a blind eye to hostage-taking. Experts also have weighed in, with one calling the deal a \u201cstepping stone\u201d to an improved relationship while noting there is more progress to be made.\n\nThis prisoner swap funding unfreezes $6 billion in assets that went to Iran and led to the release of 5 detained American prisoners. Although these funds are supporting the Iranian government, the purpose of the funds doesn\u2019t address the remaining U.S. Iran tensions.\n\nThe White House released a statement about the crackdown on foreign relations with Iran in relation to Amini\u2019s death: \u201cOver the last year, the United States has responded to the calls of the Iranian people and organized an unprecedented diplomatic campaign that led to the Iranian government\u2019s removal from the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, and the creation of a UN fact-finding mission to investigate their human rights abuses,\u201d Biden said.\n\nJahanshah Ardalan, a Kurdish community member attending Mahsa Day, said he \u201clost loved ones to the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201d He spoke to the deaths of activists that followed Mahsa Amini: \u201cThey killed over 500 other young activists or anybody who wanted to speak out against the tyranny taking place in Iran right now, and the movement still continues,\u201d Ardalan said. \u201c[The emotions] express our disgust, our utter disappointment with the Islamic Republic of Iran and show our solidarity with the youth of Iran who want to be free, to self-express freely, with no fear of reprisal.\u201d\n\nOrganizers of the protest controlling the speed and direction of the protest.\n\nKhodanoor Lajaei, who was arrested and tortured by the Iranian police, was handcuffed in a similar body position around a flagpole. Lajaei\u2019s photo of being tortured became another icon and symbol of resistance following his death on October 1, 2022, on what would be known as Bloody Friday, one of the deadliest days of protest in the Woman, Life, Freedom movement.\n\nMessages are written along an Iran flag that is carried through the streets with some of the phrases being \u201cFree Iran\u201d, \u201cFor Freedom\u201d and \u201cIRGC Terrorist.\u201d\n\nProtesters of Iran\u2019s government hold signs calling for revolution and freedom in Iran while chanting Zan.

National Voter Registration Day is a nonpartisan civic holiday. It serves as an opportunity to register and engage in the right to vote and express views on political matters within the U.S.\n\nThe USC organizations represented on campus yesterday included the Political Student Assembly, Trojan Democrats and USC GOP.

Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are apologizing for character letters the celebrity couple wrote on behalf of Masterson ahead of this week's sentencing of their fellow \"That '70s Show\" cast member. A judge in Los Angeles on Thursday, Sept. 7, 2023, sentenced Masterson to 30 years to life in prison for raping two women in 2003.\n\nBy Kate McQuarrie September 20, 2023 at 1:16 pm PDT\n\nOn Sept. 7, Los Angeles Superior Court sentenced actor Danny Masterson to 30 years to life in prison for drugging and raping two women in the early 2000s. His co-stars from \u201cThat 70s Show,\u201d Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, have faced scrutiny for writing letters of support during Masterson\u2019s sentencing. The couple have been criticized for the content of the letters, in which Kunis described Masterson as \u201can outstanding role model and friend.\u201d She said he played a large role in keeping her away from drugs throughout her time in Hollywood. Kutcher cited Masterson\u2019s prowess as a friend and father, even referring to an instance in which Masterson defended a stranger against her \u201cbelligerent\u201d boyfriend in public.\n\nWhile over 50 others wrote similar letters of support, including several other co-stars from \u201cThat 70s Show,\u201d Kutcher\u2019s and Kunis\u2019 letters have received the most media attention. In a video released on Sept. 9, the couple addressed public concern over the letters, saying that they \u201csupport victims.\u201d \u201c[The letters] were intended for the judge to read and not to undermine the testimony of any of the victims or retraumatize them in any way. We would never want to do that, and we\u2019re sorry if that has taken place,\u201d Kutcher said in the video.\n\nChristy Heiskala, a professional survivor advocate with Haeggquist & Eck, LLP, issued her professional opinion on the letters and the apology video in a LinkedIn post. \u201cI believe Ashton must have thought those character letters he and Mila wrote at the parent\u2019s request would never become public,\u201d Heiskala wrote. \u201cThat was na\u00efve and still doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that he wrote them in the first place.\u201d\n\nAfter further discontent among the public about the ambiguous apology in the video, Kutcher announced his resignation from his position as Chairman of the Board at Thorn, an organization aimed at combating sex trafficking that he co-founded. \u201cVictims of sexual abuse have been historically silenced, and the character statement I submitted is yet another painful instance of questioning victims who are brave enough to share their experiences,\u201d Kutcher said in his letter of resignation. \u201cThe mission must always be the priority and I want to offer my heartfelt apology to all victims of sexual violence and everyone at Thorn who I hurt by what I did.\u201d\n\nThis decision came after \u201cseveral days of listening, personal reflection, learning, and conversations with survivors,\u201d Kutcher wrote. Kunis additionally has stepped down from her role as an observer on the board. Heiskala also expressed her discontent with Kutcher\u2019s \u201cwillful ignorance\u201d as a longtime advocate in an organization that she admires. \u201cWhen you work in this field, you know what survivors go through when they come forward and false reports are extremely rare. You know how incredibly hard and rare it is to get a rapist convicted,\u201d Heiskala wrote.\n\nAccording to RAINN, 8 out of 10 assaults are committed by someone known to the victim, and the CDC asserts that over half of women and almost 1 in 3 men experience physical sexual violence in their lifetimes. It stands to reason, then, that many people know and are in close contact with perpetrators of sexual violence. However, based on data from the Department of Justice, RAINN reports that 97.5% of perpetrators of sexual violence face no repercussions for their actions.\n\nYet still, even when a conviction is made, some people continue to support the convicted rapist and refuse to believe the court\u2019s findings. Samuel Dordulian, the president and owner of Dordulian Law Group, a firm focused on representing survivors of sexual violence and abuse, expressed disdain at Kutcher and Kunis\u2019s supposed dedication to survivors. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to ask for leniency from the judge, in this particular case, then you are calling into question to some degree the legitimacy of the claims being made by the survivors in this case,\u201d Dordulian said. \u201cWhy else would you ask for leniency on this particular defendant?\u201d\n\nDordulian said that one part of Kutcher\u2019s letter \u2014 in which he stated that he would trust Masterson to be alone with his own daughter \u2014 stood out to him in particular for its gross negligence of the impact his words have on the survivors and demonstrates the disingenuous nature of their apology. \u201cYou are directly calling into question the legitimacy of the claims that the survivor is making because you\u2019re saying that I can\u2019t possibly believe that he would do this because I\u2019m going to trust my daughter with him. But he did do it,\u201d Dordulian said. \u201cA jury of 12 unanimously found that did and is capable of doing these violent crimes.\u201d\n\nAbuse experts agree that it\u2019s common for an abuser to be a good friend and relative to certain people, but an abuser to others. This can cause cognitive dissonance in friends and family of abusers. However, the inability to see a loved one\u2019s capacity for violence does not diminish that capacity.\n\nDr. Nicole Bedera, a sociologist studying sexual assault, published a study in 2023 in the Journal of Higher Education entitled \u201cI Can Protect His Future, but She Can\u2019t Be Helped: Himpathy and Hysteria in Administrator Rationalizations of Institutional Betrayal.\u201d In her research, Bedera found that \u201cadministrators openly encouraged conversations with perpetrators that would allow them to \u2018see the whole person,\u2019 and as a result, enable them to develop sympathy.\u201d\n\nDordulian similarly expressed that this is a common occurrence in almost every case he handles, especially with character witnesses and letters of support. \u201cWho this person is also encompasses all the horrible things they have done,\u201d Dordulian said.\n\nIn these cases, where celebrities have meaningful power to alter public opinion and perception of the perpetrator \u2014 much like the administrators in Bedera\u2019s study \u2014 letters like those supporting Masterson perpetuate the myth that family and friends cannot simultaneously be sexual abusers, when in fact, abusers typically occupy both spaces.\n\n\u201cFor someone like Ashton Kutcher, who knows that this is going to get the light of day and who claims that he is an advocate for survivors, to make the kind of claims that he did ... was just careless at best and inappropriate.\u201d\n\nWith his subsequent resignation from Thorn, Kutcher has addressed the carelessness of his actions, citing his dedication to \u201cthe mission\u201d of supporting victims and the distraction from Thorn\u2019s efforts caused by his and Kunis\u2019s letters. Similarly to the administrators in Bedera\u2019s study, these letters \u201ccast male perpetrators of sexual assault as deserving of sympathy, mercy, and protection. To do so, they also minimized the violence that occurred.\u201d\n\nMany of Masterson\u2019s letters of support focus solely on the well-being of the accused, calling for leniency for Masterson and never mentioning the impact his actions had on his survivors. The victims\u2019 impact statements, however, have received far less media attention, indicating the effect of celebrity status on widespread coverage. These victims have remained anonymous throughout the process and spoke about the impact Masterson\u2019s actions have had on them.\n\nOne victim asserts that Masterson \u201cdisfigured my life. You stole some crucial pieces of my self-worth and lessened my capacity for joy. You made every part of me turn on myself.\u201d Another said that \u201cWhen you\u2019re raped, it\u2019s not your surface that\u2019s been most defiled ... It damages you on a cellular level.\u201d\n\nOne of the victim responded to the video Kutcher and Kunis posted regarding the letters, saying that the \u201cvideo was incredibly insulting and hurtful,\u201d in a text message to journalist Yashar Ali which was shared on X.\n\nDordulian expressed that he sees this level of pain and impact among most of the survivors he works with. \u201cThey really collapse and they really take to heart a lot of these comments,\u201d Dordulian said.\n\nThis victim called for the couple to \u201clearn radical accountability and the importance of self-education to learn when to keep their privilege in check \u2014 especially Ashton, who claims to work with victims of sex crimes.\u201d\n\nWhile the public conversation in this case centered on pointing out the issue that lies in Kutcher and Kunis\u2019s support, their words of support set an example of sexual assault apologism. \u201cThere is empirical evidence to corroborate decades of survivors\u2019 claims that their perpetrators were treated with more sympathy than they received,\u201d Bedera wrote.\n\nHowever, Kutcher and Kunis have affirmed to the public that they have learned from this mistake and have taken it upon themselves to impose the self-reprimand of stepping down from Thorn. Despite affirming that they respect the law and the decision of the court, their heartfelt sentiments for survivors of abuse, and the admission of an \u201cerror in judgment,\u201d neither Kutcher nor Kunis has yet to verbally affirm that they regret writing the letters \u2014 or apologize directly for that action. Instead, they have only apologized for its consequences.\n```"}

It\u2019s a marketing ploy for a new social media app but students still love getting a $5 Starbucks card\n\nCarrot Guy poses near the Hoover St.- Jefferson Blvd intersection with a pail of carrots and a whiteboard promoting the Carrot app. (Photo by Becca Speier)\n\nBy Rebecca Speier September 19, 2023 at 10:00 pm PDT\n\nHe\u2019s big. He\u2019s orange. He\u2019s a carrot. He\u2019s not quite Santa Claus, but Carrot Guy still walks the streets bearing gifts for students: $5 gift cards for answering questions in a new social media app the mascot was created to promote. As the Carrot Guy travels throughout campus, students flock towards him to take pictures or to steal the vegetable from his pail. Each time the Carrot Guy is present on campus, he holds a sign with the new trivia of the day. When students take a carrot or answer the trivia question, they are handed a free carrot with a QR code from the mascot that links to a download for the app Carrot. It is a social networking app that promotes \u201cauthentic\u201d communication between users, while simultaneously allowing users to earn free digital currency.\n\n\u201c[The founding team] wanted to do something that was an alternative to current social, that was this healthier alternative where people felt like they could be genuine, and they were learning about each other, and digging deeper friendships,\u201d Carrot Guy said. The app itself is fairly new, about a year old, and has been first promoted to college students. The Carrot Guy has not only explored USC\u2019s campus, but has walked through UCLA as well.\n\n\u201cWe think that college students really probably want to express themselves more than anybody else,\u201d Carrot Guy said. \" The Carrot app gives you an opportunity to do that because these questions really kind of dig into who you are, and what you believe, and what you think is funny, or cool. And so it\u2019s a way of really expressing yourself, and that\u2019s with college students.\u201d\n\nFounder and CEO James Tashjian said the idea of the mascot is not to specifically solicit the app, but instead to spread cheer to students while on campus, and advertise the app when asked. The company\u2019s policy is to never reveal the current identity of the Carrot Guy, though Tashjian said he\u2019s played the orange enigma in the past. Carrot Group Inc. is a Los Angeles-based company, and this is one of the main reasons why Carrot has been targeted to students on both USC and UCLA campuses. However, Tashjian hopes that Carrot will continue to spread beyond local schools.\n\nThe app sends out \u201cThe Daily Dig\u201d which is a new trivia question that users can answer to earn coins, deemed Carrot Coins, which can be redeemed for app-exclusive NFTs, or transferred to an external wallet. The NFTs purchased within, or added to the app, can be used to react to fellow users\u2019 messages. \u201cThe NFTs in the app are a way to decorate your messages. [Our team] thought it\u2019d be super fun to be able to use the digital currency to buy really cute, fun animations,\u201d Carrot Guy said. \u201cNot expensive, like all that crazy NFT madness, but really, you know, you\u2019re getting the coins for free and it\u2019s something you can use the coins on to make your messages more unique.\u201d\n\nAccording to Carrot\u2019s white paper, the Carrot Coins can be used to \u201csend messages to their friends, redeem them for in-app NFTs, or transfer their coins out of the app into their external wallet to exchange tokens for other cryptocurrencies.\u201d Students on USC\u2019s campus can download the app, answer the daily dig and show the Carrot Guy that they completed the trivia question. If it is completed, he gives students a five-dollar gift card to Starbucks.\n\nMalini Pandey, a sophomore studying business administration and political science, was curious why there was someone dressed as a carrot, and \u201cwalked up and [she] then saw that you get a $5 Starbucks gift card.\u201d Pandey does not actively use the app, but every time she sees the Carrot she opens her phone and answers the daily question to score a prize.\n\nTerence Holton contributed to this report.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Siena Maniatis, Nathan Silva and Malcolm Caminero\nSeptember 19, 2023 at 9:47 pm PDT\n\nStudents at USC are painfully aware of the high costs that come with attending the school \u2013 but $3 for a load of laundry? Students who live in USC housing know this is the cost of clean clothes, but those who see it as an unnecessary expense are in luck: USG is working towards creating a laundry stipend, similar to the existing fund for printing.\n\n\u201cI think laundry is so ridiculously expensive,\u201d said sophomore Aditya Thiyag. \u201cNot all the students need to print as frequently, but all students need to do their laundry.\u201d Sophomore Jasmine Elasaad agreed with Thiyag; since she does most of her work digitally, her printing funds go almost entirely unused.\n\n\u201cI think that most students would prefer to have this money allocated for laundry instead of printing since we wash our clothes so frequently,\u201d she said.\n\nUSG announced the proposed laundry stipend for USC students in an Instagram post Monday afternoon. The post stated that the project would aim to give students up to $25 to use towards laundry and provided a QR code linked to a feedback form.\n\nCurrently, the university gives students who live in USC housing $25 per semester towards printing. The proposed stipend change aims to provide USC housing students increased flexibility in using these funds, including the option to allocate them for laundry services, printing, or even a combination of both.\n\nIt would be a game-changer for Elasaad, who prefers to go home and wash her clothes over the weekend to avoid the high laundry prices at USC. While this is feasible for her because she lives nearby, she acknowledged that is not the case for most students.\n\nWhile the feedback from students Annenberg Media spoke to has been relatively positive, some say it is not nearly enough to cover their laundry expenses for the entire semester. The normal price for a wash cycle is $1.75 and the dryer cycle is $1.25, which comes out to about $3 for a full load. Assuming students wash their clothes once a week and keep the settings on normal, they would spend $48 on laundry for the 16-week semester.\n\nSome students say it would be more beneficial if the stipend was increased to $50 so they would only have to worry about purchasing detergent and dryer sheets.\n\nDiana Carpio, a legislative aide in USG, spearheaded the laundry stipend project after noticing a barrier in accessibility. \u201cI wanted to make a difference for more people than just myself,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you are someone who does laundry, this project affects you.\u201d\n\nAs of right now, only students who live in USC housing would receive the stipend, which would be available in their student accounts at the start of each semester. The feedback form posted on the USG Instagram marks the next step in the process as student feedback is required to move forward with the proposal.\n\n\u201cThere is no guarantee that students will receive a laundry stipend yet,\u201d Carpio said, \u201cbut any interest that students can provide will greatly help USG advocate for your needs and opinions.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Kassydi Rone\nSeptember 19, 2023 at 8:29 pm PDT\n\nFrom 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Tuesday, McCarthy Quad gave Regina George\u2019s wardrobe a run for its money. It\u2019s not often that we see a walk-in closet make its way outdoors, but the Fashion Industry Association (FIA) transformed the popular campus center with tables featuring clothes from both student and local fashion vendors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so nice that we get to be in the middle of campus with a lot of foot traffic. It benefits everyone,\u201d said senior and FIA Co-President Madison Hong. \u201cVendors have told us they have had issues with flea markets in the past like theft and lowballing of prices, so the USC community being very willing to support has been a great experience for them.\u201d\n\nHong\u2019s idea for the fair was born from the villain of all shopping enthusiasts: inconvenience. Tired of paying for two Ubers and waiting in L.A. traffic just for a trip to Melrose, Hong and the FIA team brought the treasure hunt essence of thrift shopping straight to campus.\n\nThis was the organization\u2019s seventh fair, and they narrowed down nearly 70 applications to select the 22 vendors in attendance. With pieces ranging anywhere from cherry-shaped earrings to two-piece suits, students meticulously browsed through unique styles of vintage and secondhand clothing.\n\n\u201cI like the convenience of having it so close. I\u2019m not from L.A., so this helps me not have to look for places to shop,\u201d said Anura Deshpande, a freshman neuroscience major who walked outside of Birnkrant and was greeted with several vibrant booths. \u201cI think it\u2019s more special to look through all of these different clothes and have the excitement of finding something that works.\u201d\n\nLocal vendors paid a flat fee of $80 to participate, but were guaranteed a refund equivalent to their loss if they did not make a profit. However, given the notoriety that the fair has gained over the past year and a half of its operation, participants had no problem meeting their sales goals for the day.\n\nArthur Andrade, 26, and Cynthia Esclance, 24, co-owners of Past Present Future Goods, made a return to the fair from San Fernando Valley largely due to their profitable visit last semester.\n\n\u201cI try to average around $500, but collectively we made way over that last time we were here. Today we had a wall of vintage USC stuff, and it\u2019s literally all gone, there\u2019s only one piece left,\u201d Andrade said. \u201cI see more of a wide interest just because there\u2019s so many types of people here.\u201d\n\nKelly Salvador, 25, seasoned thrifter and owner of resale shop Second Time Around, also more than doubled her table fee within the first hours of opening to customers. She sourced clothing from both local thrift stores and donations from friends.\n\n\u201cI just love being around the student body. It\u2019s a different market compared to the other markets I normally go to,\u201d Salvador said. \u201cThe style is different. The students know what\u2019s in and what\u2019s happening, and I think that\u2019s more convenient for us vendors.\u201d\n\nStudents who sold also found success with customers due to their understanding of what pieces offer a simultaneously trendy, yet timeless vibe. Members of FIA tabled at the event for free as a perk for their participation, letting go of pieces from their closet in hopes of making space for new purchases from the fair.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many different patterns, textiles and things that I draw inspiration from, and from different decades and generations. Here you\u2019ll find things from the \u201860s to the early 2000s. It\u2019s really broadened my spectrum in terms of what I want to wear and how I\u2019m going to put my pieces together,\u201d said Madison Pottinger, sophomore casting director for the annual FIA fashion show.\n\nPottinger was not only on the hunt for print and bold colors from other booths, but she also began relaying recruitment information about the fashion show for intrigued students.\n\n\u201cEvery time I see someone, I make sure to tell them about FIA and the opportunity to be a model for our show in the spring,\u201d Pottinger said. \u201cEverybody here just loves fashion, so getting to talk with students about our passion for making clothes, thrifting clothes, styling clothes... it\u2019s really nice.\u201d\n\nMuch like Pottinger, the specificity of desired items aided first-time visitors in lucking up on good finds. Paolo Cerippa, an exchange student from Paris taking finance classes at Marshall, arrived in California just a month ago. He appreciated the pricing of the clothing at the fair and came in search of cargo pants.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s better offers here because there\u2019s clothes that younger people would buy. Whereas in Europe, the good vintage stores get really crowded, and you\u2019ll still find a lot of stuff you would never buy,\u201d Cerippa said.\n\nThe FIA team prioritizes diversity in merchandise and style when selecting vendors with the intent of encouraging students to experiment with their fashion choices.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have been coming up to us just excited to show us what they got. In L.A. there\u2019s definitely a pressure to dress well, and it can be expensive. So, having flea markets like this means that students have access to clothing that isn\u2019t overpriced,\u201d senior FIA Co-President, Simone Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier for them to put together their personal style in an affordable way.\u201d\n\nThe FIA Fashion Fair will return to McCarthy Quad on Tuesday, October 10.\n```"}

Few squads can claim a better one-two punch than Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. Combined, they have 11 All-NBA designations, 11 All-Defensive Teams, two Defensive Player of the Year awards, two Finals MVPs, two NBA Championship rings and an Olympic Gold Medal. But what do they have to show for it in Los Angeles? The busiest medical staff in the league and zero titles \u2014 not even a conference championship.\n\nThrough four seasons (2019-2020 to 2022-23), Leonard and George have played 118 regular season games together out of a possible 328 \u2014 just under 36 percent. The injuries have been constant and devastating. Even when Leonard graced the 2022-23 playoffs with a few quality performances, including an efficient 31-point, 7-assist performance in Game 2, George had injury issues of his own that ruled him out, and then Leonard tore his meniscus anyway. The duo only played together 38 times last season.\n\nWhen they do actually play together, though, the Clippers tend to steamroll opponents. Leonard and George outscored opponents 13.2 points per 100 possessions in 2019-20 and 17.6 points per 100 possessions in 2020-21 when sharing the court. That is a ridiculous margin, one that backs up their title candidacy. For context, during the 2022-23 season, the Nuggets points per 100 possessions above their opponent with Nikola Joki\u0107 on the floor was just 4.8. Yes, that\u2019s one player versus two top-15 talents, but that gap shows just how dangerous the Clippers can be with their star men healthy.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of whether or not Leonard and George are even the same guys we\u2019ve watched dominate the league previously. Leonard has torn his ACL and his meniscus in consecutive seasons \u2014 both in his right knee, too. Famously, his right quadriceps tendinopathy kept him out of all but nine games in the 2017-18 season. And in addition to the knee injury that kept him from featuring in the last playoffs, George fractured his tibia playing for Team USA back in 2014.\n\nTo succeed in 2023-24, the Clippers will have to face the challenge of not just ensuring Leonard and George are healthy to start the season, but keeping them up to and through the playoffs. If it wasn\u2019t hard enough before, it just became harder. On Wednesday, the board of governors passed a new rule intended to curtail the much-discussed (and much loathed) trend of load management. Per the new guidelines, teams cannot rest two stars \u2014 defined as players who have earned All-Star or All-NBA Team honors in the previous three seasons \u2014 on the same night. For the Clippers, one of the league bastion\u2019s of load management, this could spell trouble for George and Leonard\u2019s health. Clubs found violating the rule will be subject to a fine scale dependent on a team\u2019s number of offenses. A first time violation will cost $100,000 and the second $250,000, with each subsequent rule break increasing by $1 million. It will be interesting to see if deep-pocketed Clippers owner Steve Ballmer pays the fines to keep his stars fresher for the playoffs.\n\nThankfully for Clippers fans, Leonard underwent surgery for his torn meniscus over the summer and head coach Tyronn Lue expects him to be present and healthy for training camp. But making George and Leonard\u2019s ability to stay on the court even more imperative is the Clippers\u2019 lackluster rotation. Besides the forwards, the Clippers best starting player is... Russell Westbrook? Ivica Zubac? If Lue and the Clippers want to make life easier for their two stars, another player or two needs to outperform last season\u2019s role.\n\nWhich gets us to...\n\nA young(-ish) guard takes a leap\n\nJust because the Clippers have bet the house on Leonard and George doesn\u2019t mean that their guard play can fall by the wayside. The two All-NBA selections dominate most possessions, which has made it hard for a true point guard to stick \u2014 until Westbrook\u2019s postseason run, that is. But given his inefficient shooting and lack of ball security, no team in their right mind should rely on Russell Westbrook in 2023, so Tyronn Lue will be hoping one of his rotational guards plays themselves into a greater role.\n\nIn the 2021 playoffs, Terance Mann looked like that guy. The 26-year-old out of Florida State scored 39 points in a series-clinching Game 6 against the Utah Jazz, including seven made three-pointers. But that game turned out to be much more the exception than the rule. In the previous two seasons combined, Mann has averaged just 9.8 points and fewer than 2.5 assists per game. He doesn\u2019t need to become an All-Star, but just five additional points per game would actually make a big difference in this rotation. Mann has the three-point shooting chops to make that happen, too, having shot 38.9% from behind the arc in 2022-23 and even as high as 41.8% in 2020-21.\n\nBut he\u2019s not the only candidate for a potential break-out. Brandon Boston Jr. had a Mann-like burst of his own against the Celtics early in the 2021-22 season, scoring 27 off of 9-13 shooting and five threes. He showed real ball-handling chops and a willingness to drive to the rim when the opportunity presented itself. Again, Boston Jr. doesn\u2019t need to become an All-Star to win the Clippers a title (although the former five-star is still only 21), but turning him into a reliable, spark plug scorer would ease Leonard and George\u2019s burden.\n\nRussell Westbrook knows his role\n\nWhile Westbrook has caught strays in the previous sections, his performances in the 2023 playoffs provided the Clippers with a boost that will have earned him respect and a continued role. Westbrook made himself most valuable, however, when the team had a George-shaped hole that needed filling. The much-maligned former UCLA guard plays a very different role to George, but his pure energy admittedly gave the Clippers a bite they wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise.\n\nPlays like this in big games were missing for him while with the Lakers:\n\nWestbrook\u2019s athleticism can still be an asset, but with George and Leonard back, the former MVP will have to settle into a tertiary \u201cstar\u201d role, one that didn\u2019t go well during his Lakers tenure. Westbrook had a 1.96 assists to turnover ratio during his time in purple and gold, a far cry from Chris Paul\u2019s 4.60 in 2022-23. Not to mention, multiple sources described Westbrook\u2019s presence in the Lakers organization as \u201ctoxic,\u201d per The Athletic\u2019s Sam Amick and Jovan Buha. It would do the Clippers a world of good to not be the center of attention for negative reasons this year, which will require Westbrook being on his best behavior.\n```"}

Fixing New York\u2019s QB conundrum\n\nAfter losing Aaron Rodgers to a torn achilles in Week 1, and a lackluster Week 2 performance from Zach Wilson, head coach Robert Saleh is back to the drawing board.\n\nThe football world came to a standstill when New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers exited the New York Jets\u2019 season opener with an Achilles injury. Jets fans watched on in sorrow as Rodgers was carted off the field and quarterback Zach Wilson entered the game, a third-year signal caller who last year led one of the worst Jets offenses in franchise history. Despite the disappointment of fans, however, Jets head coach Robert Saleh was quick to jump to Wilson\u2019s defense after the team\u2019s surprise victory over the Buffalo Bills. \u201cI want to make it very clear \u2014 Zach is our quarterback... We have a lot of faith in Zach, and we are really excited about this opportunity,\u201d Saleh told reporters in a press conference last Tuesday.\n\nSaleh has been a strong supporter of Wilson throughout his tenure as head coach, yet the quarterback\u2019s play on the field raises big questions as to why. In nine games as the Jets\u2019 starting quarterback in 2022, he proved to be one of the worst passers in football, finishing the season last in completion percentage (54.5 percent), last in passer rating (72.8), and bottom five in passing success rate (37.7), and sack & interception percentage (8.7 and 2.9 percent respectively). Those inside the Jets building probably attribute Wilson\u2019s struggles in 2022 to his youth, hoping that his play this year will improve with another offseason under his belt, yet the quarterback has shown no sign of development through two games.\n\nAgainst the Bills in Week 1 and the Dallas Cowboys this past weekend, Wilson showed all the negative traits that led to his benching in 2022, particularly poor decision-making under pressure and the inability to create out of structure or make big-time throws. Through two weeks, Wilson ranks second to last in quarterback EPA (expected points added, a measure of success which defines the value of each play by the effect it has on the offense\u2019s likelihood to score) and has led a Jets offense which has scored only 13 points on drives not beginning after opposition turnovers.\n\nWith a bonafide top three defense and Pro-Bowl caliber skill players in wide receiver Garrett Wilson and running back Breece Hall, the Jets are a team built to win now. Thus, even if no available quarterback amounts to Aaron Rodgers\u2019 level of play, it is in the team\u2019s best interest to acquire functional quarterback play to salvage the season. Let\u2019s explore what the Jets are looking for at the position and possible targets that could help the team compete for a playoff berth.\n\nWhat the Jets are Looking for\n\nBefore discussing specific names, we first must analyze the profile of quarterback that the Jets might look to target. With NFL insider Ian Rappoport reporting that Rodgers may target a playoff return after an innovative surgery to repair his Achilles, the Jets\u2019 pursuit of a long-term franchise-level passer like Kirk Cousins or Matthew Stafford is definitely off the table. Furthermore, the team would look to acquire a scheme fit for offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett\u2019s West Coast offense, a system built around quick underneath passing to stretch defenses horizontally and get the ball to the team\u2019s playmakers. This leaves the team to consider a very specific type of quarterback: a backup or low-profile veteran who can make quick decisions and be accurate in the underneath and intermediate areas.\n\nWith this established, let\u2019s look at three passers who could help the team compete for a playoff spot.\n\nThe Most Realistic Option - Andy Dalton\n\nLong seen as the baseline for starter-level quarterback play, Andy Dalton quietly put together a very solid year for the New Orleans Saints in 2022, finishing the season with 2,871 yards, 18 TDs, and 9 interceptions on 66.7 percent completion - No. 10 in the NFL. Dalton also ranked first among all quarterbacks in accurate pass percentage, fifth least in turnover-worthy throws and ninth in passer rating, all while posting above average or better numbers both when kept clean and when pressured or blitzed. He\u2019s a scheme fit, having excelled in an offense with West Coast principles; in 2022, Dalton got the ball out in 2.59 seconds (0.18 seconds faster than the league average), with outs, hitches, and crossers being his most targeted routes. Furthemore, Dalton was borderline elite in quick passing situations, ranking top ten in passer rating on throws less than two seconds from the snap and those 2-2.5 seconds after.\n\nDalton was signed in free agency by the Carolina Panthers to back up quarterback Bryce Young, the first overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. And while the Panthers probably favor the idea of having a high-end veteran backup to help their rookie learn the ropes, there\u2019s no reason a mid-round pick couldn\u2019t tempt them to part ways. Dalton proved last year he can be the perfect vehicle to operate a West Coast offense, and should be a frontrunner to keep the Jets\u2019 afloat while Rodgers recovers.\n\nThe Long Shot - Ryan Tannehill\n\nSince taking over as the Tennessee Titans starter in 2019, few quarterbacks have been as successful as Ryan Tannehill, who led the team to the AFC Championship Game in 2019, and ranked top five in passer rating and EPA in 2019 and 2020. Tannehill endured his worst season as a Titan in 2022, throwing for 2,536 yards, 13 TDs, and 6 interceptions on 65.2 percent completion. But that can somewhat be attributed to the changing picture around him: Pro-Bowl wide receiver A.J Brown was traded prior to the season, and the Titans\u2019 injury-decimated offensive line finished 26th in pass block rating. Tannehill may have looked to take a step back, yet he still is a perfect candidate to take over as the Jets\u2019 signal caller.\n\nFor one, he excelled in an offense very similarly constructed to the Jets\u2019 with a star running back in Derrick Henry and a true WR1 in A.J Brown. He\u2019s both one of the most accurate quarterbacks over the middle of the field and one of the best play action passers in football, fitting the Jets\u2019 current run-centric offense with Breece Hall and Dalvin Cook and the team\u2019s West Coast style. Tannehill may not currently be available with the team starting 1-1, yet the team clearly does not see him as the franchise\u2019s future - the organization drafted quarterback Will Levis early in the second round in the 2023 draft and refused to extend Tannehill in the offseason, who is now scheduled to be a free agent in the offseason. If the team is struggling prior to the trade deadline, look for the former Dolphin to potentially return to the AFC East.\n\nThe Backup Plan - Jacoby Brissett\n\nSigned to lead the Cleveland Browns offense while Deshaun Watson served his suspension, Jacoby Brissett outdid expectations to deliver a decent season in 2022, finishing the year with 2,608 yards, 12 TDs, and 6 interceptions on 64 percent completion. Brissett was largely average by most metrics, ranking 19th in passer rating and 20th in EPA per play. Like Dalton, however, he operated a West Coast offense, with the 2022 Browns running underneath and crossing routes at an above-average rate, and provided solid play as an underneath and intermediate passer, posting league average grades on accuracy and efficiency metrics on throws from 0-20 yards in 2022. This all makes Brissett a fit for what the Jets are looking for at the position, and while he may be no more than average, that is all the Jets could need to be a playoff team in 2023 with their defense and skill position players. Like Dalton, he is currently backing up first-year starter Sam Howell for the Washington Commanders, yet with Howell seemingly securing the starting job after a 2-0 start, Brissett could be available for a mid-round pick.\n```"}

In a  live-streamed interview  with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Musk said that \u201cthe single most important reason we\u2019re moving to having a small monthly payment for use of the X system is it\u2019s the only way I could think of to combat vast armies of bots.\u201d USC students are now concerned about the paywall affecting how X functions as a tool for open communication.\n\n\u201cI think anything that prevents access from people who don\u2019t have the money to afford it is generally a bad thing,\u201d said Cole Dubrow, a senior studying political science. \u201cI think a town square implies it\u2019s democratic and open to all, but if you have to pay for it, it doesn\u2019t seem very democratic to me.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Musk has pointed to bots as the cause for concern; after he made an offer to purchase Twitter in May 2022, he claimed in a  tweet  that the social media platform was \u201c20% fake/spam accounts,\u201d which was four times the company\u2019s estimate at the time. Since then, Musk has made several controversial changes impacting user experience. The creation of the Twitter Blue subscription \u2014 later rebranded to X Premium \u2014 and limiting the amount of posts users could view in a day all sparked strong reactions from the user base, but the suggestion of a paywall might be the final straw for many users.\n\n\u201cI think [the paywall] is just another decision in the chain of events that\u2019s making Twitter go downhill, as far as popularity and relevance,\u201d said John Millsap, a sophomore studying creative writing. \u201cI feel it\u2019s unfair to people who have loyally used the platform for the last decade or so.\u201d\n```"}

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nBy Terence Holton September 19, 2023 at 7:36 pm PDT\n\n\u201cThe Big Ten Breakdown, Vol. II\u201d is a column by Terence Holton about the new look of college football. Let\u2019s play out a scenario. The NCAA has decided to eliminate the Pac-12 entirely and all of college football will be reformed. However, they need a transition Tsar. After a long grueling search, they chose one man to help smooth the merging of teams to new conferences. Some say his knowledge in college sports surpasses all else and he can name all 363 Division 1 mascots. Who is that man? Me. I will be reshaping the landscape of college football as fans know it, with realigning more than just the Pac-12.\n\nThe New Look Big Ten\nI\u2019ll give the Big Ten some credit, they already have brought in the big dogs of the Pac-12 in USC, UCLA, Washington and Oregon. However, I don\u2019t believe they should stop there with the West Coast. Ideally, Oregon State and Washington State will join their in-state brothers, so that the Big Ten has now captured what I believe to be the three best rivalries from the former Pac-12. Both Washington State and Oregon State have been very solid programs over the past two seasons. With new coaches who are clearly very talented, you cannot tell me that they can\u2019t at least compete with the likes of Illinois, Northwestern or Minnesota. These two up-and-coming programs deserve to be reunited with their rivals.\n\nThe only issue with Washington State and Oregon State joining is the size of the conference. What was once the Big Ten would become the Big 20. Not to fret, I have some solutions that will right the ship.\n\nThe Big Big 12\nAs Tsar of Pac-12 realignment, I will force Stanford and Cal not to join the ACC, but the Big 12. It is completely ridiculous that Cal and Stanford of all teams want to entwine with the ACC. What does ACC stand for now, \u201cAll Coast Conference?\u201d Second, Nebraska and Iowa are joining the Big 12. Nebraska was formerly in the Big 12, and Iowa\u2019s biggest rival, Iowa State, is in the Big 12 \u2014 another reunion of rivals. I will allow Texas and Oklahoma to leave the Big 12, as I believe it will make this conference more competitive. With the additions of Iowa and Nebraska, many old rivalries will be restored and make for some great football. With the additions of the other annexed Pac-12 teams in Arizona, Arizona State, Utah and Colorado, along with Nebraska and Iowa, the Big 12 is now the Big 20; but I am the man who wields the Infinity Gauntlet.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t like BYU, Cincinnati, UCF and Houston joining a Power Five conference \u2014 just doesn\u2019t feel right to me. So what I\u2019m going to do is combine these four with the Mountain West and make a new Power Five conference with formerly Group of Five teams.\n\nThe Super Mountain West\nThis new super conference will include the entire Mountain West Conference (San Diego State, San Jose State, Fresno St, etc.), a conference which has proven it can hang with teams from the current Power Five, and combine them with the likes of BYU, UCF, Houston and Cincinnati, as well as Memphis and Tulane. I realize this is contradictory to what I said about Stanford and Cal joining the ACC, but I like the idea of the best Group of Five teams forming their own super conference of sorts. This will also allow at least one bid to the College Football Playoff with the 12-team format. The Super Mountain West will accelerate recruiting and give these smaller teams a bigger market.\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference (No, really Atlantic)\nI am making the ACC truly the Atlantic Coast Conference. Sorry, SMU, you aren\u2019t being promoted to a power conference. Teams like Syracuse and Pitt are on thin ice, but as former members of the Big East, they do not have a true football conference to go to, and I will cut them some slack. First off, Maryland and Rutgers are joining the ACC \u2014 it makes the most sense, as their states are on the Atlantic Coast. Like with Iowa and Nebraska, Louisville and Georgia Tech are being sent to the SEC to join their rivals Kentucky and Georgia. That just leaves one issue: Boston College. I realize Boston College is on the Atlantic Coast, but it is so painfully terrible at football that it is being kicked out of the ACC and relegated to becoming an Independent. This leaves an opening which Notre Dame will fill. Even though South Bend, Indiana, is nowhere near the Atlantic Coast, I am tired of the whole \u201cWe play who we want.\u201d \n\nStill the best conference in football\nThe SEC will go relatively untouched in my new-look conferences, as it is pretty perfect. As I said earlier, I will allow Texas and Oklahoma to join. Louisville and Georgia Tech will also be joining their southern siblings. Football will still run through the South no matter what changes I make, however I think these shifts are the most agreeable and would make college football even more exciting. If only the NCAA had handed over the reins to a 19-year-old with no experience in sports management. What a shame.\n\n\u201cThe Big Ten Breakdown, Vol. II\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

And so that was obviously like I had to go to the ten to look at because that\u2019s where the best stuff is. But then also, like after I started like browsing around and I found like these cool patchwork pieces that I really like, interesting and like, you could tell put a lot of work into.\n\nUSC Freshman Alex Gechwill thought the FIA Fashion Fair was a great alternative in helping support local vendors and designers instead of purchasing fashions from mainstream retailers.\n\nAlex Gechwill: it\u2019s hard to find local vendors if you don\u2019t know about them. So, we\u2019re able to collectively put all of them in one place is really awesome.

Although national gas prices are dropping, California gas prices continue to rise. Today, the average gas price is $5.76. That\u2019s seven cents increase from the price on Monday, and it is climbing at the fastest rate it has risen all year, jumping almost 20 cents in the last 48 hours. In Los Angeles, specifically, the average gas price is $6.03 according to AAA.\n\nDoug Shupe, the Corporate Communications Manager for AAA in Los Angeles, touched upon why these gas prices are rising specifically in Southern California.\n\nDoug Shupe: We see the biggest increases recently because of our regional refinery issues. Here in southern California, we\u2019re like a fuel island. We don\u2019t have gas pipelines that can bring product to us. What we use here in SoCal is what is produced locally or what is imported from foreign countries and so when we can\u2019t use everything that\u2019s produced locally or our local refinery issues it can cause some problems.\n\nMicheal A. Mische, an economics professor at USC, talked to us about the effects of price increase to Los Angeles residents and the local economy.\n\nMicheal A. Mische: No matter what gas station goes to, people are complaining about the price and they have to make adjustments in their driving habits and in their consumption habits. I think the real negative impact is on those folks who have to drive to work. And who are hourly wage workers in particular. It\u2019s going to cut into the quality of life that you have and the cost of living that you know.\n\nMische gave his opinion on how residents can take matters into their own hands.\n\nMische: The citizens have to express their concerns. In the ballot box. And ultimately, go to the state legislature and ask for some type of regulatory relief from the high tax burden.\n\nWe talked to a couple locals at the pump today about their opinions on LA\u2019s gas price increase. Willie Walden wasn\u2019t a fan of the high cost.\n\nWillie Walden: I feel it\u2019s not a good thing. They need to go back to work. Well, I\u2019m 49 years old. I\u2019ve never seen gas prices this high before in my life.\n\nAnother local, Denise Smith, was concerned about how it affected the class divide.\n\nDenise Smith: It always affects maybe the poor and the middle class people because how do you get around it?

But now, the new general manager is looking to take the first steps to address some of these issues and increase the quality of their care.\n\nStaycee Dains, who was appointed to the position in June, spoke at the shelter\u2019s board of commissioners meeting last Tuesday about how she is looking to fix some of these issues. \u201cAnimals are suffering in our shelters, and so are those who care for them,\u201d Dains said in a statement released Sept. 12. \u201cWe keep animals in crates in hallways for days, weeks, or months at a time. Staff and volunteers are injured by animals subject to fear, anxiety, and stress. Our caregivers know that the animals receive substandard care, which harms their mental well-being. We cannot allow the suffering to continue.\u201d\n\nPlans include hiring dozens of new animal care technicians within the next couple of months. Dains also discussed potentially pausing handing out any new breeding permits to lessen the number of animals coming into the shelter.\n\nA dog lies in a kennel at the Chesterfield Square/South L.A. Animal Shelter on Sept. 13. Photo by Angelina Hicks\n\nThere are six L.A. city-run animal shelters. The closest to USC is the South L.A. shelter on West 60th Street off South Western Avenue.\n\nJennifer Primo, a visitor at the South L.A. facility on Sept. 13, came to the shelter looking to adopt a dog and was disappointed to see the state of overcrowding in the shelter. \u201cI [was] actually just here for the first time in years, and it was so sad seeing the dogs in cages with their own feces,\u201d Primo said. \u201cIt was really heartbreaking. I got really emotional.\u201d\n\nTwo kittens pause during mealtime at the Chesterfield Square/South L.A. Animal Shelter on Sept. 13. Photo by Angelina Hicks\n\nSome activists argue these plans aren\u2019t going far enough and won\u2019t make any real change to the issues prevalent in the shelter. Michelle Cornelius, who has been volunteering at the West Valley shelter since 2007, said the announcement doesn\u2019t make it clear what is actually going to be done to fix critical issues. \u201cWhen you really reflect back on it, you realize [Dains] didn\u2019t say anything of substance,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cI still don\u2019t know what her plan is to actually save lives.\u201d\n\nShe also said the most concrete parts of the plan \u2014 the hiring of new workers \u2014 shouldn\u2019t deserve applause. \u201cShe announced plans to fill dozens of vacant positions. Well, okay. That\u2019s when the city council gives you authorization to hire people,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cLiterally, that is your job. I don\u2019t know why you would get a pat on the back for hiring people to fill vacant positions.\u201d\n\nA cat looks around in a kennel at the Chesterfield Square/South L.A.

These are the problems Cornelius said need to be addressed immediately. \u201cWe need to get like 600 dogs out of the shelter right now,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cWe have a lot of dogs who are paired up to get two in a kennel. These kennels are meant for one large dog. When you put two dogs in a kennel, I think the public thinks, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s cute. They have a friend.\u2019 But it\u2019s not that way because the environment is so incredibly stressful.\u201d\n\nTwo large dogs are housed in the same kennel at the Chesterfield Square/South L.A.

Laufey\u2019s second studio album, \u201cBewitched\u201d, released two days prior on Friday, September 8, and set the record for the biggest jazz debut in Spotify history. Her fans, nicknamed \u201cLauvers\u201d, were given an itinerary of activities to participate in around their cities and towns throughout the day and were encouraged to post their adventures on social media with the hashtag \u201c#AVeryLaufeyDay.\u201d\n\nThe initial itinerary had a variety of activities so people worldwide could join in. The introspective activities had fans walk around their cities and towns and had strong ties to songs on \u201cBewitched.\u201d Fans were encouraged to leave a letter to their 13-year-old self in a copy of their favorite book at a bookstore referencing Laufey\u2019s song, \u201cA Letter To My 13 Year Old Self\u201d and write a promise to their future selves about their hopes and dreams referencing Laufey\u2019s song \u201cPromise\u201d as well as \u201cDreamer.\u201d\n\nLaufey addresses fans at Melrose Trading Post. Sophomore Arrianah Galvan celebrated in #AVeryLaufeyDay with her friends months after a special interaction she had with Laufey online. \u201cI actually choreographed a lyrical dance piece to her song \u2018Night Light\u2019 for last year\u2019s Troy Phi PACN and posted a snippet on TikTok and she commented on it,\u201d Galvan said. \u201cI was really happy she saw it because the lyrics really spoke to me. It\u2019s so cool to see how much she\u2019s grown in the music industry too since I started listening to her music, and I think she really deserves all the love she\u2019s getting for it.\u201d\n\nCertain cities were given special itineraries with specific locations to visit throughout the day. Los Angeles Lauvers were instructed to visit locations around West Hollywood, including Carrera Cafe, Book Soup, and Melrose Trading Post, where Laufey did a surprise meet-and-greet at a merchandising stand. #AVeryLaufeyDay ended at the Pan Pacific Park where Laufey performed new songs off of \u201cBewitched\u201d for hundreds of fans.\n\nSenior Jessica Labrador called the free concert experience \u201cmagical\u201d and was grateful to see Laufey with several other fans. \u201cIt was amazing to see how she has grown so much as an artist and to see how she was able to unite fans all over the world in a global event to honor her new album.\u201d Labrador said.\n\nLaufey signs vinyls at a pop-up meet and greet in L.A. Laufey\u2019s Pan Pacific Park performance marked the live debut for several songs off of \u201cBewitched.\u201d Fellow Lauver and Junior Abbe Pingol said he saw the concert as a full-circle moment after beginning to listen to her music in the last few months of 2022. \u201cI gravitate towards music that I can sing to and that has distinct melodies, so getting to yell out the lyrics and melody felt so fulfilling during the performance,\u201d Pingol said.\n\nGalvan said that the park performance was the clear highlight of the day and viewed #AVeryLaufeyDay as a rousing success for Laufey fans worldwide. \u201cAll the Lauvers were singing along,\u201d Galvan said. \u201cMy friends and I were crying or almost cried to \u2018Letter to My 13-Year-Old Self,\u2019 it was so unforgettable. I think it was super inspiring to hear her sing live and it was fun to go on a little girl\u2019s day. I love going to cafes, listening to music, and taking cute pictures with my friends, so it was the perfect way to spend my Sunday afternoon.\u201d\n\nThis past weekend, Laufey made a second appearance in LA performing with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. She previously collaborated with the LA Phil on \u201cCalifornia and Me\u201d, another song on \u201cBewitched\u201d. She is also performing November 17-19 in LA as a part of her world tour.\n```"}

Where is this money coming from?\n\nMeet USC\u2019s newest app: TapTap, a live trivia app that allows USC students to compete and win cash prizes. Since it launched in late August, there has been a growing number of students across campus who have been dropping everything to answer a series of 10 trivia questions every day at 5 p.m. Students have eight seconds to answer questions in various categories: campus life, sports, science, business, music, art, food, history, math, geography and pop culture. If they get all 10 questions correct, they win a portion of a cash prize pool that is split among all the winners and sent through Venmo. Each day\u2019s total prize pool is usually $100, but others have been as high as $200 with individual prizes ranging from $5 to $25 depending on the number of winners.\n\nKatie Crimmins, a sophomore studying business administration says she \u201cplans on playing every day,\u201d as she utilizes the app as an easy and fun way to make some extra money. \u201cI first found out [about the game] when my friend was freaking out when it turned 5 p.m. and started playing,\u201d Crimmins said. \u201cWinning doesn\u2019t seem that hard, and the money could add up fast each day.\u201d\n\nOther students like Sachin Patel, a sophomore studying business administration, have already started making money through the app. He said that out of the three times he has played the game, he has won once. His prize was about $5.\n\nHowever, the amount of daily winners, along with the fact that TapTap is free to download, has led students to question how the app has been able to give out around $2000 in its first month of operation. \u201cI definitely have thought about where the money is coming from,\u201d Crimmins said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like TapTap\u2019s questions are anything but general trivia questions, and the app doesn\u2019t have embedded ads from what I have seen.\u201d\n\nOther students, like Patel, theorized that the money could be coming from investors. \u201cHonestly, I am not sure where they are getting money from,\u201d he said. \u201cIt possibly could be from an investment before the app launched that they are using for the daily games. I have never seen an ad in the game.\u201d\n\nGordon Sun and James Oldenburg, the CEO and COO of TapTap, shared their intentions behind the app and its operation. TapTap currently consists of a team of four people who have previously worked at notable companies like Tesla, Amazon and Cameo. The reinvention of a game show on a digital platform was created to stand out in comparison to other apps and combat doom scrolling. Instead of taking up hours of your time, they hope to generate conversations and bring people together through \u201cbite-sized time.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are just telling us, \u2018This is the only five minutes per day where I can get my roommates to focus and just gather in the atrium or get in the lobby, get around, gather on my porch, and actually have fun.\u2019\u201d Oldenburg feels that TapTap appeals to all students and helps to establish a sense of community. \u201cWe think freshmen like this, too,\u201d Oldenburg said. \u201cThey\u2019re all hanging out in dorms, and it\u2019s a great opportunity to play with your dorm mates or homies.\u201d\n\nSun and Oldenburg further revealed that they have funded the prize money through fundraising venture capital from a variety of investors, including Wonder Ventures and angel investors. More notably, Mr. Beast\u2019s Feastables Chocolate Company, Discord and Cameo have also backed the company in its fundraising efforts.\n\nRegarding concerns over cheating, Oldenburg, who writes the trivia questions each day, shares that they are implementing a variety of tactics to prevent it. The time to answer each question was cut from ten to eight seconds and new question formats that utilize graphics have been implemented to prevent students from looking up the answers.\n\nCurrently, the app is exclusive to USC and its students and alumni. Oldenburg and Sun feel that \u201cthere\u2019s no cooler school than USC to start.\u201d With close proximity to the app\u2019s base in Los Angeles, paired with the well-rounded campus life of academics, sports, Greek life, clubs and diverse student body, TapTap is proud to claim USC as its starting point.\n\nMoving forward, Sun and Oldenburg hope to launch the app in other LA schools and eventually go nationwide. \u201cI think in 12 months, we want to be in the top 100 schools in the U.S.,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start here in California [and] extend to schools like LMU, UCLA [and] Stanford.\u201d\n```"}

For head coach Brad Keller, who worked at UCLA prior to taking over the Trojans\u2019 program, it certainly brings up a lot of emotion. \u201c[I]t\u2019s loaded for me because I have so many friends and people that I love at UCLA, so it\u2019s not something for me, but I do want to win,\u201d Keller said. \u201cYou want to win the game.\u201d \n\nDespite the emotion, Keller is excited to take on several of his former UCLA players in what is expected to be a very competitive and physical match on both sides of the net. When he served as the Bruins\u2019 associate head coach, he played a big role in bringing these athletes to Westwood. \u201cThere are still players on that [UCLA] team that I recruited,\u201d Keller said. \u201cSo seeing them be successful and seeing them be happy, and seeing my kids [at USC] be happy, and seeing a healthy rivalry where the local community can come and watch high level volleyball and good role models is probably my favorite part of this.\u201d \n\nFor freshman outside hitter London Wijay, who is playing in her first Bruin matchup, the excitement of getting to take part in such a storied rivalry is a big motivation in wanting to do well on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m super excited to see what it\u2019s going to be like,\u201d Wijay said. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything like it, so I can\u2019t wait to play them. And they\u2019re a great team. So it\u2019s gonna be really fun.\u201d \n\nUCLA recently hired Alred \u201cAlfee\u201d Reft as its new head coach last December. Keller knows that USC will have its hands full against its crosstown rival as the Bruins are off to an impressive 8-2 start. Reft has an impressive coaching resume, which includes leading San Diego to the Final Four last season as the Toreros\u2019 associate head coach while also working as an assistant coach for the USA Women\u2019s National team. \u201cVery impressed with Alfee, he\u2019s one of the coaches of the National Team, so he comes from good systems and good training,\u201d Keller said of his UCLA counterpart. \u201cThat clearly shows from watching video of them. They\u2019re very good at what they do, so it\u2019s not about changing, it\u2019s about just prepping for what they do and what we need to do.\u201d \n\nDespite the hot start from the Bruins, Keller says that the Trojans prioritize daily improvement, consistent work ethic and accountability amongst teammates. Wijay just won her first Pac-12 Freshman of the Week honors. She contributed 22 kills and 18 digs at the Boilermaker Challenge to help USC defeat both Illinois and Purdue. She knows that the positive mindset and strong bond amongst the team will help it as the Trojans trek their way into enemy territory as they enter Wednesday\u2019s match on a five match win streak. \u201cI think we all are just having such good attitudes on the court and our practices are getting better and better, so I think that the intensity at practice is carrying onto the game, and honestly, our team is like a family,\u201d Wijay said. \u201cWe hang out with each other outside of volleyball, and I think that\u2019s what makes us continue to be great together.\u201d \n\nThe rivalry between the two schools will continue to bring excitement and feature talented athletes on both sides of the net in the years to come. For Keller, this season\u2019s matchups against UCLA will be particularly important because it will be the last season that the Trojans and Bruins face each other as members of the Pac-12. \u201cIt\u2019s just two good teams that are doing well that represent the Pac one last year, it\u2019s the last time we\u2019re gonna represent the Pac,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI know we\u2019re gonna play each other down the road in the Big Ten, but it\u2019s the last time with the Pac-12, so I\u2019m looking forward to these two matches.\u201d \n\nThe first edition of the Crosstown Showdown this year is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. on Wednesday at Pauley Pavilion.\n```"}

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\n\nBy Matthew Andrade\nSeptember 19, 2023 at 12:01 pm PDT\n\n\u201cShout\u201d is a column by Matthew Andrade about college football.\n\nDown 11 points in the third quarter and in front of a sold-out home crowd, Colorado was on the brink of having its season come crashing down in disastrous fashion. Lil Wayne had made his way to Boulder. The Rock was in the house. Every celebrity who wasn\u2019t there was still tweeting about the game from the comfort of their own couch. Folsom Field was the center of the sports universe Saturday night. And then, the Buffaloes broke through to survive in double overtime by way of an 18-yard touchdown pass from junior quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Students rush the field. You can\u2019t even see the most recognizable man in college sports \u2014 Colorado head coach Deion Sanders \u2014 in the midst of the madness.\n\nWhat a win! What a game! Not so fast, my friend. If you scrolled through social media after this game, you\u2019d find plenty of people talking about how incredible the game was or how great of a job Deion Sanders is doing at Colorado. But you\u2019d also find plenty of people criticizing the Buffs for struggling against Colorado State. These people want to say Colorado\u2019s story isn\u2019t impressive. After all, how can this team not put away a lowly Mountain West program?\n\nTo these people, I\u2019d like to ask several questions but top of mind is, did you watch any Colorado football last year? That answer must be no. And that\u2019s understandable \u2014 this program went 1-11 last year! Colorado was so bad in 2022 that the Buffaloes had a point differential of -349 \u2014 the equivalent of losing every game by more than 29 points. That\u2019s no better than how an FCS team would do given Colorado\u2019s schedule.\n\nColorado didn\u2019t just struggle last year either \u2014 look at the program\u2019s 10-year tenure in the Pac-12. The Buffaloes have gone to a whopping two bowl games in that entire stretch. That\u2019s a number you can count to with just a USC victory sign, which reminds me that I should mention USC is a perfect 16-0 all time against Colorado. Save for the 90s and a couple of other seasons sprinkled throughout Colorado\u2019s history, this is just not a football program that has gained any traction at all over its lifespan. Sure, there\u2019s a national championship banner waving in Boulder, but success has been incredibly hard to come by for Colorado. It\u2019s just the truth.\n\nWhat Deion Sanders is doing at Colorado is incredible. It really is. This program is actually being talked about at the national level and not just to be made fun of as the Pac-12\u2032s resident doormat. Last week, College Gameday made its way to Boulder for the first time since before Lee Corso even made headgear picks. Fox\u2019s Big Noon Kickoff set up shop across campus to compete with Gameday, and both crowds were packed. Heck, even 60 Minutes did a feature on Deion that aired Sunday night. All of that is a success on its own. Making Colorado a program worth talking about was a tall enough task without factoring in the actual goal of the whole thing \u2014 to win football games. But that hasn\u2019t been the challenge we once thought it would be, either.\n\nThe Buffs pulled out a gritty win in a tough road environment at TCU in Week 1, stormed past Nebraska for a convincing 22-point victory in Week 2, and, yes, had to force double overtime to take down Colorado State in Week 3. But if you\u2019re not keeping that in perspective, you\u2019re doing Deion a massive disservice. Colorado\u2019s lone non-Power 5 opponent last year, Air Force, beat Colorado by 31 points. I don\u2019t care how bad Colorado State is supposed to be. They could practically be a pee wee football team for all I care.\n\nHeading into the season, I thought Colorado would be lucky to get to 2-1 through three weeks. Now they\u2019re 3-0 and they look like they could give a lot of teams fits. No one expected Deion to take Colorado to the College Football Playoff in year one. Everyone was excited to see what his team would look like, but no one said the Buffaloes were a legit threat to win much of anything. Now, I\u2019d be surprised if Colorado doesn\u2019t get to six wins. If you\u2019ve been taking notes, you\u2019d realize that would mark just the third bowl berth for Colorado in its Pac-12 era. That\u2019s in Deion\u2019s first year and after taking over a 1-11 program.\n\nIf you still can\u2019t find Colorado\u2019s turnaround impressive, you may be living under a boulder larger than the city. This program was an afterthought and is now the epicenter of the college football universe, as a result of what\u2019s happening on the field and off. What Deion Sanders is doing will likely never be replicated ever again and is the most captivating story in all of sports. So the least you could do is give him his theme music.\n\n\u201cShout\u201d runs every Tuesday.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Nico Perez)\n\nBy Anthony Bottino September 18, 2023 at 8:08 pm PDT\n\n\u201cUSC Unsung Heroes\u201d is a column by Anthony Bottino that talks about elite USC athletes who aren\u2019t on one of the school\u2019s Division 1 teams.\n\nHave you ever dreaded the idea of doing cardio exercises like running, biking or swimming? What about doing all of them one after the other? To make it even more challenging, what if it involved a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride and a 26.2-mile run? Sounds impossible, right? Well, for someone like Nico Perez, it is very achievable.\n\nNico, 23 years old, is a first-year master\u2019s student studying mathematics. He also attended USC for his bachelor\u2019s degree. USC has been excellent for Nico academically, but it\u2019s also a part of what led him to become a triathlete.\n\nNico is an international student who spent the first 18 years of his life in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. So when the time came to choose a college, USC was an unexpected decision. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really in the plans until later on in high school. Until senior year, I was just planning on applying to Brazilian universities,\u201d Nico said. \u201cA couple of buddies of mine from my class were applying, and I got excited talking to them about it and managed to rush through the process. It was a bit of a last-minute decision.\u201d\n\nAt first glance, someone might think Nico spent his life in Brazil running and biking around the country\u2019s biggest city, but that\u2019s not the case at all. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything in high school at all. Like, literally, I was sedentary,\u201d Nico said. \u201cIn high school, I studied a lot. Senior year, I did gym and some pickup soccer games with my friends, but that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nUpon Nico\u2019s arrival at USC, he didn\u2019t immediately take up triathlon or cardiovascular sports. He went to the gym more, but he still hadn\u2019t found that passion for triathlons \u2014 not until the COVID-19 pandemic hit.\n\nDuring COVID, he went back home to Brazil, where he finally started running. Since all the gyms were closed, he had to resort to running for exercise. At first, he started with a 5K; then, a few days later, a 7K; and the following week, a 10K. He displayed a clear talent right away, because doing that with limited running experience is not easy by any means.\n\nNico recognized it too, because then, on a whim, he signed up for the Los Angeles Marathon. \u201cLooking back it was a stupid decision, but it got me here,\u201d Nico said. \u201cI started training really well with a running group back home. It got me in the rhythm of training.\u201d\n\nAfter spending a year in Brazil due to COVID, Nico brought his newfound love for running back to USC, where he then took up biking. He began cycling to complement his running training for the marathon and immediately became hooked on it. Now, all he needed was swimming.\n\nNico finally joined the USC Triathlon team during his junior year of college. That\u2019s when everything changed for Nico. He became an extremely committed member of the team and found a new home in triathlon.\n\nWith the help of his new training partners and SC Triathlon coach Corey Norris, he became a seasoned triathlete. While it may seem like Nico was a natural, he definitely put in the work to earn his spot on the team. He committed to working out every day and pushing himself past his limits. He never shied away from tough workouts or trying something new, especially with biking and swimming, for which Nico put in a ton of extra effort.\n\nIt was time for a new challenge, though. After realizing he liked the Olympic distance races more than the sprint distances, he wanted to test himself in a 70.3 Ironman. This race made Nico a star.\n\nIn Nico\u2019s first 70.3, he qualified for the World Championship. \u201cIt was a big surprise to me. I finished by myself and asked this random lady to check my place, and I was first,\u201d Nico said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nNico Perez (pictured right) and Olivia Vallone with 70.3 Podium awards at Ironman 70.3 Arizona on Oct. 21, 2022. (Photo courtesy of Nico Perez)\n\nA year later, Nico arrived in Lahti, Finland, for the Ironman 70.3 World Championship. He dedicated the school year and the summer to training. He constantly worked out, and by the end, he was in the best shape of his life. While he wasn\u2019t expecting to win, he aimed to make the most of it and demonstrate why he deserved to be there.\n\nAll the hard work paid off, because on the grandest stage of them all, he raced a personal-best time of 4:39:36. To put that into perspective, the average time for a male is about 6 hours.\n\n\u201cAt the finish line, I felt very fulfilled, because I delivered the best performance of my life, and in that place, it was amazing.\u201d\n\nEven after achieving the biggest accomplishment of his life, Nico took no rest or days off and immediately transitioned into full Ironman training. Training for this is much different, because the race now consists of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride, and a 26.2-mile run which is twice the distance of 70.3. It\u2019s undeniably one of the most grueling and challenging feats a person can undertake.\n\nHowever, Nico welcomes the challenge and eagerly looks forward to it. Just like everything else, Nico is relentlessly training for it.\n\n\u201cMonday is swim and bike; Tuesday is gym, run and swim; Wednesday is swim and bike as well; Thursday is gym, run and swim; Friday just swim; Saturday is a brick (Bike and Run); and Sunday is a long run,\u201d Nico said. \u201cSwim is like 10,000-12,000 yards per week, bike is like 150-200 miles and the run is about 30-40 miles.\u201d\n\nGoing into the race, Nico is thinking he has a shot to qualify for Ironman Worlds, but he\u2019s more focused on doing his best and finishing his first full Ironman.\n\nWith the Ironman a little over a month away on Oct. 22, Nico is fully engulfed in his training and had to move on quickly from the glory of competing in the World Championship. However, the SC Triathlon team hasn\u2019t moved on. Nico is still a constant presence on the team, and they are beyond proud of Nico for his performance and making it to the World Championship.\n\nEveryone who knows Nico has full confidence that he will finish and have a spectacular time in the full Ironman. He serves as a leader and huge inspiration to everyone on the team.\n\nFrom someone who used to rarely work out to becoming a world-class athlete, Nico has truly transformed his life into something extraordinary. He accomplished all of this while proudly representing his two homes: Brazil and USC.\n\n\u201cUSC Unsung Heroes\u201d runs every other Monday.\n```"}

Where does each contender stack up?\n\nUSC sprinted past Stanford 56-10 in Week 2 to open Pac-12 conference play. (Photo by Micah Chow)\n\nBy Will Camardella September 18, 2023 at 6:30 pm PDT\n\n\u201cPac-12 Power Rankings\u201d is a column by Will Camardella ranking the Pac-12 football teams on a week-to-week basis. If it was not 10 months from completely dissolving, one might argue that the Pac-12 Conference has never been in a stronger position in college football. Through the first three weeks of the season, the Conference of Champions has a collective 7-3 record in non-conference Power Five matchups. No other conference has an above-.500 record in those games. Eight of its teams are ranked in the current AP Top 25, the most of any conference.\n\nAfter giving each of these programs three games to show their depth, I will be ranking the Pac-12 each week. Unlike some people\u2019s approach to national rankings, I will not be basing these on which team is currently \u201cmost deserving\u201d of a spot in the College Football Playoff. The best overall football team will occupy the top spot of my list. Strength of schedule is an important tool for making those determinations, but not the end-all, be-all.\n\nWith all that said, let\u2019s get into it.\n\n1. USC Trojans (3-0, 1-0 Pac-12)\n\nUSC\u2019s competition through the first three weeks will not blow anyone away, but this team has looked flawless on the football field thus far. Caleb Williams has followed up his Heisman season by leading the highest-scoring offense in the nation, averaging a shade under 60 points per game. If that mark does not sound crazy enough, know that Williams has taken a grand total of six snaps in the fourth quarter this year.\n\nThe Trojans went into this season with defensive concerns, but after a rocky showing in Week 0, Alex Grinch\u2019s unit has bounced back in a big way. The front seven was an absolute force in wins over Nevada and Stanford against both the run and the pass, and the 10 points allowed to the Cardinal were the fewest since Lincoln Riley took over as head coach.\n\nThe secondary has appeared vulnerable defending the deep ball early on, but if there\u2019s a defense in this conference that can slow down USC enough for that to matter, I haven\u2019t seen it.\n\n2. Washington Huskies (3-0)\n\nI praised USC for appropriately making inferior competition look like inferior competition through three games, and I can give the same credit to Washington thus far. The Huskies\u2019 41-7 drubbing of Michigan State in East Lansing is exactly how a college football powerhouse is supposed to handle a program in turmoil.\n\nIn a week where Georgia, Florida State and Texas all struggled with mediocre opponents, taking care of business like that should not be taken for granted. Michael Penix Jr. leads the nation in passing yards with over 1,300. He has three receivers with over 300 yards already, and his tight end Jack Westover has been a force in the red zone with four touchdowns.\n\nMy only concern with the Huskies thus far is that they have not been a great third-down team, but this offense has been so explosive in the passing game that it hasn\u2019t been a significant issue.\n\n3. Oregon Ducks (3-0)\n\nSpeaking of explosive offenses, Oregon is averaging 58 points per game so far, good for second in the country. In his fifth college season, Bo Nix\u2019s experience is showing. He can make any throw on the football field, but has yet to turn the ball over.\n\nHis knock at Auburn was that he could not win big games on the road, but a Week 2 win against Texas Tech has alleviated such concerns for me. I have also been really impressed with how well the Ducks have run the football. They are averaging over seven yards per carry on the ground and nearly 230 yards per game with Bucky Irving and Jordan James.\n\nWith a ground game that can wear down a defense and a veteran quarterback who can take the top off it, Oregon will be a formidable challenge to either of the top two teams.\n\n4. Utah Utes (3-0)\n\nThe Utes are as well-coached as you will find in college football with Kyle Whittingham, but this team has shown more warts thus far than any of the top three. Their Week 1 win over Florida looks a lot better on paper now that the Gators knocked off Tennessee, but there were a lot of holes in Utah\u2019s performance that I did not like.\n\nFlorida had numerous back-breaking penalties that evening and was 1-for-13 on third downs, but only lost by 13 points. The next week, Utah nearly blew a seven-point lead to Baylor despite the Bears having the ball at their own 27 with under 10 seconds remaining.\n\nUtah\u2019s instability at quarterback is my biggest long-term concern. Nate Johnson has appeared to have taken the reins, but he has proved very limited as a passer. If this offense starts humming once Cam Rising returns to the football field, I will not hold the team\u2019s early-season struggles against them. However, that has not yet happened, and this iteration of the Utes is not as good at the three teams above them.\n\n5. Oregon State Beavers (3-0)\n\nThe Beavers\u2019 non-conference schedule of UC Davis, San Diego State and San Jos\u00e9 State will not blow anyone away, but this team has looked rock solid in year six of the Jonathan Smith era. This offense may not be as explosive in the passing game as some of the teams in this conference, but a 41 points per game average is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nThe scariest part of Oregon State\u2019s play thus far has been how good its defensive front has been against the run and the pass. The Beavers have the fewest rushing yards allowed in the Pac-12 and lead the conference with 12 sacks.\n\nA team that will be facing the sport\u2019s elite quarterbacks on a week in, week out basis is going to need to disrupt them if they want a chance to pull an upset, and this team is well equipped to do just that.\n\n6. Washington State Cougars (3-0)\n\nFor a team that won a multi-score victory over a ranked B1G team two weeks ago, Washington State is flying a little under the radar. Cameron Ward has a 9:0 touchdown-to-interception ratio and a completion percentage above 70.\n\nI do have concerns about the Cougars on the defensive side. While their run defense has been comparable to Oregon State this year, they give up a ton of explosive passing plays. In the Pac-12, only Stanford allows more passing yards per game to their opponents.\n\nThat is a recipe for disaster for a team that will face Nix, Penix and Shedeur Sanders before this season is through. Despite my concerns, Washington State has handled its business thus far, winning a huge non-conference home game against Wisconsin and blowing out Colorado State on the road.\n\n7. Colorado Buffaloes (3-0)\n\nWhen it comes to entertainment value and net improvement from the year prior, the Buffaloes are the best story in college football this year. When it comes to performance on the field, I am not convinced that Colorado is above average in this conference.\n\nShedeur Sanders is an extremely clutch quarterback \u2014 as Saturday night\u2019s 98-yard drive will show you \u2014 but this offense strikes me as extremely one-dimensional. The Buffaloes are dead last in the Pac-12 in rushing yards per game through three weeks, and their pass blocking has been suspect.\n\nI also have a tough time seeing this defense stand up against the top teams in this conference. They allowed over 40 points to TCU before Travis Hunter went down, and they will now be without one of the nation\u2019s top corners against USC and Oregon, the two highest-scoring offenses in America.\n\nNeeding two overtimes to beat Colorado State was the first sign that Deion Sanders\u2019 squad was coming back to earth, and I expect the Buffs to be out of the AP poll two weeks from now.\n\n8. UCLA Bruins (3-0)\n\nIt took a little bit of time for Chip Kelly to fully hand the reins to Dante Moore at quarterback, but doing so has appeared to be the right decision for UCLA. After throwing a pick in his first game against Coastal Carolina, Moore has thrown for five touchdowns with no turnovers in a pair of blowout wins.\n\nThe Bruins\u2019 roster has been a blessing for a quarterback still adjusting to the college game, as their proficiency in the run game has kept opposing defenses very honest. UCLA has the third-best rushing offense in the NCAA, averaging over 270 yards per game on the ground.\n\nAs a result, the Bruins have had high offensive success rates in both standard and passing downs and an offense averaging over 40 points per game with a true freshman under center.\n\nI worry about their defense\u2019s tendency to give up explosive plays in the rushing and the passing game, which is bad news considering the other teams that are in this conference. I am also not sure that Moore is ready to go toe-to-toe with the other elite quarterbacks in the Pac-12 just yet, hence UCLA\u2019s lower ranking.\n\n9. Arizona Wildcats (2-1)\n\nArizona lost a tight game on the road to Mississippi State, but bounced back nicely by handling UTEP at home, 31-10. This is Jayden de Laura\u2019s fourth season playing in the Pac-12, but he is still making freshman mistakes.\n\nHis 8:5 touchdown-to-interception ratio is not going to cut it in this conference, and the Wildcats would likely be undefeated if he had not coughed the ball up four times against the Bulldogs.\n\nI will note that these are not new struggles for de Laura; he threw 13 picks in 2022. I like Jedd Fisch as a head coach, and I think he is moving this program in the right direction. However, given the competition in the Pac-12, the Wildcats are not ready to compete on a high enough level to be a factor this year.\n\n10. Cal Golden Bears (2-1)\n\nOf the \u201cbad\u201d teams in this conference, Cal has done the best job avoiding embarrassment. They blew out North Texas on the road in Week 1 and scored 31 unanswered to come back and defeat Idaho last weekend.\n\nTheir best asset has been the run game; the Golden Bears are second to UCLA in the conference in rushing yards per game. Cal simply does not have the talent that any of the teams above them do to be a contender this season, but it has acquitted itself much better so far than the two squads below.\n\n11. Stanford Cardinal (1-2, 0-1 Pac-12)\n\nBesides USC, Stanford is the only team in the Pac-12 to play a conference game this season, and it went rather poorly. The Cardinal\u2019s 56-10 loss was, amazingly, not as close as the final score indicated; the Trojans could have scored 80 that night if they had wanted to.\n\nTo follow that up with a home loss to Sacramento State should already raise some questions about first-year head coach Troy Taylor. Stanford has a few talented pieces on offense with Benjamin Yurosek and E.J. Smith, but their results on the field thus far have been nothing short of horrid.\n\n12. Arizona State Sun Devils (1-2)\n\nWhile Stanford has looked terrible in the last two weeks, Arizona State is the only team in this conference that has not played a single good football game. They managed to squeak by Southern Utah in Week 1, only to follow that game up with a shutout loss to Fresno State and a 12-point loss to an Oklahoma State team that just got blown out by South Alabama.\n\nThe Sun Devils self-imposed a bowl ban for the 2023 season due to recruiting violations. That punishment will not matter much, given that they will be hard pressed to finish 3-9 this season.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson)\n\nBy Drake Lee, Janette Fu and Jasmine Kwok September 18, 2023 at 6:21 pm PDT\n\nBody camera footage was released last week showing Seattle police officer Daniel Auderer joking about how much the city would have to pay for the death of Jaahnavi Kandula, a 23-year-old Indian student who was killed by another officer on Northeastern University\u2019s Seattle campus. Officer Kevin Dave was responding to a 911 call on January 23 when he struck and killed Kandula. His patrol car was going 74 mph in a 25 mph zone, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\u201c[Write a check for] eleven thousand dollars. She was 26 anyway. She had limited value,\u201d said Auderer, vice president of the Seattle Police Officers Guild. \u201cWithout context, this audio is horrifying and has no place in a civil society, the guild said in a tweet on Friday. \u201cIt sullens the profession of law enforcement, the reputation of all Seattle Police officers and paints Seattle in a terrible light.\u201d\n\nAuderer wrote that he intended the comment as \u201ca mockery of lawyers,\u201d according to KTTH, a radio station based in Seattle. \u201cI laughed at the ridiculousness of how these incidents are litigated and the ridiculousness of how I watched these incidents play out as two parties bargain over a tragedy.\u201d\n\nDespite his explanation, the community and the nation were outraged at the remarks. Displaying posters that read \u201cJail Killer Cops\u201d and \u201cConvict Kevin Dave,\u201d protesters assembled on Thursday at the crosswalk where Kandula was killed. The Consulate General of India in San Francisco called for \u201ca thorough investigation & action against those involved in this tragic case.\u201d\n\nSome members of the Northeastern University community have voiced their concerns. One former NU student, Kiran Jivani, created a petition to call for more accountability from the Seattle police department, Dave, Auderer and the university.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked with the people at the Seattle Police Department, and I\u2019ve talked to people at their accountability office. The greater implication is how are police officers treating community members in this case?\u201d Emily Spatz, a sophomore at Northeastern studying journalism and political science, said in an interview with Annenberg Media.\n\nThe video\u2019s reach extended well beyond the Seattle and Northeastern University communities. According to UCLA professor of history and Asian American studies Vnay Lal, the bodycam footage has national implications.\n\n\u201cI think there has to be enormous pressure placed by public bodies and public institutions and by the citizens everywhere to ensure that the forces that are allegedly out there to preserve the sanctity of human life are actually doing so,\u201d Lal said.\n\nAsian Americans are the fastest-growing population group in the U.S., according to Pew Research Center. However, targeted incidents such as this one are increasing according to Lal.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be construed by many people within the wider Asian community as another instance of the devaluation of Asian American lives, and in this case of South Asian life,\u201d he said.\n\nStudents have commented on how Kandula\u2019s death and incidents of police brutality have impacted their university. In speaking up, students hope to empower those in the South Asian community.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve become sort of desensitized to things like this and news like this because we experience it so much everyday,\u201d said Rudra Saigal, a USC junior studying economics and international relations. \u201cI think a great part about it is just telling them that enough is enough, and these are the facts of the situation and that these are the resources that you can utilize.\u201d\n\nAs a senator in USC\u2019s undergraduate student government, Saigal wants to pass a resolution condemning police brutality and asking the university to release a public statement calling for justice for Kandula.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s affected so many South Asian students, and South Asians are such a big population on this campus, but we are often underrepresented when it comes to student government and when it comes to different university resources and policies,\u201d he said.\n\nThis incident speaks to the significance of bodycam footage and officer accountability.\n\n\u201cI feel like over the past several years, all of the police accountability we\u2019ve had has resulted from police bodycam footage,\u201d commented Spatz, the Northeastern student who covered this incident in the university\u2019s student newspaper, The Huntington News.\n\nSpatz said the Office of Police Accountability (OPA) is investigating Officer Auderer, who has had 18 other incidents and complaints against him that have also been investigated, four of which were sustained. As for Officer Dave, the OPA was supposed to release their findings and any disciplinary actions in August, but nothing ever came out of it, according to Spatz. The investigation is still ongoing and charges have not been filed.\n\n\u201cI think police in general in this country are really heavily protected,\u201d said Saigal. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t really know what to expect, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the decision is not in our favor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are officers saying when they think they\u2019re not being recorded and when they\u2019re actually not being recorded?\u201d Spatz asked. \u201cI think that any time that an officer is on duty, they should have their bodycams on, or some kind of audio recording device because, I mean, this is just unacceptable.\u201d\n\nNortheastern University will hold a vigil in the coming days to remember Kandula\u2019s life. The university will award Kandula\u2019s degree posthumously and present it to her family.\n\n\u201cThe degree would be nice. It\u2019s a nice, symbolic gesture, but it doesn\u2019t really guarantee any tangible, substantive support to her parents, to her family,\u201d said Saigal. \u201cThis is just something that you can\u2019t really make up for in just a symbolic gesture.\u201d\n```"}

The price increased by 8.5 cents overnight Friday.\n\nA source from AAA told KCRA news that unseasonably hot temperatures in the west could be a factor of the gas prices as it could limit the production in oil refineries. Another factor that could have contributed to the increase in gas prices could be due to the tragic recent flooding of Libya, which will temporarily halt oil exports from this OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) nation, a source told CBS News.\n\nCalifornians are no strangers to expensive gas prices. California gas prices have been atop the nation\u2019s average prices for decades because of its higher taxes and regulations for clean fuel, according to the LA Times. These prices add onto the frustration of L.A. traffic among commuters, and has forced some Annenberg students to resort to other means of transportation to combat the skyrocketing prices.\n\n\u201cI have thought of using [a] bicycle.

McCarthy\u2019s announcement comes in the wake of the indictment of Hunter Biden, the president\u2019s son, and increased pressure on the speaker from far-right Republican House members threatening to remove him.\n\nAccording to McCarthy\u2019s Speaker of the House website, \u201cThe Biden family was afforded special treatment by the Biden administration \u2014 treatment they would not otherwise have received if they were not related to the President.\u201d\n\nStudents at USC have mixed feelings about the impeachment inquiry. \u201cI don\u2019t really see [Biden] as a good president. I think I would support the idea of impeachment,\u201d said Lance Jones, a freshman studying animation and digital arts. \u201cWhen Biden first became president, the first thing he did was cut the middle class... I really just did not like that.\u201d\n\nSkyler Pak, a senior studying communication and philosophy, politics and economics, expressed support for Trump\u2019s impeachment, but not Biden\u2019s. \u201cThere\u2019s been several indictments against [Trump] and many illegal actions, and I don\u2019t think Biden\u2019s actions have been that intense,\u201d Pak said.\n\nSophia Schreiber, a business administration major, said she has not had much time to keep up with impeachment proceedings. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why Biden is getting impeached,\u201d Schreiber said. \u201cI\u2019m not a big politics girl.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment inquiry \u2014 which will be conducted by the House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means committees \u2014 are expected to focus on President Biden\u2019s alleged collaboration in illicit foreign business dealings that Republicans are saying were conducted by Hunter Biden.\n\nThis is not the first time Republicans on the hill have sought to investigate Biden\u2019s alleged involvement in his son\u2019s business engagements with overseas firms. According to the Associated Press, House Republicans have emphasized a 2019 bribery claim alleging that President Biden pulled strings in Ukraine to stop an investigation into Burisma, an oil and gas company that Hunter Biden was on the board of.\n\nThe Department of Justice investigated the bribery claim for eight months during Trump\u2019s presidency, but closed the matter.\n\nSome Democrats have mocked the decision by Speaker of the House McCarthy to launch the impeachment inquiry. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., told NBC News that \u201cafter seven months of this wild goose chase, aimless fishing expedition, they haven\u2019t found anything on Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans are divided in their support of the impeachment inquiry. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., cited a lack of evidence linking Biden to his son\u2019s business dealings as a reason to not move forward. \u201cI don\u2019t see the glaring evidence that says we need to move forward, I didn\u2019t see it in the Trump case and voted against it. I don\u2019t see it in this case,\u201d Capito told CNN.\n\nThough the inquiry is likely to draw heavy media attention, the trial is unlikely to result in a conviction and removal of President Biden from his post, said Robert Shrum, the director of the Center for the Political Future at Dornsife. He said that Hunter Biden\u2019s indictment will likely result in probation. \u201cThis is a case that is almost never brought to a federal criminal level,\u201d said Shrum. \u201cThis is a father who has had a very troubled son, who has done everything he can to try to help him. I think a lot of Americans have been through that.\u201d\n\nAnnenberg Media reached out to Kevin McCarthy\u2019s Bakersfield district office for comment, but did not hear back.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry \u2014 which could last anywhere from a few months to a year, according to Associated Press \u2014 will proceed as President Biden launches his 2024 reelection bid.\n```"}

Galaxy 4-2. LAFC entered the match third in the Western Conference but had lost its last three games, while the Galaxy had enjoyed good form, losing just once in its last eleven. Despite their losing streak, the MLS Cup Champions remained ten points ahead of their rivals from Carson, California.\n\nForward Denis Bouanga opened the scoring for the deserving Black and Gold following a cross from left back Diego Palacios in the 23rd minute, but the Galaxy responded just twelve seconds after play was restarted, tying the game 1-1. Midfielder Diego Fag\u00fandez found himself in space before playing a through ball to English striker Billy Sharp, who turned in his third goal for the Galaxy in his first start after signing from Sheffield United on August 15.\n\n\u201cWe were kind of in between and it was a moment of ball watch where they find [Fag\u00fandez] in the pocket,\u201d said LAFC goalkeeper Maxime Cr\u00e9peau. Cr\u00e9peau also made his first start of the season, ten months removed from breaking his leg in last year\u2019s MLS Cup Final.\n\n\u201cThe guy has been grinding for the better part of a year now, trying to get back on the field,\u201d said defender Ryan Hollingshead of his teammate. Hollingshead reclaimed the lead for LAFC with his weaker left foot in the 33rd minute, but the Galaxy equalized once more in the second half when another defender, Maya Yoshida, headed past Cr\u00e9peau.\n\nThe visiting Galaxy, despite having 62% possession, looked the inferior side throughout, registering just two shots on goal to LAFC\u2019s nine. \u201cObviously when it\u2019s 2-2, it\u2019s always a little different, but we still felt very good about where we were in the game and that we always have the ability to score a goal and create enough chances to win this game,\u201d said LAFC manager Steve Cherundolo.\n\nGalaxy manager Greg Vanney agreed, saying his team looked a step slower than its rivals, especially in the first half. \u201cWe were just a little bit behind the game and too opened up, and they were controlling the middle of the field,\u201d Vanney said after the defeat.\n\nCherundolo\u2019s side took the lead a third time in the 75th minute when Denis Bouanga capitalized on a misguided backpass by defender Chris Mavinga. Bouanga\u2019s second goal of the game tied him for the league lead in goals with 14 and marked his seventh multigoal game of the season in all competitions. By contrast, not one Galaxy player has had a multigoal game all season in the MLS, highlighting the attacking woes that have kept Los Gal\u00e1cticos out of the playoff picture.\n\nWith less than ten minutes to go, a pair of substitutes sealed the win for LAFC when Mario Gonz\u00e1lez and Timothy Tillman combined to set the home fans ablaze for a fourth time. Following the win, LAFC finds itself in a position to challenge for the top spot in the Western Conference. The Black and Gold are just six points behind conference leaders St. Louis, and have played one less game.\n\nThe Galaxy, now with a loss and two draws in its last three games, has seen playoff chances fall to 32 percent, according to  fivethirtyeight.com . But, with seven games remaining, a string of wins could yet propel Vanney\u2019s side into the playoff picture. LAFC rises to 12-9-7 with the win and will take on St. Louis Wednesday in Missouri. Meanwhile, the Galaxy fall to 7-11-9, and will also play on the road Wednesday against Minnesota United.\n```"}

If Ohtani does indeed leave the Angels in free agency, then outfielder Mike Trout\u2019s tenure with the team may come to an end. Rumors surrounding the Angels trading Trout have been swirling after Bob Nightengale of USA Today reported that the Angels  may be open to trading Trout  if he wants to leave.\n\nDuring the offseason, Trout will have a conversation with the Angels front office on what their vision is for the future. The Angels would love to keep their franchise player in Anaheim, but their future currently looks bleak. They could\u2019ve brightened their future by trading Ohtani, but they didn\u2019t, and going all in at the deadline backfired on them \u2014 the Angels are currently 68-82 with only 12 games left on the year.\n\nIf the Angels want to salvage anything for their future, then trading Trout would be the smart decision. The Angels have the third-worst farm system in baseball according to  MLB Pipeline , so swapping Trout for a few prospects would be huge for the Angels. Anyone who knows Angels owner Arte Moreno, however, knows that trading Trout would not happen under his watch. Moreno has never thrown in the towel as the owner of the Angels, so trading Trout seems unlikely.\n\nIn any trade that involves Trout, the Angels would have to eat a majority of his salary in order to gain prospects. This is a similar strategy that the Mets used at the deadline by trading away starting pitchers Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander for two top-100 prospects. This would be smart on many levels especially if the Angels want to go into a full rebuild. This would all depend on Ohtani\u2019s decision this offseason. If Ohtani does sign with another team, there would be no reason to keep Trout.\n\nOf course, any trade involving Trout is ultimately up to him due to his contract\u2019s full no-trade clause. He\u2019s played in Anaheim his whole life and has settled down there with his family. He\u2019s comfortable living in Orange County, but if he wants to ever play in the playoffs again, he needs to leave the Angels. Trout\u2019s trade value is the lowest it\u2019s ever been, however, as he hasn\u2019t played over 130 games since his MVP season in 2019. This season, Trout is hitting .263/.367/.490 with a .858 OPS, all career lows. However, this is Mike Trout, and those numbers are still great and would provide an impact on any lineup he may join.\n\nThat being said, here are a few teams that should be in on Trout if he does want to leave Anaheim:\n\nNew York Yankees\nOf course, you\u2019d expect the Yankees to be in on any big player on the market, especially someone like Trout. He would help New York\u2019s outfield and take pressure off of Aaron Judge in the middle of the lineup. The Yankees may hesitate on this deal, however, as it may be reminiscent of Giancarlo Stanton\u2019s with Trout\u2019s injury issues as of late. Trout fractured his hamate bone swinging on July 3, and has only played in one game since. The Angels should look to acquire prospects in infielder Oswald Peraza and pitcher Drew Thorpe as they would both help rebuild the Angels\u2019 depleted farm system.\n\nSan Francisco Giants\nThe Giants were looking to sign a star player last offseason, chasing Judge and shortstop Carlos Correa, but they could get their man in Trout. Their lineup lacks a true star, but is very well balanced. Adding Trout in the outfield would fit perfectly, as they don\u2019t have a true center fielder. They have the prospect capital to pull it off, too \u2014 look for shortstop Marco Luciano and outfielder Wade Meckler (who is originally from Anaheim) as potential candidates to be moved.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nThe Phillies should be the favorites to land Trout due to his history of rooting for Philly sports teams and proximity to his home state of New Jersey. He would help their defense even more by forcing Kyle Schwarber out of the outfield and into being a full-time designated hitter. Would it be awkward for the Angels to ask for outfielder Brandon Marsh back in a trade package? It may be, but he could potentially be on the move back to Anaheim, along with pitcher Mick Abel.\n```"}

Flick had massive success during his 2019-21 spell at Bayern Munich, winning seven championships, including the great treble. However, of Flick\u2019s last 16 matches, Germany has won just four games, including a group stage exit in Qatar. They have also conceded 11 goals in their previous five fixtures, an alarming statistic considering Germany will be hosting the European Championship in nine months.\n\nA statement from the DFB president Bernd Neuendorf read, \u201cWe need a spirit of optimism and confidence with a view to the European Championship in our own country... Sporting success has top priority for the DFB. Therefore, the decision was inevitable.\u201d Apart from Hansi Flick, both of his assistants Marcus Sorg and Danny Roh have left the role. German Sporting Director Rudi V\u00f6ller, Hannes Wolf, and Sandro Wagner will take charge as \u201ccaretakers\u201d of the national team until further changes.\n\nThe days of Arsene Wenger, of Alex Ferguson, of holding managerial roles for up to a decade, have long passed. Now, every post-game dinner could be a coach\u2019s last meal at the club. Just a few days apart from the sacking of Hansi Flick, Lyon sacked their head coach Laurent Blanc as the club is standing at the bottom of the table, as well as Poland sacking national team head coach Fernando Santos. Were all these sackings truly necessary? In many cases, the team\u2019s underperformance was not solved by a simple change in management.\n\nTake Chelsea as an example: disappointed with Thomas Tuchel\u2019s performances, Chelsea decided to sack the Champions League-winning coach and bring in Graham Potter for \u00a321.5 million, who had led Brighton to accomplish incredible feats. However, Potter only managed for just mere seven months as Chelsea struggled to stay in the top half of the table. Changing to Frank Lampard didn\u2019t resolve the issue either, as Chelsea finished 12th despite spending the most in the Premier League for the past window.\n\nCoaches are often just the scapegoats, covering deeper layers of problems that is either inherent of the team or in the board above. In Flick\u2019s case, Germany lacks a true number nine (Striker), as well as capable world-class fullbacks. In Chelsea\u2019s case, most of the money spent are on young players that are still quite some distance from their full potential. Preserving the coach may sometimes help the team in the long run.\n\nTake Arsenal as an example. In the beginning of 2021-22 season, Mikel Arteta was seriously underperforming, including shocking results such as 0-5 home loss to Manchester City. However, Arsenal stayed with their manager. In the 2022-23 season, Arsenal led the table for a remarkable 248 days, only losing out to City near the end of the season.\n\nBeing a manager is not easy. Not only do they have to deal with managing professional soccer players on wages much higher than theirs, they also have to deal with the pressure from the board and the fans if the team is underperforming. Everyone needs a scapegoat, and unfortunately for the sport of soccer, managers often find themselves taking the blame.\n```"}

The rankings, which were updated on the education section of the U.S. News and World Report\u2019s website, listed USC as tied with U.C. Davis, U.C. San Diego, and the University of Florida with a score of 83 out of a possible 100. Fellow California universities Stanford, CalTech, U.C. Berkeley, and UCLA all ranked inside the top 15.\n\n\u201cMany national and international magazines publish college rankings, which are one of many considerations some people take into account when choosing a university,\u201d USC wrote in a statement to Annenberg Media. \u201cThe way these rankings are calculated change frequently. As a result, we don\u2019t comment on them.\u201d\n\nWhile U.S. News and World Report has not published specific reasoning for why USC fell in its rankings, it did explain that changes to its ranking process may lead to a school\u2019s rise or fall from year to year. In an article published Sunday night highlighting how the rankings were calculated, U.S. News and World Report writers Robert Morse and Eric Brooks wrote, \u201cAs in past years, changes in methodology, together with changes in individual schools\u2019 data, can result in significant changes to schools\u2019 rankings.\u201d\n\n\u201cU.S. News & World Report made refinements to this year\u2019s rankings formula by dropping five longstanding factors, modifying the weights of several other factors, and introducing a few new ones,\u201d Morse and Brooks continued. According to Morse and Brooks, the biggest change in the ranking formula centered around the ability of students from all backgrounds to succeed at each school. \u201cWe increased the emphasis on how often schools\u2019 students from all socioeconomic backgrounds earned degrees and took advantage of information on graduate outcomes that was not available until recently,\u201d said the two writers.\n\nThe five factors dropped by the publication\u2019s ranking system were class size, alumni giving average, graduate debt proportion borrowing, high school class standing, and the number of faculty holding terminal degrees, or the highest possible accreditation in their field. Those factors had previously accounted for 18% of the 2023 rankings.\n\nCurrent USC students shared their conflicting views on the ranking and current support provided by the university in interviews with Annenberg Media. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising, to say the least,\u201d said Matheo Mourot, a student from the School of Cinematic Arts. \u201cAs an SCA student, our film school is technically the best film school in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI definitely feel like I am supported as a student and as an individual,\u201d Mourot continued. \u201cIt sounds like the rankings are adjusting to think more about how the school supports their students and makes it easy to attend, which I definitely think [USC] struggles with at times,\u201d said Jane Rutherford, a junior majoring in theater.\n\nOne student was conflicted when asked about USC potentially being ranked lower than other universities because of the lack of support for students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. \u201cI hope if [USC] is being seen in that way or categorized in that way it does get better because I know that they are doing a lot of initiatives and pushes,\u201d said Miko Mariscal, a junior majoring in sociology. \u201cBut sometimes, you know, that\u2019s just talk.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cBest Colleges Rankings\u201d are one of many college rankings systems published by different organizations every year. Forbes published its latest \u201cAmerica\u2019s Top Colleges List\u201d in August, with USC ranked 14th, U.C. San Diego ranked 21st, the University of Florida ranked 27th and U.C. Davis ranked 37th. The Wall Street Journal also released its rankings of the \u201cBest Colleges in the U.S. in 2024\u2032\u2032 in September, with USC ranked as the 22nd best university in America, registering an overall score of 83.4 out of a possible 100 points.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s ranking process differs slightly from U.S. News and World Report\u2019s current system. Among other factors, the Journal focuses on graduation rates, career preparation, environment and diversity. They also take into account the average net cost to attend each university compared to the value added to each graduate\u2019s salary.\n\nThe universities that USC shared its spot with in the U.S. News rankings had widely differing placements in the Wall Street Journal\u2019s. The University of Florida ranked 15th in the Journal, but U.C. Davis and U.C. San Diego ranked 95th and 103rd, respectively.\n```"}

It is expected to be released at the end of this month.\n\nKansas City police arrested Lambkins, co-founder of the sports podcast Talk of Troy, and Jude Oca\u00f1as, a sophomore journalism student and aspiring sports commentator, on April 28. Five police officers boarded their Los Angeles-bound airplane, which had already left the gate on its way to the runway when authorities ordered it to return.\n\nWithin days of their arrests, USC Annenberg faculty, students and members of the community rallied behind the students. Some 33 faculty members and 200 others signed a public letter of support posted on change.org. All charges \u2014 felony stealing, second-degree burglary and misdemeanor trespassing \u2014 have been dropped as part of an agreement reached with Jackson County.\n\nIn return, the students agreed to produce a video offering wide-ranging advice to journalists covering sporting events. The agreement, which the students\u2019 attorney and prosecutor intended to keep confidential, also bars the students from criticizing the NFL, the police or the prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\nThe public information officer for the prosecutor\u2019s office provided the document. \u201cI do feel vindicated,\u201d Lambkins said. \u201cI do feel that the outcome is just. I\u2019m Black in America, so honestly I didn\u2019t think I was going to get any type of grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see it as an opportunity to tell people our story,\u201d Oca\u00f1as said. \u201cBut, at the same time, educate people on being smarter when at professional events, or sporting events of any kind, as a teaching lesson for future journalists who want to get in the field.\u201d\n\nDavid Bell, the Kansas City lawyer who represented both students, said his clients\u2019 experience will help student journalists in the future. \u201cGiven the unique circumstances of this case, along with the manner of the arrests, the media attention and the extraordinary reputations of Mr. Lambkins and Mr. Oca\u00f1as, each party could have remained unwavering in their respective positions at the outset of this case,\u201d Bell said.\n\n\u201cInstead, the parties sought to craft a solution together with the Annenberg School to turn this unfortunate situation into something positive for Eric, Jude and for future student journalists. We appreciate the discretion shown by the Jackson County Prosecutor\u2019s Office as well as the outstanding support from professors at the Annenberg School. We look forward to seeing great things from Eric and Jude as sports journalists,\u201d continued Bell.\n\nUntil now, few details emerged about the case beyond the sparse account alleged in police and court documents. Cursory stories appeared in the media from Los Angeles to New York, along with the students\u2019 mugshots. They did not speak to the media until this month.\n\nLambkins announced the resolution of the case in a LinkedIn post two weeks ago. Police documents said surveillance footage showed the students around 1:20 a.m. on April 28 entering areas off-limits to them. The video showed Lambkins entering the \u201cNike Room\u201d with a paper bag and emerging about five minutes later with the bag looking \u201cfuller,\u201d according to police.\n\nAnnenberg Media\u2019s review of all 26 of the security videos, shot in the early morning hours after the first round of the Draft, tell a more complete story. The official activities for that day had ended shortly before midnight. Surveillance videos shot throughout the sprawling complex show security officers and others milling about and the students walking unimpeded through various hallways and buildings.\n\nNone of the videos show the inside of the \u201cNike Room.\u201d Lambkins described what he saw \u2014 and didn\u2019t see \u2014 in the videos during a review of them last week. \u201cI would like to think the DA considered the totality of all of the evidence in her willingness to drop it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe post-draft scene\n\nThe video surveillance footage reviewed by Annenberg Media shows Lambkins and Oca\u00f1as walking through the expansive NFL Draft venue in Kansas City. Their NFL-issued media credentials were clearly visible throughout. Lambkins and Oca\u00f1as, two in a group of five reporters from Annenberg Media\u2019s Talk of Troy, left the \u201cMedia Room\u201d on the third floor of the Westin Hotel in search of food, they said.\n\nThe group had been working since the start of the Draft around 7 p.m. \u2013 including three hours of live, multiplatform coverage \u2013 until the time of the incident, which police documents say was around 1:20 a.m. The footage reviewed does not include timestamps.\n\nLambkins and Oca\u00f1as are shown leaving the hotel and crossing through the intersection of East Pershing Road and Grand Avenue into a closed-off area outside Kansas City Union Station where a stage was set up. The police report describes the opening in the perimeter as \u201can emergency exit.\u201d\n\nAs they pass through it, a police officer on a motorcycle drives past slowly but does not interact with them. The pair walked by the stage area into a lounge inside Union Station where they walked past another security guard. They are off camera and reappear a short while later. Lambkins is holding a brown paper bag.\n\nThe pair said it was filled with snacks including Snickers, cups of Jif peanut butter, cookies and granola bars. On their way back, they stop to take selfies on the stage. A dozen workers or so can be seen moving about the stage.\n\nIn cellphone video captured by Lambkins and reviewed by Annenberg Media, a security guard is visible at the back of the audience area, in view of the stage. The reporters then walk off stage-left following about 30 seconds behind a group of people through a doorway.\n\nIn the next frame, Oca\u00f1as and Lambkins are seen opening and passing through a door on their right. No surveillance video shows their activity for about five-and-a-half minutes. The police report refers to the area they enter as the \u201cTalent Waiting Room.\u201d\n\nIn the forthcoming video about the reporters\u2019 experience in Kansas City, Lambkins said he asked permission from someone who did not have the authority to give him the San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys and Minnesota Vikings jerseys. \u201cThis is where I made a grave miscalculation,\u201d Lambkins said in retrospect. \u201cThe person that I asked didn\u2019t have the authority or the authorization to give the swag. And I didn\u2019t do my due diligence in ensuring that that was the proper person to ask.\u201d\n\nCommunication is a key point that Lambkins underscores in the YouTube video he and Oca\u00f1as are preparing for student journalists.\n\nThe hallway outside the Talent Waiting Room, where the pair were last seen on camera, was empty for about two minutes and 10 seconds before two security guards, one Black female with shoulder-length hair and the other a white male wearing a hoodie under his neon jacket, walk into the frame past the door to the Waiting Room.\n\nThe female security guard leaves through a door at the end of the hallway, the male security guard returns back the way they came. He is partially visible at the edge of the frame lingering in the hallway before Lambkins and Oca\u00f1as reemerge from the same door they entered about five-and-a-half minutes earlier.\n\nThe reporters are seen on camera returning to the Westin, slowly walking back across the intersection and into the hotel where security is still visible. Oca\u00f1as and Lambkins both said they went through a security checkpoint and a guard looked inside the paper bag and saw the jerseys and snacks. This interaction was not shown in the footage reviewed by Annenberg Media.\n\nSurprised on the plane\n\nIn the early afternoon on April 28, the Talk of Troy reporters boarded their return flight to Los Angeles. By the time the plane was pulling back from the gate, Lambkins was asleep and Oca\u00f1as was zoned out on his phone, texting friends that he was on his way back to L.A.\n\nThough the two didn\u2019t notice at the time, after taxiing toward the runway, the plane had returned to the gate. The main cabin door opened and five Kansas City Police officers headed to the back of the plane, where the USC students were seated.\n\nLambkins was awakened by police asking for him and Oca\u00f1as. Confused, the two identified themselves. They were handcuffed on the plane after one officer told them they were being arrested for burglary.\n\nThey were each questioned briefly but declined to speak without an attorney present. It remains unclear regarding who requested the plane to turn around. \u201cThe decision of an airplane\u2019s actions would rest with an airline and/or the pilot,\u201d Jacob Becchina, a spokesperson for the Kansas City Police Department, wrote this month in an email.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any ability to compel an airplane to do anything.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until they were booked into the Kansas City jail that they realized they had been arrested on suspicion of stealing the three jerseys earlier that morning.\n\nLambkins and Oca\u00f1as were charged and transferred to the Jackson County Jail before each posted $2,500 bail and were released around midnight on April 29. Within a week, news outlets around the country had reported the arrests.\n\nWhen Lambkins saw these stories, most of which showed the students\u2019 mugshots, he said he thought his professional dreams had been dashed. \u201cI felt that my career had evaporated before my eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are places I wanted to work for, not be in their headlines,\u201d Oca\u00f1as said of the stories that ran in the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times.\n\nOca\u00f1as, who spent most of his first summer after starting college at home in Los Angeles, said he tried to get jobs, including at UberEats, but a quick background check would reveal the charges in Kansas City.\n\nProsecutors agreed to postpone their arraignment, initially scheduled for May 12, the day of USC\u2019s graduation, so Lambkins could walk with his class. He expects to complete his degree and his thesis project, \u201cLife After Life,\u201d a documentary about a group of individuals sentenced to life in prison, by the end of the fall semester.\n\nToeing the line\n\nIn the nearly five months since their arrest, Lambkins and Oca\u00f1as have been reluctant to speak publicly about the matter or to make comments seen as critical of the NFL or police.\n\nThe agreement each of them signed seeks to restrict what they can say about the charges and the other parties involved. The agreement, signed on August 8, orders the students to \u201cavoid making, either directly or indirectly, any public statements that may be viewed as an attempt to minimize the actions by Lambkins.\u201d\n\nIt also directs them to \u201cavoid disparaging any organizations and/or individuals involved with the investigation and/or decision to file the Case.\u201d If the students violate any of the terms, \u201cthe Prosecutor may, in its sole discretion, re-file the Case\u201d before the end of January 2024, the agreement warns.\n\nThis stern language is common in such agreements, said Katharine Tinto, a former public defender who now directs the Criminal Justice Center at the University of California, Irvine School of Law, where she is a clinical professor.\n\nShe reviewed the agreement and said it could prevent the reporters from declaring their innocence or accusing the police of making an error. \u201cThere\u2019s at least an argument that coming out and saying \u2018It was a mistake\u2019 is minimizing your actions and not taking responsibility,\u201d Tinto said.\n\n\u201cA diversion agreement is in a defendant\u2019s interest because it avoids the risk of trial, and it puts the ability to get a case dismissed in the defendant\u2019s own hands, other than in the hands of a jury,\u201d Tinto said.\n\nLambkins, who is a father of three children and an Iraq War veteran, worked in consultation with the director of the Annenberg Media Center to get graduate and undergraduate student reporters credentialed by the NFL for the first time to cover the Draft.\n\nUSC Annenberg supported the students\u2019 efforts and funded their travel, as it does for students covering USC away games. Oca\u00f1as, a sophomore majoring in journalism, received a USC Dean\u2019s Scholarship and the Jacki and Gilbert Wells Cisneros Endowed Scholarship, which is awarded to a new student of Latin American descent with outstanding academic performance.\n\nReporter\u2019s note: This story was reported and written in accordance with the highest journalistic standards and ethics. We take our responsibility to truth and transparency seriously, especially when reporting on members of our own staff.\n\nProfessor Alan Mittelstaedt, a faculty advisor at the USC Annenberg Media Center, edited this story and advised me throughout the reporting process. Mittelstaedt organized and signed a letter in support of Eric Lambkins and Jude Oca\u00f1as, along with 33 USC faculty members.\n\nHe has also advised and supported Eric and Jude since they joined the newsroom. Professor Christina Bellantoni, the director of the USC Annenberg Media Center, also edited this story and advised me on the reporting process.\n\nAs director, she advised the Talk of Troy students on the credential application process and helped organize the logistics of the trip. She did not sign the letter of support.\n\nProfessors Bellantoni and Mittelstaedt\u2019s involvement in this story was strictly in an advisory capacity and their suggestions were just that \u2013 final decisions lay with student editors, Tess Patton and Mateo Gutierrez, and me. \u2013 Jules Feeney\n```"}

Quarterback Matthew Stafford will look to build off of an impressive Week 1 performance, going 24 for 38 for 334 passing yards. The game was was Stafford\u2019s first since suffering a spinal cord contusion last November forcing him to miss the home stretch of the 2022 season. Rams will remain without star wide receiver Cooper Kupp, who is on injured reserve with a hamstring injury. Kupp will not be eligible to return from IR until week five at the earliest.\n\nLos Angeles will face off against a 49ers team that looked dominant in a 30-7 week one win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Quarterback Brock Purdy, who like Stafford, was returning from an injury suffered at the end of last season, picked up right where he left off, completing more than 65% of his passes for 220 yards and two touchdowns. Sunday will mark Purdy\u2019s first career start against the Rams.\n\nThe Rams will also be faced with the daunting task of containing San Francisco\u2019s loaded group of skill position players. Leading that group are running back Christian McCaffrey, who rushed for 152 yards and a touchdown last week, and wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk, who racked up 129 yards receiving and two scores. Los Angeles is looking for its first win over the 49ers since a 20-17 NFC Championship Game victory in January of 2022. Last season, San Francisco won both contests between the two teams, with the Rams\u2019 offense managing just 23 total points across the two games.\n\nKickoff between the two teams is set for 1:05 PM PDT on Sunday afternoon on FOX.\n```"}

(Photo by Elijah Patterson)\n\nBy nikki thomas\nSeptember 16, 2023 at 1:31 pm PDT\n\nUSC women\u2019s volleyball impressed in the Boilermaker Challenge this week, notching two wins against Illinois and host Purdue. With USC set to leave the Pac-12 for the Big Ten next season, the Challenge represented an opportunity to preview future conference matchups and rivalries.\n\nUSC came out hot in the first set against Illinois on Thursday, but struggled to generate offense towards the middle of the match. Led by senior outside hitter Skylar Fields, who racked up 25 kills in the match, the Trojans stormed back to win the match 3-2 (25-16, 17-25, 21-25, 25-20, 15-13). Junior setter Mia Tuaniga had a double-double with 46 assists and 11 digs; sophomore middle blocker Tyrah Ariail led the team with 6 blocks, and sophomore libero Gala Trubint recorded 21 digs.\n\nNo. 7 Purdue was USC\u2019s second matchup of the Boilermaker Challenge. Freshman outside hitter London Wijay started the match against Purdue and finished with 18 kills. Ariail made USC volleyball history with a spectacular .778 hitting percentage; she now ties former middle blocker Katie Olsovsky (2001) for second-highest in-game hitting percentage in USC\u2019s history. Ariail also amassed 15 kills, a career high.\n\nOfficiating nearly became an issue for the Trojans in this match, as several crucial calls that went in Purdue\u2019s favor were later overturned by challenge. Despite a fighting effort from the Boilermakers, the Trojans pulled together and sealed the 3-1 win in four sets (30-28, 15-25, 25-23, 25-23). Fields hammered down 27 kills and gained her second double-double of the season so far; she was named Most Valuable Player of the tournament.\n\nThe victories mark the fourth and fifth wins in a row for the USC squad, who started the season 1-4. Behind the leadership of Fields and the support of a strong young core, the team is gaining momentum.\n\n\u201cWe realized that we were getting exploited, we weren\u2019t super clean,\u201d USC head coach Brad Keller commented about the beginning of the season, when the team struggled against Houston, Rice and Hawai\u2019i. However, they turned things around during the Trojan Invitational, winning against UC Davis, Marist and San Diego.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of these players kinda step into their own a little bit more and gain confidence, and that\u2019s gonna help Skylar out,\u201d Keller said.\n\nThe tournament also marks the end of USC\u2019s non-conference play, with plenty of Pac-12 games on the horizon (including UCLA on Wednesday). This tournament proved that USC can hold their own against Big Ten teams, who they will surely see more of in the near future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great because the level of volleyball in the Big 10 is just so good, so physical, so fast,\u201d Keller remarked. \u201cAnd to see that and to play at that level and match it was really fun.\u201d\n\nUSC improves to 6-4 on the season. The Trojans will play at UCLA on Wednesday, Sept. 20 at 7 p.m.\n```"}

Six days and a full week of school or work removed from the spectacle that is America\u2019s Saturday tradition, they\u2019re hungry for more. Friday night for a college football fan is like going to bed as a kid on Dec. 24, too excited for a morning of presents to fall asleep. It\u2019s Saturday eve. In this weekly column, I\u2019ll lay out Saturday\u2019s best and most playoff-relevant games each and every Friday. We\u2019ll walk through it all \u2014 the best games of the day, who\u2019s primed for an upset and who just needs to win. Check back every Saturday eve for everything you need to know about the weekend\u2019s college football offerings.\n\nGAME OF THE DAY: No. 14 LSU (1-1) vs. Mississippi State (2-0)\n\nStarkville, Mississippi, 9:00 a.m. PDT on ESPN\n\nLSU comes into an 11 a.m. matchup in Starkville in need of a win to open SEC play after losing to No. 3 FSU in their home opener. Regardless of their 72-10 beatdown of FCS Grambling in Week 2, Brian Kelly\u2019s Tigers still have a lot to prove in a stacked SEC west division that will only get tougher from here on out, with a road trip to Tuscaloosa just seven weeks away on Nov. 4.\n\nThe Tigers struggled to get a rhythm on offense against the Seminoles, with over 60 percent of possessions ending in turnovers or punts. Senior quarterback Jaylen Daniels was inconsistent \u2014 showing flashes with some crafty runs and a 75-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr. The 6-foot-4 junior wideout has been the best part of LSU\u2019s offense so far, leading the team with 220 yards on 13 receptions.\n\nMeanwhile, Mississippi State has quietly fielded a sturdy defense to start off the year, especially against the run. They held both of their first opponents under 100 yards on the ground and boast six turnovers across the two contests. The Bulldogs did show some weaknesses against Arizona quarterback Jayden de Laura, who consistently created first downs through consecutive short completions.\n\nLSU is favored -9.5 in this one, and I think that\u2019s definitely a fair evaluation of their chances to win, but regardless of the victor this will be a hard fought game with ups and downs from both teams. Unranked Mississippi State will perhaps have a chance to gain some AP (and later, CFP) clout with an upset, but LSU needs the win if they want to stay ranked throughout a tough SEC schedule. If you\u2019re looking for a competitive game to start your morning off with, look no further.\n\nUPSET ALERT: No. 11 Tennessee (2-0) vs Florida (1-1)\n\nGainesville, Florida, 4:00 p.m. PDT on ESPN\n\nTennessee\u2019s offense has looked great so far this season, especially on the ground with 515 rushing yards across their first two games. Junior running back Jaylen Wright is on pace for a historic season, tallying over 100 rushing yards in both contests. He\u2019ll certainly be a threat to every defense he faces, including Florida\u2019s.\n\nBut the Vols had a lot to improve defensively after ranking 91st last year in yards per game last season. Defending the pass was by far the team\u2019s greatest weakness last year, with only two teams in all of Power 5 topping Tennessee in passing yards allowed per game. And I don\u2019t want to hear \u201cThat\u2019s what happens in the SEC\u201d when they gave up 316 passing yards to Tennessee-Martin, 269 to Ball State and 274 to Pittsburgh.\n\nWhile they certainly showed some improvement in Week 1 of this year against Virginia, allowing only 11 completions for 106 yards, Austin Peay quarterback Mike DiLiello fared better, completing 74 percent of his passes for 260 yards and a touchdown in last week\u2019s matchup with Tennessee.\n\nEnter Florida\u2019s X-factor, senior wide receiver Ricky Pearsall. The Arizona State transfer had a good first year with the Gators in 2022, leading the team with 661 receiving yards and five touchdowns. Pearsall had two 100+ yard games, including last year\u2019s 38-33 road loss to Tennessee.\n\nBut he\u2019s on pace to more than double those numbers this year with 14 catches for 215 yards and a touchdown in just two games, and will certainly be a major factor against a Vols defense that has yet to face a competent passing attack.\n\nThe Gators haven\u2019t given up a home game to Tennessee since 2003, and I just don\u2019t see the streak ending this time around. This game could be an especially important one come Halloween when CFP rankings start rolling out \u2014 Tennessee figures to only keep climbing so long as they stay undefeated, and beating the Gators will be a good sign for their chances to knock off No. 10 Alabama in October for the second year in a row.\n\nBut an upset win could be just the thing Florida needs to restore its legitimacy after a tough loss to Utah, and they\u2019ll be hungry to do just that in a night game at the Swamp.\n\nON THE RISE: \n\nThis piece of the column will showcase one or two teams that have been climbing the rankings, and have a good shot to continue doing so in their matchup this Saturday.\n\nNo. 3 Florida State, 2-0 @ Boston College, 9:00 a.m. PDT on ABC\n\nThe Seminoles started this season with a bang, taking down then-No. 5 LSU in their home opener 45-24. They\u2019re now ranked No. 3 for the first time since 2017, and this Florida boy feels like he\u2019s in middle school again.\n\nStar senior quarterback Jordan Travis has been playing as good as ever, going 23 for 31 for 342 yards and four touchdowns against LSU. He\u2019s found a new favorite target in Michigan State transfer Keon Coleman, connecting with the junior wide receiver for four touchdowns passes in their first two games.\n\nThe rushing attack has been chugging along as well with junior running back Trey Benson (who nearly broke 1,000 yards last season) leading the team with 126 yards and three rushing touchdowns.\n\nAll that stands between Florida State and a trip to the playoff is consistent strong play on defense. They showed the ability to stop teams through the air last year, holding opponents to an average of 165 passing yards per game, although their schedule of mostly run-heavy teams likely helped, as they faced the 10th-fewest passing attempts of any team in Division I.\n\nBut teams ran all over the Seminoles last year, for an average of 156 yards and a touchdown per game \u2014 and they haven\u2019t shown much improvement yet. LSU quarterback Jaylen Daniels cut up the Seminole defense for some nice runs Week 1, including a 40-yard draw that set the Tigers up in the red zone.\n\nAnd Southern Miss running back Rodrigues Clark averaged 5.7 yards per carry in Week 2 against the \u2018Noles.\n\nBoston College has a mobile passer of their own in sophomore Thomas Castellanos, who leads the team in rushing yards across their first two games.\n\nNow, I definitely don\u2019t think BC has what it takes to knock off Florida State, especially this early in the season. But this weekend will still be an important measuring stick game for the Seminoles\u2019 unproven rush defense, especially with playoff gold in sight.\n\nNo. 21 Duke, 2-0 vs Northwestern, 12:30 p.m. PDT on ACC Network\n\nDuke\u2019s 28-7 Labor Day upset over Clemson stunned the college football world. The question on everyone\u2019s mind\u2014did Clemson just take a dive, or are we in a new era of Blue Devil football?\n\nDuke certainly made a strong argument for the latter in their Week 2 matchup with Lafayette, holding the Leopards to just 213 yards of total offense while putting up over 250 yards each on the ground and through the air.\n\nSenior running back Jordan Waters led a red-hot rushing attack with 112 yards and two scores on just 11 carries. Combine that with junior Jaquez Moore, who tallied an impressive statline himself with 72 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries, and you have what looks like a top college running back tandem.\n\nJunior quarterback Riley Leonard couldn\u2019t have been more efficient, going 12 for 12 for 136 yards and a touchdown before being sat in garbage time for fellow junior Henry Belin IV.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget that defense\u2014the Blue Devils have yet to give any team more than seven points.\n\nAll that to say, Duke appears to be a basketball school no longer.\n\nThe Wildcats are 1-1 and averaging just 260 yards a game, certainly not how Northwestern\u2019s David Braun wanted to start his head coaching career. While their Week 2 win over UTEP shows some progress, I just don\u2019t see quarterback Ben Bryant making the leap from his performance last week\u201411 for 17 for 116 yards and a touchdown\u2014to the level of offense necessary for Northwestern to outscore Duke.\n\nExpect the Blue Devils to improve to 3-0 this Saturday and climb into the AP\u2019s Top 20 for the first time since 2014.\n\nSOMETHING TO PROVE: \n\nThis section of each week\u2019s column will look at teams who need to win this Saturday\u2019s game. Maybe they\u2019re coming off an upset, or maybe they just need a win this weekend for legitimacy\u2019s sake \u2014 either way, if they lose come Saturday, they can wave their hopes of conference or playoff gold goodbye.\n\nTCU, 1-1 @ Houston, 5:00 p.m. PDT on FOX\n\nTCU was still ranked No. 2 in last year\u2019s final AP poll after getting walloped 65-7 by Georgia in the national championship, but fell all the way to No. 17 to start the season, and fell out of the Top 25 entirely after a Week 1 loss to No. 18 Colorado.\n\nTCU gave up 565 yards of total offense to the Buffaloes, with junior quarterback Shedeur Sanders putting up 510 yards on 38 completions. Sanders found the end zone four times, with running backs Sy\u2019veon Wilkerson and Dylan Edwards each scoring touchdowns as well.\n\nTCU\u2019s defense seemed to have trouble containing Edwards out of the backfield, allowing him 135 yards and three touchdowns on just five catches, including a missed assignment which left him wide open in the endzone for the first score of the game.\n\nIt might be tempting to chalk up these defensive struggles to Deion Sanders and the Colorado comeback, but Nebraska allowed over 200 fewer yards to Prime Time on the road in Week 2.\n\nIf TCU can\u2019t out-defend Nebraska, they certainly won\u2019t be recovering their 2022 status anytime soon.\n\nTCU\u2019s offense certainly looked better, but still showed room for improvement. Sophomore quarterback Chandler Morris, whose Week 1 injury last year paved the way for Max Duggan to start and lead TCU to the national championship game, has shown flashes of physical talent, but his pocket vision leaves much to be desired.\n\nMorris doesn\u2019t show the ability to read all levels of a defense, as he\u2019s often noticeably stuck in his first or second read, and his indecision in the pocket can lead to mistimed throws to otherwise open receivers.\n\nThe former led to a number of missed opportunities to convert third downs against Colorado, and the latter gave up an easy interception to safety Trevor Woods in the end zone on a wide-open play that should have been TCU\u2019s first score of the game.\n\nLast week\u2019s 41-6 victory over Nicholls State was a good start at a comeback \u2014 TCU held the Colonels to just 263 yards of total offense, and outposessed them by nearly 11 minutes with Morris going 26 for 30 for 263 yards and a touchdown.\n\nBut Saturday\u2019s matchup with Houston will be the Horned Frogs\u2019 first chance to prove their defense has turned things around against a Cougars offense that averaged 389 total yards of offense in its first two games.\n\nIf they can do that, and if Morris plays like he did last week, the Horned Frogs can make it past Houston and start the season 1-0 in their conference.\n\nClemson, 1-1 vs. Florida Atlantic, 5:00 p.m. PDT on ACC Network\n\nUnless they win out, combined with a majority of undefeated CFP frontrunners taking a dive, Clemson\u2019s chances at a playoff spot seem long gone following their 28-7 Week 1 loss to in-conference Duke.\n\nAt this point, head coach Dabo Swinney is fighting to keep the name alive. With FSU looking like a legitimate playoff contender, his Tigers can\u2019t even be considered the best team in a relatively weak ACC, which can\u2019t fare well for recruiting more Will Shipleys to come and save his program.\n\nFAU is a team that most people will expect Clemson to destroy, especially after a shaky 1-1 start with their strongest opponent of the year in No. 3 FSU coming to Death Valley next weekend.\n\nWhether that\u2019s a fair expectation or not, Dabo needs a 35+ point W in my eyes to ease the minds of doubters across the Palmetto state\u2014and to rally the locker room for a must-win game next week against the Seminoles.\n\nLook for the Tigers to try and run up the score on a Florida Atlantic team that hits the road for the first time this season.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/09/15/bleeding-blue-what-will-the-dodgers-starting-rotation-look-like-going-into-october/", "response": "```\n\u201cBleeding Blue\u201d is a column by Diego Ynzunza about the Los Angeles Dodgers. Welcome to Bleeding Blue, a weekly column covering all things Dodgers. My name is Diego Ynzunza, and I\u2019m a sophomore from Pasadena, California. I attended my first Dodger game two months after I was born and have been a dedicated fan ever since. With the multitude of dedicated Dodger fans in L.A., I\u2019m proud to count myself among their ranks. The Dodgers are entering into a challenging, but exciting time as a franchise. They have a couple more weeks left in the regular season, hopefully a long postseason run and then the unpredictable offseason where a $500 million man lurks in the shadows. Luckily, we still have some regular-season baseball to discuss, so let\u2019s get into it.\n\nThe Dodgers are 5-5 in their past 10 games, after an impressive August performance in which they went 24-5 and cemented themselves as the cream of the crop of the National League West. The offense slowed down a bit from their dominant ways, but I don\u2019t see it being an issue going into the postseason considering their depth. Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez commands lefties, Amed Rosario has postseason experience and the bat of Miguel Rojas has been heating up. Pair that with the top-six of Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, JD Martinez, Max Muncy and James Outman, and there is no pitcher in the league that can contain them.\n\nThe issue is pitching. What is the rotation going to look like going into October? I don\u2019t know how much I trust Lance Lynn to make a postseason start. Over his past five starts, he\u2019s delivered a 6.21 ERA and given up nine homers. In what\u2019s been by far the worst year of his career, his main issue has been giving up the long ball. I can\u2019t imagine his leash would be all that long in October, and in an ideal world, he would be used as a long man coming out of the bullpen. But right now, the Dodgers are desperate for reliable starting pitching.\n\nGoing into October, the Dodgers\u2019 starting rotation looks to be Clayton Kershaw, Bobby Miller, Lynn and Ryan Pepiot with Ryan Yarbrough available if needed to piggyback or make a start himself. However, each of these options is flawed. Kershaw isn\u2019t healthy. He hasn\u2019t been for about a month now. In his start on September 5 against the Marlins, he registered his slowest fastball ever in the bigs coming in at 86.6 MPH, according to Baseball Savant. Both Kershaw and manager Dave Roberts say that he\u2019s going to pitch through it, but you have to wonder how effective he can be at that reduced velocity.\n\nMiller and Pepiot are both extremely talented and have performed well as of late. Pepiot especially has exercised his command issues and kept the walks down since his previous call-up. The issue is they are both rookies. They have no postseason experience, and I truly believe that if they are forced to start an away postseason game, it\u2019s going to be extremely difficult for them to hold in their jitters.\n\nYarbrough has been a great addition, posting a 3.08 ERA, 0.91 WHIP and 24.0 K/BB ratio since his trade to the Dodgers. The only two issues are that he operates at a reduced velocity and can be prone to big blow-ups. He averages 86.9 MPH on his fastball, which is in the bottom 1% of all pitchers in the big leagues, according to Baseball Savant. We\u2019ll see what happens when the postseason begins, but as of now, I\u2019m weary about the Dodgers starting rotation.\n\nThis weekend, the guys go into Seattle for a three-game set against the Mariners. When I think of the Dodgers and Mariners, what comes to mind is the Chris Taylor trade. Taylor was acquired by the Dodgers for pitching prospect Zach Lee in June 2016. Since his acquisition, Taylor has played an integral role in the success of the team. His ability to play multiple positions, as well as his above-average offensive output, have been extremely valuable to a team that prides itself on that skill. Let\u2019s thank Mariners GM Jerry Dipoto for gifting us CT3.\n\nLastly, I want to give a huge shoutout to Kyle Hurt for making his big-league debut on Tuesday night. Hurt is a product of USC, pitching here for two years. He was drafted in 2020 by the Miami Marlins and was acquired by the Dodgers the following year in the deal that sent Dylan Floro to the Fish. Hurt features two secondary pitches that are above-average, as well as a fastball that complements the other two very well. He could be a welcome addition to a Dodgers bullpen in need of effective late-inning arms.\n\nThanks everyone for tuning in to this week\u2019s edition of Bleeding Blue. Let\u2019s hope our Boys in Blue take care of business in Seattle this weekend, and then at home against the Detroit Tigers to begin next week. \u201cBleeding Blue\u201d runs every Friday.\n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nProtestors took to the streets near Los Angeles City Hall Friday to call for the declaration of a climate emergency. This is the fourth year of the Youth Climate Strike in the U.S., where protestors aim to put pressure on politicians to enact progressive climate policies. Specifically, Youth Climate Strike L.A. is hoping to get the American government to end oil drilling, plant more trees, make green schools, improve public transport and build affordable, climate-friendly housing according to a public document released by the organization.\n\n\u201cI think, right now, people are starting to pay more attention to youth climate activists especially. So we need to make sure that the momentum keeps going,\u201d said Valerie Kuo, a third-year USC student and co-executive director of the Environmental Student Assembly at USC.\n\nAccording to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), last summer was the hottest recorded since records began in 1880. Previous scientific predictions are proving accurate as sea ice continues to melt, sea levels continue to rise, and heat waves are becoming longer and more intense according to NASA.\n\n\u201cWe need to be active and fight back because we can\u2019t wait. We can\u2019t wait another five years, another four years, people are suffering right now,\u201d said Sim Bilal, the lead organizer for the Youth Climate Strike. \u201cWe need solutions right now.\u201d\n\nLead Organizer Sim Bilal (right) stands with another organizer of the Youth Climate Strike Shekinah Deocares (left) as they introduce different speakers and musical performers at City Hall South before the march down the streets of L.A.

Ever since I was a little kid. Climate change burned my summer camp down.\u201d\n\nProtesters pass by L.A.

(Photo by Katherine Havens)\n\nBy Katherine Havens, Yana Savitsky and Lana Diab\nSeptember 15, 2023 at 4:26 pm PDT\n\nUnsent \u2013 The Letter Project, a bi-weekly event organized by USC Senior Isabella Escalona, provides a safe space for students to release emotions that range from excitement and hope to loss and grief through anonymous letters. As a part of the event, a tent will be set up on Mondays at the Hahn Plaza and on Fridays at the USC Village from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. An array of the students\u2019 heartfelt letters are displayed around the tent for spectators to empathize and resonate with.\n\nThrough her efforts, Escalona aims to facilitate an environment where students can recognize their peers\u2019 struggles and accomplishments, as well as their own. In an interview with Annenberg Media, Escalona describes her project as a celebration of \u201cthe shared capacity to be human.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why she felt inspired to start the letter project, Escalona credits an English course she took last year that discussed how different forms of writing can bring about various forms of closeness. She wanted to create The Letter Project to give everyone the opportunity to be truthful and vulnerable.\n\nEscalona added, \u201cI realized that not only do we grow closer to ourselves and our own truths by writing letters, but when you read the letter of another person, you grow closer to them, even though they\u2019re a stranger. You walk around and you read letters of joy, pain, excitement, heartache, and you feel closer to the person who wrote it without ever knowing who they are.\u201d\n\nAt the event on Friday, many students walking past the tent stopped to read the letters. Resonating with the words of others, some were encouraged to write their own. Sophomore Christopher Sullivan was inspired to write an uplifting message addressed to \u201cDear Stranger.\u201d He says, \u201cSometimes, we just need a push from someone like that. It doesn\u2019t have to be someone you know.\u201d\n\nEscalona is majoring in narrative studies with a minor in social change. Through her project, she is championing social change by allowing students to express themselves with the reassurance that their letters are anonymous. She recounts that these letters \u201caccept the absence of an audience.\u201d While the letters remain \u201cunsent,\u201d the act of writing them successfully acts as a form of cathartic release.\n\nA parent of a future USC student, Rashmi Bhandari, was deeply moved by the words written by students. She said, \u201cSelf-expression of any kind is a cathartic experience. And when you offer a space for a cathartic experience, I think it\u2019s just wonderful for your mental health and for your sense of belonging and for your sense of feeling whole and feeling grounded.\u201d\n\nLetters are saved to story highlights on Escalona\u2019s personal Instagram account. The recipients include parents, friends, exes, the deceased, future selves and more. Ben Richard, a first-year master\u2019s student, expressed how he\u2019s been \u201cholding in a lot of feelings\u201d after recently moving to Los Angeles. \u201cComing here, I haven\u2019t really had the chance to connect with my family. It\u2019s been giving me a lot of reflection time,\u201d Richard said. He addressed the letter to his family, which helped him \u201cexpress emotions without tying my identity to it.\u201d\n\nThe letters are diverse in content; some are heartbreaking and deep, while others are funny and contain doodles. When given the chance to express themselves creatively, people write in whatever language, style, or handwriting they please. Letters range from short lines to paragraphs to poems.\n\nEscalona mentions that some of her favorite quotes are \u201cCruelty is woven into our bones and it\u2019s our strength to defy it,\u201d and \u201cI am full with the absence of you.\u201d Her treasured part of the project is watching people encounter the exhibit for the first time. \u201c[I love] seeing people read other people\u2019s letters and ultimately decide, you know what? I want to try this too,\u201d Escalona said.\n\nEscalona hopes to turn her passion project into a book for people to enjoy. She saves all the letters and reads them never knowing whether it will evoke laughter or a tear. She describes her future book as a \u201ccollection of letters that speak all kinds of human truths\u201d but for now, the project remains a safe space for students to express what\u2019s on their mind.\n```"}

Students had the opportunity to hear from notable mental health speakers and enjoy a variety of food and arts programming. Annenberg\u2019s Student Services Office hosted the event in partnership with USC student organization The Happy Hour Club, the Annenberg Cross-Cultural Student Association, Men\u2019s Mental Health Initiative and the Public Relations Student Society of America.\n\n\u201cI presented the project as an idea for helping mental health initiatives around campus,\u201d said Saphia Zaman, president and founder of The Happy Hour Club.\u201dI thought [the] organization would be best for students to sort of come together, build that community, get to know each other, but also educating themselves about mental health and learning how to support one another and how to get resources.\u201d\n\nThe Happy Hour Club is a student-led mental health awareness organization that provides an accessible space for USC students to discuss and receive education about mental health topics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that this will be an annual thing and this is the first of its kind. So hopefully everything goes well and it has a great turnout,\u201d Zaman said. \u201cBut we wanted a day of [the] community spreading a chain reaction of kindness, and we thought that could be very needed, especially in September, a suicide prevention month.\u201d\n\nUpon entrance to Kind Fest, students received a free t-shirt on a first-come, first-served basis and began filling seats.\n\n\u201cI just thought it was a really cool event, and I was excited at the fact that it would be about mental health,\u201d said senior journalism student Tamanna Sood.\u201dI think it\u2019s a good start for the school to have events like this.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from the Kaleigh Finnie Memorial Endowment Scholarship, which was utilized by Zaman to create The Happy Hour Club, also spoke at the event. Ella Katz, a former Kaleigh Finnie Memorial Scholar and the creator of Annenberg Media segment Ellavate, encouraged students to speak up about under-discussed topics like mental health.\n\n\u201cIf any of you have that idea, you feel like there\u2019s something that\u2019s not being talked about, or it\u2019s not being communicated or delivered in a certain way, try it,\u201d Katz said.\n\nKayla Bergholz spoke on behalf of Rachel\u2019s Challenge, an organization dedicated to preventing school violence started after the death of Rachel Scott in the Columbine shooting. Bergholz concluded the first portion of the event by challenging attendees to pursue the five goals detailed in Scott\u2019s writings.\n\n\u201cLook for the best in others, dream big, choose positive influences, speak with kindness and start your own chain reaction,\u201d Bergholz said.\n\nUSC Annenberg undergraduate and graduate students can apply to the Kaleigh Finnie Memorial Endowment scholarship until September 29.\n\n\u201cOur main goal is to have an inclusive environment where all students can have a space to come together and express their identities and experiences, specifically regarding mental health initiatives and experiences, which is really important,\u201d said Annenberg Cross-Cultural Student Association co-president Skyler Pak.\n\nThe event continued into the ASC West Lobby following the speaker series. The Annenberg Cross-Cultural Student Association spearheaded the arts side of the event, featuring tables providing materials to make friendship bracelets, Play-Doh and a space for students to socialize. Students indulged in Italian ice and specialty chocolates provided by Happy Ice and Zac\u2019s Sweet Shop.\n\n\u201cEspecially as we\u2019re getting into the first few weeks of midterms, people are in need of a break from school,\u201d said Annenberg Cross-Cultural Student Association co-president Nya Menneh. \u201cThey should have a space where they can bond, socialize and relax and also just get in touch with their inner child.\u201d\n\nThe second part of Kind Fest provided a space for students to listen to others who have taken the initiative in utilizing kindness to make a difference.\n\n\u201cWhen you go to a school that\u2019s academically rigorous and you have so many things going on, it can be hard to check on yourself and make sure that you\u2019re doing okay,\u201d said freshman journalism student Ayana Gonzalez. \u201cAnd then before you know it, you are in a place that is really hard to come out of.

Founded by Ricardo Padilla and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez in 2011, the Latino Comics Expo was first hosted at the Cartoon Art Museum in San Francisco for three years. In 2014 they came across the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach which is dedicated to displaying modern and contemporary Latin American and Latino art.\n\nThe purpose of the expo is to bring creators, fans and the community together and celebrate the art and imagination of Latino artists. The expo is one of the first comic conventions to shine a light on Latino creators and to inspire and raise awareness of creativity in different art forms.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez is an independent comic book creator known for his comic book series \u2018El Muerto\u2019. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that people can see themselves portrayed as a character, in a book, or even a movie,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cI think more than ever now, they should start showing more representation of different groups in every form of media.\u201d\n\nAztec Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles illustration made by Jorge Garza, QETZA Art.

Jesus Magdaleno was fascinated with the art that made him feel represented. He stated he always enjoyed drawing since a young age and as a child he didn\u2019t see many Latino creators.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very drawn to all of these tables showing a reflection of our culture, but also ties in with other things such as the Ninja Turtles,\u201d Magdaleno said, reminiscing on his memories. Magdaleno explained how he saw a difference growing up in the \u201880s and just having white characters and now where there is more inclusivity of his culture.\n\nThe Museum of Latin American Art hosting the Latino Comic Expo is an example of helping those in the comics community by supporting these independent artists and giving them access to expose and express their art to others.

{"key": "/2023/09/15/rosh-hashanah-rundown-how-to-celebrate-at-usc/", "response": "```\nRosh Hashanah, the holiday celebrating the Jewish New Year, will begin Friday at sundown. The holiday\u2019s name translates to \u201chead of the year\u201d in Hebrew, and begins on the first day of the month of Tishrei on the Hebrew calendar, lasting for two full days. Because the Hebrew calendar follows the lunar cycle, Rosh Hashanah usually falls between mid-September and early October.\n\nWhile being away from home during the holidays can be challenging for students who celebrate, on-campus organizations are engaging the campus community with special events to celebrate the new year. USC Hillel and Chabad at USC, the University\u2019s Jewish organizations, are hosting many events throughout the holiday.\n\nRosh Hashanah is traditionally celebrated with services on the evenings and mornings of each day with messages of atonement, renewal and hope for the new year. A hollowed-out ram\u2019s horn known as a shofar is blown at these services as a reminder for worshippers to prepare for the many other holidays that occur during Tishrei, such as Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.\n\nIn addition to services, Jewish people will have celebratory meals featuring foods that are representative of positive aspects to bring into the new year. The most common foods associated with Rosh Hashanah are round challah to symbolize the cyclical nature of the year and apples with honey to symbolize sweet hopes for the new year.\n\nIn addition to services and meals, Jewish people will not work, as the holiday is a period of rest. USC Hillel will kick off the holiday on Friday night with services at 6 p.m., followed by candle lighting and dinner. Hillel will also host services on Saturday morning at 10:30 a.m. followed by lunch, and will conclude on Sunday with a luncheon at 1:30 p.m.\n\nRachael Cohen, Assistant Director of USC Hillel, noted that USC students are not the only ones to attend Hillel\u2019s services; students from other universities nearby will often join. \u201cAlthough L.A. is full of amazing Hillel professionals on university campuses, we recognize that we offer sometimes services at a more convenient time or just more or less offerings, and so we definitely want students from around the L.A. area who are involved in Hillel to come join us for the holidays,\u201d said Cohen.\n\nCohen emphasized that Hillel\u2019s services are open to anyone who wishes to participate, no matter their religious affiliation. USC Chabad will begin services at 6:30 p.m. on Friday, followed by candle lighting, apples and honey eating, and a holiday dinner. There will be two services followed by meals on Saturday. On Sunday, among other things, Chabad will host a tashlich session at 7:15 p.m. that evening.\n\nTashlich is a ritual in which participants symbolically get rid of their sins from the past year by throwing small bits of bread into nearby creeks, streams, or other bodies of flowing water. Students can RSVP for the aforementioned Hillel and Chabad events, as well as others, at their websites.\n\nCohen said that Rosh Hashanah, a time of joy, comes before the Day of Atonement so that Jewish people can gather and form communities before they must be vulnerable about themselves and their past. \u201cRosh Hashanah is like the beginning of a spiritual preparation to open our hearts and open our souls,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cSo we can commit to another year of acknowledging that there will be joy, and then there will also be sadness, and that it\u2019s okay, that we\u2019re not perfect beings.\u201d\n\nRosh Hashanah is one of the holiest days of the year for Jewish people, so if your friends are celebrating you can wish them a \u201cshana tovah u\u2019metukah\u201d or a \u201chappy and sweet new year.\u201d Chag Sameach, Trojans!\n```"}

Mitt Romney announced that he will not be seeking reelection for his Senate seat, stating the need for a new generation of leaders. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones that need to make the decisions that will shape the world they will be living in,\u201d he said in a video statement posted on YouTube. Citing his age as a key reason for choosing to retire, he said at the end of another term he would be in his mid-80s. He will serve as a U.S. senator until January 2025.\n\n\u201cThe next generation of leaders must take America to the next stage of global leadership,\u201d Romney said. The son of the famous governor and presidential nominee George Romney, Mitt Romney has a long political history, serving as Massachusetts governor before becoming the Republican presidential candidate in 2012\u2014 an election he lost to former President Barack Obama. Romney has been serving as senator since 2019, and has only served a single term.\n\nIn a news conference at Capitol Hill, Romney stated that the reasons behind his decision to retire were not out of concern for his approval rating polls in Utah. \u201cThere was a recent poll in Utah which had me showing some very strong numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any question in my mind [that] I\u2019d have won if I ran again.\u201d Polls from August show Romney has a 56% approval rating in Utah, according to a poll conducted by Dan Jones & Associates.\n\nRomney dodged questions on if his decision to not seek reelection was related to his long-standing feud with former President Trump. But, he said in an announcement video that Biden and Trump are not leading their party to confront the issues that face America.\n\nIn an exclusive excerpt from McKay Coppins\u2019 biography, \u201cRomney: A Reckoning,\u201d Romney recalled a conversation with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell when former President Donald Trump was in the middle of an impeachment trial. McConnell said to Romney, \u201cyou\u2019re lucky... you can say the things that we all think. You\u2019re in a position to say things about him that we all agree with but can\u2019t say.\u201d A spokesperson said that McConnell never recalled this conversation.\n\nRomney refused to endorse any potential candidates that would seek to replace him in the senate and declined to speculate on who might replace him. The election to replace Romney will be held on Nov. 5, 2024.\n```"}

Within the first four plays of the Jets\u2019 season, it looked like my hopes of doing so were completely shot. The football gods were brutal for this one. After an offseason of high expectations, the Jets turned the chapter on the Zach Wilson era and had newfound aspirations of a Super Bowl run, yet, Aaron Rodgers couldn\u2019t even make it out the first drive of his Jets debut. After just one passing attempt, Rodgers found himself in the locker room with a torn Achilles following a sack by Leonard Floyd. Like Wall Street in 2008, everything seemed to be crashing down for Jets fans. However, one man saved the day. Rookie Xavier Gipson, who didn\u2019t even know if he had a roster spot a week ago, called game on a 65-yard punt return in overtime to restore joy, for the time being, of many Jets fans. What can I say, I knew all along that the Jets were going to take that one. But it wasn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows for my week one picks. I was dead wrong about Justin Fields and the Bears. I thought the new direction of the team this offseason, adding new talent around Fields, would take shape in a victory over arch nemesis the Green Bay Packers. Jordan Love took that personally, throwing for 245 yards and three touchdowns. On top of that, Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander held Bears wide receiver DJ Moore to only 25 yards on two catches \u2014 not exactly the Bears debut I imagined for Moore. While the Bears certainly disappointed me, America\u2019s team did quite the opposite. The Cowboys were firing on all cylinders, and Dak Prescott didn\u2019t even have to break a sweat. I never imagined that the first two scores of the season for the Cowboys would be a blocked field goal return and a pick-six, but nevertheless, a 40-0 road shutout is a very positive step forward for a team that has Super Bowl aspirations. Overall, last week\u2019s menu was enjoyable, but had room for improvement. Week 1 gave lots of insights into what talented teams could possibly become, with plenty of high-expecations teams like the Bengals, Bills, Chiefs and Seahawks not looking like themselves. But it\u2019s still too early to sit here and predict a whole season off on one lousy game, so let\u2019s look to Week 2. The waiter has arrived, what\u2019s the first dish?\n\nFirst course | Baltimore Ravens (1-0) vs. Cincinnati Bengals (0-1), 10:00 a.m PDT on CBS\n\nThe Bengals definitely had one of the more disappointing starts to the season. Coming off another great year, Joe Brrr really embodied that name with his freezing-cold Week 1 performance. The Bengals struggled to get anything going on offense, with Ja\u2019Marr Chase (5 catches for 39 yards) and Tee Higgins (0 catches on 8 targets) both completely neutralized. However, Lamar Jackson and the Ravens didn\u2019t fare much better, but got lucky with a young and inexperienced Houston Texans squad. The win was overshadowed by yet another season-ending injury to running back JK Dobbins. The Bengals were able to get out of the week unscathed, however, after only one week, the injuries are already stacking up for the Ravens. Star safety Marcus Williams is already ruled out, plus Mark Andrews, Marlon Humphery, and Ronnie Stanley are all questionable for this week. The Bengals have won four of these two teams\u2019 last five matchups. If the Ravens want to leave the weekend 2-0, they should take a page from the Browns playbook last week and make Burrow as uncomfortable as possible in the pocket. Burrow was sacked twice with 13 total hits. I don\u2019t expect another underwhelming game from Chase and Higgins, especially in the Bengals\u2019 home opener. At their best, they are one of the top receiving duos in the league, but the offensive line needs to give Burrow enough time to get through his progressions in order for them to be effective.\n\nFries: Zay Flowers, Ravens wide receiver\n\nThe rookie had himself a breakout week one with 78 yards on 9 catches, and certainly looked like Lamar\u2019s new favorite target. The run-after-catch ability he showcased last week has every Ravens fan excited for his rookie campaign.\n\nPrediction: WHO DEYYYY. In the home opener for the Bengals, I fully expect to see a different squad compared to week one. I am riding with the Bengals in this one. Key injuries for the Ravens, especially Humphery and Williams both potentially out in the secondary, give Chase and Higgins an opportunity to rewrite their woes from week one.\n\nSecond course | Kansas City Chiefs (0-1) vs. Jacksonville Jaguars (1-0), 10:00 a.m PDT on CBS\n\nThis is a rematch of last year\u2019s divisional round playoffs, however, there are some new faces for the Jaguars this year. Calvin Ridley was everything the Jaguars wanted to see for their new number-one receiver, posting 101 yards on 8 catches plus one touchdown. The connection of Trevor Lawerance and Calvin Ridley after one week already has Jaguar fans wanting more. Beating the Indianapolis Colts was one thing, but now the young kids on the block get to put their skills to the test against the best quarterback in the league in Patrick Mahomes II. The defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs looked like a very different team against the Lions in Week 1. It was clear that Mahomes missed Kelce badly, struggling to get any consistency from the recovering core made up of Skyy Moore, Kadarius Toney and Marquez Valdes-Scantling. And I know Kadarius Toney would like to forget about last week\u2019s JV-level performance, with three brutal drops in critical moments of the game. It will be interesting to see whether Kelce plays, because another week of the group they have now could spell more trouble.\n\nMac and cheese: Chiefs\u2019 entire receiving core\n\nThis is an out-of-left-field type of pick, but whatever happens this week might determine the urgency from the front office of looking outside the locker room for options at the receiver position. Kelce back or not, this team struggled immensely to get anything in the passing game, and in today\u2019s age of football, there won\u2019t be a lot of winning without a stout pass attack.\n\nPrediction: DUVALLLLL. I am riding with the underdog Jacksonville Jaguars. Doug Pederson has turned around the franchise into one of the more enticing teams in the AFC over the past two years. If Kelce doesn\u2019t come back, I see the Chiefs continuing to struggle on offense. While it\u2019s still very early in the season, an in-conference win like this can be the difference in playoff positioning come January.\n\nThird course | Seattle Seahawks (0-1) vs. Detroit Lions (1-0), 10 a.m PST on FOX\n\nJust last year in Week 4, the Seahawks traveled to Ford Field in what became a classic game. It was also Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith\u2019s coming out game \u2014 he posted 320 yards and two touchdowns in the win. However, neither team is the same team that took the field in Week 4 of last year. The Lions have grown into a fan favorite across the league, especially after beating the Chiefs on opening night. On the flipside, the Seahawks started in embarrassing fashion losing their home opener 30-13 to rival Los Angeles Rams. Both offenses have the ability to score and score a lot. Last year, the Seahawks ranked ninth in offensive scoring, while the Lions were fifth in that category. On the other side of the ball, though, there is some left to be desired. In what will likely be a high-scoring affair, the result of the game will come down to which team protects the ball better. Look for second-year edge Aidan Hutchinson to make a game-deciding play late in the 4th quarter.\n\nGarlic bread: Jahmyr Gibbs, Lions running back\n\nThe rookie out of Alabama was an exciting player in his Week 1 debut. His rare mix of power and elusiveness made every touch a spectacle to watch, always ending with a Chiefs defender on their butt. I hope to see the Lions provide more touches for the young running back as the season progresses.\n\nPrediction: IT AIN\u2019T THE SAME OLD LIONS. I am riding with the Lions this week. The Seahawks showed plenty of red flags against an inferior Rams team, which makes me question their ability to get it done against a stronger foe. The Lions are coming off one of the best wins in the Dan Campbell era, and the confidence this team has to be oozing is going to propel them to their first 2-0 start since 2017.\n\nLast week\u2019s record: 2-1\nSeason record: 2-1\n\nRecipe of the week\n\nLast week\u2019s recipe of the week was quite a success. I brought out the buffalo chicken dip for Sunday Night Football to many of my friends\u2019 delight. Paired with some chips, it was the second most enjoyable part of my night, right behind the joy of watching my Cowboys shut out the Giants. For this week\u2019s game day recipe, I present Kim\u2019s BBQ Pulled Pork Sliders. Who doesn\u2019t love some classic BBQ pulled pork? Makes 12 sliders. Cook time: approximately 25 minutes.\n\nColeslaw ingredients\n1/2 cup mayo\n1 tablespoon Dijon mustard\n1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar\n1 tsp onion powder\n1/2 tsp sea salt\n1 (9 oz.) package slaw (I like a cabbage/carrot mix)\n\nSlider ingredients\n3 cups pulled pork, (or use store-bought)\ncoleslaw, (recipe above)\n1/2 cup BBQ sauce, OPTIONAL & use more or less depending on how saucy you want the sliders\n1/4 cup butter\n2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce\n1/2 teaspoon onion salt or garlic salt\n1/2 teaspoon poppy seed\n\nDirections\nFor Coleslaw - In a large mixing bowl, stir together mayo, mustard, apple cider vinegar, onion powder and sea salt. Toss in the coleslaw mix. Stir everything together until the slaw is completely coated in the dressing. I like to make this a couple of hours before serving, so the flavors have time to marinate together.\n\nFor Sliders - Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Slice the slider buns in half, remove the top of the buns and set aside. Place the bottom half of the buns in a 9\u00d713 dish. Layer the pulled pork over the buns, top with BBQ sauce, if desired, and replace the top of the buns. In a small microwave-safe bowl, add butter, Worcestershire sauce, onion salt and poppy seeds. Microwave for 30-60 seconds, or until completely melted. Slowly pour the butter mixture over the top of the buns. Alternatively, use a spoon to spoon out melted butter to ensure poppy seeds cover the bun tops. Cover the dish with foil and bake at 375\u00b0 for 10 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 5 minutes. If using slaw, once the sliders have cooled a few minutes, remove the bun tops, add a spoonful of slaw and replace the tops. Enjoy!\n```"}

It was the Padres\u2019 first series win over the Dodgers in two years. Both teams started Monday\u2019s series opener hot on offense, quickly burning through each other\u2019s dugouts. The Padres kicked the game off with an RBI single from Juan Soto, scoring Ha-Seong Kim. The Dodgers answered back with Mookie Betts hitting a solo homerun in the bottom of the first inning, his 39th of the season. The game stayed steady with the Dodgers scoring one more run in the bottom of the second and the Padres adding another run in the top of the third. In the bottom of the third inning, the Dodgers scored five runs (including infielder Max Muncy\u2019s 35th home run of the season) and took a 7-2 lead. Manny Machado brought the Padres back with two home runs, a solo at the top of the fourth inning and an RBI for Soto in the top of the sixth. Add in RBIs from Luis Campusano and Matthew Batten, and the score was tied 7-7 to wrap up the sixth. The Padres looked to counter after Dodger outfielders James Outman and Chris Taylor botched a flyball in left field to start off the ninth. With runners on first base and third base, Juan Soto broke the game open hitting a three-run homerun in the top of the ninth inning, his 29th of the season. Xander Bogaerts followed this up with a solo home run, leaving the Dodgers four runs down. The Dodgers mustered one with J.D. Martinez\u2019s RBI single to center field, but the Padres hung on to win game one of the series 11-8. Evan Phillips picked up the loss for the Dodgers, pitching just one inning and allowing 4 runs. Padres pitcher Robert Suarez picked up the win on one inning with no hits and one strikeout. Coming off of the loss, the Dodgers bounced back in game two with a stellar performance from starting pitcher Lance Lynn. Lynn pitched 7.0 innings, allowing just two runs and five hits. Timely hits for the Dodgers allowed the club to pile on runs against the Padres pitching staff. Freddie Freeman went four for five, hitting his 26th season home run in the bottom of the third inning. Will Smith went two for three on the day with a home run and three RBI\u2019s. The Padres managed to tack on two runs, with Trent Grisham getting in on a fielder\u2019s choice RBI and Fernando Tatis Jr. hitting his 24th home run of the season. But in the end, the Dodgers took the game 11-2. But in game three, the Padres took over. Starting pitcher Blake Snell shut the Dodgers down in six innings, with no runs and eight strikeouts. Soto went two for four, adding his 30th home run of the season in the top of the first. Campusano also went two for four on the day, including a three-run home run in the top of fourth inning. Tatis Jr. piled on two hits and two RBIs. The Dodgers were held scoreless through eight innings, but pinch hitter Kolten Wong broke the shutout, launching a solo home run in the bottom of the ninth. But the Dodgers couldn\u2019t find any more offense, and the Padres closed out the series with a 6-1 win. With the loss to the Padres, the Dodgers record stands at 88-57 for the season, 48-26 at home. The Padres improved their record to 69-78, but still sit fourth in the National League West. Even with the Padres winning this series, The Dodgers still take the overall season series, finishing the season with a 9-4 record against the Padres. The Dodgers now travel to Seattle for a three-game series against the Mariners starting Friday.\n```"}

The release of the UAP Report comes during a recent surge of news relating to extraterrestrial life. This summer Congress hosted hearings on UFOs, and earlier this week, Mexico\u2019s Congress examined supposed alien corpses. Today\u2019s NASA report says they don\u2019t have information to verify that UFOs exist. But what do USC students think?\n\nMarcus Partida is a freshman studying human biology. He is solidly against the idea that NASA\u2019s report is accurate. \nMarcus Partida: I don\u2019t really think that it is telling the truth. I think that there is some sort of life form. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like that green alien or like gray alien thing that we usually think of.

But if they decided to reveal more, I think definitely they\u2019re going to make a change about everything.\n\nAnd for senior Anusha Vadlamani, who is majoring in business administration, you have to see both sides of the issue.\nAnusha Vadlamani: I think that NASA has a duty to inform the public, but at the same time, they have a duty to make sure that we\u2019re not panicking, especially about things that we might not understand. So I think there\u2019s definitely some truth to the report, but I do think that there\u2019s some things they can\u2019t tell us.\n\nFrom UFOs to aliens, USC students may remain skeptical, but the existence of alien life somewhere out there is still up in the air in the minds of many students.

While the neighborhood surrounding USC is home to countless places to grab a bite to eat, there are few options when it comes to coffee shops with space to get work done. Moxie Coffee is hoping to change that.\n\nThe new coffee shop features a welcoming environment for customers with soothing music and rustic architecture that evokes the feeling of a well-established neighborhood coffee shop. Moxie Coffee offers a variety of menu options including coffee drinks \u2013 like the Moxie Special \u2013 and pastries. Students who have been to the coffee shop have given the drinks mixed reviews, but have raved about the pastries, ambiance, and location.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great location because it\u2019s not on campus, but it\u2019s close enough, which I really enjoy,\u201d senior public relations major Ruby Fuller said. \u201cIt\u2019s also spacious and I think a lot of coffee shops are overcrowded.\u201d\n\nOwner Dane Wise describes the Moxie Special as a brown sugar latte featuring homemade brown sugar syrup.

I mean, I\u2019ve always wanted to be an entrepreneur, do things different, disrupt markets,\u201d Wise said. Wise said the opportunity came after he graduated last May.

Courtesy: Levitt Pavilion\n\nBy April Aguilera September 14, 2023 at 3:34 pm PDT\n\nThe future is bright for Sunset Ecl\u00e9ctico, a summer night concert series with a 16-year legacy that brings vibrant joy to the local community of Macarthur Park as laughter, dancing, singing and all-together unity is brought to them by live music through the Levitt Pavilion Los Angeles. Levitt LA has been providing free and accessible live music to all. The music ranges from different genres and cultures in hopes of creating a safe space for diversity and inclusion.\n\nThis year\u2019s summer concert series concluded on Sunday, September 3 with Sunset Ecl\u00e9ctico, a concert featuring three performers who uplifted the space with an upbeat atmosphere and a positive end to the summer season. Allegra Padilla, executive director with Levitt Los Angeles, spoke about what closing the summer-long concerts meant for her.\n\n\u201cDoing 16 years of programming here in MacArthur Park is a really important undertaking, and a very big thing,\u201d Padilla said adding that their series of 32 concerts in three months would conclude with one final night of performances.\n\nThis year\u2019s closing concert began with the opening act, Heart of Eisner Intergenerational Orchestra of Los Angeles(HOLA EIO), who brought out jazz and oldies with brilliant solos from each section. HOLA is an orchestra of musicians from all ages and backgrounds that represents the city in a multicultural experience. The audience was filled with supporting members of the orchestra continuing the unifying motif of community and empowerment throughout the community.\n\nFollowing their performance was Nancy Sanchez y Las Chorizeras, who has appeared on the Netflix series Lincoln Lawyer and has been blowing up through their diverse range of music. They continued the show with their take on mariachi and even covered Selena Quintanilla songs to which the crowd sang along. The community showed their \u201cgritos\u2019' as they listened to the performance and danced around. Providing events like these holds more culture within the community.\n\n\u201cThese events give people a sense of pride, MacArthur Park is such a historically significant space for especially the Latin American immigrant community and many others,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cIt is important to not only preserve the cultures that exist at the moment but also make space for other newer cultural expressions across generations,\u201d Padilla adds in reference to the future of MacArthur Park.\n\nBeatriz Solis, daughter of the Mexican singer Marco Antonio Solis and singer Beatriz Adriana, was the headliner for the closing concert as she performed her own singles and covers of both La Sonora Dinamita and Selena Quintanilla. Her music got the crowd moving and some even went on stage with Solis.\n\n\u201cI love this specific event because there\u2019s a lot of need here for love and I\u2019m so grateful that the city was able to put on this event that was completely free because I know that they took something with them,\u201d said Solis. Before and after the concert she was open and more than welcome to take pictures with her fans.\n\nAt the end of the night, Solis expressed, \u201cI feel very blessed to be able to close this festival today. I hope it\u2019s not the last time because I had a blast.\u201d\n\nAndrea Ybarra, a concert attendee who is also a friend of the main performer Beatriz Solis, expressed the importance of the free accessible live events.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important because the community doesn\u2019t always have access to concerts like this and it just brings you one step closer to letting you know that you can also do that,\u201d said Ybarra.\n\nThe final summer night concert was filled with a sense of unity within its community that is brought through music. As Solis had stated, \u201cMusic is universal\u201d and when celebrated with others it can fill a city with enjoyment.\n```"}

Female and non-binary identifying riders can now select drivers who have the same gender. The new feature is called Women-plus Connect. While it is not active in Los Angeles, Lyft has announced an early launch in cities such as Chicago, Phoenix, San Jose, and San Francisco.\n\nIn a press release, Lyft CEO David Risher said, \u201cWomen Plus Connect is all about providing more women and nonbinary people the opportunity to earn money on their terms and giving riders more choice.\u201d The feature will increase riders\u2019 chances to be paired with women and nonbinary drivers by selecting the \u201ccount me in\u201d option. After selecting their preference, the female or nonbinary rider will increase their chances of being paired with women or non-binary drivers.

The School of Dramatic Arts offered flu shots in the McClintock Building (MCC) lobby Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. The event was part of USC\u2019s vaccine program, Flu and U, which is kicking off a two-month outreach effort that includes several flu vaccine events for students and faculty on campus.\n\nOver the next two months, a number of schools on campus will offer students a chance to get their flu shots in a convenient location. Schools include the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism, School of Architecture and Price School of Public Policy.\n\n\u201cI actually got an email yesterday and I saw that they were doing this at a very convenient time right after my class in the building,\u201d theater major Brooke MacDougal said. \u201cSo I decided to just walk right out of class and do it in less than five minutes, maybe three. It was really, really easy and didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\nFor students on Ship/Atena health insurance plans, there are no out-of-pocket costs. However, for students on other plans outside of USC, $20 is billed to a student account to cover the cost of the vaccine.\n\nActing, stage and screen major Jayden Adams-Ruiz said that both the price and the location was a factor in students deciding to get the flu vaccine. \u201cI think [the location] encourages lots of students to be able to do this because it\u2019s right here,\u201d Adams-Ruiz said. \u201cIt\u2019s free or just $20.\u201d\n\nAlthough flu activity doesn\u2019t tend to spike until October, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, students like psychology major Tiare Cabrera wanted to get their shot \u201cas fast as possible,\u201d in order to protect those around them.

(Photo by Madison Hogue)\n\nBy Madison Hogue\nSeptember 14, 2023 at 2:34 pm PDT\n\nThe annual report spearheaded by the Anti-Racism Diversity and Inclusion (ARDI) initiative, was the focal point of the State of Black L.A., which drew civic leaders, researchers and community members to USC's campus on Wednesday. Black Angelenos earn the lowest median household income, have the highest unemployment rate and the highest suspension rate in public schools, according to the report released in April.\n\n\"They hire us last, they fire us first. They pay us less, they charge us more. They work us harder so we die sooner,\" said Dr. Anthony Samad of the Mervyn Dymally African American Political and Economic Institute. \"All of the outcomes in the report indicate that there is a compounded effect of racism.\"\n\nThe event covered education, multicultural collaboration and reparations. All of the information was supported by the report and Dr. Donna Nichol of California State University Dominguez Hills broke down the data before each talking point.\n\nMayor of Los Angeles Karen Bass referred to income equality as the major cause of homelessness. The homelessness crisis in L.A. affects the largest amount of people among any other U.S. city or nation as noted by the report. The L.A. homeless population is 30% Black.\n\n\"What you see on Skid Row is a Black community,\" Mayor Bass said at the event. \"We need to reclaim our people off the streets.\"\n\nOnly 76% of Black students in L.A. County graduate from high school and one in four are chronically absent, the report said. Dr. Christopher Nellum of Education Trust-West stated that these numbers are due to a lack of care and apathy from leaders who are denying the data.\n\nDr. Pedro Noguera, dean of USC Rossier School of Education, challenged Dr. Nellum's idea and said that the problem is not about lack of care. He believes that people care about the disparities in education, but the people in power do not know how to fix it.\n\nLeaders then proposed solutions for their findings. Veronica Melvin of the L.A. Promise Fund said that care partnered with strategy, focus and collaboration will lead to change. Her non-profit educational organization in South L.A. meets students where they are in their academic journey to assist them with their educational and career goals.\n\nDr. Tolu Wuraola, who is the founder and principal consultant of Magnitude and Bond Consulting, said that anti-Black racism exists in all communities, and that coexistence between minority groups and the common pain points can and should be used to bond different cultures together, not separate them. The outcome of this bonding and continued support can lead to wider representation of Black individuals in different spaces such as hospitals, schools and corporate America.\n\nWith such a high maternal mortality rate among Black women, Dr. Wuraola said that even having a Black doctor in the same zip code as a Black mother decreases said mortality rate threefold.\n\nIn response to damages to Black Americans caused by the lasting effects of slavery, Kamilah Moore, chair of the State Reparations Task Force, has compiled an 1100 page report with the California Department of Justice and her team of 11 others calling for reparations. The result of the report was SB-490, a bill proposed to the California government two weeks ago. If passed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, the California American Freedman Affairs Agency would be tasked with delivering reparations to Black residents of California.\n\n\"The true crux and justification for reparations in the state of California and nationally is for that broken promise of reconstruction in this country,\" said Moore. \"It's about slavery, but it's also about addressing the legacy of slavery in this country.\"\n\nIn addition to the ongoing struggles mentioned in the annual report, it is important to highlight the \"bright spots\" that were noted. There was a 16% decrease of Black individuals who were incarcerated. In addition, 93.6% of Black Angelenos have health insurance which is only 1.9% behind white residents. Lastly, Black residents reported as being the most likely to receive mental health counseling.\n\nIn addition to all the solutions proposed at the event, L.A. County Supervisor Holly Mitchell urged everyone to leave the conference with an \"aha\" moment, and a desire to make change.\n\n\"When we have the courage to reimagine and take action to create a brighter future for Black Angelenos, we are creating a brighter future for every Angeleno,\" said Mitchell.\n\nAddendum: This event was hosted by the Los Angeles Urban League.\n```"}

While delusional Cowboys fans will say \u201cThis is our year!\u201d (for the 12th year in a row) after handling the Giants 40-0 on Sunday Night Football, other teams like the Bills and Bengals have serious cause for concern after poor QB play in their season openers. While this chatter is fun and justified to an extent, let\u2019s not overreact: it\u2019s still only Week 1. Players like Jordan Love and Mac Jones aren\u2019t gonna finish as top fantasy quarterbacks, and the Cowboys defense won\u2019t put up 30+ points every week (though they may when they play the Giants again).\n\nWith all this to keep in mind, let\u2019s take a look at how last week\u2019s Start \u2018Em Sit \u2018Em fared, starting first with the good: I picked Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson as a snoozer in his debut against the Jaguars and he did not disappoint, dropping more than 20 fantasy points thanks to 223 passing yards and two total touchdowns, leading him to QB4 on the week. Commanders running back Brian Robinson was also a snoozer, and while he didn\u2019t get much going on the ground, he did haul in a touchdown grab that brought him to 13.6 fantasy points, placing him at RB15. On the contrary, Najee Harris busted as predicted against a tough San Francisco front, cumulating just 5.3 fantasy points and finishing as RB44. Similarly, DJ Moore was held to just two catches against a difficult Packers secondary, where Jaire Alexander described Moore\u2019s fantasy performance perfectly postgame: \u201cYeah, it was real quiet for him. I don\u2019t know if anybody thought anything else was gonna happen\u201d. While some of my picks were spot on, others certainly were not. I thought that Geno Smith was going to feast against a weak Rams secondary, where in actuality he settled for a mere 112 yards. Christian Kirk was expected to cook after torching the Colts D with three touchdowns last year, however, this year he forgot to even show up to the stadium, grabbing just one catch for less than two fantasy points, finishing as the whopping WR95. While Marvin Mims Jr. was picked as a snoozer against the Raiders, he certainly disappointed too, finishing just better than Kirk as the WR91. Finally, Cole Kmet proved me wrong with my prediction as he finished the overall TE6 after scoring most of his points in garbage time in the fourth quarter.\n\nYou can find a full recap of how my picks performed last week at the bottom of this page. Now let\u2019s look forward to Week 2 with some players you should start and sit in fantasy, being mindful of overreactions following the first week of NFL games.\n\nQuarterback\nSTART: Daniel Jones (NYG) @ ARI\nAfter arguably one of the worst losses in franchise history, the Giants travel to Arizona in a favorable matchup against the Cardinals. With such a bad loss to open the season, I expect Brian Daboll to come out firing, particularly on offense against a Cardinals defense that has lots of holes and allowed the ninth most fantasy points to opposing QBs last season. With Jones\u2019 rushing upside, I like his matchup even more, as I expect the Giants offense to utilize him in the run game heavily just like they did in the opening drive against the Cowboys, where Jones had 26 rushing yards before the Cowboys blocked and returned a field goal attempt for a touchdown.\n\nSIT: Dak Prescott (DAL) vs. NYJ\nDak Prescott didn\u2019t have to do much in Sunday\u2019s historic victory against the Giants, where the Cowboys took care of business 40-0 giving the Giants their worst home shutout in franchise history. In fact, Prescott only passed for 140 yards to get the victory, amassing just 6.3 fantasy points in the process. After not playing much meaningful time against the Giants, Prescott now has to face a top secondary in the NFL in the New York Jets. After not getting many reps due to a blowout victory last week, I suspect Prescott to start off slow against a Jets defense that allowed the ninth fewest fantasy points per game to quarterbacks last season.\n\nSnoozer: Mac Jones (NE) vs. MIA\nMac Jones sneakily had himself a week in fantasy against the Eagles, finishing as the overall QB2 behind his Week 2 opponent, Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. With another favorable matchup against a Dolphins defense that allowed the third most fantasy points to opposing QBs last season, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Jones replicated his performance from last week. Even if the Dolphins go up big in this game, Jones will still be forced to throw the ball a ton, hopefully translating into another sneaky-good fantasy day for Jones.\n\nRunning back\nSTART: James Cook (BUF) vs. LV\nAfter making this list as a sit last week, James Cook has re-entered the list, this time as a start candidate and one who is prime to break out. After the Bills lost on Monday night to the Rodger-less Jets behind four turnovers from Josh Allen, I expect the Bills to get back to the fundamentals and pound the football with Cook against a Raiders squad that gave up the seventh most points to running backs last year. With six targets as well in Week 1, I expect Cook to be heavily involved in both the run and pass game, giving him the potential for RB1 overall on the week.\n\nSIT: Joe Mixon (CIN) vs. BAL\nEveryone\u2019s going to hate me for this one, but this is just a gut feeling. After the Bengals offense got shut down by the Browns in Week 1 behind a mere 82 passing yards from Joe Burrow, I expect Zach Taylor to get the offense rolling early behind what they rely on most: Joe Burrow\u2019s arm. While Mixon is an integral asset on offense, the Bengals thrive most in the passing game behind Burrow, Chase, and Higgins. Across two games last season against the Ravens, Mixon had just 105 rushing yards, and I expect a similar performance out of him on Sunday in a gritty divisional showdown against the Ravens \u2014 who allowed the 6th fewest fantasy points to opposing running backs last season.\n\nSTART: David Montgomery (DET) vs. SEA\nDan Campbell and the Lions showed in Week 1 that they are here to play this season, defeating the defending champ Kansas City Chiefs in Arrowhead. While all the fantasy buzz is on fellow running back Jahmyr Gibbs, Montgomery tallied 21 carries in Week 1 compared to Gibbs\u2019 seven, and I expect this workload to continue as the Lions slowly ease Gibbs into his role as a rookie. Montgomery is only started in 44 percent of leagues (ESPN), and if he\u2019s on your squad this week, he should be starting against a Seahawks squad that gave up the fourth-most fantasy points to running backs last season.\n\nSIT: Cam Akers (LAR) vs. SF\nI feel like this one should be obvious, yet at this point, Akers is started in more ESPN leagues than David Montgomery! Akers and the Rams host the 49ers in a divisional matchup that has Akers going against the top-ranked rush defense in the league. After holding Najee Harris to just 31 yards, I expect the 49ers to do the same to the Rams rush attack, which was split between Akers and Kyren Williams last week. While Akers seemed to have a mediocre fantasy day, Williams out-carried Akers until garbage time when Akers took 11 of the last 12 carries to conclude the game. Knowing his inefficiency from Week 1 (22 carries for 29 yards), I expect Akers to have another inefficient game against the 49ers, likely one of his last in a Rams uniform.\n\nSnoozer: Tyler Allgeier (ATL) vs. GB\nThis is another situation similar to David Montgomery \u2014 a talented back behind a very talented back. While all the hype surrounds top draft pick Bijan Robinson, Tyler Allgeier had himself quite the performance in Week 1, carrying the ball 15 times for two touchdowns, good for over 24 fantasy points, landing him at RB4. In a game against the Packers, who boast an elite secondary but are lacking against the run (allowed the eighth-most fantasy points to running backs last year), I expect the Falcons to pound the rock, and I expect Allgeier to get his turn just as he did Week 1. If he\u2019s available in your league, be sure to snap him up quick, as his ownership share increased by over 31 percent in ESPN leagues this week.\n\nWide receiver\nSTART: Brandon Aiyuk (SF) @ LAR\nAfter a WR1 performance in Week 1, Aiyuk has a chance to keep the momentum going with a great matchup against a poor Rams secondary. While Geno failed against this secondary last week, I believe Brock Purdy will exploit the Rams behind a big day from Aiyuk, his favorite target. Over his last four games with Purdy under center, Aiyuk is averaging over six receptions and 92 yards per game, with three touchdowns in that span. I expect another big day for Aiyuk, so don\u2019t make the mistake of leaving him on your bench again.\n\nSIT: DeAndre Hopkins (TEN) vs. LAC\nDeAndre Hopkins turned back the clock in Week 1, proving right all the fantasy owners that took a risk on him with 13.5 fantasy points on seven receptions. While the volume was certainly there, Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill threw the ball more than 34 times last week, just the fifth time he\u2019s done so since the start of 2022. That type of volume is not destined to stay, giving Hopkins a tough matchup against a deceptively good Chargers secondary. While Tyreek torched the Bolts secondary in week one, I anticipate a bounce-back performance against the Titans and Ryan Tannehill, yielding a weaker performance for DeAndre Hopkins.\n\nSTART: Mike Williams (LAC) @ TEN\nForget Hopkins \u2014 Mike Williams is the player you\u2019ll want to start from this week\u2019s matchup in the Music City. After a disappointing first game of only four receptions for 45 yards, Williams and the Chargers play a Titans defense that gave the most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers of any team last season. Williams should be a matchup nightmare to the Titans, as his 6-foot-4 frame stands substantially taller than any member of the Titans\u2019 secondary, who all check in at 6-foot or below (nothing personal \u2014 I still have love for you short kings). I expect Herbert to utilize all of Williams\u2019 height in a bounce-back game for the Chargers, leading to a big fantasy day for Williams.\n\nSIT: Terry McLaurin (WSH) @ DEN\nI feel horrible for Terry McLaurin. The man has not had a competent quarterback his entire career, and it doesn\u2019t get much better with Sam Howell under center for the Commanders. We saw it in Week 1 when McLaurin had just two catches on four targets, and I anticipate another slow performance from him while Howell gets adjusted to the offense. The Broncos pose a tough matchup for McLaurin, giving up the second-fewest fantasy points to wide receivers last year. His name may be enticing to start, but he would be best off on your bench this week.\n\nSnoozer: Michael Thomas (NO) @ CAR\nMichael Thomas showed flashes of his former OPOY-self on Sunday, catching five passes for 61 yards on eight targets from quarterback Derek Carr. I hate to buy into Thomas again. He\u2019s let me down too many times. But he finally looks healthy again, and I think he and Olave can both finish top-20 at the end of the season with Carr under center. Even though the Panthers gave up the fewest points to wide receivers last week (keep in mind they did play the Falcons, a run-heavy offense that threw the ball less than 20 times), they gave up the fifth-most points to the position last year, and this week they\u2019ll play without their best cornerback in Jaycee Horn. I expect a big game from Thomas on Monday night.\n\nTight end\nSTART: Sam LaPorta (DET) vs. SEA\nSam LaPorta had a good debut on Thursday night, hauling in five of his six targets, good enough to make him TE8 for Week 1. As the Lions welcome the Seahawks to Ford Field, LaPorta welcomes an even better matchup against the team that gave up the most fantasy points to opposing tight ends last season. Dan Campbell likes utilizing his tight ends in the passing game \u2014 we saw it with TJ Hockenson before he got traded \u2014 and with LaPorta getting six targets in Week 1, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this is the beginning of a major role for LaPorta. He\u2019s arguably a strong candidate for a breakout season, but at least for this week\u2019s matchup against the Seahawks, you\u2019d be a fool to leave him on the bench.\n\nSIT: Pat Freiermuth (PIT) vs. CLE\nThe Steelers offense couldn\u2019t string anything together against the 49ers on Sunday, but fortunately, they have a much better matchup against the Browns at home in Week 2. However, Pat Freiermuth faces a tough matchup against a Browns defense that only allowed two touchdowns to opposing tight ends all of last season. In his career against the Browns, Freiermuth is averaging less than three catches and 27 yards per game, and with a small likelihood that Freiermuth reaches the endzone on Monday night, I suspect a weak performance from the tight end from Happy Valley.\n\nSnoozer: Hunter Henry (NE) vs. MIA\nHunter Henry looked like Mac Jones\u2019 most reliable target behind Kendrick Bourne on Sunday, hauling in five catches on six targets for 56 yards and a touchdown. Jones favored Henry heavily over new acquisition Mike Gesicki, and with a matchup against the Dolphins who gave up the fourth most points to opposing tight ends last season, I expect Jones to once again target Henry in a game where the Patriots will likely throw the ball a ton to keep up with the Dolphins high-powered offense. Expect another day of 10+ points for Henry, who is currently started in only one percent of ESPN leagues.\n\nLogan\u2019s Week 1 Results\nQB Start: Geno Smith (9.08, QB23)\nSit: Aaron Rodgers (0.0, QB34)\nSnoozer: Anthony Richardson (20.92, QB4)\nRB Start: Cam Akers (8.9, RB33)\nStart: Miles Sanders (11.8, RB21)\nSit: Najee Harris (5.3, RB44)\nSit: James Cook (10.3, RB27)\nSnoozer: Brian Robinson (13.6, RB15)\nWR Start: Chris Godwin (10.1, WR40)\nStart: Christian Kirk (1.9, WR95)\nSit: Marquise Brown (8.7, WR48)\nSit: DJ Moore (4.5, WR74)\nSnoozer: Marvin Mims (2.9, WR91)\nTE Start: Tyler Higbee (7.9 TE14)\nSit: Cole Kmet (9.4 TE6)\nSnoozer: Dalton Kincaid (6.6, TE18)\n```"}

He also kept the station running during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and made a major push to diversify hiring after the police murder of George Floyd.\n\nClaire Fogarty, a social media intern for LAist, described Scannell\u2019s presence in the work place as CEO.\n\nClaire Fogarty: I met him once. He kind of goes out of his way to make sure there\u2019s a time that he gets to meet all the interns and we had a lunch and a Q&A with him. It was really great. As an intern, I\u2019m working with just my team. There\u2019s not much reason for me to ever interact with executive leadership and so if he hadn\u2019t made that time, I probably wouldn\u2019t have met him, so it was cool to have that experience.\n\nScannell\u2019s time as CEO wasn\u2019t always smooth sailing though. In June of 2023 there was a major outbursts when it was revealed the station laid off 12 percent of its journalists. This resulted in 21 lost jobs which was the largest layoff amount in the station\u2019s history.\n\nProfessor Kahn believes these layoffs are due to the company biting off more than they could chew.\n\nKhan: One thing that KPCC which now goes by LAist really tried to do was lean into the podcast as a distribution mechanism. And one reason they had the layoffs was that they probably grew too fast in that area.\n\nUnion members at the station expressed concern that CEOs made more than 500,000 dollars a year back in 2021. This hit staff hard especially after public documents show Scannell received 625,000 dollars in base pay and bonuses two years prior.\n\nScannell expressed that he is proud of the work he has done while at the SCPR station.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Stephen Knobel.\n```"}

Last weekend, Fast-food companies agreed to remove a referendum from California\u2019s November 2024 ballot that aimed to reverse an unprecedented worker protection law. This agreement will avoid an expensive political battle with labor unions involving pay for their employees. This is a victory for workers across the state, with minimum wage increasing to 20 dollars an hour for fast-food employees starting in April. It will provide workers with higher pay and a more stable future in an often difficult and labor-intensive environment.\n\nFormer Taco-Bell employee and current USC student Isabel Jasper was making $15.50 an hour. Based on her experience there, a higher wage would have compensated for the stress. Isabel Jasper: It was not super pleasant. It was just a very tight space. I think that location in particular was not managed that well. It was a little understaffed and so there was just a lot of there was a lot of yelling\n\nAccording to the math, a salary of $15.50 an hour while working a 40-hour a week job is not a livable wage in California. In a state where it costs 4,423 dollars a month to live according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, workers making 15.50 an hour would only bring in 2,480 a month. Isabel Jasper: A lot of the people I talked to there had multiple jobs and would go from Taco Bell to their other job. And I don\u2019t know, I think even working like night shifts and stuff and few I think one or two of them were tired of talked about having a family and were kind of a lot of them were older.\n\nHowever, not all California fast-food chains have this drastic of an issue. Current In-N-Out employee and USC student Remy Vigil makes the company-specific minimum wage of 19 dollars an hour. Based on her experience, the pay was fair. Remy Vigil: I think it\u2019s definitely you get paid for the amount of work you put into each shift, and I think it\u2019s a really cool place and it\u2019s a lot seems like a lot different in terms of other fast food places like their conditions and what they\u2019re actually being paid for.\n\nAdditionally, IN-N-OUT operates on a level system. Remy Vigil: You can\u2019t really complain just because of the pay and you are able to get raises from working there and moving up a level. So maybe other companies or fast food chains can adopt that like level system of where it it\u2019s easier to get a raise even if they are starting pay like a little bit lower than in and out.\n\nTime will tell how this wage increase will affect both fast-food company policies around employee wage, and the employees themselves at large.

SB 447 is heading to Governor Gavin Newsom for final approval. California started banning state-sponsored travel to North Carolina as an act of retaliation when North Carolina adopted a legislation prohibiting transgender people from using their gender bathrooms in public buildings in 2016. The ban was signed into law the following year. Following a surge in anti-LGBTQ+ legislations, more states, mostly Republican-led and conservative-leaning, have made the list. Six years later, it has grown to 26 states.\n\nThe ban directly impacted government officials, public universities scholars and sports teams that conduct out-of-state business, research or road games using the state\u2019s money. The bill to end the ban was authored by Senate President pro Tempore Toni Atkins and is known as the BRIDGE project \u2013 Building and Reinforcing Inclusive, Diverse, and Gender-Supportive Equality. If passed, the bill would lift the travel ban, but it would also replace it with an outreach advocacy campaign for the LGBTQ+ community in conservative-leaning states.\n\n\u201cI remember what it was like to grow up in a time and place where conversations about someone being gay or lesbian only happened in whispers,\u201d Sen. Atkins said in a press release. \u201cWhile years have passed since then, there are still areas of our country where the LGBTQ+ community \u2013 and especially our LGBTQ+ youth \u2013 feel isolated and fearful for their safety. The BRIDGE Project would be a conduit of hope and compassion, and encourage others to open their hearts and minds to be more accepting and inclusive. It\u2019s within all of us to be that light.\u201d\n\nThe ban has been impacting sports teams in particular that have had to rely on alternative funding sources to pay for their games out of state. That means that football teams from public universities such as the UCLA Bruins can\u2019t use state money to travel to play Utah or Arizona teams while being part of the same athletic conference. Other universities like San Diego State University have not been able to play teams based in Arizona and Utah because of the ban.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been scheduling games with those teams,\u201d said Jamie McConeghy, senior associate athletic director of communication and media relations. \u201cOnce [the bill] is passed, it will immediately change who we can schedule, mostly for home-and-home games,\u201d said McConeghy. \u201cWe worked our way around it for a little bit with the NCAA,\u201d he said, referring to basketball games played in Houston, Texas \u2014 a state on the no-travel list. These games were financed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and players didn\u2019t have to use state money to pay for their travel expenses.\n\nSB 447 will affect the future game schedules of San Diego State\u2019s football team, but not anytime soon. McConeghy said that SDSU\u2019s football team already has their games scheduled until the 2030-2031 season.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Dylan Luden\nSeptember 14, 2023 at 12:07 pm PDT\n\nAfter dominating Stanford 56-10 on Saturday in what may be the two teams\u2019 last matchup for a while, USC football is keying in on consistency for both sides of the ball during its bye week. Coming into the season, the defense was the biggest question mark for USC in its quest to make the College Football Playoff and potentially become national champions. The Trojan defense has improved every week.\n\nAfter a shaky game against San Jose State, the Trojans\u2019 defense played their best game of the season in their rivalry game against Stanford. The Trojans suffocated Stanford\u2019s offense, only allowing 36 total yards in the 1st quarter and 146 total yards at the half. The Trojans forced three turnovers through fumbles with two of them coming on sacks. Redshirt senior rush end Jamil Muhammad tallied both a sack and a forced fumble Saturday to continue an impressive start for him this season. Muhammad transferred in from Georgia State this year and has had an immediate impact. He has two sacks and seven tackles, plus his two forced fumbles are tied for the team lead.\n\nThe defense has been as consistent as ever thanks to the Trojans getting to the opponent\u2019s offense early and keeping them pinned back. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing together really on all downs, not just third downs,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cOne of my old coaches said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to earn the right to rush the passer.\u2019 You\u2019ve got to earn that right in the first couple downs by defending the run well and playing fast. It\u2019s just a culmination of those things done by everyone, not just one or two people.\u201d\n\nOn the offensive side, the Trojans have been honing in on their offensive line and seeing how they can improve. Just like the defense, the offensive line had their best game of the season by allowing junior quarterback Caleb Williams plenty of time in the pocket and provided an ample amount of room for running backs redshirt junior MarShawn Lloyd and redshirt senior Austin Jones. USC\u2019s offensive line coach Josh Henson has preached and seen consistency as both the starters and backups have had similar playing time due to the nature of USC\u2019s blowout victories so far this season. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really have the play in the first half that we\u2019ve had the two games previously from an offensive line standpoint, where we kind of cost the drive,\u201d Henson said. \u201cYou saw what happened. When we\u2019re not stopping drives with our play, our skill guys are pretty good.\u201d\n\nOne of those skill guys that\u2019s stood out so far is freshman wide receiver Zachariah Branch, who has showcased his electric speed in multiple facets of the game. Branch scored on a 75-yard punt return touchdown early on in the 2nd quarter against Stanford while tallying four receptions for 30 yards. Branch is the only player in the FBS with a receiving touchdown, kick return touchdown and punt return touchdown this year. \u201cI would say [returning] is 75% instinct and 25% preparation,\u201d Branch said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that you have to look at on the prep side of things such as where the wind is coming from and how the ball is coming down, but a lot of it is instinct. If you don\u2019t hit it then some of those holes will collapse pretty fast.\u201d\n\nUSC football will take this break to regroup and focus on areas where it thinks need improvement as it dives head first into playing the top teams in the Pac-12 after the bye week.\n```"}

Apple revealed their range of new products for the 2023 season this morning in Cupertino, California, including the brand new iPhone 15 models. The most groundbreaking change with these new products is the switch in charging ports, from the lighting cable to the now more universal USB-C cable. This feature marks the biggest change to the iPhone\u2019s design in 11 years, the last time Apple switched to lightning cables in 2012 with the iPhone 5.\n\nThe introduction of the USB-C port in new iPhones comes after the European Union voted to require smartphones, tablets and other devices to support USB-C charging by 2024. If Apple did not comply with this law, they would not be able to sell in Europe, which would contribute to a major loss in sales. The EU\u2019s decision is part of a greater effort to tackle e-waste and reduce technology companies\u2019 carbon footprint, but it could generate more waste overall as people throw out their Lightning cables when they upgrade devices\n\nOther prominent upgrades that Apple mentioned with the new iPhone includes a better camera, brand new emergency SOS features, and a tougher titanium material that will wrap the two iPhone 15 Pro models substituting the aluminum that is currently used, The base iPhone 15 will cost $799 and the larger iPhone 15 Plus will cost $899. The iPhone 15 Pro will start at its same price as last year, $999. And the iPhone 15 Pro Max will cost $1,199, which is a price increase, but users will get a storage bump of 256 gigabytes.

I think it\u2019d be really good if USC promoted the vaccine and offered incentives to do it,\u201d Guardado said. \u201cFor my community college, if you got the vaccine by a certain date they offered like a gift card or something. So it\u2019s different ways to incentivize people.\u201d\n\nBrianna Garcia, a senior psychology major, said she\u2019s taking the vaccines as a measure to keep both herself and her family free of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cI have younger siblings and I live with my grandma so I feel like it\u2019s necessary for me to get the booster,\u201d Garcia said.\n\nBut some students said they are worried about the safety of the vaccines.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m open to the idea but I would do my own independent research before deciding to [take the vaccine],\u201d said Mya Kamara, a freshman neuroscience major.\n\nDespite following vaccine recommendations, Garcia also spoke on the uncertainty in long-term side effects of the vaccine.\n\n\u201cI think the only concerns are obviously like the long term effects,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWe just got the vaccine probably like two years ago so we really don\u2019t know the long-term effects, like in 50 years how it\u2019s going to affect us.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s vaccine efforts have persisted. Last year, USC pharmacies hosted Vaxchella, which provided COVID-19 bivalent boosters and flu vaccines to all UPC students, staff and faculty in the Engemann Building\u2019s walk-in clinic.\n\nWhile the University is still waiting for the new COVID-19 booster stock this year, Dr. Van Orman recommends that students get flu shots in the meantime.\n\n\u201cIt is a good opportunity, though, to remind people of the vaccines we recommend for everybody, including their seasonal influenza vaccine,\u201d Van Orman said.\n\nShe added that the flu \u201coften hits right during finals week, so getting your flu shot could really prevent people from either getting the flu, or if they do get it, to make sure they have a milder course.\u201d\n\nStudents can schedule flu shots through MySHR and are available at most USC pharmacies and pop-up vaccination sites on campus.\n\nAs some individuals slowly begin to overlook the symptoms of COVID-19, the CDC reminds us that healthy adults and children can still fall extremely ill to the ongoing disease and the benefits of responding vaccines outweigh the risks.\n\nFind out more in CDC\u2019s announcement.\n```"}

As a Jets fan, the only word I can use to describe what I feel is \u201cbroken.\u201d It was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. This was the exact scenario that plagued QB Vinny Testaverde and the Jets 24 years ago, the last time the franchise had this much belief in their team. I woke up Tuesday hoping that it was just a horrible nightmare, but that\u2019s just life as a Jets fan. At least I still have fantasy football (I say as a desperate coping mechanism). Now that I got my Jets rant out of the way, here\u2019s what you really came for... Don\u2019t Panic About AFC North Duds It definitely was not a pretty week for many highly touted fantasy players, but most notably, the stars of the AFC North. Joe Burrow had probably the worst game of his career, completing just 14 of 31 attempts for a measly 82 yards and zero scores. That earned him a pitiful 20.3 QBR and just 3.18 fantasy points. Yes, you read that correctly, 3.18. This dreadful performance obviously permeated throughout the Bengals\u2019 wide receiver room. Ja\u2019Marr Chase reeled in five of nine targets for 39 yards, equating to 9.1 PPR fantasy points. Cincinnati\u2019s WR2, Tee Higgins, was going as high as the third round in fantasy drafts. He led off the season with 0.0 PPR points. Zero catches on EIGHT targets. Everyone needs to just relax about the Bengals. They are going to be just fine and will be the team we think they are by season\u2019s end. This debut should not be much of a surprise with Burrow making a speedy return from a late offseason calf injury. The last time he started the season after an injury, he had drastically fewer pass attempts than the rest of the year, and this situation should be much of the same. Not to mention they were playing a stout Browns defense on the road in Cleveland, a team who have been Burrow\u2019s kryptonite \u2014 he\u2019s just 1-4 against the Browns in his career. To sum it up, until further notice, these three should be started in all leagues. Another AFC North QB disappointed in his season debut: Lamar Jackson. There were high hopes for Jackson, with him getting his big payday this offseason and finally having a wide receiver room with some weapons. He rewarded his believers with a stinker against a bad Texans defense, amassing just 6.56 fantasy points as a result of only 169 passing yards, an interception and a lost fumble. However, he\u2019s going to be fine and will reveal himself as the dynamic weapon we\u2019ve come to know. The revamped Ravens passing game had its moments too, with rookie Zay Flowers catching nine of 10 targets to lead the team. Not to mention, TE Mark Andrews, Jackson\u2019s favorite target, did not play and should be back next week. Baltimore RB J.K. Dobbins sadly went down with another season-ending injury, though that should only increase Jackson\u2019s carries. Lamar Jackson will be a top five fantasy QB this year. Side note: You should definitely panic about Najee Harris. His value depends on his workload, and it\u2019s clear that is being threatened. Sell him while you can. Jaylen Warren will be the most valuable player in the Steelers\u2019 backfield by midseason. Waiver Targets: Pick up Puka; the Return of Robinson? I\u2019ll state the obvious, it\u2019s Puka Nacua no matter what. Working with a fantasy football website this summer I heard Nacua\u2019s name often, but it definitely was not a household one until now. The rookie led the Rams in targets by a wide margin with 15, tied with Dolphins\u2019 superstar Tyreek Hill for the most by any player in the league. He capitalized on his opportunity, hauling in 10 catches for 119 yards and 21.9 PPR fantasy points. The Rams had been raving about him all training camp, so while it\u2019s actually not too surprising to see him take on a large role, no one expected this. With Cooper Kupp sidelined for the near future, Nacua is the WR1 in Los Angeles. Quarterback Matthew Stafford clearly trusts him, and he should still have a substantial role in this better-than-expected offense upon Kupp\u2019s return. He\u2019s only rostered in 2.8% of ESPN leagues at the time of writing; that won\u2019t last long. Lastly, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually saying this, but you should add Allen Robinson. I know how last season turned out. It was really ugly. Things are different in the Steel City, though. Pittsburgh has him taking the majority of his snaps from the slot and clearly plans to use him. He led the Steelers in targets with eight and despite not making the most of them, five catches for 64 yards, he will have more opportunities. Pittsburgh\u2019s top wideout, Diontae Johnson, will also miss at least the next couple games with a hamstring injury, so Robinson will likely see even more passes thrown his way. The Steelers can\u2019t do much worse than they did in Week One, so it can only go up from here, right? Robinson is flying under the radar, only rostered in 1.7% of ESPN leagues. He will revive his career in Pittsburgh, grab him before it\u2019s too late. That puts a bow on a crazy week one. While it may take me a while to recover from the Jets being the Jets, fantasy football waits for no one. \u201cFrankel\u2019s Fantasy Files\u201d runs every Wednesday.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/09/13/chargers-look-to-avenge-week-1-loss-in-tennessee/", "response": "```\nThe Los Angeles Chargers will look to bounce back this week against the Tennessee Titans following a heartbreaking 36-34 loss in their Sunday home opener against the Miami Dolphins. Though the Chargers led for most of the game, the Dolphins scored what would be the winning touchdown with 1:45 left in the 4th quarter on a four-yard pass from quarterback Tua Tagovailoa to wide receiver Tyreek Hill. While L.A.\u2019s offense was productive throughout, headlined by 164 total yards and one touchdown from running back Austin Ekeler, the Chargers were unable to drive into field goal range as the clock wound down. The Bolts defense gave up \u201cfar too many big plays,\u201d said head coach Brandon Staley, after Tagovailoa set a new career-high with 466 passing yards. 215 of them came via Hill, who had two touchdowns on the night. Luckily for Staley, Tennessee doesn\u2019t boast the same weapons that Miami does with the likes of Tagovailoa, Hill, and Jaylen Waddle. The Titans did add highly-coveted wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins in free agency, though nothing compares to the speed, and thus separation ability, Hill brings to an offense. Having also lost in Week 1, the Titans shouldn\u2019t pose as much of a threat to the Chargers as the Dolphins did, and L.A. can certainly bounce back and get a win in Tennessee this Sunday. But in order to do so, they\u2019ll need to figure out their pass rush. In Week 1, the Chargers couldn\u2019t get to Tagovailoa, registering just two quarterback hits and zero sacks. Coach Staley attributed the clean sheet more to the Dolphins\u2019 willingness to get the ball out quickly, and his team\u2019s lack of pass coverage. \u201cWhen he got to the top of his drop, the ball was out,\u201d Staley said, having been asked about the lack of production from defensive stars Khalil Mack and Joey Bosa. Regardless of the reason(s) for this rut, the Chargers\u2019 pass rush must put more pressure on Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill than they did against to Tagavailoa to ease the strain on their secondary. That should be a manageable expectation \u2014 the Titans allowed the fifth-most sacks in 2022. After losing the cornerstone of their offensive line in three-time Pro-bowler Taylor Lewan this offseason, they allowed ten quarterback hits and three sacks against New Orleans on Sunday. The opportunities will be there for Mack and Bosa off the edge, as well as defensive tackle Sebastian Joseph-Day. The Rutgers product was the only Charger to hit Tagovailoa Sunday, in addition to helping to hold Miami\u2019s rushing attack to just 70 yards. Limiting Tennessee\u2019s passing game will also be crucial to the Chargers\u2019 hopes of slowing down running back Derrick Henry. If Tannehill and the Titans are able to push the ball downfield through the air, the Chargers will have to spread out their defense, leaving fewer hats in the box and more space for Henry to demonstrate why he\u2019s arguably the most dominant tailback in football. The health of Ekeler will also be a huge factor in Sunday\u2019s game as well as the rest of the Chargers\u2019 season, after the star running back suffered an ankle injury in the loss to Miami. His status for Sunday is unknown, but as of Wednesday, he has yet to return to practice. Should he miss the game, Joshua Kelley is a more-than-capable alternative, and, along with a strong passing attack led by quarterback Justin Herbert, should provide L.A. with more than enough potential on offense to get back to their winning ways. While there\u2019s certainly an element of luck to winning and losing close games, last week\u2019s loss provided another example of a feeling Chargers fans have become too familiar with: Losing games from winning positions in the fourth quarter. The Bolts lost three regular-season games which they led in the fourth quarter last season, twice to the Kansas City Chiefs and once to the San Francisco 49ers. Then, L.A. infamously blew a 27-0 lead to the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wild Card Round of last season\u2019s playoffs, crashing out of the postseason with a 31-30 loss. While the Dolphins game exposed plenty of the team\u2019s weaknesses (especially defensively), it was also a hard-fought battle between two teams likely destined for the playoffs. Coming up against a weaker Titans team, the Chargers should take care of business on the road and even up their record at 1-1. The Chargers play the Titans Sunday in Nashville at 10:00 a.m. PDT on CBS.\n```"}

(Photo by Nova Blanco-Rico)\n\nBy Nova Blanco-Rico\nSeptember 13, 2023 at 7:53 pm PDT\n\nYesterday the American Red Cross announced the national blood supply has dropped 25% reaching a critical low. So I went out to donate mine at Crenshaw Christian Center. The tightening of the blood pressure cuff, the smell of alcohol and the quick sting of the needle was the experience that made me pass out the last time I did this. So this time with food and water in my stomach, I could even chat during the blood draw.\n\nThe Blood technician, Carly Feinstein drew out my blood, while I drew out answers. Carly Feinstein: The drives have definitely started to slow down and the number of appointments are smaller and we try to encourage people to tell their friends and when there\u2019s any walk-ins, we have reps who try to recruit people... But yeah it\u2019s definitely started to slow down a little bit.\n\nFeinstein explained how people should know that the process is only 10 minutes and can save up to three lives, especially individuals with rare blood like Kelly Stamps, a faculty member at Frederick K.C. Price III Christian Schools. Kelly Stamps: I actually started donating blood at the beginning of the pandemic. I grew up watching my mother give blood. I have a O-type, which is a very in-demand type. I\u2019m just giving back and being an example of Christ, giving back to wherever I can help.\n\nAnd help is what\u2019s needed to deal with the shortage according to Mimi Teller, Development Communications Manager for American Red Cross. Mimi Teller: That can be attributed to a few things, first of all, it was one of the busiest travel seasons on record for Americans. And also with schools now in session, we don\u2019t have blood drives which are commonly held at schools. But in addition to that, Hurricane Idalia wiped out a lot of our donation drives that had been set up.\n\nTeller says the American Red Cross is incentivizing people to donate by offering free shirt and haircuts from Sport Clips. The American Red Cross will come to USC in early October for a blood drive.\n```"}

As of Sept. 12, your wishes have come to fruition. The 40th annual MTV Video Music Awards were held on Tuesday at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. The star-studded event was emcee\u2019d by Nicki Minaj and hosted some of the biggest names in music, including, to everyone\u2019s surprise (but especially Taylor Swift\u2019s), all five members of popular boy band *NSYNC. Their reunion after 10 years was certainly not the only thing turning heads, though. This year\u2019s red carpet looks did not come to play. Attendees dressed in everything from black to bright pink, from classy to subversive.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are some of the best looks from this year\u2019s red carpet.\n\n10. Chase Stokes\nThe 30-year-old \u201cOuter Banks\u201d actor showed up in a dashing, bright red blazer, draped over a black, semi unbuttoned shirt. White trousers broke up the look with a stark contrast, but his black belt and loafers served to compliment the shirt. While the look was a bit simpler than some of the others on the carpet, Stokes showed us that you don\u2019t always have to push the boundaries to make your presence known. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a classic, timeless look with a pop of color. Not to mention, the bold outwear had an adorable motive, too \u2014 he wore it to match the red dress worn by his partner, Kelsea Ballerini.\n\n9. Sabrina Carpenter\nSabrina Carpenter looked absolutely stunning on the red carpet, donning a Cavanagh Baker gown. The dress had a sparkly silver bodice, draped in a translucent white, tulle-like fabric that made up the skirt. She completed the look with Jimmy Choo heels and gorgeous glowy makeup. The actress-turned-singer\u2019s red carpet look was only the prelude to her performance of hits \u201cFeather\u201d and \u201cNonsense,\u201d where she managed to deck out in even more sparkles.\n\n8. Olivia Rodrigo\nFor such a young artist, Olivia Rodrigo has no problem tackling a red carpet like a pro. The singer, who just released her sophomore album \u201cGUTS\u201d on Sept. 8, came in a glittering silver dress designed by Ludovic de Saint Sernin, made from 150,000 Swarovski crystals. She paired the piece with metallic stilettos by Roger Vivier. The look was simple and elegant, with the glitter providing the touch of youthful fun that Rodrigo has come to be adored for. Rodrigo walked away with the award for Best Editing for her song \u201cvampire\u201d in addition to performing at the event, so it is definitely safe to say that we can look forward to seeing plenty more red carpet looks from her soon.\n\n7. Nicki Minaj\nOf course, it only makes sense to include the event\u2019s host, Nicki Minaj. Tuesday marked Minaj\u2019s second consecutive year as host, so she obviously had to come dressed to impress. Sporting a baby pink ensemble designed by Dolce & Gabbana, Minaj had the perfect look to compliment her widely known love of all things pink and Barbie-esque. The get-up featured a satin corset, a transparent skirt and a gorgeous pink veil, trimmed with lace and other intricate, feminine detailing.\n\n6. Taylor Swift\nTaylor Swift\u2019s appearance on this list should be a shock to no one, considering her presence alone is enough to get fans excited. Swift showed up in a sophisticated black Versace dress, complete with an asymmetrical silhouette and a slit up the side. And of course, we can\u2019t forget the Versace signature: gold hardware detailing. She accentuated the outfit with plenty of gold and silver jewelry, including a $12,000 ring by Van Cleef & Arpels, and a \u201ccat eye sharp enough to kill a man,\u201d as she would say. As expected, Swift dominated the ceremony, taking home nine awards (including Video of the Year, for \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d), and tying the record for most VMAs won in a single night.\n\n5. Selena Gomez\nIt\u2019s hard to talk about Taylor Swift without talking about her bestie, Selena Gomez. Thankfully, we don\u2019t have to. Gomez arrived in a red Oscar de la Renta dress \u2014 it featured a floral-like design over a nude bodice, with a skirt made to look like hanging vines. The unique piece, accessorized with rings, earrings, and a bracelet (all by Pasquale Bruni), and Jimmy Choo shoes, had all eyes on her. Gomez dropped her latest song, \u201cSingle Soon,\u201d on August 25, and if it\u2019s anything like this look, it\u2019s sure to blow everyone away!\n\n4. Chloe Bailey\nChloe Bailey\u2019s Roberto Cavalli ensemble turned heads in the best way possible. She wore a blue dress made of a multitude of fabrics, including a unique pairing of denim and velvet, and a matching scarf. The dress featured a slit up to her hip on one side, and a floor length skirt that pooled on the ground around her. Blue heels and mixed metal jewelry further bumped up the wow-factor of her look.\n\n3. Megan Thee Stallion\nGiven that she\u2019s not the first to appear on this list, it\u2019s clear that female rappers know how to command a red carpet. Megan Thee Stallion served us the ultimate mix of classy and contemporary, with a sheer, strapless Brandon Blackwood gown. The black dress was adorned with vertical stripes, as well as a single horizontal stripe around her waist, to accentuate her figure. She donned glamorous jewelry, including a ring, a bracelet and a choker, as well as her trademark long nails. During the show, she took the stage with Cardi B to perform their new song \u201cBongos.\u201d\n\n2. Cardi B\nAgain, female rappers took the cake this year. Cardi B\u2019s avant-garde look commanded the carpet. She donned a metallic silver structural dress with matching arm bands, but the pieces were created from an unusual material: hair clips. Yes, that\u2019s right, Cardi B\u2019s iconic outfit was made of hundreds of silver hair clips designed by Dilara Findikoglu. It was certainly one of the most unexpected, yet stunning looks of the night.\n\n1. M\u00e5neskin\nThe Italian rock band, consisting of Damiano David, Victoria De Angelis, Thomas Raggi, and Ethan Torchio, stepped out in all black outfits by designer Rick Owens. All four members wore dark eye makeup to compliment their rockstar demeanor. While the group looked sleek and cohesive, their coolness-factor was still through the roof. Despite wearing the same color, M\u00e5neskin\u2019s outfits differed in silhouette and fabrics used, allowing them to look just as incredible solo as they did altogether. Their Best Dressed title was rightfully earned.\n\nThe complete list of award winners is now available to view here.\n```"}

The Santa Monica Daily Press wrote a report of the water in Santa Monica beaches being the most polluted in California. We asked Heal The Bay Water Quality Specialist Alison Wu to explain the potential risk to humans and the environment.\n\nAlison Wu: \u201cWe are talking about water safety, we\u2019re mainly concerned about what\u2019s called water pathogens. So basically, these pathogens, the microorganisms that can make people sick. For example, some people went to the beach, come back with like stomachaches, rash skins, like red eyes. This is mainly happened when there were slight infections due to some waterborne pathogens. So this among pathogens can come from different sources, mainly like although they ended up on the beach in the water.\u201d\n\nSome members of the community like local surf teacher, Kei, didn\u2019t express as much concern being in the water. Kei: \u201dI usually stay out of the water right up here because a lot of the bacteria garbage off the streets goes into the ocean. \u201d Kei usually does not check bacteria levels before going out surfing Kei: \u201d... not on a day by day basis, mostly because I don\u2019t really want to know that\u2019s going to be out here anyway.\u201d\n\nWith the rainy season that is present in California, it leads to problems in the ocean. Alison Wu: \u201c...especially during rain seasons, because we know the storm drains basically collect all the rainwater that\u2019s flowing from the roofs or from the streets. So they\u2019ll collect all this dirty water. Flush them into the ocean. So usually the water within the storm drains a pretty dirty. So, for example, like even to close beaches at Venice Beach, one close to the storm drains and one is like away from storm drains. So even there are like only a few a few. 100 foot, what, a few hundred feet away. One close to the storm drain to have really bad water quality.\u201d\n\nTourist, Janine Gonzalez, from Colorado said she will listen to the advice from the Los Angeles representatives.

Calderon is a culture bearer of Gabrielino Tongva, Chumash, Yoeme and Chicana descent. She, along with a handful of other speakers, appeared today on the Arctic Sunrise, a Greenpeace ship docked in Long Beach, California, to urge governments to protect ocean sanctuaries.\n\nThe event announced the launch of Greenpeace\u2019s latest report, \u201c30x30: From global ocean treaty to protection at sea.\u201d Greenpeace also used the event as an opportunity to premiere a short animated film called \u201cSanctuary,\u201d featuring the voices of Simon Pegg, Jane Fonda and Camila Cabello. The film showed a whale who guides a flying fish and an eel through industrial fishing nets to an ocean sanctuary.\n\n\u201cScientists have pointed out that due to the rapid declines of our oceans from everything from overfishing and destructive fishing, and pollution and climate change, protecting 30% of our oceans by 2030 is sort of our best bet for avoiding the worst impacts of biodiversity loss, extinction and climate change,\u201d said Arlo Hemphill, project lead for Greenpeace\u2019s U.S. ocean sanctuary campaign.\n\nA copy of Greenpeace\u2019s 30x30 report executive summary obtained by Annenberg Media calls for governments to \u201ctake action\u201d to protect marine areas. The report says that the treaty \u201cfills a gaping hole in planetary governance and protection,\u201d calling for governments to push to fulfill the goal of 30% of the ocean marked as sanctuaries by the year 2030.\n\nThe United Nations held its first International Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction in 2018. The purpose of the conference included drafting an internationally binding agreement on sustaining and conserving marine areas. Work on the treaty started over 20 years ago, according to Greenpeace\u2019s lead \u201cProtect the Oceans\u201d campaigner Chris Thorne.\n\nHe said that treaty negotiations, which began about five years ago, were stalled by both the COVID-19 pandemic and uncooperative countries in the global north. \u201cIt was Great Britain, the European Union, the U.S.A., Canada; they presented a deal in that round of negotiations that was too late in the process,\u201d said Thorne. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough time for countries in the global south to actually properly assess what was on the table.\u201d\n\nBut after five sessions and five years, the conference adopted by consensus what is now known as the Global Oceans Treaty. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace calls the treaty an \u201cextraordinary diplomatic achievement.\u201d\n\nNow that the treaty has been adopted by the United Nations, individual member nations must decide whether they want to pass necessary legislation that will allow them to ratify the treaty. It will take the cooperation of 60 countries to ratify the treaty.\n\n\u201cThen this treaty will enter into force and actually become a real thing, a tool that governments can use to regulate the high seas and deliver protection to those ecosystems,\u201d Thorne said.\n\nIn Greenpeace\u2019s report, and throughout the Protect the Oceans event, the phrase \u201chigh seas\u201d is used to refer to marine Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ), sections of the oceans from seabed to surface water outside of any government\u2019s control. ABNJ cover 73% of the ocean\u2019s volume and 61% of the area of the ocean. These areas lack legislative bodies \u2014 anything goes on the high seas.\n\n\u201c42% of the planet is covered by international waters,\u201d Hemphill says. \u201cThat\u2019s almost half of the planet. And for centuries, it was basically treated like the aquatic wild west, where anything went, and there\u2019s no rules, there\u2019s no regulations.\u201d\n\nSpeakers at Greenpeace\u2019s event stressed the importance of indigenous leadership and traditional techniques in the process of preserving marine areas. Northern Chumash Tribal Council executive assistant Gianna Patchen felt that, while she is not indigenous herself, listening to indigenous voices is key.\n\n\u201cUplifting the work that\u2019s already being done by tribes\u201d is meaningful, said Patchen. \u201cThe Chumash sanctuary is one example of work being done by indigenous peoples to do marine conservation that is meaningful, long-lasting and incorporates knowledge long term.\u201d\n\nCalderon agreed, saying, \u201cOur people have received original instructions. And it has passed down through millennia. We haven\u2019t wavered in being good relatives, and living in respect and reciprocity, and continuing a balance, a harmony and a balance, that\u2019s so necessary for all life to survive.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace\u2019s push is in its final sprint. The United Nations General Assembly opens the Global Ocean Treaty for signatures on September 20, 2023. Although a signature is nonbinding, it indicates strong intent to ratify for the country that signs - and 60 total signatures are needed.\n\n\u201cThe signing of this treaty is going to be a significant step in us now looking at the areas of what used to be called the high seas for protection,\u201d said Solomon \u201cUncle Sol\u201d Pili Kaho\u02bbohalahala, a Hawaiian elder and indigenous leader in his closing statements.\n```"}

Board members said that even though they were reluctant to approve the price hike, they believed they had no choice. Cal State joins other universities that have raised tuition prices in recent years, including USC. USC tuition has increased by five percent in each of the last two years.\n\nUSC President Carol Folt said that the university lost \u201cnearly $1.2 billion in extra costs and lost revenues\u201d between 2020 and 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic inflation.\n\nIn an impassioned statement, Cal State University Trustee Leslie Gilbert Lurie exclaims she feels the university simply has \u201cnot found an alternative path.\u201d The price hikes will begin in 2024-2025 and will be implemented over the next five years.\n\nCSU executive vice chancellor & chief financial officer Steve Relyea said, \u201cThe revenue from the tuition increase is essential to provide the CSU with the financial stability it needs to continue to serve students today and in the future\u201d.\n\nAn amendment to the proposal introduced by Chair Wenda Fong would have reduced the time period of tuition increase to three years at the same rate. But the motion failed, with the majority of committee members speaking out against the amendment.\n\nAccording to reports, students and faculty were baffled by the increase, as the school hadn\u2019t raised costs in 12 years save for a 5 percent increase in 2017. Lurie said that CSU campuses across the state are in \u201cshocking disrepair\u201d: Staff salaries are being repeatedly undercut and student services have been increasingly underfunded. She also said the university owes a better standard of education to current and future students, which will only be possible with more funding. The only other option would be to cut services, which would affect all students.\n\nSeveral members, including Trustee Jean Picker Firstenberg, echoed Lurie\u2019s sentiments, declaring that the CSU community \u201ccannot survive if we don\u2019t take action.\u201d\n\nBefore the vote, the board stressed that they were aware of the financial hardships many of their students will experience in the face of this additional burden. Lieutenant Governor of California Eleni Kounalakis pointed out the majority of their student body are economically disadvantaged students who could not and cannot afford to attend private universities.\n\nBuilding off Kounalakis\u2019 concerns, Trustee Raji Kaur Brar pled with committee members to keep in mind the total cost of attendance these students are responsible for, which is not just tuition, but also housing and transportation costs.\n\nNearing the vote, in a very emotional speech, Trustee Jose Antonio Vargas highlighted the importance of keeping universities such as CSU financially accessible so that high school graduates, like his \u201cnieces and nephews, can go to Cal State,\u201d as he did.\n\nA worry consistently brought up throughout the meeting was that the university would suffer less funding paired with lower enrollment rates if a large number of students begin to drop out after tuition is raised. Lurie posed a solution, stating the committee must work hard to receive state funding, so as to not rely solely on students to fund the university. She wants members of the committee to be committed to this cause, so that \u201cno student...will be priced out of the system\u201d after the new tuition policy is implemented.\n\nBefore the vote took place, Chair Wenda Fong clarified that the tuition increase will not fix all the budgetary and funding issues the university has been enduring.\n```"}

City Council. L.A. City Council voted on Tuesday, Sept. 12 to approve a motion that would allow the city to officially explore pathways and partnerships towards acquiring around 260 acres in the Senderos Canyon, just west of the neighborhood of Bel Air. The area is one of the last and largest remaining undeveloped pieces of land in the City of Los Angeles, with around 90 percent being untouched.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, I submitted a motion after we learned that a very large parcel of open space in the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains was coming up for auction,\u2019\u2019 said Councilwoman Katy Yaroslavsky leading up to the vote. \u201cWe saw this as an opportunity to begin a conversation about how we collectively\u2014the state, the county, private partners and community organizations\u2014could come together to save the land and preserve it for the public benefit.\u201d\n\nThe land was put up for auction in January for $39 million, but closed without a buyer in March. The council\u2019s motion doesn\u2019t allocate any funds yet, but allows for the city to begin official talks and planning to acquire the land, including the possibility of partnering with private organizations. Additionally, the motion points to the acquisition helping in California\u2019s 30x30 initiative, an aim to conserve 30 percent of California land by the year 2030 to combat the global climate and biodiversity crises.\n\n\u201cUnspoiled open space will encourage natural habitats and biodiversity,\u201d Kathy Schaeffer, Legislative Co-Chair of the San Fernando Valley Climate Reality Project, said in a public comment on the proposal. \u201cDevelopment of this area with more mega-mansions is inconsistent with residents\u2019 desires for preservation of open spaces, as well as city environmental goals.\u201d\n\nThe canyon is already bordered by other protected areas, and if obtained by the city, would be incorporated into the Westridge-Canyonback Wilderness Park. The city has an interest in public ownership of the land not only for the preservation of endangered wildlife, but also for the safety of nearby residents due to a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone covering much of the mountain range.\n\n\u201cThe city has a unique opportunity to preserve this land for wildlife and allow for public access to open and recreational space,\u201d the motion reads. \u201cIf properly preserved and managed in a manner consistent with indigenous knowledge and practices, the property has an opportunity to present benefits for nearby neighborhoods.\u201d\n```"}

When students move through stressful times, it can be helpful to know about the mental health resources on campus and ways to deal with stress.\n\nBroderick Leaks, Director of Counseling and Mental Health at USC Student Health, said in a briefing before the fall semester that the number of students who seek mental health services goes up each year. To help students struggling with mental health, Leaks said that there have been several efforts to improve and advance mental health services at USC.\n\nLeaks said that a new app called \u201cNod,\u201d a mental health application that launched at the beginning of the school year can help improve students\u2019 mental health. \u201cIt\u2019s an app that helps with belonging, and loneliness, and really helps students kind of have some creative ways of connecting with each other,\u201d said Leaks.\n\nThrough his research, he also connected students with the Oasis mental health app, which allows students to use technology for mental health services. He said that a lot of students want chat and text features rather than calling in or seeing someone in person.\n\nUSC students also have access to UWill, an online therapy platform partnered with Counseling and Mental Health Services to talk through a problem or explore how therapy might help them in a college environment. \u201cWe really wanted to kind of make sure that we were having the right service in the right place at the right time delivered by the right person,\u201d said Leaks.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Simi Valley-based non-profit, All It Takes, released the first in a series of documentary training films: \u2018Meeting the Moment.\u2019 The films are aimed at providing students and educators with the tools they need to overcome the emotional and mental health challenges that persist in school environments.\n\nThe 14-minute documentary suggested that the mental health crisis has always existed and that the COVID-19 pandemic only exasperated the issue. Professionals such as Maggie Maguire, a high school wellness teacher, explained that children in schools are struggling and that there is more anxiety and depression as well as overwhelmingness and exhaustion in the school environment.\n\nIn the short film, Mary Helen Immordino-Yang, a professor at USC Rossier School of Education suggests that we need to let kids move through these spaces. \u201cScience is unequivocally showing us that our biology literally doesn\u2019t know how to organize itself in the absence of culture and relationships,\u201d said Immordino-Yang. \u201cWhat students and teachers need is a safe and communal space.\u201d\n\nImmordino-Yang also explained that teachers need to be a safe space and direct a student to help that they may need: \u201cWe have to step back and attend to the person.\u201d Students in the documentary also suggested that teachers should show that they care about their students and get to know them in order to create a safe feeling in a classroom environment.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, self-care can help maintain mental health to manage stress, lower the risk of illness and increase energy. The NIMH provides ways to get started with self-care, including: exercising; eating healthy and staying hydrated; prioritizing sleep; practicing self-gratitude; and staying connected with friends and family.\n\nThe Suicide & Crisis Hotline national number is 988. The service provides confidential support for anyone in emotional distress or in a suicide crisis. The hotline is available any hour of the day, every day of the week.\n```"}

The event took place at McCarthy Quad alongside the farmers\u2019 market, with the main aim of providing students with knowledge about \u201chow exactly we can be more efficient on this campus, how we can be more safe and what we can do to change the current procedures and protocols,\u201d said Justin Santana, a spokesperson for USC Transportation.\n\nThe event was sponsored by USC Transportation, USC Department of Public Safety, Fire Safety & Emergency Planning, Environmental Health & Safety, LA Bike Coalition, Bird Scooters and Lime Bikes, who also had booths set up at the event. Make sure to stop by for free swag and learn about pedestrian, bike, and scooter safety!\n\nThe goal of the day was to \u201cmake students aware of the many different programs that are out there for them,\u201d said Santana, \u201cespecially for students that have issues with private transportation\u201d because of rising costs. The event was held in a booth as part of the campus farmers\u2019 market. Officials gave out safety gear such as bike bells and provided safety demonstrations and information. Pamphlets were also provided about the free USC U-pass, which can be used for unlimited rides on all metro bus and rail lines, Culver CityBus, Foothill Transit, GTrans, LADOT-DASH, Torrance transit, long beach transit, Montebello bus lines, Norwalk transit, Pasadena transit and Santa Monica big blue bus. Maps were also available for students to find accessible routes to various places in Los Angeles.\n\nEmergency Response team member, Emmelina Najera, from the Fire Safety and Emergency Planning Committee, said her team was using the event as an opportunity to talk about other types of emergencies that occur on campus. They aimed to spread awareness about what to do in the event of an earthquake and to remind everyone to evacuate in the event of a drill. They also performed safety demonstrations on how to use a fire extinguisher.\n\nAndrea Sanchez, from the Office of Environmental Health and Safety, said her team was promoting information on topics like heat illness. \u201cLos Angeles [has] really high heat temperatures, like 90-100 degrees,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWe want to make sure that we\u2019re giving information on how to prevent heat exhaustion or heat strokes.\u201d They were also giving out PPE kits that included masks and hand sanitizer due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases on campus to ensure students and faculty at USC have something on hand.\n\nThe booths were surrounded by bikes in an effort to ensure students were aware they could register their bikes at the event. Santana said the most important safe riding tip for students would be to register their transportation vehicles with public safety. Santana said the event would be beneficial to students who had questions for them about transportation since it is usually \u201chard for them to communicate with us, especially during our office hours.\u201d\n\nStudents appeared to enjoy and benefit from the event. Armine Nahigian said she \u201cwon a bike at the DPS raffle before\u201d and that she enjoyed talking to DPS about what she has seen going on around campus. She also said that she could see how USC might not be safe for students and riders if they do not pay attention.

Is Victoria\u2019s Secret the next brand to hop on the diversity and inclusion train?\n\nBy Yvonne Abedi September 13, 2023 at 2:54 pm PDT\n\nDo you remember finally being old enough to step foot in a Victoria\u2019s Secret and purchasing all the things your parents refused to buy? For many girls, the 5 for $35 underwear sale was a staple part of their journey to womanhood. But we got older and everything changed. The Victoria\u2019s Secret Angels transformed from picture-perfect embodiments of femininity to problematic portrayals of what society thinks women should look like. The company has had a controversial history in regard to the beauty ideals they\u2019ve promoted.\n\nThe last Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show was in 2018, and after that, many spoke up about the treatment they received while working under Ed Rasek and Leslie Wexner. Rasek was accused of sexual assault and harassment by former Angels, who claimed that when they would speak out, they would face retaliation by not being hired anymore. Wexner not only condoned this behavior but, according to The New York Times, also had connections to Jeffery Epstein \u201cwho managed Mr. Wexner\u2019s multibillion-dollar fortune, [and] lured some young women by posing as a recruiter for Victoria\u2019s Secret models.\u201d Wexner is no longer associated with Victoria\u2019s Secret as it completed its separation from the parent company L Brands that he originally founded. Rasek stepped down as well, so what does this mean for Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s future as a brand?\n\nThe company has now launched its rebrand with the \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret World Tour 23,\u201d which will showcase four female designers from Lagos, Nigeria, London, Japan, and Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. It will air on Amazon Prime on Sept. 26, showcasing their journeys and the process behind their work. Within the trailer, we see models like Adut Akech, Paloma Elsesser, Imaan Hammam, and Winnie Harlow, who all have different body types and skin tones, a stark contrast to past Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Shows. We also see the inclusion of transgender models, like Alex Consani, within the show.\n\nIn 2018, in an interview with Vogue, Rasek said, \u201cIt\u2019s like, why doesn\u2019t your show do this? Shouldn\u2019t you have transsexuals in the show? No. No, I don\u2019t think we should. Well, why not? Because the show is a fantasy.\u201d Now it\u2019s a reality, and a huge step in the right direction for the brand. However, even with the push for inclusion within their new framework, I can\u2019t help but remember the 12-year-old version of myself who wondered why women who looked like me weren\u2019t represented on that stage. Has the damage been resolved? Will the unrealistic beauty standards and ideals they promoted throughout society for years be reversed through this return? No. That\u2019s the hard truth, as we\u2019ve seen the beauty standards of each decade fade in and out, but they always come back to two things: skinniness and whiteness. This notion has stuck around for so long, it\u2019s been embedded into the structure of our society.\n\nPeople have taken to social media and begun to speak out about their thoughts on the rebranding of the new show. Cami Twomey, USC junior and TikTok content creator said, \u201cThe return of the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show flopped.\u201d @cami.twomeyy It would have been great to see plus-sized and diverse models walking the iconic VS runway. VS clearly only included more diversity when they realized they were losing money so something about the rebrand feels disingenuous. Not to mention the show and looks seemed poorly executed.\n\nAlthough this fashion show is conceptually appealing in its ability to showcase talented designers all over the world, Victoria\u2019s Secret has been at the forefront of pushing these unrealistic standards for years. The Victoria\u2019s Secret brand can change, but it will take a lot more than one fashion show to erase years of conformity pushed on women in their most formative years.\n```"}

USG voted unanimously last week to pass a new bill that makes officials more available to student through office hours. (Photo by Nicholas Corral of Annenberg Media)\n\nBy Siena Maniatis and Nicholas Corral\nSeptember 13, 2023 at 2:12 pm PDT\n\nStudents will now be able to meet with officers of the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) over Zoom following a bill unanimously passed by the USG Senate during a meeting on Sept. 5. When presenting SB 143-08, President Divya Jakatdar emphasized the low usage of the office hours system and highlighted a need to reach students not served by the current system, including students who commute or have jobs.\n\nThe USG bylaws dictate that all USG officers are required to hold office hours that are accessible to their constituents and complete USG responsibilities, such as processing applications or completing research. Chief of Staff David Martinez said officers are anyone who is listed on the staff roster. These office hour requirements range from two hours a week for junior officers and up to 20 hours a week for the president and vice president.\n\nUnder last year\u2019s Office Policy Manual, USG office hours were held almost exclusively in the USG offices. Some members in the Executive Cabinet, Programming Department and Legislative Branch were allowed to complete some office hours outside of the office per an exception, termed external office hours.\n\nThe updated bill changes this significantly, allowing student leaders to regularly complete their office hours outside of USG offices, and for the first time, allowing office hours to regularly occur over Zoom.\n\nThe bill sets out three major categories of office hours: internal office hours, public office hours and external office hours. Internal office hours refer to any office hours that occur within the physical USG offices, which are required to make up at least 50% of a USG member\u2019s office hours. Public office hours are the new name given to what used to be external office hours, and consist of any hours an officer spends working in a USG capacity outside of the office, such as tabling at the involvement fair or going to meet a constituent outside of the USG office. The third category is now termed external office hours, or the time a USG member spends doing official work on Zoom.\n\nAs a check on the potential abuse of external office hours, officers are required to deliver their completed work at the end of the office hour period. The new office hour system is intended as a trial run that is set to expire on Nov. 17, 2023, unless re-approved.\n\nWith the influx of new hires at USG at the start of this semester, office hours are still being determined, but they are expected to be decided by Tuesday, Sept. 19.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan September 13, 2023 at 9:20 am PDT\n\nIt\u2019s time to give Becki Tweed the job Angel City FC needs to make a statement. For about three-quarters of the club\u2019s brief existence, the team has not been a serious competitor. The Freya Coombe reign promised a lot with splashy signings like Christen Press in 2021, but has since achieved little. Until now, that is. And head coach Becki Tweed has earned her contract offer to become Angel City\u2019s permanent manager.\n\nIt\u2019s not an overstatement to say that Tweed has turned ACFC into an actually competitive team. In Tweed\u2019s 10-game run in both the NWSL regular season and the Challenge Cup, Angel City has yet to lose, totaling six wins and four draws. Even more impressively, five of those wins came against the top four teams in the NWSL by league position, including two against SoCal rivals the San Diego Wave FC.\n\nGoing back to the team\u2019s inaugural season in 2022, this 10-game streak marks the first occasion Angel City has an unbeaten streak of more than five matches. Even including fifth-place Gotham FC and the sixth-place Washington Spirit, no team outside the top four looks more likely to qualify for the playoffs than Angel City.\n\nTwo more wins and two more draws would bring the team to 32 points, which will most likely earn them the sixth-place playoff berth. The team would go on the road to play the three-seed, a spot currently held by the North Carolina Courage, whom ACFC beat 2-1 in July.\n\nNo team wants to play Angel City in their current form, and no team would relish a playoff game against them either. Tweed and her staff have accomplished this without many signings, either. U.S. women\u2019s national team legend Julie Ertz only played two games under Tweed before leaving for the World Cup and retired after the U.S.\u2019s loss to Sweden.\n\nAmandine Henry\u2019s move from eight-time Women\u2019s Champions League-winners Lyon could\u2019ve provided a boost back in June, but she injured her calf in the build-up to the World Cup and has made just one ACFC appearance so far.\n\nTweed has worked with limited resources to turn around a team that looked like it was headed for a bottom-three finish. What else does she need to do to remove the \u201cinterim\u201d from her title?\n\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time in this column outlining how Angel City seems poised to make the club\u2019s first playoff appearance. While I\u2019ve praised Tweed for that progress again this week, she deserves a contract extension regardless of how Angel City finishes the season.\n\nClubs need to choose process over results when selecting the captain of their ships. But that\u2019s the thing: Tweed has demonstrated a command for the process and an ability to achieve strong results.\n\nFans should feel most encouraged by Tweed\u2019s attacking play. In her 10 matches, ACFC have only had fewer than eight shots on two occasions, but they still managed to use counterattacks and set pieces to their advantage to beat the OL Reign 2-1 when they posted a season-low five shots.\n\nWhen the attack clicks, Angel City can tally fifteen-plus total strikes. At the other end of the pitch, Tweed\u2019s defense has been stout, not conceding more than one goal in a match yet.\n\nWith a healthy Amandine Henry and a clinical striker for the 2024 season, Angel City could even challenge for the Supporters\u2019 Shield, the trophy given to the first-place team in regular season play.\n\nThe Angel City hierarchy should name Tweed the permanent head coach as soon as possible and provide her with security through the end of the 2025 season. That may seem like an unnecessarily long extension in a league where teams can rise and fall quickly, but if club president Julie Uhrman and general manager Angela Hucles Mangano allow Tweed to walk at the end of this season, they will feel positively silly.\n\nAnd who knows, maybe the contract announcement would give the team a boost in the short-term, too.\n\nTime to panic for LAFC?\n\nWhat\u2019s the old saying? Once is an accident, twice is a coincidence and three times is a pattern? It goes something like that.\n\nLAFC has a pattern on its hands, a pattern of losing. Losing both home and away, to Eastern and Western Conference teams.\n\nThe alarm bells aren\u2019t sounding quite yet, but my hand is hovering over the button.\n\nThe latest goose egg came on the road to the Portland Timbers \u2014 usually a competent, playoff mainstay who this season find themselves in 11th place in the west.\n\nThe Timbers\u2019 expected goals numbers (per FootyStats) would actually suggest the Timbers have been slightly unlucky this season, having conceded more and scored fewer goals based on the quality of the chances they\u2019ve faced and created.\n\nNonetheless, a 2-0 road loss to the 20th-best team in the league (on a points per game basis) does not bode well for a supposed MLS Cup-contender.\n\nStrangely, LAFC lost this match doing exactly the thing I\u2019ve criticized them for not doing in previous weeks: controlling it on paper.\n\nLAFC accumulated 61% possession in this match and played 514 total passes, almost double Portland\u2019s 287 and about as many as the 539 LAFC tallied in their previous two matches combined (against Charlotte FC and Inter Miami).\n\nSo while I have to commend LAFC for finally taking a game by the reins, the black and gold failed to combine that with the same chance creation we\u2019re used to seeing from them.\n\nAccording to FotMob, the Timbers had 2.27 expected goals in this match to LAFC\u2019s 1.20, mostly due to some catastrophic set piece defending on the Timbers\u2019 first goal.\n\nGoalkeeper John McCarthy mishit the ball so badly on his attempted punch it should be recorded as an own goal. The ball bounced meekly off his hands into the turf and popped up for the Timbers\u2019 Larrys Mabiala for an unmissable header.\n\nMcCarthy has been a competent back-up for Maxime Cr\u00e9peau for most of the season, but the past two weeks, between this mistake and Facundo Far\u00edas\u2019 goal for Inter Miami, LAFC are missing their Canadian No. 1.\n\nThe Timbers\u2019 second goal came from a brilliant series of one-touch passes that LAFC doesn\u2019t seem capable of putting together on their own, with their emphasis on pace and space to create chances.\n\nLAFC can\u2019t put a complete performance together at the moment and with El Tr\u00e1fico coming this weekend, the reigning champs look desperate for a win.\n\nSpeaking of... El Tr\u00e1fico Preview\n\nSince the epic July 4 El Tr\u00e1fico that the Galaxy won at the Rose Bowl, the two rivals\u2019 fortunes have flipped completely.\n\nGoing into that match, the Galaxy couldn\u2019t buy a win, having lost nine of their opening 14 matches, while LAFC looked set to repeat as MLS Cup champions.\n\nBut, my friends, it\u2019s a long season.\n\nRiqui Puig has emerged as the best MLS player on the mortal side of Lionel Messi, with five goals and two assists in previous seven MLS matches in his hybrid No. 10/No. 8 role.\n\nThe team\u2019s entire creative and goalscoring burden falls on the Spaniard, making it even more impressive that he\u2019s living up to his lofty expectations.\n\nThe Galaxy still have an outside shot at making the playoffs and winning three out of the season\u2019s four El Tr\u00e1ficos (including the U.S. Open Cup match) would save a lot of face in a distinctly mediocre season.\n\nLAFC badly need the morale boost an El Tr\u00e1fico would bring, further increasing the stakes in this weekend\u2019s game at BMO Stadium.\n\nOddsmakers still heavily favor LAFC to secure the win, but the Galaxy have all the momentum.\n\nMake sure you have your game day snacks and a cold drink ready when the clock strikes 7:30 p.m. this Saturday.\n\nNext games:\n\nLAFC: Saturday, September 16 vs. LA Galaxy (home)\n\nAngel City: Sunday, September 17 vs. Chicago Red Stars (away)\n\nLA Galaxy: Saturday, September 16 vs. LAFC (away)\n\n\u201cSoCal Soccer Spotlight\u201d is a column by Jack Hallinan about the professional soccer landscape in Los Angeles.\n```"}

He teaches mindfulness, and is committed to the building of \u201ccommunities of resistance\u201d to the \u201cpressures\u201d of contemporary society.\n\nDespite the three panelists hailing from different backgrounds and spiritual beliefs, all panelists projected a similar message of working for individuals to change lives, instead of working to change the world as a whole.\n\nAnother panelist, Father Greg Boyle, came to speak about transforming communities. Since 1986, Father Boyle has operated Homeboy Industries, a program focused on the rehabilitation of former teenage gang members, and one that has reached 7,800 community clients. Homeboy Industries, created to provide healing initiatives to former gang members who were caught in a loop of violence and incarceration, provides programs that include substance abuse resources, an 18-month employment program and tattoo removal.\n\nBoyle is still helping others at Homeboy to this day. \u201cWhat if we invested in people rather than incarcerate our way out,\u201d said Father Boyle. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll stop punishing wounds and together we\u2019ll be healing it.\u201d\n\nFather Boyle appreciated the opportunity to do outreach with a diverse group of spiritual leaders at the panel, saying \u201cThis is wonderful, it\u2019s nice to be with those other two because they all have a story of their own anchor and you like to be around people like that.\u201d\n\nSabrina Sojourner, a Shaliach Tzibur and Community Chaplain, said she was at first resistant to participate in this panel, but realized her teachings were valuable to educating others about how \u201cwe live our lives as good people, who are kind and who are about making and providing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not about practicing one\u2019s faith or spirituality, it\u2019s about living one\u2019s faith and spirituality. And finding the ways to not change the world, but to change and impact people one at a time, or in small groups. And it\u2019s really recognizing that and really understanding that I really do have a very solid core basis by which I operate has really going to transform how I do the work that I do,\u201d said Sojourner.\n\nThe reception\u2019s co-sponsors were the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies at USC, USC Office of Religious and Spiritual Life, USC Annenberg Center on Public Diplomacy and USC Dornsife.\n```"}

Following their 56-10 victory against Stanford last Saturday, the Trojans have a weekend off due to a bye. The players and coaching staff arrived at Tuesday\u2019s practice with the same mentality as game week. A common theme among the team was that this week off is not going to dampen its momentum going into the rest of the Pac-12 season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re three games in, one conference game in, with a lot of things we haven\u2019t done yet and we\u2019re getting ready to have opportunities to do so,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said. Riley spoke positively about his team\u2019s performance against Stanford, but mentioned some areas that need improvement \u2013 one of these areas being the number of penalties against the Trojans.\n\n\u201cSome of the penalties just make you want to pull your hair out,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI thought we played hard. I thought we played really fast and aggressive. And I thought that covered up, at times, some of the mistakes.\u201d\n\nDefensive coordinator Alex Grinch said he is looking to improve on those mistakes with the time that the bye week provides. He is challenging the safety group on its explosiveness and focusing on its competitive reps in the secondary. Grinch said his desired outcome of this week\u2019s training is for the defense to make fewer detrimental mistakes.\n\n\u201cWe need to get to a point where the lowlights cannot be that low,\u201d Grinch said about the points the Trojan defense allowed in the first three games. \u201cNow you\u2019ve got some things on video and you\u2019ve got to look at it through the lens of \u2018OK, what\u2019s next steps?\u2019\u201d\n\nAs a member of the defense, redshirt senior safety Max Williams said he looks at this week of practice no differently than a game week. When asked how he felt about a bye this early in the season, he expanded on the team\u2019s mentality.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going full speed, we\u2019re going high tempo. We\u2019re running, being physical,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019re practicing like we have a game this week and not looking at it as a bye week.\u201d\n\nWilliams, who led the team with 79 tackles last season, said the team is looking forward to the training week to improve in all areas. From stopping the run and containing the quarterback, he said he believes the team\u2019s focus from the past three games will translate to practice.\n\nUSC travels to Arizona State for its next game on Saturday, Sept. 23.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of IsaacSexton2001 licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nBy Monique Davis September 12, 2023 at 8:05 pm PDT\n\nDisney+ is joining the long list of streaming services that are raising their prices. Beginning Oct. 12, the ad-free version of Disney+ will now cost $13.99 per month, a 27% percent increase from the current price of $10.99. The ad-free version of Hulu \u2014 which Disney owns a majority share of \u2014 will increase 20% from $14.99 to $17.99. To make up for the price increase, Disney+ is now offering a new bundle that allows customers to receive the ad-free option of Hulu and Disney+ for $19.99 per month.\n\nReenua Jones, a master\u2019s student studying public relations and advertising, says that having a bundle option makes a difference for students because of the convenience factor. \u201cWhen it just comes to students, we just have to pick and choose what we purchase and what we don\u2019t like,\u201d Jones said. \u201cToday\u2019s Tuesday, and I want tacos, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll get them because you know, we have to be mindful of our dollar.\u201d\n\nThe change in pricing follows Netflix\u2019s decision to eliminate its basic ad-free plan, where new users must choose between the ad-supported program for $6.99 a month or their more expensive ad-free platform. A decision to shift the pricing comes on the tails of Spotify, which increased its subscription rates in July. Less than a year ago, Disney increased their subscription prices from $6.99 to $10.99 per month. Hulu barely falls under Netflix\u2019s premium plan cost of $19.99 a month, despite its less extensive content library.\n\nAs streaming platforms continue to raise their prices, many college students who rely on these platforms for entertainment are hit the hardest when most of their finances are tied up in tuition payments and school fees. Jones says that the increase in cost is unnecessary and feels like price gouging. \u201cI think it\u2019s irritating considering the economy we\u2019re in,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think Disney should provide student deals like the Spotify and Hulu bundle, because as of right now, they don\u2019t offer students anything.\u201d\n\nStudents are able to purchase a special bundle of Spotify Premium and Hulu (With Ads) for just $5.99 a month. Madison Price, a senior majoring in computer science, believes that the increase will cause people to share passwords or search for pirated content. \u201cI think it\u2019s honestly going to make more people cancel their subscriptions,\u201d Price said. \u201cWhy would I spend my money on this when I can just find the content somewhere else?\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for students, those workarounds won\u2019t be working much longer. Disney\u2019s CEO Bob Iger announced in the Q3 conference call last month that Disney+ will begin to crackdown on password sharing in the upcoming calendar year. He believes the change in policy will cause more people to buy their own subscriptions. \u201cIn calendar \u201824, we\u2019re going to get at this issue,\u201d Iger said. \" We actually think that there\u2019s an opportunity here to help us grow our business.\u201d\n\nIger might have a point when it comes to students like Nila Cousar \u2014a senior majoring in international relations and the global economy \u2014 who will not be deterred by the price increase. \u201cI use Disney+ for inspiration,\u201d Cousar said. \u201cMy willingness to pay for it is pretty high. I would pay upwards of $20.\u201d\n```"}

Let\u2019s take a look at five players who made their names known in Week 1.\n\nJordan Love, quarterback, Green Bay Packers\n\nFew players were shrouded in more mystery prior to Week 1 than Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love, who this week made only his second NFL start after essentially redshirting his first three seasons behind presumed Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Drafted in the first round out of Utah State in 2020, Love was seen as a raw prospect by NFL draft analysts and scouts alike, who lauded his physical traits but expressed concern about how his inconsistent decision-making would translate to the NFL.\n\nGiven minimal play time during his first three years in the league, what type of player Love would be in 2023 as Aaron Rodgers\u2019 successor was a complete mystery. While a one-game sample size is not a definitive mark for future performance, Love\u2019s Week 1 tape certainly showed reason for excitement.\n\nIn his first game as a starting quarterback, Love went 15-for-27 passing for 245 yards, three touchdowns, and a QBR of 73.4, which ranked sixth among all quarterbacks in week one. Love was asked to play point guard in the Packers\u2019 RPO-heavy offense, aligned in the shotgun for the majority of his snaps, taking three or five-step drops, and tasked with getting the ball out quickly.\n\nLove executed, showing the ability to get to the top of his drop, read coverages and go through multiple progressions efficiently, and rip difficult throws to his playmakers with accuracy and anticipation, particularly in the underneath and intermediate areas of the field. His first touchdown of the game stands out as a prime example, as he delivered a smooth pump fake to delay the safety on receiver Romeo Doubs, which allowed him to execute his double move and get free under a dime from Love for the Packers\u2019 first score of the day.\n\nLove\u2019s poise and decision-making looked light years ahead of expectations for a first-year starter. While he still has parts of his game he needs to iron out (particularly his adequate deep ball accuracy) his week one tape showed the marrying of the impressive physical tools that made him a first-round pick and the high-level decision-making missing in college.\n\nThe Packers look to have developed another quarterback, and with more experience and a stronger rapport with his receivers, Love could soon become one of the better passers in the league.\n\nPuka Nacua, wide receiver, Los Angeles Rams\n\nWith the Los Angeles Rams in dire need of cheap, young pieces after going all-in on veteran talent to win Super Bowl LVI, many saw the fifth-round selection of wide receiver Puka Nacua out of BYU as simply another late-round dart throw to help fill out their rebuilding roster. After all, Nacua was No. 7 of 14 Rams selections in the 2023 draft, and one of 36 rookies to attend training camp in late July.\n\nYet Nacua impressed as training camp wrapped and the Rams went through their preseason slate, with reports out of Rams camp indicating that Nacua was emerging as the favorite to secure the Rams WR2 spot. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a great job. I\u2019m a huge fan of him,\u201d Rams head coach Sean McVay told reporters in August after the Rams\u2019 preseason loss against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nIn Week 1 versus the Seattle Seahawks, not only did he win the WR2 spot but actually assumed Cooper Kupp\u2019s WR1 role as the All-Pro receiver sat out with a hamstring injury. Nacua finished the game with 10 receptions for 119 yards on 15 targets, the most ever for a rookie receiver in week one since targets became a statistic in 1992.\n\nUsed at both wideout spots in Sean McVay\u2019s system, Nacua was asked to leverage all three areas of the field, and quickly earned quarterback Matthew Stafford\u2019s trust with his smooth route running and reliable hands. More specifically, his understanding of how to gain quick separation on the underneath and intermediate areas of the field, showing good processing to hit his landmarks and settle versus zone coverage and using fakes to shake defensive backs vs man, was incredibly impressive for a late round rookie in his first professional start.\n\nIt should be noted that Nacua struggled when pressed, showing below-average strength and hand use to get past cornerbacks off the line. This indicates that he projects as more of a slot receiver or strictly as a \u201cZ\u201d (the non-isolated outside receiver who usually gets the free release) moving forward.\n\nWith that said, that is a role he could fill perfectly with his route-running prowess and good mental processing upon Kupp\u2019s return. In Nacua, the Rams definitely found their diamond in the rough.\n\nBrian Branch, defensive back, Detroit Lions\n\nDespite being a three-year starter at the University of Alabama and a 2022 First-Team All-American, Brian Branch fell out of the first round of the NFL draft in April due to concerns about his size and projected role in the league. Playing the \u201cstar\u201d position in Nick Saban\u2019s defense, a hybrid role that blends the responsibilities of a safety and slot cornerback, scouts expressed doubt that Branch, at 5 \u201811, 190 pounds, would be able to execute first-round play at either position.\n\nThe Detroit Lions selected Branch with the 45th overall pick despite having him high on their board. It was uncertain what kind of role Branch would play in Detroit\u2019s defense after the free agency signing of C.J. Gardner-Johnson, but general manager Brad Holmes expressed no concern about Branch finding a role.\n\n\u201cThe thing about it is that because we had C.J. Gardner-Johnson slated to kind of be the nickel and we knew that Branch was going to be best as a nickel\u2014he can play safety, as well. But we were just like, \u2018Look, if he finds a role, he finds a role. If he doesn\u2019t, then we know he\u2019ll be a dang good special teams player,\u2019\u201d Holmes said in August to NFL Network.\n\nBranch had an impressive week one performance versus the Kansas City Chiefs with three total tackles, one pass defended and an interception returned for a touchdown. He played as the starting nickel for the Lions, showing the ability to erase slot receivers with good foot quickness, hip fluidity, and speed to cover longer developing routes.\n\nIn zone, he showed good ability to leverage his area as a hook, curl, and flat defender, showing very good processing to quickly recognize route combinations and the positional awareness to shrink throwing windows. Branch only played 46% of first downs in Week 1, an indication that the Lions coaching staff does not see him as a plus-run defender at this point in time.\n\nWith that said, Branch still showed the potential to develop into one of the more versatile coverage players in the league.\n\nTyler Allgeier, running back, Atlanta Falcons\n\nTyler Allgeier quietly put together a stellar season in 2022 with 1035 yards on 210 carries, averaging 4.9 yards per carry\u2014No. 12 among all running backs. A fifth-round pick out of BYU in the 2022 draft, Allgeier was drafted to replace veteran running back Mike Davis as the counter punch to the dynamic Cordarelle Patterson.\n\nBut after stacking good performances on limited touches, he ended the season as the Falcons\u2019 clear RB1. However, the selection of Texas running back Bijan Robinson at eighth overall in April quickly removed Allgeier from the radar of the general populace, who expected Robinson to instantly become the workhorse back in Atlanta.\n\nYet despite all the attention garnered by Robinson throughout the offseason, it was actually Allgeier who opened the 2023 season versus the Carolina Panthers as the Falcons\u2019 lead back, rushing for 75 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nAllgeier showed everything that made him the primary back for the Falcons in 2022, showing good processing and decisiveness in his reads during zone plays, the toughness to generate yards after contact and the good burst and power to hit the hole with explosion.\n\nNFL fans and fantasy players may have expected Robinson to take over the Falcons\u2019 backfield, yet that probably won\u2019t be the case. Since Arthur Smith took over as head coach in 2021, the Falcons have always operated on a running back-by-committee system with two players sharing the spotlight.\n\nAllgeier is here to stay as a staple of the Falcons offense, and while he may be secondary to Robinson as the season progresses, he\u2019ll most likely be more of a 1B than a 2. Look for Allgeier to repeat as a four-digit rusher in 2023.\n\nDerek Stingley Jr., defensive back, Houston Texans\n\nNot often are top-five picks as minimally covered as cornerback Dereck Stingley Jr., the number-three overall selection by the Houston Texans in the 2022 draft. While he struggled with injuries the last two years of his college career, Stingley Jr. was regarded as a true blue-chip prospect by draft analysts and scouts alike due to his lockdown man coverage skills.\n\nYet during his rookie year, Stingley Jr. was primarily utilized as a flat or deep zone defender in Lovie Smith\u2019s zone-based defense, not playing to his strengths. This, combined with fellow 2022 first-round cornerback Ahmad \u201cSauce\u201d Gardner\u2019s All-Pro rookie season, caused Stingley Jr. to quickly become an afterthought to the average NFL fan.\n\nWith the new season came a new head coach in former San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator DeMeco Ryans, a former Texans captain in 2011 who led a top-three defense in the league by many metrics in 2022. Regarding Stingley Jr., Ryans told reporters in his opening press conference in February that he would \u201cput [Stingley Jr.] in a position where he can excel and show his talents,\u201d a statement he backed up in Week 1 as Stingley Jr. played the majority of his snaps as a man corner.\n\nStingley shined in his first game in Ryans\u2019 defense, targeted only twice and allowing one reception for 20 yards. In man coverage, he looked like the stellar lockdown corner he was at LSU, showing elite quickness and hip fluidity to trail receivers, completely shutting down Baltimore Ravens receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and Rashod Bateman, and winning most duels against rookie first-rounder Zay Flowers.\n\nIn zone, Stingley Jr. looked decisive, showing good processing and awareness to read route concepts and leverage his area effectively. Look for Stingley to potentially elevate his name into elite cornerback contention by the end of the year under Ryans\u2019 tutelage.\n```"}

(AP/Jeff Chiu)\n\nBy Spartacus Smith Jr. September 12, 2023 at 7:04 pm PDT\n\nDavid Hernandez, a USC freshman and American studies major, considers himself an Apple connoisseur. Even with an \u201cApple Ecosystem\u201d that he said consists of an iMac, iPad, MacBook and Apple Watch, he still conceded that the yearly product releases don\u2019t add very much. \u201cMost of the updates have been very minimal,\u201d said Hernandez, adding how what Apple added this year is not much different from previous years, a feeling shared with multiple USC students.\n\nOn Tuesday, Apple revealed its next generation of Apple devices for this year, including multiple variations of the iPhone 15 \u2014 like the titanium-finished iPhone 15 Pro Max. Other devices included a new set of AirPods with USB-C connectors, the Apple Watch Series 9, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and more.\n\nWhile Apple has recently experienced a drop in sales, USC students were still left wanting more after the announcement. \u201cI know they release one [iPhone] every year, but its changes are so small,\u201d said USC junior and business administration major Delane Ly.\n\nAn online showcase of Apple\u2019s newest products unveiled a number of facts and advertisements. They aim to be carbon neutral, recycle previous devices and lower their carbon dioxide emissions from here on out. But what many were interested in was the improvement of the iPhone 15\u2032s camera, arguably the biggest selling point along with its growth in performance. With developments to both, a new charging port is replacing the previous lightning cable charger with one that is USB-C.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing new,\u201d said Val Sancen, another junior at USC. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s no drive to [updates] like other years. There would be things that would drive it: like the changes in color [and] the different amount of cameras they had. And so now, for example, the charger port is changing, but who wants that?\u201d\n\nTo some, the charger port\u2019s change to USB-C is not a purposeful thing, just a major change from the previous year\u2019s iPhone that\u2019s a pain. \u201cNow you have to have a different charger,\u201d Sancen said. \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s an inconvenience because now you have to find people who have that charger.\u201d\n\nElijah Avery, an intern research student at USC\u2019s biomedical engineering school, said he has a lot of devices that use USB-C but has to carry multiple different chargers on him at all times. \u201cI have an older version, like the micro USB, the USB-C, and now this lightning charger, which only works with iPhone stuff,\u201d Avery said. \u201cEven my MacBook has a different charger. It\u2019s a big pain in the butt.\u201d\n\nSpending what he rounded to almost $700 dollars for his current phone, Avery believes there\u2019s a better way than making a switch to the newest iPhone, known for its newest charging port. \u201cI\u2019ll just buy a dongle for $14 rather than pay $600 for a brand-new phone,\u201d he said.\n\nOutside of the charging aspect, the design of the iPhone 15 Pro Max caught Sancen\u2019s eye. \u201cThe new titanium design for the [iPhone Pro Max] might be a cute aesthetic or trend people might try to follow. But at the same time, it\u2019s very simplistic,\u201d Sancen said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of backward.

(Photo by Sangmin Kim)\n\nBy Marcel Lacey, Kaitlyn Kizy, and Isaiah Alwin\nSeptember 12, 2023, at 5:54 pm PDT\n\nUSC students say their campus is diverse and provides them the space to voice their opinions, despite there still being room for improvements. USC ranks 109th on the free speech rankings out of 248 Universities, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit organization. FIRE said these free speech rankings were based on comfort expressing ideas, tolerance for liberal and conservative speakers, disruptive conduct, administrative support, and openness.\n\nAccording to the USC Student Handbook, the university encourages a learning environment full of free inquiry and expression. \u201cThe university is a diverse community based on free exchange of ideas and devoted to the use of reason and thought in the resolution of differences,\u201d the handbook said. \u201cHowever, when self-restraint and self-discipline fail, the university will initiate such action as necessary to prevent disruption of or substantial interference with its community and to preserve the rights of its individual members.\u201d\n\nThe student handbook said the lack of self-restraint becomes a problem when the university feels threatened. \u201cThey shall be free to support causes by all orderly means, which do not disrupt or substantially interfere with the regular and essential operations and activities of the university, since such disruption or substantial interference violates the responsible exercise of free inquiry and expression,\u2019\u201d USC said in their student handbook.\n\nDylan Gonzalez, a junior at USC studying screenwriting, said he feels USC focuses on \u201cbusiness rather than education.\u201d \u201cWhen it comes to lower-income students, or people that have pointed out marginalized communities on campus and how they feel, It\u2019s not as loud and apparent,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI think that there\u2019s a good amount of lower-income students that are actually going here, and I think that a lot of USC isn\u2019t really adapted to that.\u201d\n\nGonzalez mentioned his experience with work-study, an on-campus job platform that gives students financial aid and wage for hours worked. \u201cI\u2019m doing work-study right now, for example,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to take a full 16-18 units, and some of my previous classes don\u2019t really account for that. And so I think that, when people try to talk about those things, I don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re as apparent or you\u2019re allowed to express these views at USC. There\u2019s no platform to spread it.\u201d\n\nGonzalez also said he believes certain opinions may be less accepted than others. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s preconceived biases that I\u2019m afraid to challenge, because I don\u2019t want to be perceived poorly based on having a different opinion, or be reprimanded for it,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nUSC freshmen said they feel comfortable talking about their experiences, although they come from a different background. Freshman Ella Zarrow said she grew up in Los Angeles, and that USC was a continuation of that \u201copen space.\u201d \u201cI think USC fosters a liberal environment, and people associated with these views, which is what drew me to this school,\u201d Zarrow said. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s expressed their opinions whether they be on any end of the spectrum of politics or just personal ideology, everyone\u2019s been very receptive to that.\u201d\n\nElla Grossman, a USC freshman studying law history and culture, said the school seems to foster a specific ideology. \u201cI think the majority of people here think similarly to each other, and I think there\u2019s some danger in that, even at such a large institution,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cThe way to combat this is to foster communities where people can express opinions that may be different, without backlash.\u201d\n\nAnother USC freshman, Liam Campora, said he felt that though the dominant culture was not diverse, he is still able to express his own values. \u201cI am vegan and very against people not supporting the environment by not being vegan ... I make the space for myself but I know I receive judgment for it,\u201d Campora said. \u201cI am sure I don\u2019t suffer as much as other people, but I think the dominant culture here of what\u2019s cool is not very diverse.\u201d\n\nGabriel Perez, a sophomore who studies psychology at USC, also said he preferred creating or finding your own space within the campus environment. \u201cWhen I first imagined going to USC I didn\u2019t really think about it being as diverse as it really is,\u201d Perez said. \u201cYou can find a lot of people here who share similar opinions with yourself, and create a comfortable space for you to share your opinion.\u201d```"}

River through bird poop and algae, surrounded by steep, concrete walls. The students, armed with camera gear and note pads, were on a six-day journey to document the river\u2019s ecology for a project they dubbed \u201cfifty-one miles,\u201d named after the length of the man-made watershed. An undertaking of that scale would\u2019ve been impossible without money for gear, food, first aid and compensating contributors. That\u2019s where USC\u2019s Arts & Climate Collective came in, an organization that awards small grants to student-run projects like fifty-one miles that look to tackle environmental issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s $1,300 \u2014 but there\u2019s so much you can do with that,\u201d said Leslie Dinkin, a master\u2019s student studying heritage conservation and landscape architecture who worked on the fifty-one miles project.\n\n(Left to right) Lucy Zepeda, Au Chung, Monty Hughes and Sydnee Yu \u2014 four members of the Arts and Climate Collective \u2014 hosted an informational session on Sept. 12. (Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nApplications for this semester\u2019s grants are open through Sept. 24 and pose the question: How would you reimagine L.A. as a healthy, equitable and sustainable city? It\u2019s an intentionally open-ended question, said Colin Maclay, an Annenberg professor who co-founded the program.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems with a university is that in classes, you\u2019re always being told what to do in a kind of a narrow way,\u201d Maclay said. \u201cBut we thought, \u2018Who are we to say what you should work on? You all know better than us.\u2019\u201d\n\nMaclay said the Collective isn\u2019t necessarily looking for projects that will make an immediate impact on climate policies, or even generate the most web views or likes on social media. The group instead looks for projects that align with the program\u2019s mission, and for students who bring real passion.\n\nIn the past, students have created podcasts to highlight climate activists; documentaries to push USC to divest from fossil fuel investments; a \u201cphone booth\u201d where people could record their feelings and others could listen in; and a series of movement performance pieces meant to raise climate awareness.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t require reels or portfolios: The only thing we\u2019re looking for is passion and vision,\u201d said Au Chung, a junior studying political science, public relations and screenwriting who runs the Collective\u2019s social media pages. \u201cReally think about your project. How are you going to do it? Why are you going to do it? And when you ask yourself those questions, make sure that those things are answered on the application.\u201d\n\nA truck drives along the L.A. River as students document the basin's ecology.\n(Photo courtesy of Rio Asch Phoenix)\n\nThe goals are fairly open-ended for the fifty-one miles project, which won its grant last fall. Dinkin said the group \u2014 which plans to release a six-part documentary, a book and a detailed map of the river \u2014 at least in part hopes to capture a snapshot of the watershed\u2019s current state that can help inform efforts to expand public access to the open space.\n\n\u201cI found it fascinating how people adapt to a space that wasn\u2019t designed for them,\u201d Dinkin said. \u201cThe river was designed with exclusively flooding in mind, but people are drawn to water. People are drawn to the river that allowed L.A. to be established here.\u201d\n\nMaclay said that the Collective ultimately has a limited number of grants it can afford to dole out and will look to fund a range of projects from students who hail from a diverse set of backgrounds.\n\n\u201cMy advice is: Don\u2019t try to please us,\u201d Maclay said. \u201cWrite down whatever it is you want to do.

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Qais Adawiya September 12, 2023 at 4:22 pm PDT\n\nThere is nothing like October baseball. Fall is in the air; the trees undergo a colorful change, and the frigid temperatures start to emerge. This time of year gives baseball fans goosebumps as they guess who the next Mr. October will be. With the intensity rising, the anticipation of what is to come heightens. After 162 games and nearly six months of regular season baseball, things are about to heat up.\n\nThis has been a remarkable season, filled with shocks, upsets, and disappointments. We saw the juggernaut Yankees are seemingly going to miss postseason baseball where they have been a staple for over twenty years. The storied Cardinals are set to have their worst record since 1995. The Mets have already accepted their fate, despite their lofty preseason expectations, and have begun preparing for 2024. Even the Red Sox, who made big acquisitions in the offseason, are fighting for their playoff lives and may miss playing in October.\n\nWith all that said, one team has been a constant of October: the \u201cBoys in Blue.\u201d The Dodgers are on track to make the postseason for a franchise-record 11 straight seasons. The Dodgers have been the epitome of consistency and excellence over the past decade and they show no signs of slowing down. The Dodgers currently hold the fourth-best record in the Major Leagues and second-best in the NL, a stark contrast after baseball pundits labeled this a \u201ctransition year.\u201d\n\nThe year started when they lost All-Star Trea Turner to the Phillies, former MVP Cody Bellinger to the Cubs and the second-longest tenured Dodger, Justin Turner, to the Red Sox. Two time All-Star and ace pitcher Walker Buehler started the season on the IL after requiring a second Tommy John surgery. Although Buehler was expected to return late this year, recent reports indicate he will not pitch again in 2023. Perhaps the Dodgers biggest loss was shortstop Gavin Lux. The Dodgers lost their prized 25-year-old shortstop of the future after an injury in spring training.\n\nNot to mention they came into the season coming off a disappointing loss to their rival, the Padres in the NLDS \u2014 the same Padres that looked to be gunning for the mantle as baseball\u2019s next dynasty. Regardless, the Dodgers have continued to dominate the league, led by MVP-frontrunners Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman. It hasn\u2019t just been the stars who have gotten the job done. Veteran free agent acquisitions David Peralta, J.D. Martinez and Jason Heyward have played key roles in the Dodgers success. Rookie phenom James Outman has broken out in a huge way following the departure of Bellinger. Catcher Will Smith continues to be a consistent presence in the lineup and looks to be the starting backstop for a long time in L.A.\n\nMax Muncy\u2019s 33 home runs are second on the Dodgers while his 98 RBIs are good for sixth in the circuit. The Dodgers may not have the star power on the mound, but rookies Bobby Miller and Ryan Pepoit have been outstanding out of the \u2018pen. Likewise, 26-year-old Evan Phillips and 25-year-old Brusdar Graterol have given the Dodgers more than they could have dreamed, with ERAs of 2.18 and 1.38 respectively. Not too bad for a \u201cyoung and inexperienced\u201d pitching staff.\n\nWith Kershaw entering his 16th year wearing a Dodgers uniform, expectations remained steady for what to expect from the three-time Cy Young award winner. Coming off three straight injury riddled seasons heading into 2022, Kershaw\u2019s body was sooner or later going to give out. He defied the odds again in 2022 though, making his ninth All-Star Game in his already Hall of Fame career. In 2023 Kershaw was hurt, limited to only 117 innings, which can only be described as expected for a 35-year-old who has logged as many innings that he has. When on the hill however, his dominance has been exemplified by his 2.61 ERA, earning him his 10th All-Star nod.\n\nFollowing the collapse in the NLDS in 2022, cries to fire Dodger manager Dave Roberts erupted. With two years left on a three-year deal, Roberts, in his eighth year as the Dodger skipper, had everything to prove in \u201823. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna guarantee it this year, I\u2019m not going to do that,\u201d Roberts said to the media during Dodgers FanFest. A delightfully candid Roberts knew the team\u2019s limits coming into 2023 and halted on declaring this team World Series capable \u2014a far cry from last year when Roberts was perhaps overly confident. \u201cWe are winning the World Series in 2022. I know where you\u2019re going with that,\u201d Roberts had said in an interview with USA Today. \u201cWe will win the World Series this year. Put it on record.\u201d\n\nThis year may go down as Roberts\u2019 finest in L.A., which includes a year that saw them winning a World Series, and three straight 100-win seasons (excluding the COVID shortened season), including 111 last year. This well-oiled machine that is the L.A. Dodgers has been firing on all cylinders. After a rocky start to the season, they have never looked back. The Dodgers have staved off threats from NL West opponents San Diego, Arizona and San Francisco to still hold the crown in the NL West.\n\nAs postseason baseball is just around the corner, the Dodgers postseason woes once again will be heard by critics. Their only World Series in the 21st century came in a shortened 2020 season which succeeded numerous postseason falters. Regardless, it\u2019s a new Fall, and that means the Dodgers need to have a short memory if they have a chance. With the conclusion of the regular season less than one month away, it\u2019s time to shift focus to October, and with that the chase for baseball\u2019s most coveted prize. Echoes of Vin Scully rain in my ears, \u201cIt\u2019s time for Dodger baseball\u201d as L.A. chases number eight.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Ksenia Chernaya)\n\nBy Paige Shea September 12, 2023 at 12:59 pm PDT\n\nIf you\u2019re ever scrolling through TikTok or Pinterest for style inspiration, you\u2019ve definitely seen Internet sensation Matilda Djerf. Djerf, a 26-year-old Swedish influencer, boasts over 3.1 million followers on her Instagram account and 1.5 million followers on her TikTok account. With picture-perfect blonde hair and a laid-back, Scandinavian \u201cdream girl\u201d aesthetic, Djerf has taken the digital fashion sphere by storm. Her fast-growing clothing brand, Djerf Avenue, has contributed largely to her popularity. The brand sells clothes perfectly tailored to Djerf\u2019s signature style preferences: deliberately baggy, classic-with-a-twist, masculine yet feminine silhouettes.\n\nShe recently graced the cover of Vogue Scandinavia after hosting Djerf Avenue\u2019s first NYC pop-up shop and NYFW event at the Guggenheim Museum. However, while Djerf\u2019s style, aura, and community champion inclusivity \u2014 the price tags of her clothes do not. Djerf Avenue\u2019s basic t-shirts, tanks and shorts alone start at $50. For us college students, spending that much on one piece of clothing can feel unreasonable.\n\nThere are a plethora of affordable options available to achieve the same look and feel of Djerf\u2019s signature style. The key to emulating Djerf is investing in a capsule wardrobe with classic, neutral pieces. This allows for the curation of many different outfits fashioned around a few staple pieces that won\u2019t break the bank.\n\nSo, here are the 10 pieces you need in your wardrobe to dress like Matilda Djerf, on a budget.\n\n1. Oversized Button Down\n\nAs a staple of Djerf Avenue and Djerf\u2019s own style, button downs allow for a comfortable yet elevated look. While button downs on the Djerf Avenue website start at $100+, companies such as H&M and Zara sell comparable products starting at $25. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, go to your local thrift store and browse the men\u2019s section!\n\n2. Baggy Trousers & Jeans\n\nGone are the days of skinny jeans. Low-rise and baggy mom jeans are on trend right now, and can be found for affordable prices at stores such as Pull&Bear, H&M, and Pacsun. These are another staple that can be found at a thrift store for an even lower price. Personally, I\u2019ve completely hopped on the low-rise, baggy bandwagon \u2014 in my opinion, they just look effortless and instantaneously cool.\n\n3. Oversized Jacket\n\nA leather bomber, a racing jacket \u2014 the choices are endless. The oversized jacket is a key component to the laid-backness of Djerf\u2019s looks. It\u2019s a piece that can completely upgrade a basic outfit by cutting up the silhouette. Locally, I\u2019ve found my racing jackets at markets like Silverlake Flea Market or Melrose Trading Post.\n\n4. Mules or Ballet Flats\n\nDjerf is often photographed wearing a pair of mules or ballet flats, pairing them with pants, skirts, and dresses alike. While hers are largely vintage Chanel, Manolo Blahnik, mules or ballet flats under $100 can be found at long-trusted brands such as Steve Madden and Sam Edelman. (Mules and ballet flats are also a great alternative if you\u2019re like me \u2014 ungifted at walking in heels.)\n\n5. Shoulder Bag\n\nThis can be any size, depending on how kindly you treat your shoulders. I personally love a good baguette purse, but tote-sized shoulder bags also fit seamlessly in capsule wardrobes. Instead of blowing your savings on a Bottega, opt for one of Anthropologie\u2019s Brigitte bags or one of their other shoulder bag options for under $100. A plethora of affordable shoulder bags can be found online, and you can probably raid your mom or older sister\u2019s closets for some timeless leather gems.\n\n6. Oversized Blazer\n\nAn oversized blazer is one of Djerf\u2019s staple pieces, a piece that she has inspired many of her own admirers (including myself) to wear. Affordable options can be found for under $50 on websites like ASOS and H&M, and this is another piece that would be a perfect find at a thrift store. Oversized blazers also act as jackets with a more casual outfit, but can swing business casual if you\u2019re on the way to an interview or networking event.\n\n7. Long Silk or Slip Dress\n\nA long silk or slip dress, a Djerf and current Internet favorite. They pair perfectly with jackets, cardigans, or just by themselves, and are the perfect staple to dress up or down depending on the occasion. I love wearing slip dresses with sneakers for a casual day look, or putting on a pair of mules or sandals to transition to a more formal outfit. It\u2019s likely to luck up on a vintage silk dress for a steal on Depop.\n\n8. Tube Top\n\nTube tops are another Djerf and capsule wardrobe essential, and you might already have some in your closet. Djerf constantly pairs tube tops with trousers, jeans, and skirts. While hers are priced at $98, you can find tube tops for under $10 at many online sites, or even get crafty by cutting up an older tee to upcycle it.\n\n9. Basic T-shirt or Tank\n\nBasic t-shirts and tanks are one of the main keys to a capsule wardrobe \u2013 they can be dressed up or down, and they\u2019re easy and comfortable to wear. Djerf Avenue boasts a variety of them on their website, but for cheaper options, my personal favorite has always been Brandy Melville\u2019s basic tees and tanks. Cotton On also has great options with more size inclusivity. Basic shirts also allow for better accessories \u2014 the best friends of fun shoes, printed pants, or statement jewelry. Arguably, they are probably the most versatile pieces in a capsule wardrobe.\n\n10. Oversized Cardigan or Sweater\n\nOversized cardigans or sweaters are perfect for a capsule wardrobe \u2013 they can be worn over tanks or tees, or just on their own. Living in Southern California calls for these transitional pieces that are wearable in all seasons. Djerf is an avid wearer of cardigans \u2013 which are sold on her website \u2013 but they can be found on many different sites for under $40-$50. If you don\u2019t like the bulkiness of oversized jackets or blazers, cardigans and sweaters are the perfect option for chillier climates.\n```"}

Not only did the two-day event feature model train display set-ups by Southern California Traction Club, Group 160 NTRACK Club and others, but older service trains like Santa Fe 3751, ATSF 5704, BNSF Freight Locomotives were also available for attendees to get a closer look from the inside. Over the course of the weekend, more than 16,000 train enthusiasts, history aficionados, industry professionals and commuters of all ages visited Union Station, according to event organizers. Bustling with eager railfans, the festival also organized live performances by Jason Sulkin Music and Thee Illusions. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Conan Cheung, the L.A. Metro chief operations officer, said they are witnessing an increase in commuter traffic even on weekends. The new influx of commuters has resulted in more programming. Cheung also noted that with initiatives like GoPass and Metro\u2019s extended routes on the D and B lines, student commuters have increased. A railfan himself, Metrolink CEO Darren Kettle said the student population makes up a large chunk of their commuters. Kettle said the agency will launch a student day-pass program, tentatively in October this year, allowing students to commute longer distances with no-hassle. \u201cTrains matter because they connect us to one another,\u201d said Jeanne Cantu, Amtrak Vice President. LaDonna DiCamillo, California High-Speed Rail Regional Director who also attended the ceremony said the routes between Southern California, San Francisco and Northern California will be ready for trial runs by 2028 connecting commuters between counties at a faster pace.\n```"}

But, for some teens across the country, videos of people consuming this extremely hot chip have a potential to go viral that can\u2019t be ignored.\n\n14-year-old Harris Wolobah (Photo is from family's Go Fund Me page)\nOne Boston teen, 14-year-old Harris Wolobah, fell victim to the trend. Just two days after completing the One Chip Challenge, Wolobah passed away from an acute cerebellar stroke. While Paqui\u2019s chip has yet to be directly linked to his death, it was one of the last things Wolobah ate before falling ill, passing out, and eventually dying in the hospital. His tragic death has prompted major backlash to the dangerous challenge. Paqui has since removed the product from store shelves.\n\nPaqui\u2019s One Chip is marketed as the \u201chottest chip in the world,\u201d spiced with a combination of California Reaper Peppers and Naga Viper Peppers. These peppers have Scoville Units of 1.7 million and 1.4 million respectively, making them two of the hottest peppers available. While the packaging contains health warnings advising those sensitive to spice or allergic to peppers against the challenge, the chip is notorious for causing serious pain and discomfort to anyone who dares to try it. The label instructs consumers to wait as long as possible before drinking or eating anything after consuming the chip.\n\nHot snacks, like Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos, are marketed directly to Black and Hispanic consumers. In the past few years, Frito-Lay has tapped rappers Megan Thee Stallion, and MiMs to star in Flamin\u2019 Hot campaigns. Latin music superstar Bad Bunny also starred in his own campaign. One commercial features Chester \u2013 the brand\u2019s beloved tiger mascot \u2013 dropping a \u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot diss track.\u201d The brand, the most recognizable name in chips, has co-opted Black and Hispanic culture in order to sell their products.\n\nPicture of Paqui's packaging and chip that are found in many stores around the country. (Photo source Amazon.com)\nPaqui, a subsidiary of The Hershey Company and a direct competitor of Frito-Lay, sells more than just the One Chip Challenge. Their website lists four other flavored tortilla chips that can be found in stores across the country. While Frito-Lay has gone the celebrity endorsement route, Paqui takes another approach to their marketing strategy. The One Chip Challenge is a novelty product containing one single chip that retails for about $10. Once you open the coffin packaging, the rules of the challenge state that consumers should \u201cpost your reaction on social media with #OneChipChallenge and mention @paquichips.\u201d Including the hashtag and social media handle turns the product into a social media campaign, encouraging consumers to create content for the brand.\n\nWith major Youtubers like FaZe Rug and Zach Choi racking up tens of millions of views on their own #OneChipChallenge videos, this viral marketing strategy has worked. But, at what cost? Despite the warning labels stating that the One Chip Challenge is \u201cintended for adult consumption,\u201d there are no restrictions on who can purchase the chip.\n\nNate Buescher, a 16-year-old high school student from Chicago, spoke about his personal experience with the challenge. \u201cI literally walked not even one minute from school and bought it at 7/11,\u201d said Buescher. He described the experience as \u201clike bees stinging your tongue, lips numbs, stomach on fire... going to the bathroom is the worst.\u201d \u201cWe challenge each other at school with it...It was honestly terrible but it was also really funny,\u201d said Buescher.\n\nThe viral trend may be humorous for some, but has landed others in the hospital. For Wolobah, it was fatal. From the thousands of videos labeled with #OneChipChallenge on Instagram, it seems like the product was designed to create viral moments of peoples\u2019 pain and discomfort. Upon scrolling, there are videos of people crying, throwing up, and writhing in pain after eating the chip. Onlookers laugh hysterically. It\u2019s a precarious mix of joy and pain. To a teenager looking for a \u201cviral\u201d moment, it could seem tempting.\n\nBy issuing warnings to teens but also promoting the product through viral campaigns and allowing minors to purchase it without parental consent, it raises questions about Paqui\u2019s true intentions regarding teen consumption. In a statement posted to their website, Paqui states, \u201cWe have seen an increase in teens and other individuals not heeding these warnings. As a result, while the products continue to adhere to food safety standards, out of an abundance of caution, we are actively working to remove the product from shelves.\u201d Paqui was contacted for this story but has not responded.\n```"}

Club 90s\u2019 and livies hq co-hosted their Olivia Rodrigo night at the 1720 Warehouse.\n\nBy Katie Simons and Julie Piccolo\nSeptember 11, 2023 at 9:36 pm PDT\n\nWhile the streets surrounding the 1720 Warehouse were eerily silent on Saturday at 10 p.m., outside of a garage door stood a line of young, purple-clad Olivia Rodrigo fans singing songs off of her new album, \u201cGUTS.\u201d Club 90s held an official album release dance party to celebrate Rodrigo\u2019s sophomore hit, alongside Rodrigo\u2019s official fan club, livies hq. Inside of the venue, the excitement was palpable. As a song by Conan Gray, Rodrigo\u2019s best friend, came on over the speakers, there was a collective scream from the audience. Friends clung to each other and sang passionately to hits by Gray, Harry Styles, Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus, among others. Fans were able to scream along all night long with Rodrigo\u2019s more rock-oriented new album.\n\nThe event, which was co-hosted by Rodrigo\u2019s record label, Geffen Records, drew Rodrigo\u2019s most empathic fans. Although the majority of songs played weren\u2019t actually Rodrigo\u2019s, the crowd gave the night their all. Fans went wild for Rodrigo\u2019s debut written single \u201cAll I Want\u201d from her Disney+ series \u201cHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series,\u201d which launched Rodrigo\u2019s songwriting career. It was clear that many audience members were long-time listeners. They were, however, equally eager to hear new songs from \u201cGUTS.\u201d Even during slow songs, fans scream along to Rodrigo\u2019s heartbreak ballads.\n\nWith 2000s throwbacks from shows like \u201cVictorious\u201d and movies like \u201cLemonade Mouth\u201d there are plenty of opportunities for fans to dance. Many of Rodrigo\u2019s hit songs are slower heartbreak ballads, but fans weren\u2019t discouraged by the quiet nature of her songs. During \u201cthe grudge,\u201d two friends in the front row fell to the ground in anticipation of singing the song surrounded by fellow fans. These songs seemed to be cathartic for the audience, especially in this atmosphere which is traditionally meant for dancing and louder music. Many couples took these songs as an opportunity to slow dance in the club. Although the album has its share of rock-pop songs, these heartbreak anthems were crowd pleasers. That\u2019s not to say every slow song was a hit. The last track of Rodrigo\u2019s new album, \u201dteenage dream,\u201d was met with less enthusiasm. Perhaps this reflected in the nature of the event, given the song is about the growing pains of being a teenager, but Club 90s required all attendees to be over 18.\n\nRodrigo\u2019s ballads let fans sing all of their emotions out. Jeffery The DJ commands the audience through his dance moves, even falling down into a death drop at one point. Despite the song that was playing, all audience members seemed to find joy in the event\u2019s DJ, Jeffery Lyman (Jeffery The DJ), who was decked out in \u201cGUTS\u201d merch and a purple boa. During every song, he was full of infectious energy which rubbed off on the fans. When he got especially into it, Lyman would dance around the stage, jumping up and down, spinning and even doing the worm. Despite alleged tension between Rodrigo and fellow pop artists Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter and Paramore, Jeffery played hits from all three artists and was met by astounding cheers from the crowd. \u201cCruel Summer,\u201d which is the center of much of the alleged drama between Rodrigo and Swift, turned out to be a crowd favorite. It seems that most of Rodrigo\u2019s listeners share an appreciation for this genre of recent pop music, and they seemed to know the lyrics to all of the songs played. Fans recorded plenty of videos of themselves belting alongside Rodrigo\u2019s music.\n\nAt any given time, phones were pulled out as fans sang into their cameras. This reflected the social media oriented generation that Rodrigo appeals most to, as she originally went viral on TikTok first with her song \u201cAll I Want,\u201d then again with her song \u201cdriver\u2019s license.\u201d The fans fully committed to Rodrigo\u2019s look. They arrived dressed in her signature color purple, and many sported the merch for \u201cGUTS\u201d only a day after its release. Even the club lights were set to varying shades of purple, pink and blue in celebration of the artist.\n\nIf this is any indication of fans\u2019 excitement and enthusiasm for Rodrigo and her music, it bodes well for a potential upcoming tour. In the meantime, it is clear that Rodrigo\u2019s fans are ready to celebrate both her new and old music. The celebration of Rodrigo\u2019s work let fans express their emotions\u2014both good and bad.\n```"}

The Middleweight championship at UFC 293 boasted an astounding -650 odds for the now-former champion.\n\n\u201cWe are watching the biggest upset in UFC championship history unfold in real time,\u201d tweeted TSN Martial Arts analyst Aaron Bronsteter during the fifth round of the matchup. Commentators and fans alike were quick to point out the personal significance of Strickland\u2019s win, citing the thirty-two-year-old\u2019s troubled past and his relationship with his abusive father growing up in Anaheim, California as part of an unlikely underdog story.\n\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t in the UFC, I\u2019d probably be cooking meth in a trailer,\u201d said Strickland during a post-fight interview at UFC Vegas 33 in June 2021. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the fans, to the UFC, you guys that gave me purpose. And I appreciate that.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the matchup even came to fruition was somewhat unlikely, as Strickland only received the championship opportunity after South African fighter Dricus Du Plessis pulled out due to a foot injury. The Californian fighter made his presence known in the octagon, however, with judges scoring 46-49 unanimously in Strickland\u2019s favor and Strickland largely controlling the pace of the fight.\n\nStrickland made his mark on Adesanya early, with a clean right hand that dropped Adesanya late in round one. Despite Adesanya seemingly returning in the second round fully recovered, Strickland maintained his momentum by keeping Adesanya on the outside perimeter of the octagon and pairing a strong Philly-style defense with powerful striking ability.\n\nStriking was a major factor in the fight, as Adesanya is widely agreed to be one of the most effective strikers in combat sports. But Saturday night, he found himself bested by another striker. \u201cYou guys, Sean Strickland is outstriking Israel Adesanya,\u201d tweeted The Athletic\u2019s Shaheen Al-Shatti during the final round.\n\nThe defense from Strickland was also a major highlight of the fight. Laura Sanko, in her UFC pay-per-view commentary debut, conversed heavily with former UFC champions Robert Whittaker (middleweight) and Daniel Cormier (heavyweight) about the unique nature of Strickland\u2019s defensive style. His ability to stand with Adesanya toe-to-toe and not allow the unpredictability of Adesayna\u2019s feint-heavy style faze him ultimately destroyed the Stylebender\u2019s confidence.\n\n\u201c[Sean Strickland] bamboozled the most creative, incredible striker we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said analyst Brian Campbell, speaking to CBS Sports. \u201cIt was all Sean Strickland, all the time.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t far off the mark, as judges scored Strickland winning all rounds except the second. Yet, despite his start-to-finish dominance, Strickland only allowed his confidence to truly shine through at the end of the final round, where he dropped his guard and talked aggressively to Adesanya.\n\nThis was quickly followed up, however, with the two men embracing and exchanging kind words after the decision was announced. Strickland called Adesanya a legend, while Adesanya showed off his sportsmanship by lifting Strickland\u2019s hand in victory and beckoning the crowd to cheer on the new UFC middleweight champion.\n\nThis show of good graces between the two fighters is a new phenomenon, as the press conferences leading up to the fight were littered with colorful insults from both men, with Strickland making fun of Adesanya\u2019s dog and the Nigerian fighter responding that he would \u201cgo John Wick\u201d on Strickland.\n\nStrickland expressed how incredulous he was at his finally winning the belt. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he said as the belt was placed around his waist. \u201cAm I f***ing dreaming?\u201d\n\nThe new champion\u2019s incredulity continued after he left the octagon, admitting in a post-fight interview with ESPN\u2019s Megan Olivi that he thought finally taking down the Stylebender \u201cwould be a lot harder.\u201d\n\nMany questioned Strickland\u2019s ability to compete with the striking prodigy Adesanya prior to the fight, but never Strickland himself. In the post-fight press conference, he dispelled all questions about his confidence before the fight with quick quips about his hard work, dedication and nerve.\n\nTo Strickland, being a good fighter is not rocket science, it comes down to being willing to put in the work. \u201cI\u2019m ready to die [for] this,\u201d Strickland said post-fight. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Steven Martin)\n\nBy Aidan Williams, Nicki Berelson and Maria Robles\nSeptember 11, 2023 at 6:33 pm PDT\n\nOn Friday, the Board of Directors for the State University System of Florida voted to accept the Classic Learning Test (CLT) as an alternative option to the SAT and ACT when applying to their universities. With Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida in the running for the Republican candidacy for president of the United States, these efforts seem to be in line with his attempt to overhaul the \u201cwoke indoctrination\u201d of education. This official test adoption marks the third time that DeSantis dismissed educational components of the College Board. Previously, DeSantis has banned the curriculum of AP African American studies, tangled with AP Psychology\u2019s inclusion of LGBTQ+ content.\n\nThe CLT is a 2 hour exam and, although this exam is shorter in length compared to the SAT, both exams measure similar skills according to the testing website. The test includes reading comprehension, grammar, algebra and mathematical problem solving. The main difference between both exams has to do with the reading comprehension section. While the SAT focuses more on contemporary fiction, the CLT focuses more on classical liberal arts curriculum, according to FOX 35 News in Orlando.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re measuring your ability to read the most important texts that have driven the development of history and culture for thousands of years,\u201d said Jeremy Tate, the founder of the CLT, to NPR.\n\nThe SAT has fallen out of favor throughout many colleges over the recent years due to supposed inherent bias that favors affluent students over economically disadvantaged students, according to an analysis published by the New York Times.\n\nThe College Board responded to the test and Florida\u2019s acceptance of it in a statement to Annenberg Media, writing, \u201cThe concordance published unilaterally by the Classical Learning Test (CLT) offers inaccurate claims about comparability between the SAT and CLT. College Board was not involved in or even made aware of the study.\u201d\n\nDirector of marketing at CLT Taryn Boyes says that the test does rival the widely accepted SAT and ACT. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more comprehensive reflection of a student\u2019s abilities because it\u2019s not just testing what a student has learned in the past, but what a student\u2019s potential is to learn new information in the future,\u201d she said.\n\nJerry Lucido, professor of clinical practice at the Rossier School of Education, agrees that classical texts can be enriching but says they would not provide a better understanding of our contemporary world. \u201cThe classics have a lot of value. There\u2019s no question about that. But the classics represent a largely traditional canon that doesn\u2019t represent the broad spectrum of our society or of the world,\u201d Lucido said.\n\nSome, like Lucido, see CLT as an opaque bid to sway the higher education curriculum towards more conservative politics. \u201cI think this is part of a political movement in Florida and some other states to control how colleges operate,\u201d Lucido said.\n\nDespite CLT being deemed a Christian-backed alternative to the SAT/ACT, according to an article by NPR, creators of the test argue the opposite. \u201cWe are not a Christian exam [...] we\u2019re not religiously or politically affiliated and we hope that students in Florida and all over the nation will see CLT as another option to expand their educational choices,\u201d Boyes said.\n\nStill, many people are concerned about the alleged religious undertones of the exam. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s really weird to expect people to pass a test about one specific religion to go to a school that they\u2019re paying a ton of money for anyways,\u201d said Laney Riley, a sophomore studying neuroscience and psychology at USC.\n\nWhile the system seems to be raising alarms, some students agree with it. \u201cI think it sounds cool to me. I think reading old European texts such as C.S. Lewis can be pretty edifying,\u201d Brandon Willingham, a USC alum, said. \u201cI would say I\u2019m all for it.\u201d\n```"}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported in 2020 that suicide was the third leading cause of death for individuals between 15 to 24 years old in the United States. The CDC found that there were approximately 49,449 total suicide deaths in 2022, marking a 2.6% increase since 2021.\n\nStudents currently enrolled at USC have access to mental health services through USC Student Health, provided by faculty in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine. However, some USC students find them confusing and hard to utilize.\n\nTaylor Ryan, a junior at USC studying NGOs and social change and a vocal advocate for suicide prevention, found the counseling services at USC Student Health \u201cdecently effective.\u201d After losing her mother to suicide in 2017 when she was a freshman in high school, Ryan turned to USC Student Health to be referred to a therapist.\n\n\u201cThey were kind of hard to navigate because I was under the impression that I would be directed to a therapist permanently at school, but it routes you out to another service, which is better for me in the long run. When you get connected, you don\u2019t stay connected within USC, they kind of like outsource you,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nRyan, who fundraises for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in honor of her mother, emphasized the benefit of providing remote options for these counseling services.\n\n\u201cI think the way that USC and other places go about it remotely now provides a bigger opportunity for people to get the resources they need if they know how to access those and even find them,\u201d she said.\n\nTaylor Ryan fundraises for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in many ways including by selling these stickers. (Photo courtesy of Taylor Ryan)\n\nSome USC students, however, are unaware of how to access or find USC\u2019s mental health resources. Tiffany Lo, a senior studying communication at USC, named her external health insurance as a reason for her limited knowledge.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t use the USC Student Health plan, I use my family plan, so I waived the USC one. So I\u2019m not really sure how that would come to play, like what I am allowed to use and what I\u2019m not allowed to use when it comes to counseling and if it\u2019s free or not,\u201d Lo said.\n\nLo isn\u2019t the only one unsure of the logistics behind USC Student Health services. Juny Romero, a freshman studying pharmacology and drug development, suggested that these services be more widely promoted.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a good thing if you have to go out of your way to find help. I\u2019m not saying it should be everywhere, like on all the walls,\u201d Romero said. \u201cBut if there\u2019s more just, I don\u2019t know, advertisement, it would be a lot more helpful than having to sit through a website and then find the number to call.\u201d\n\nDr. Kelly Greco, the embedded counselor for USC Annenberg, shed some light on the services that USC Student Health offers and how students can access them.\n\n\u201cThe majority of students pay for the Student Health Center fee, and so everyone is able to access the services at Student Health.\u201d Greco said.\u201dSo it\u2019s a great starting point to see what you need and what would be the best fit of service. No one is turned away.\u201d\n\nThe Student Health Fee is automatically included each semester on the student account invoice and cannot be waived. Students enrolled only in online classes are excluded from the fee but can opt in if they are a current California resident.\n\n\u201cWorkshops, Let\u2019s Talk, crisis services, if you have an urgent matter, need a walk-in, if you need to schedule an intake \u2014 all of that is part of the Student Health Center fee. So you have access to those services,\u201d Greco said.\n\nStudents can sign up for Let\u2019s Talk \u2014 a service in which students can have a 30-minute conversation with a clinician from Counseling and Mental Health \u2014 in person or virtually through usc.edu/myshr. More information can be found at USC Counseling & Mental Health Services.\n\n\u201cIf you have a crisis urgent matter, you can always call the (213) 740-WELL number. But we also have a text crisis line where you text TROJAN to 741741,\u201d Greco added. \u201cAgain, the more resources you have, the better to be very accessible to a large community like USC. So that\u2019s something that I would really encourage students to access or tell a friend about as well.\u201d\n\nIf you are experiencing thoughts of suicide, text or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988.\n```"}

(Photo by Michael Chow)\n\nBy Jack Smith, Makayla Idelburg and Roman Marchetti\nSeptember 11, 2023 at 5:59 pm PDT\n\nWhen USC and Stanford met on the field of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Saturday, the Trojans dominated the Cardinal, winning their first conference bout of the year 56-10. While the game was decided early, another competition that matters just as much to the USC Athletic Department and Coliseum staff still hung in the balance. USC attempted to hold its first zero-waste \u201cGreen Game\u201d of the 2023 season as part of the PAC-12 Conference\u2019s \u201cZero Waste Challenge.\u201d\n\nWith a color-coded garbage bag system, compostable cups, and fan-engaging scoreboard videos, the Coliseum put forward its plan to best promote sustainability during the Stanford game. Since 2016, schools in the PAC-12 have competed with each other, attempting to host a zero waste home game during the football and basketball seasons. For the past four years, all 12 member schools of the conference have participated in the competition.\n\nAccording to the PAC-12\u2019s Team Green website, the competition \u201cencourages campuses to move towards zero waste and be creative in developing best practices, whether it be directly through reuse, recycling, and composting or by working with partners to drive impactful changes.\u201d\n\nNycoi Jones, a member of USC\u2019s Environmental Student Assembly (ESA), partnered with the Coliseum staff and the USC Sustainability Group for this year\u2019s zero-waste game through a class in USC\u2019s Environmental Studies Program called Zero Waste Operations.\n\n\u201cThese games and sports, they generate a lot of waste and a lot of it goes to trash,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSo what zero waste games are supposed to be doing is basically allowing at least 90% of the total game trash towards the end of the cumulative year to get diverted from a landfill.\u201d\n\nWith that end goal in mind, USC and the Coliseum needed to create stadium measures to control the flow of trash. One idea they devised was a color-coded trash bag system. Jones also explained that the colored trash bags are only the start.\n\n\u201cThey have a special trash sorting system where they sort through every single bag that\u2019s produced during the game to make sure everything goes to the right facility,\u201d Jones said.\n\nThe L.A. Memorial Coliseum celebrates its centennial in 2023 as it also prepares to host a third Summer Olympics in 2028.(Photo courtesy of Marina Fote)\n\nRaegan Lusk, a junior studying international relations at USC, said that the university\u2019s effort was apparent during the game.\n\n\u201cAt tailgates, there were more recycling and trash bins than before and there was also a truck driving around picking up trash,\u201d Lusk said. \u201cAt the game, I saw signs talking about the \u2018Green Game\u2019 and other stuff like that.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how she feels about USC\u2019s sustainability efforts, Lusk said she is optimistic.\n\n\u201cI am really glad that USC is stepping up and trying to make campus in general more sustainable,\u201d Lusk said. \u201cI see a lot of trash on game days so I am happy about [the \u2018Green Game\u2019].\u201d\n\nThe Torch is lit on the first of every month this year to celebrate the Coliseum's Centennial. (Photo courtesy of LA Memorial Coliseum)\n\nThe strategies weren\u2019t as noticeable for everyone. Ryan Saywitz, a senior at USC\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts, attended the game and noticed nothing out of the ordinary from previous football games he\u2019d been to.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t at the game for that long, but I didn\u2019t really notice anything different,\u201d Saywitz said.\n\nUSC\u2019s main goal is to limit the negative impact of athletic events on the environment but, just like its teams on the field and court, the university is also participating to compete and win. The rules of the zero waste program, which are laid out on the conference\u2019s website, are strict but straightforward. Every campus gets to pick just one home football and basketball game each year to mount its attempt. After the day has ended, the event is scored by a conference official using a carefully designed scorecard that includes categories such as the effective use of partnerships, fan engagement, and overall waste diversion.\n\nAt the end of the university year, a panel of judges deliberate over the scorecards and decide on a winner for both sports. The panel also hands out \u201cSpecial Innovation Awards\u201d to the most improved campus and to the schools with the best fan engagement and engagement from players and athletic department staff.\n\nSince the start of the 2016/17 school year, USC has won the Zero Waste Challenge three times in football and one time in basketball. Two years ago, the university became the conference\u2019s first to win both sports\u2019 top placement in the same year. No school has achieved a perfect zero waste football game since the program\u2019s inception, but USC came the closest in 2016 with a reported 94% waste diversion rate. UC Berkeley holds the conference record for basketball, registering a 95.7% diversion rate in 2018.\n\nAs USC waits for the PAC-12 to publish the results of this year\u2019s competition, there is still more the school can do to improve its sustainability efforts.\n\n\u201cThere is still about 10% [of undiverted waste], which is a lot of trash that still gets sent just to a landfill,\u201d Jones said. \u201cTo an extent, I still think the system is commendable because it is the first of its kind... But I think USC can do a lot more and I think that if there\u2019s more of a push from a student perspective, maybe they may actually go forth and implement some bigger changes.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about ways that students can help influence school sustainability, Jones emphasized the importance of reducing and reusing waste and recommended that students should read USC emails on sustainability and attend ESA and campus sustainability events.\n\nUSC and the Coliseum staff won\u2019t know whether their efforts on Saturday earned them another conference award until the spring. Last year\u2019s winner and Special Innovation Award recipients were announced in early May.\n```"}

For this month and beyond, USC\u2019s Latinx student organizations, such as La CASA, are creating more opportunities for celebration and appreciation, offering programs and services that highlight intersectionality and educate students about Latinx issues.\n\nWhile the calendar for the month is still in the works, La CASA ambassadors gave us some insights on what to expect. \u201cGetting to see our culture and celebrate it is really important because it lets you know that we\u2019re welcome here at USC, just like everybody else,\u201d said Micaela Zamora, a La CASA cultural ambassador.\n\nUSC will commence Latinx Heritage Month with a kickoff on Friday, where attendees can participate online or in person at Tommy\u2019s Place at noon to grab a quick bite and engage in discussions with other community members. September 15-18 marks the anniversaries of independence for Latin American countries from Spanish rule, according to National Hispanic Heritage Month\u2019s official website. Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua celebrate on September 15, while Mexico and Chile celebrate on September 16 and September 18, respectively.\n\nIn addition to this, October 12 marks D\u00eda de la Raza, which is celebrated in place of Columbus Day. This holiday recognizes \u201cthe mixed indigenous and European heritage of Mexico\u201d instead of \u201cpaying homage to the controversial explorer and conqueror Christopher Columbus,\u201d according to Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nIn Los Angeles, members of the Latinx community make up most of the population. \u201cI think [Latinx Heritage Month] is really great to celebrate the biggest minority in the area and just around the U.S. We\u2019re also in a predominantly Latino area and that just doesn\u2019t get acknowledged,\u201d said USC student and La CASA cultural ambassador Adrian Guevara. Participating in Latinx Heritage Month \u201cjust brings awareness to that.\u201d\n\nOn September 22, Artists at Play, an Asian American theater group, and Latino Theater Company will present the premiere of \u201cThis Is Not a True Story.\u201d Founded in 1985, the Latino Theater Company utilizes artistic expression to honor tradition and culture. The organization harnesses theater to commentate on contemporary social issues and \u201cawaken the collective consciousness\u201d to act in forging a better future.\n\nAnother event, Machismo, held on September 27 will spark dialogue on the expectation for men in the Latinx community to suppress their emotions. \u201cI guess the equivalent word in English would be like toxic masculinity,\u201d said Zamora, a sophomore studying biopharmaceutical sciences. Machismo refers to strong masculine pride, which can consequently stigmatize emotional vulnerability. Zamora reflected on her personal upbringing, mentioning that she is \u201csurrounded by men in my family that have a hard time like opening up and showing emotional intelligence. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to, you know, explain that and go further into that,\u201d she said.\n\nThese discussions can be a starting point to see \u201cgrowth of our community\u201d and foster a more open environment. Guevara, a senior studying political science, expressed his excitement for the new La CASA center opening in the Student Union, which will hopefully be open for the general public by the next Latinx Heritage Month.\n\nThe Latinx community encompasses a rich variety of cultures and backgrounds, each a unique and integral part of the vibrant community. \u201cI definitely would love to see events that are not just Mexican centric, because I think that happens a lot,\u201d reflected Zamora. \u201cI\u2019m Mexican, so I guess this is coming from somebody that would love to visit other cultures.\u201d\n\nThis steps in tandem with this month\u2019s theme of \u201cUnidad, ProSperidad y Cultura\u201d \u2014 unity, prosperity, and culture \u2014 which sets the foundation for the Latinx community to \u201clearn about all of our differences but at the same time realizing that we have many similarities and that we\u2019re just united by the fact that we\u2019re all from the same community,\u201d according to Guevara. \u201cWe all deserved to be unified here,\u201d said Zamora. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be looked at as like somebody else is better than the other, like a culture deserves to be celebrated more than the other.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s celebration of Latinx Heritage Month will come to a close on Wednesday, October 11 with a celebration including special guests, music and food. The official USC events calendar for Latinx/e Heritage Month will be finalized ahead of the kickoff event on Friday. For more information, check out: https://calendar.usc.edu/LHM\n```"}

Jean Carroll. The guilty verdict stems from Trump accusing Carroll of lying about accusations that he raped her in the mid-1990s. Under Wednesday\u2019s ruling, the jury in the trial will only be required to decide the amount of punitive damages Trump owes to Carroll, instead of deciding if he is guilty.\n\nThis ruling comes four months after former President Trump was first found guilty of defaming the author. After Trump further denied allegations during a CNN Town Hall meeting, Carroll amended her original suit to include the statements said at the town hall. In these remarks, Trump again denied Carroll\u2019s accusations, and said \u201cthis woman, I don\u2019t know her. I never met her. I have no idea who she is.\u201d\n\nKaplan wrote on Wednesday that due to the \u201cestablish[ment] that Mr. Trump\u2019s 2019 statements were made with actual malice\u201d following the May 9 verdict, Trump\u2019s successive remarks were already found to be defamation, which eliminated the need to relitigate the alleged attack.\n\nFormer President Trump is currently appealing the May 9 jury verdict. The trial to decide the amount of damages Trump owes to Carroll under this ruling is set for Jan. 15, 2024.\n```"}

The Mariners currently sit in the third American League Wild Card spot\u2014half a game up on their fellow A.L. West foes the Texas Rangers.\n\nThe big news coming from Angels manager Phil Nevin is that Monday\u2019s series opener could be the return of A.L. MVP frontrunner Shohei Ohtani. Ohtani has been out of action this past week due to an oblique injury that occurred during pre-game batting practice on Sep. 4 against the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nThe Halos are coming off a home series win against the Cleveland Guardians, but they\u2019ll be facing a hungry Mariners team who are looking to bounce back themselves. Seattle comes off a 10 game road trip in which they went 3-7 and want to rebound at home in front of their fans, who are hoping for a second consecutive playoff appearance.\n\nThe Mariners currently hold the season advantage against the Angels with a 6-4 record across their matchups this year. The Angels were swept the last time these two teams faced each other in the beginning of August in Anaheim. That sweep was one of the main reasons for the Angels downfall after the trade deadline, where they went on a seven game losing streak and destroyed their playoff hopes.\n\nOne key part of the Mariners\u2019 success this season has been their starting pitching. They feature one of the best trios in the league at the top with Luis Castillo, George Kirby and Logan Gilbert. The Angels will face Gilbert in game one while Castillo will start in Wednesday\u2019s finale, but they had success against both pitchers last time out until their bullpen faltered and blew both games.\n\nBoth pitchers faced the Angels in their last series, with Castillo allowing seven runs in six innings and Gilbert coughing up seven more (six earned) in just three innings.\n\nThe Angels are getting back shortstop Zach Neto off of the injured list, which will be a huge boost to the lineup and infield. Neto has quickly become a key glue player for the Angels in his rookie season.\n\nWith Neto back, the Angels are looking for their younger players to develop during this last month of the season, such as catcher Logan O\u2019Hoppe, reliever Ben Joyce, starting pitcher Reid Detmers, outfielder Mickey Moniak and first baseman Nolan Schanuel.\n\nOn the Mariners side, Julio Rodriguez can\u2019t be contained. The sophomore center fielder recently won A.L. player of the month, slashing a ridiculous .429/.474/.724 with seven home runs and 30 RBI in 23 games. This streak came at the perfect time, and has helped the Mariners surge into a playoff spot.\n\nRemember, these two teams had similar records at the trade deadline, but they\u2019ve now gone their separate ways. The Angels have the opportunity to play spoiler as the skidding Rangers are waiting to pounce if the Mariners falter.\n\nThe series kicks off Monday night in Seattle at 6:40 p.m.\n```"}

Bella Sanchez, co-executive director of JAMS, recalled visiting the 9/11 Memorial. \u201cI was looking at the names of each person that was engraved, and I thought, \u2018How do you even begin to quantify a person\u2019s life?\u2019\u201d said Sanchez, a senior who is studying international relations. \u201cAnd one part specifically that really got me was there was a woman\u2019s name and next to her name was her unborn [child\u2019s name].\u201d\n\nThe participants assembled at the Physical Education Building before walking to Webb Tower. Once they began their ascent, some members stopped at the roof to take pictures of the view. The event was a bonding experience for the different ROTC branches, according to Jared Park, a sophomore studying economics and mathematics. \u201cIt\u2019s a cool opportunity for all the Air Force branches, and everyone else to get together and collaborate on something because we rarely ever see the Army or Air Force when we do our Navy stuff,\u201d Park said.\n\nA member of the USC ROTC runs up to the roof of Webb Tower on September 11, 2023.

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Julie Jacobson)\n\nBy Brissa Rojas\nSeptember 11, 2023 at 11:12 am PDT\n\nGrowing up, I used to wake up early on the weekend to my parents and grandparents blasting Spanish music in order to get ready to clean the house. A staple routine that many Latino children experience in their households. At the time, I often dreaded waking up like this, but once I got older I realized how amazing the music truly was. One of the classic bands my family would often play was Los Temerarios.\n\nWith a heartwarming blend of fond memories and hopeful excitement, there comes a changer in a momentous chapter in the realm of music. After 46 years, the group that for years made my weekend mornings more enjoyable will be ending their career.\n\nLos Temerario originally started in Fresnillo, Zacatecas, Mexico in 1977. The family band was started by two brothers, Adolfo Angel and Gustavo Angel, and their cousin Fernando Angel. Their father would rent out a room in their house to local music groups to store their instruments. At night the brothers would sneak into the room and make music with the instruments in the storage room, leading to them debuting as a duo at their local church.\n\nAt the beginning of their career, they went by Conjunto la Brisa, but in 1983 they debuted under the name of Los Temerarios with their first album called Los 14 Grandes Hits de Los Temerarios. They changed the vibe of their name, their original name Conjunto con la Brisa meant \u201calong with the breeze\u201d whereas Temerario means \u201csomeone who undertakes a dangerous action with courage and recklessness.\u201d\n\nHaving gained extreme popularity, they signed their first deal with CBS Mexico. They noticed they weren\u2019t growing as much, so they made a new deal with a Monterrey label named Disa. The brothers subsequently established \u00c1ngel Records in San Antonio in 1990, where they unveiled their most iconic albums including \u201cMi Vida Eres Tu,\u201d \u201cVen porque te necesito\u201d and \u201cEnamorado de Ti.\u201d\n\nWith a total of thirty-eight discographies throughout their whole career, the group was a trailblazer of the Grupera subgenre.\n\nLos Temerarios, Gustavo Angel (Left) and Adolfo Angel (Right). (Photo by Gregory Bull/AP)\n\nAdolfo skillfully plays the keyboard, adding a melodic layer to their music, while Gustavo showcases his prowess on the guitar, weaving intricate harmonies. Fernando anchors the rhythm with the resonating bass notes, creating a solid foundation for the band\u2019s sound. The two stepped into the spotlight as the main vocalists, delivering passionate lyrics and melodies, while Jonathan Amabilis and Carlos A. Cavazos contributed as percussionists.\n\nThrough the span of their music career, they have had great achievements which include two Grammy nominations, one Latin Grammy Award, an Excellence Award from Premio Lo Nuestro and another Lifetime Achievement Award from the Latin Billboard Music Awards. In 2016, they got inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The brothers even created their own record label back in 2008.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of our careers when we were looking for support from labels and executives, we weren\u2019t well received,\u201d Adolfo said in an interview with Billboard. \u201cAll we knew back then was that music was our life so we kept looking for options,\u201d he said.\n\nThey first announced the start of their Hasta Siempre tour, which consists of thirty-one dates starting in September 2023, but on August 28, they announced their retirement via Instagram.\n\nBridget Batrez, a fan of the band, originally from Chicago said, \u201cI\u2019ve been listening to Los Temerarios since I was 9 years old because my mom would play their music very often. Now I\u2019m 31 and I finally decided to go see them in person and I\u2019m in love! It was so amazing listening to them and singing along to my most memorable songs. I honestly can\u2019t wait to see them again!\u201d\n\nThe farewell of Los Temerarios marks the end of an era, echoing through the generations of families who found joy and connection through their music. We carry with us the cherished memories of early weekend mornings filled with their melodies. This iconic group will soon say goodbye; let\u2019s hold onto the heartwarming thought that even as they venture onto different paths, we can continue remembering and keeping their music alive by passing down their music to the generations to come.\n```"}

Over 60 protestors were indicted on Aug. 29 under Georgia state racketeering law for protesting the construction of the Atlanta Police Public Safety Training Center, named \u201cCop City\u201d by opponents. The indictment released on Sept. 5 named 61 individuals in alleged violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a law that targets criminal conspirators and can hike up criminal punishments.\n\nProtesters who back the Stop Cop City movement oppose the further militarization of police and the environmental impacts of this project on the Weelaunee Forest, an urban forest surrounded by mostly Black residents, according to their website. \u201cBased in Atlanta, this anarchist, anti-police and environmental activism organization coordinates, advertises, and conducts \u2018direct action\u2019 designed to prevent the construction of the Atlanta Police Public Safety Training Center and Shadow Box Studio (previously known as Blackhall Studios) and promote anarchist ideas,\u201d said Attorney General Chris Carr in the 106-page indictment.\n\nThe Cop City Vote coalition responded saying the RICO charges are \u201cblatantly authoritarian\u201d and that it is an attack on the right to protest and freedom of speech. \u201cThese charges, like the previous repressive prosecutions by the State of Georgia, seek to intimidate protestors, legal observers, and bail funds alike, and send the chilling message that any dissent to Cop City will be punished with the full power and violence of the government,\u201d the coalition said in a statement.\n\nMexico joins an increasing number of Latin American nations to expand reproductive rights. The Mexican Supreme Court voted unanimously to decriminalize abortion on the federal level. Although laws to restrict abortion remain at the state level, people in those states can receive treatment at federally-ran medical facilities without being penalized by state laws.\n\nOn the state level, just 12 of 32 Mexican states have removed abortion from their penal codes, decriminalizing the medical act, demonstrating a shift in public opinion. The expansion of reproductive rights south of the U.S. border could make Mexico an important destination for Americans seeking abortions, according to Reuters.\n\nWestern Pennsylvania special election to determine who takes control of the State House. The Pennsylvania House of Representatives will face a special election on Sept. 19 to tip majority power towards Democrats or Republicans. Voters will elect a state House representative in a Pittsburgh district, where the Democratic party has a stronghold, according to Penn Live.\n\nThe House is currently left at a 101-101 split after former state Rep. Sara Innamorato stepped down in July. Democrat Lindsay Powell and Republican Erin Connolly Autenreith are in the race. The state Senate has a Republican majority.\n```"}

After another long offseason, the NFL is back. Everyone (besides Chiefs fans) has moved on from last season\u2019s tears and found new reasons as to why their team is destined for a Super Bowl run. I welcome you to the first installment of my weekly column, \u201cThe Cookbook.\u201d Every week, I\u2019ll give you my predictions for the three best NFL games of the week, otherwise known as the \u201cmain dishes.\u201d And for me, I always need a side, like mac and cheese or some fries to pair with the main dish, a player to watch for in the game. To see if my cooking skills are up to par this season, I will keep track of my record, and I welcome any and all of you to follow along. It\u2019s time for this week\u2019s menu.\n\nEach of the 32 teams has finished their offseason work and chirp, and now they finally get to put the pads on for real. And while the offseason shows us what teams can possibly be, week one is the introduction to a new year of exciting plays and drama-filled storylines. The waiter has arrived, now, what\u2019s the first dish?\n\nFirst Course | Packers vs. Bears - 1:25 PDT on FOX\nIt\u2019s a new era in this historic rivalry that dates back just over a century. Former franchise signal-caller Aaron Rodgers departed this offseason, slotting in Jordan Love as the Packers\u2019 new QB1. On the flip side, Chicago Bears quarterback Justin Fields now enters the year with expectations at an all-time high. Chicago just reloaded their offense this offseason, adding star receiver DJ Moore in a trade and running back D\u2019Onta Foreman via free agency. In a historic rivalry with lots of new faces, the Bears are favorites to win versus the Packers for only the third time since 2009. Both teams will try and run the ball early. Fields and Love are very capable of stretching plays with their feet, and I expect to see a lot of it. The Packers will need to determine which of their young receivers to trust, with second-year players Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs leading the charge. There is certainly going to be some rust to shake off for both teams.\n\nFrench Fries - Justin Fields, Bears quarterback -  Justin Fields was a threat in the running game last year with 1,143 yards, but his passing raised concerns. With an improved offense from last year, eyes should be on Fields and how he has progressed as a passer, especially now with a true number-one wideout.\n\nPrediction -  Certainly an intriguing matchup, but I am riding with DA BEARS *insert Mike Ditka voice.* The Bears have been sick of letting the cheese heads walk into Soldier Field and beat them every year. The Fields-Moore connection is going to be what every Bears fan has hoped for, and the Bears will find a way to get a victory in a down-to-the-wire type of game.\n\nSecond Course | Cowboys vs. Giants - 5:20 PDT on NBC\nTo say anything other than that Dak Prescott owns the New York Giants would be a lie. Over his career, he has posted a 10-2 record, plus an undefeated record when facing Daniel Jones as the starting quarterback. This is not to discredit what the Giants have been able to do in the past year, especially with Brian Daboll\u2019s arrival from the Bills. Daniel Jones had his best season last year, throwing for over 3,000 yards and limiting his turnovers. Both the Giants and Cowboys made moves to improve their team this offseason. The Cowboys solidified the receiver room by trading for Brandon Cooks, in addition to acquiring former defensive player of the year Stephon Gilmore to Trevon Diggs\u2019 aid. The Giants traded for a versatile tight end in Darren Waller, and drafted 2022 Biletnikoff winner Jalin Hyatt to help give Danny Dimes a few more options in the passing game.\n\nMac and Cheese - Tony Pollard, Cowboys RB -  For the first time in Pollard\u2019s career, he is RB1 for the Cowboys entering week one. After being in Zeke\u2019s shadow the past few years, it is now his time to show his full arsenal \u2014 and make many fantasy owners happy with their selection.\n\nPrediction -  HOW \u2018BOUT THEM \u2018BOYS. In another Sunday Night Football showdown, the Cowboys will come out on top. The Giants have improved this offseason, however, they are starting two rookie cornerbacks in week one. Dak Prescott, with a revamped offense, will shine under the bright lights attacking the young secondary of the Giants.\n\nThird Course | Bills vs Jets - 5:20 PDT on ESPN\nThe New York Jets have been the talk of the town, and their feature on HBO\u2019s \u201cHard Knocks\u201d: certainly amplified that. Not only did both of their top picks of last year\u2019s draft win awards \u2014 offensive and defensive rookies of the year, Garrett Wilson and Sauce Gardner, respectively \u2014 but they brought in four-time MVP quarterback Aaron Rodgers. While the additions have been impactful, the Bills have had the Jets\u2019 number for some time. In the last 10 matchups between the two, the Bills have come out victorious seven times. Both offenses are going to find a way to score. The Bills have continued to finish top five in scoring for the past three seasons, while the Jets seem to have found something with the Aaron Rodgers to Garrett Wilson connection. On Sunday, it really boils down to what defense is going to make the timely interception or huge 4th down stop.\n\nGarlic Bread- Garrett Wilson, Jets WR - Coming off of a phenomenal rookie year, especially by finishing with rookie of the year, raises expectations drastically for year two. Everything out of camp we have seen with his connection with A-Rod has been very optimistic for him taking another leap this year.\n\nPrediction - J-E-T-S. When in doubt, I ride with Rodgers. I expect MetLife to be rocking, and in a classic shootout on MNF, Rodgers leads a game-winning drive to secure his first win in the new threads.\n\nRecipe of the week\nThis column could really not be complete without giving an actual recipe to help you enjoy the first week of NFL football. For this week\u2019s game day recipe, I present  Frank\u2019s RedHot buffalo chicken dip . Just like Taysom Hill, this dip can really do it all.

(Photo by Micah Chow) \n\nBy Will Simonds September 10, 2023 at 12:31 am PDT \n\nThe last time Stanford paid a visit to the Coliseum was Sept. 11, 2021 \u2014 almost two years ago to the day. One might remember that 42-28 Cardinal victory as the end of the Clay Helton era at USC, perhaps a low point in the program\u2019s history. Oh, how much has changed since that disastrous day for the Trojans. \n\nIn perhaps the final installment of one of the longest rivalries on the West Coast, USC trounced Stanford 56-10 Saturday night at home to open Pac-12 play. With the Trojans off to the Big Ten and the Cardinal joining the ACC next season, USC will get to hold bragging rights over its California counterpart for the foreseeable future. \n\n\u201cThis is potentially the last USC-Stanford game for a while ... This was a series in recent years that went a little bit of a different way,\u201d USC head coach Lincoln Riley said. \u201cIt was important to us to seize that moment and opportunity and we did it.\u201d \n\nIt was clear from the get-go how far USC has come since its embarrassing home loss at the hands of the Cardinal two seasons prior. Three minutes in, junior quarterback Caleb Williams steamrolled Stanford fifth-year cornerback Zahran Manley to complete a 21-yard touchdown run. Three minutes later, an interception by redshirt senior safety Max Williams and a rushing score by redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd had the Trojans up by 14. \n\nRedshirt senior running back Austin Jones, who has been somewhat of a mentor to Lloyd, added a third rushing touchdown just before the end of the quarter to give USC a 21-0 lead. Ironically, Jones had 67 yards from scrimmage in that aforementioned matchup in 2021, though he was playing for the Cardinal that time around. \n\nFreshman wide receiver Zachariah Branch then joined the party with a 75-yard punt return for a touchdown, his second in just three games this season. It\u2019s probably safe to say that teams are going to stop kicking at the young speedster sooner rather than later. \n\nWho in their right mind wants to try tackling this? THAT'S A BAAAADDD MANN !!\ufe0f \n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that any time a teammate is asked about Branch, \u201cspecial\u201d is a word that comes up repeatedly. \n\nTo make things even uglier, redshirt senior Jamil Muhammad nabbed a strip sack a few plays later. That was soon followed by a vintage Caleb Williams touchdown, as he scrambled out of the pocket and unleashed a laser on the run that found junior receiver Dorian Singer in the back of the end zone. \n\nSomehow, Williams makes plays like that look routine, despite the fact that he\u2019s one of the only people on this planet that can pull them off. \n\nOn a night when USC honored the Little League World Series championship team from El Segundo, there probably should have been a mercy rule to put Stanford out of its misery sooner. \n\nNevertheless, Williams didn\u2019t feel like letting up, tossing an absolute bomb to senior receiver Brendan Rice for a 75-yard touchdown on the Trojans\u2019 next drive. And just before halftime, redshirt sophomore tight end Lake McRee caught a touchdown pass to give USC a \u2014 checks notes \u2014 49-3 lead at the break. \n\nIn fact, the USC offense scored so much that Traveler was too tired to run out for the Trojans\u2019 last two scores of the half. \n\n\u201cWe played a really, really good first half. All three sides of the ball really surged and then got the momentum and kept it,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt was fun to see the team playing at a high level together for a sustained period.\u201d \n\nPlaying just the first half, Williams was 19 of 22 passing for 300 yards with three touchdowns, in addition to his opening score with his legs. \n\nComparatively, Stanford sophomore quarterbacks Ashton Daniels (who left with an injury in the second quarter) and Justin Lamson threw for a combined 50 yards and were 3 of 13 passing in the opening two quarters. \n\nEven with the game totally out of hand in the second half, the USC defense continued to put together a strong effort. Though Stanford got all the way down to the 1-yard line in its opening drive of the third quarter, a pass breakup by junior safety Calen Bullock forced a turnover on downs to keep the Cardinal out of the end zone until garbage time. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking at the score,\u201d USC redshirt senior safety Bryson Shaw said. \u201cWe have a certain standard we want to meet; we haven\u2019t hit that standard. ... We want to be known as a defensive football team.\u201d \n\nAlbeit against a much inferior opponent playing a backup quarterback for much of the game, the USC defense put up an encouraging performance for the second straight week. \n\nGranted, Stanford did have several wide-open pass-catchers that either dropped passes or had throws go over their heads. Still, the Trojans limited explosive plays fairly well and forced three turnovers. \n\nAlthough Stanford held USC to seven points in the second half, barely any offensive starters played so much as a snap. And with a bye week coming up, it didn\u2019t hurt for Riley to give his playmakers as much rest as possible, especially given the Trojans\u2019 brutal schedule in the latter half of the season. \n\nWilliams and his teammates aren\u2019t looking too far ahead, though. It\u2019s clear that the Trojans still feel that they haven\u2019t yet played to their full potential. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to win football games. Sometimes it looks easy, but it is hard. ... You treat every team the same,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m going out there trying to kill. ... We\u2019re trying to make everybody feel our pain and play on our own terms.\u201d \n\nUSC has a bye week coming up, followed by its first road game of the season at Arizona State on Saturday, Sept. 23.\n```"}

(Photo by Yannick Peterhans)\n\nBy Will Simonds\nSeptember 08, 2023 at 8:53 pm PDT\n\nThe NFL is back, folks. Week 1 is already underway with Thursday\u2019s season opener between the Lions and Chiefs; and wouldn\u2019t you know, a former USC standout scored the first touchdown of the 2023 season. But, we\u2019ll get to Amon-Ra St. Brown and his ... intriguing celebration a little later in my rankings.\n\nUSC boasts 26 alumni on current active NFL rosters this season, and many are set to play significant roles on contending teams. So, for any USC supporters that may not be thrilled with their team\u2019s outlook for the upcoming year (looking at you, Rams fans), here are plenty of guys that you can root for this season.\n\nThis is now year four of my annual rankings, and, remember it\u2019s players I\u2019m excited and/or curious to watch, not necessarily the best players. That being said, you\u2019re quite welcome to take a look at my past rankings (2022, 2021 and 2020) if you feel inclined to get mad at my bad takes, and I\u2019ll also provide my ranking from last year for each player listed below (sorry, Uchenna Nwosu).\n\nFinally, here is a handy-dandy list of every former USC football player currently in the NFL, including those on practice squads and IR, as well as the guys that unfortunately didn\u2019t make my prestigious list.\n\nAlright, let\u2019s get into it.\n\n10. JuJu Smith-Schuster, WR, New England Patriots (No. 4)\nAfter posting a bounce-back 2022 season with Kansas City, Smith-Schuster now heads to New England. He grabbed 78 receptions for 933 yards, his highest yardage total since his 2018 Pro Bowl season with the Steelers. One issue: Mac Jones isn\u2019t Patrick Mahomes. The third-year New England quarterback has some OK weapons around Smith-Schuster, including Devante Parker and Hunter Henry, but the Patriots could still really use a true No. 1 receiver. I\u2019m not sure that will be JuJu, but he\u2019s shown potential to be that guy in the past.\n\n9. Tyron Smith, OT, Dallas Cowboys (Not Ranked)\nAn eight-time Pro Bowler and two-time AP First-Team All-Pro, Smith was one of the top offensive tackles of the 2010s. However, Smith has battled various injuries this decade, as he played just six games combined in the 2020 and 2022 seasons and missed six games in 2021 as well. Nevertheless, at age 32, the former top-10 pick has shown he can still produce at a top level when he\u2019s on the field. The Cowboys have one of the most talented rosters in the league, including on their offensive line, but Smith\u2019s availability is an important key for their success.\n\n8. Michael Pittman Jr., WR, Indianapolis Colts (No. 1)\nAfter successfully predicting a big year in 2021, I was disappointed by Pittman last season, who was atop my 2022 rankings. As the Colts\u2019 top pass-catching option, I thought Pittman would continue to ascend into a top-10 receiver in the league (that didn\u2019t happen), but it also wasn\u2019t really his fault. I mean, did you see the combination of Matt Ryan, Nick Foles and Sam Ehlinger last season? Now, rookie Anthony Richardson will be throwing the passes, and it\u2019s going to be interesting to see how Pittman meshes with the recent No. 4 overall pick.\n\n7. Tuli Tuipulotu, EDGE, Los Angeles Chargers (NR)\nTuipulotu\u2019s 13.5 sacks in his final year at USC earned him 2022 Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year honors and a second-round selection in this year\u2019s draft by the Chargers. While he\u2019s behind two of the best pass rushers in the NFL on the depth chart \u2014 Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack \u2014 Tuipulotu can still put up big numbers right away across them when he rotates in. The big key for the rookie, though, will be helping fix an abysmal Chargers run defense if they want to be a contender this season.\n\n6. Alijah Vera-Tucker, OL, New York Jets (No. 8)\nThe former first-rounder heads into his third year as perhaps the Jets\u2019 most trusted offensive lineman. It appears that Vera-Tucker will remain at right guard to start the season, but given some question marks at both tackle spots, we might see him move around throughout the year, as he did at USC. Oh, and I should probably mention the guy he\u2019s protecting now. Aaron Rodgers will be taking snaps in New York, and with him comes much higher expectations.\n\n5. Uchenna Nwosu, EDGE, Seattle Seahawks (NR)\nI\u2019m just going to say that leaving Nwosu off my rankings last year inspired him to have a career year last season in Seattle. In fact, he should probably thank me for motivating him on his way to earning a three-year extension worth up to $59 million this past offseason. Nwosu set career highs in 2022 in numerous statistics, including sacks (9.5), forced fumbles (three) and quarterback hits (26). Now, as the Seahawks seek to return to the playoffs, Nwosu will be a major factor in repeating and perhaps improving on last season\u2019s success as a team.\n\n4. Jordan Addison, WR, Minnesota Vikings (NR)\nAnother rookie that made a major impact for USC at this time last year, Addison comes into a fantastic situation in Minnesota as the No. 23 overall pick. After all, who wouldn\u2019t want to run routes across from Justin Jefferson? It\u2019s pretty much a death sentence to not put two defenders on Jefferson, meaning lots of open space for Addison to enjoy. As long as Kirk Cousins is willing to push the ball downfield, Addison could be one of the most productive rookies in the league in this potent Vikings offense.\n\n3. Drake London, WR, Atlanta Falcons (No. 3)\nYet another receiver on this list, London looks to improve on a solid debut season in Atlanta. There\u2019s plenty of reason to be optimistic about London\u2019s progress, too, especially given who will be throwing him passes this season. In Marcus Mariota\u2019s 13 starts for the Falcons last year, London averaged about 3.6 receptions and 41 yards per game. After the bye week, when Desmond Ridder took over for the final four games, London\u2019s numbers went up to over six catches and 83 yards per game. With Ridder also going into his second year, keep an eye on this young duo to take a step forward this season.\n\n2. Talanoa Hufanga, S, and Drake Jackson, EDGE, San Francisco 49ers (No. 7/No. 9)\nAlright, fine, I\u2019m cheating a bit here, and yes, it\u2019s largely because of my 49ers fandom. That being said, the San Francisco defense was incredible last season, in large part due to Hufanga\u2019s breakout year. When he declared for the 2021 NFL Draft, I wasn\u2019t super high on Hufanga, despite his impressive play at USC. Gladly, he\u2019s proved me wrong, though, as his instincts have vaulted him into the NFL\u2019s Top 100 players. Meanwhile, Jackson heads into his second year surrounded by tons of playmakers in red and gold, including the guy above. The former second-rounder \u2014 considered a first-round talent by many \u2014 now will start alongside Arik Armstead, Javon Hargrave and reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year Nick Bosa on a vaunted 49ers defensive line. If Hufanga can repeat his play from last season and Jackson can successfully rush the passer while on easy mode, San Francisco should continue to be an elite defense in 2023 thanks to these two former Trojans.\n\n1. Amon-Ra St. Brown, WR, Detroit Lions (No. 2)\nI mentioned him (and his Key and Peele tribute?) earlier, and it\u2019s only appropriate that he takes the top spot on this list after Thursday\u2019s touchdown catch to open the NFL season. Since the second half of his rookie year in 2021, St. Brown has been a legitimate top-10 receiver in the league thanks in part to a huge target share. He\u2019s a major reason why Lions fans are probably as optimistic as they\u2019ve ever been, and the former fourth-round pick seems well on his way to cementing himself in that top 10 at the receiver position.\n```"}

(Photo by Kalinda Xiao)\n\nBy Silva Chen\nSeptember 08, 2023 at 5:12 pm PDT\n\nThe USC Women\u2019s soccer team failed to continue its momentum after the 4-0 win against Purdue last week. The Trojans (3-2-0) had a tough game against Utah Valley (3-3-1) and found themselves down early in the first half and were not able to cut the opponent\u2019s lead until late in the game. This led to a 3-2 home loss and the first defeat at home for USC.\n\n\u201cWe think energy and competitiveness was lacking [in today\u2019s game],\u201d head coach Jane Alukonis said. \u201cThat will be the emphasis every day in training. We\u2019ll work on securing the ball and just overall like coming out ready to play.\u201d\n\nUtah Valley pressed high at the beginning of the game, but USC dealt with the press comfortably by passing around. After receiving a through pass at the right front, junior forward/defender Kayla Colbert \u2014 who scored a goal in the last game against Purdue for USC \u2014 was able to make a threatful first shot to the bottom right corner, but it was saved by Utah Valley\u2019s junior goalkeeper CJ Graham.\n\nUSC dominated the ball in the first 10 minutes, with junior All-Pac-12 first-team midfielder Simi Awujo continuously getting the ball back in the midfield and drawing multiple fouls from Utah Valley. However, the Wolverines did not stop pressing and remained playing physically.\n\nUtah Valley\u2019s high press paid off shortly after, with senior midfielder Heather Stainbrook getting the ball at the right side of USC\u2019s backcourt. She dribbled into the box and caused a handball from a USC defender when making a cross. Although USC\u2019s freshman goalkeeper Hannah Poulter was able to block the penalty kick, junior forward Faith Webber, who took the penalty, got the rebound and sent the ball into the net.\n\nFrom there, both USC and Utah Valley struggled to get the ball forward and create shot opportunities. The Wolverines continued with their high press but failed to make threatful shots, and the Trojans tried to respond by making counterattacks but were called offside five times in the first half, including a call that overturned a goal.\n\n\u201cWe were clear with each other that the first half was unacceptable and just was not enough,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cWe got outworked by Utah Valley, and that\u2019s on us.\u201d\n\nEntering the second half, Utah Valley kept using the same tactic by pressing USC\u2019s backfield, and the Trojans still seemed unprepared. As the clock approached the 50-minute mark, Webber stole a back pass at the edge of the box and placed the ball into the bottom left side, giving Utah Valley a 2-0 lead and Webber her second goal of the game.\n\nUSC tried to bounce back through pressing higher, which paid off as USC was getting more opportunities and creating more shots. However, just 10 minutes later, Webber received a free kick from 30 yards out by Stainbrook, got a foot on the ball, sent it to the back of the net and got the second hat trick of her career.\n\nShortly after, USC\u2019s freshman forward/midfielder Florianne Jourde, who replaced graduate forward/midfielder Hannah Griffin in the first half, stepped up, scoring her first goal of the season by firing the ball to the top left corner after receiving a pass to the middle from senior defender/midfielder Zoe Burns. Jourde\u2019s goal gave USC some momentum.\n\nThe Trojans kept winning the ball back in the midfield. Senior forward Angeles Escobar threatened Utah Valley with a long shot outside the box, and Colbert also gave her team shot opportunities by crossing into the box. Colbert\u2019s effort paid off later in the 78th minute, as she broke through the Wolverines\u2019 defense from the left, got into the box and swept the ball to the freshman forward Maribel Flores, who volleyed the ball in with her right foot.\n\nWith the return of Awujo, USC tried playing more aggressively in the final minutes of the match by pressing high. But they did not threaten Utah Valley\u2019s goalkeeper. Graham made multiple saves at the late minutes and sealed the win for the Wolverines.\n\nIn the second half, USC had seven more shots than the first half and scored two goals, but the comeback was too little too late.\n\n\u201cWe made adjustments such as pressing them a bit higher in the half time, it was just unfortunately too late,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cSo even though the second half was okay, the first half put us in too far of a hole.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will have a week-long break until their next game against New Mexico State at McAlister Field on September 14.\n```"}

The death of a Massachusetts teenager after his family said he ate an extremely spicy tortilla chip has led to an outpouring of concern about the social media challenge and prompted retailers to pull the product from their shelves at the manufacturer's request. (AP Photo/Steve LeBlanc)\n\nBy Joel Robles and Marco Alvarez September 08, 2023 at 4:16 pm PDT\n\nThe death of a 14-year-old high school student has resulted in the now infamous \u201cOne Chip Challenge\u201d being removed from the shelves of stores. Harris Wolobah, a Massachusetts high school sophomore, ate the chip on September 1 and went to the school nurse with a stomach ache. That afternoon, Wolobah passed out in his home and was officially pronounced dead in the hospital later that day. An autopsy has yet to be performed.\n\nThe challenge itself encourages people to record themselves eating the chip, their subsequent reactions to its spiciness and post it on social media. The challenge has been taken on by celebrities such as Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Tony Hawk, Kristen Bell and Michael Pe\u00f1a, and has been featured on talk shows such as the Ellen Show and Hot Ones.\n\nFollowing the death of Wolobah, Paqui, the brand that created the chip and its corresponding challenge, released a statement. \u201cThe Paqui One Chip Challenge is intended for adults only, with clear and prominent labeling highlighting the chip is not for children or anyone sensitive to spicy foods or who has food allergies, is pregnant, or has underlying health conditions,\u201d read the statement. The company recognized that there has been an increase in teens and other individuals not heeding these warnings. \u201cAs a result, while the product continues to adhere to food safety standards, out of an abundance of caution, we are actively working with our retailers to remove the product from shelves,\u201d says the statement.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the chip has caused suffering after being consumed by minors. In January of 2022, three students in a California high school were hospitalized after having severe reactions to the chip. Nine other students at the school were also reported to have become sick after eating the chip, which resulted in its ban from the school campus.\n\nPhilosophy and history major Chad Beauchamp said his experience with the Paqui One Chip was horrible. \u201cI went and did it and the first five minutes was chill... then after that everything hit you all at once,\u201d Beauchamp said. \u201cYour throat felt like it was on fire, felt like you had snake acid in your eyes... everytime you breathe it feels like you\u2019re inhaling fire.\u201d\n\nPaqui has been rolling out variations of the singular spicy chip that comes packaged in a coffin-shaped container since 2016. Before its removal from shelves, 87 different companies across the country carried and sold the chip, including 7/11, Walgreens and AM PM.\n\nNot everyone has bad experiences with the challenge. Human Biology student Owen Kuchinad said the one chip challenge was easy. \u201cIt was fine, it wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d Kuchinad said.\n\nThe two peppers that are included in the ingredients for the most recent version of the chip are the Carolina Reaper pepper and the Naga Viper pepper. The Carolina Reaper has a score of 1.7 million Scoville units, a measurement used to test heat levels in peppers and other substances. The Naga Viper has a score of 1.4 million units, according to the Paqui website. For contrast, a habanero pepper ranges between a score of 100,000 and 350,000 units.\n\nKuchinad said because of Woloba\u2019s death his brother decided to cancel the punishment for his fantasy football league, which had previously been the spicy challenge.\n\nIn addition to taking its products off of store shelves, Paqui is also offering refunds for single-serve one chip challenge products.\n```"}

The restraining order aims to cancel a board meeting scheduled for September 13. In the filing, the two schools explained the necessity of such an order to preserve the conference as it is.\n\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 actions have left Plaintiffs with no choice but to bring this emergency temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo until a hearing can be had on a preliminary injunction,\u201d the filing said.\n\nThe complaint was filed after Washington State president Kirk Schulz, also the chair of the Pac-12 board of directors, declined commissioner Kliavkoff\u2019s request to hold a board meeting to talk about issues facing the conference. Kliavkoff then scheduled the meeting himself and invited all 12 conference members, including USC and UCLA \u2014 who had previously been excluded from these meetings after announcing their move to major collegiate athletic conference the Big Ten in June 2022.\n\nThis legal action is the latest development in the disintegration of the Pac-12 which began when USC and UCLA announced that they would be withdrawing from the conference. The two schools will begin playing in their new conference during the 2024-2025 season.\n\nIn the last couple months, more Pac-12 universities have said that they will also be departing the conference. In July, the University of Colorado, Boulder, revealed that it would be returning to the Big 12 Conference after an almost 12-year hiatus. The board of regents had voted unanimously to make the switch in 2024.\n\nOn August 4, the Pac-12 lost five schools in the span of a few hours. The University of Washington and the University of Oregon both announced that they would be following USC and UCLA to the Big Ten. The University of Arizona, Arizona State University and the University of Utah announced that they would be joining the Big 12. All five schools will officially join their new conferences at the same time as USC, starting conference play during the 2024-2025 season.\n\nOne month after the Pac-12 lost five, they lost two more. Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, announced on September 1 that they would be joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2024.\n\nNow, the Pac-12\u2019s two remaining schools are looking to protect themselves and the conference. The complaint alleges that, according to the Pac-12\u2019s bylaws, after giving notice of withdrawal, the presidents at the ten departing schools should no longer be allowed to serve on the conference\u2019s board of directors. With this, the presidents at Washington State and Oregon State would be the board\u2019s sole members.\n\nOne particular concern of WSU and OSU is the Pac-12\u2019s assets, which they argue could be distributed amongst departing members if the meeting is allowed to be held. According to the filing, the Pac-12 had $42.7 million in total net assets at the end of the 2022 fiscal year, which excludes the conference\u2019s equity value of their Pac-12 Network ownership. The network reported $117 million in revenue for the fiscal year ending in 2022.\n\nA hearing for the temporary restraining order will be held on Monday, according to ESPN.\n```"}

Hong)\n\nBy Ye Ji Jong, Katherine Havens, Veronica Garza, and Catherine Stuart-Chaffoo\nSeptember 08, 2023 at 2:55 pm PDT\n\nA USC business admin student decided to walk 100 miles to raise money for Maui\u2019s wildfires devastating impacts on his and many other families. Three weeks ago, John Marc Bautista, accompanied by his brother Boston, decided to walk 100 miles in order to raise money and aid their family in Maui, for their 100miles4maui campaign.\n\nAlthough the Maui wildfires began nearly a month ago, the devastating effects are still widely prevalent on the island. The death toll currently sits at 115, and thousands of residents are left displaced as Maui begins its containment process. This ongoing crisis has inspired people to come together in the effort to support the residents of Maui.\n\n\u201cI thought that I should do something for them to raise awareness for the fires in general and to do something for my family, because I believe that families are the most important thing,\u201d said Bautista.\n\nBautista has 15 family members in Maui who were left devastated after their houses tragically burned down. They lost their jobs and were left with very little after the fire. In an effort to help, Bautista documented his 100 mile journey on Instagram and TikTok in order to advertise their Gofundme which was dedicated to raising money for emergency relief for the Marchello family, who Bautista was campaigning for. At the time of publication, the Gofunme raised nearly $85,000.\n\nUpon seeing Bautista\u2019s story, people were quick to help out, with donations ranging from $10 to $1,000. He explains that the outcome of his trek was more than what he had hoped, \u201cI think it exceeded my expectations in terms of what we were able to raise and the awareness we\u2019re able to bring,\u201d said Marc Bautista.\n\nThe rebuilding process has begun in Maui, thousands were displaced. Even as the fires simmer down, there are long lasting economic and personal effects that the disaster has inflicted upon the island and people\u2019s lives. Bautista\u2019s family is just one of thousands that have been tragically uprooted and forced away from their homes. Members of Bautista\u2019s family have also lost their jobs, in addition to their homes.\n\nBautista elaborated that although there were locals who discouraged tourists from coming may now have reversed their stance after a drop in tourism impacted their economy. He believes that tourism money could stimulate Maui\u2019s economy and aid people. The conversation of tourism has been a longstanding topic of discussion among native Hawaiians.\n\nBautista said the fundraiser was his first \u201creal insane adventure,\u201d as he spent a total of 33 hours across three days to accomplish his 100 mile goal. Although the journey was harder than Bautista expected it to be, he said he was glad that he followed through with his plan. The laborious process was very rewarding, seeing the amount of support, attention, and donations the completion of the walk gained, according to Bautista.\n\nThe walk was covered by local news outlets and people became invested in helping with the cause. Bautista says that this experience has opened his eyes to the possibility of doing more to create a positive global effect. \u201cIt definitely made me more aware that I can have an impact if I\u2019m really doing something that\u2019ll get people\u2019s attention,\u201d said Bautista.\n\nIn addition, he wants to turn this project into a bigger goal of tackling climate change and raising awareness for global warming.\n```"}

Welcome back to In the Loop! I hope everyone had an enjoyable summer. The past couple of months were a window for the skaters to take a breather and reset for the new season, which also meant that some important decisions were made. Let\u2019s recap some major updates and see how they are affecting the new season.\n\n1. Cha Jun-Hwan, the history-making figure skater from South Korea, decided to terminate his coaching contract with Canadian figure skating coach Brian Orser over the summer. This was a surprising move by Cha, considering how Orser just helped him score silver at the 2023 World Figure Skating Championships. It has officially crowned Cha as the first male from South Korea to win a medal at Worlds. Even prior to this event, Cha had been on the path of steady improvement. According to various sources, Cha has switched out of the Cricket Club for training in South Korea full-time and also taking care of his college work. He is now preparing for the new season under Chi Hyun-Jung, who also coaches Haein Lee (2023 World silver medalist and 2023 Four Continents champion) and Kim Chaeyeon (2022-23 Junior Grand Prix Final bronze medalist). Cha is undoubtedly in good hands, despite the somewhat disturbing coaching attitude from Chi. Also, being able to train at their hometown should produce a positive psychological impact on the athlete. My one concern is the transition period. It takes time and patience to adjust to any new training methods. It could hit particularly hard at the beginning of a new season, when skaters are also trying to familiarize themselves with all the new programs. In any case, I am looking forward to seeing how the new coaching is affecting Cha.\n\n2. Will Team USA finally have their medal ceremony from Beijing 2022 sometime soon? It is a question I have often asked myself since last year whenever I start to search for updates on Kamila Valieva\u2019s doping case. CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport) will hold a closed-to-the-public hearing from Sept. 26 to 29. CAS is likely to issue a ruling to settle the result of the team event, meaning that the U.S. Figure Skating Team could finally have their medal ceremony, about 500 days after the Olympics. Depending on the decision of CAS, if they want to disqualify Russia\u2019s result in the team event during which Valieva competed, Team USA might move up a spot and get gold instead. I completely agree with the U.S. Figure Skating Team\u2019s request to be present during the September hearing. Japan (third place) and Canada (fourth place) should be there as well, since their rankings could also be moved after the hearing. It is no secret that RUSADA (Russian Anti-Doping Agency) wants and has tried to protect Valieva. Having other national teams there at the Court would therefore encourage transparency and fairness. I hope there will be more updates on the case in the new season and, above all, an ending to this mess with a just outcome for every party involved.\n\n3. Late last year, Skate Canada announced that it has modified the gender rules for participating in pairs and ice dance. Now, the competing couple does not have to consist of a male and a female. Two skaters of any genders can participate in competitions, at least in Canada\u2019s domestic events. I look forward to seeing more diversity in figure skating competitions in Canada. Also, since this is a revolutionary act by Skate Canada, I am curious to see how it is impacting the international skating community. Will more national figure skating federations follow Canada\u2019s example and make the same policy change? Will there be skaters from different countries showing their support for the new policy either on or off the ice? How about any opposing voices? What will be their argument for not supporting the decision? These questions can be answered only by time as we enter a new season. A whole other story is needed to discuss the details, programs I would like to see under the new policy and whether the United States can follow suit anytime soon. But for now, if you would like to know more about how this new policy came about, you can read this Olympics interview. A new season is starting and there is plenty to be excited about. We are in for another wild ride. There will no doubt be adrenaline, tears and surprises. But we are ready for it. \u201cIn the Loop\u201d runs every other Friday.\n```"}

Saturday will mark the two teams\u2019 103rd matchup, and the Trojans will look to defeat Stanford for one final time before both teams leave the Pac-12 in 2024.\n\nThe Trojans look to move to 3-0 on the season, coming off two victories in which they scored 50+ points. The Cardinal is coming off a victory of their own, defeating Hawaii. Junior quarterback Caleb Williams seeks to continue to take advantage of defensive holes and drive yet another phenomenal game.\n\nWhile Stanford\u2019s total defense, which is ranked at No. 74, is much better than those of San Jos\u00e9 State and Nevada, the Trojans plan to replicate their electric offensive performances and win big. On the offensive side of the ball last week, USC put on a show. Fourteen different Trojans caught a pass, showing the team\u2019s true depth at the receiver position, as well as Williams\u2019 ability to find and target open receivers.\n\nIf the Trojans can come close to replicating their passing game performance from last week, they should be in for a big win. Redshirt senior wide receiver Tahj Washington is hoping to add to his team-leading total of three touchdowns.\n\nUSC\u2019s run defense vastly improved last week, despite the ejection of true freshman linebacker Tackett Curtis in the second quarter, plus the absences of junior linebacker Eric Gentry and senior linebacker Mason Cobb. Shorthanded, the Trojans were still able to effectively halt Nevada\u2019s run game, holding the Wolf Pack to just 49 yards on 38 carries.\n\nUSC must continue to prevent the run against Stanford, who scored two touchdowns on the ground in their win against Hawaii. Stanford football entered a new era with its 37-24 win against Hawaii last week, as new head coach Troy Taylor made his debut with the Cardinal. Sophomore quarterback Ashton Daniels flourished under the new system, putting up 248 yards and two touchdowns on 25-for-36 passing.\n\nThis will be a test for the Trojans, who despite defensive improvements last week against Nevada, still gave up some plays they would certainly like to have back, including a 77-yard Nevada touchdown pass. While USC is ranked at No. 6, the Trojans cannot go easy against unranked Stanford.\n\nOne player who will be a big factor for the Cardinal is senior tight end Benjamin Yurosek, who scored a touchdown in Stanford\u2019s victory and also led the team in receptions (nine) and receiving yards (138). Stanford\u2019s run game, which posted 158 rushing yards last week, will also pose a challenge for the Trojans\u2019 defense.\n\nWhile Stanford played well last week, the Trojans still seem poised to win by a considerable margin. If the defense can stay on the same trajectory and continue to improve, USC shouldn\u2019t have a hard time handling the Cardinal.\n\nWhile the season is very early, this game has meaning; a rivalry shared between two schools for over a century is coming to an end after this season. Despite the Pac-12 Conference\u2019s dramatic collapse in the past few months, one thing that will remain intact is the timeless history between USC and Stanford on the gridiron.\n\nUSC has an all-time record of 64-24-3 against its oldest rival, and regardless of the result on Saturday, this matchup will go down in history as the last time Stanford and USC match up as Pac-12 rivals. While a lot has changed between 1905 and the present day, including both teams\u2019 nicknames, the competitiveness of the rivalry has always remained consistent.\n\nTo witness history, catch USC taking on Stanford Saturday at 7:30 p.m. this Saturday at the Coliseum.\n```"}

(Photo by Bryce Dechert)\n\nBy Diego Ynzunza September 07, 2023 at 6:58 pm PDT\n\nUSC has looked like a well-oiled machine throughout the first two weeks of the season. The contributions have come from a variety of people, including freshman phenom wide receiver Zachariah Branch, junior quarterback Caleb Williams doing well to maintain his Heisman form, and redshirt junior running back Marshawn Lloyd complementing senior running back Austin Jones so well. The Trojans look primed to contend for not only a Pac-12 title, but a berth in the College Football Playoff as well. The defense even shored up a bit in last week\u2019s win against Nevada, with the emergence of freshman rush end Brylan Shelby and redshirt senior rush end Jamil Muhammad.\n\nHowever, head coach Lincoln Riley knows that the work is only just beginning; it starts this weekend when Pac-12 rival Stanford makes the trek down south to face the Trojans in the Coliseum. This game looks to be a special one because, on top of all the historical significance, it could possibly be the last time the Trojans and Cardinal play for a long while, with both teams opting to join new conferences next season.\n\n\u201cThe significance is certainly there,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about that with our guys, we\u2019re not shy about it. This one in particular, yeah. Because of the history and the significance of the timing, we do want to make sure our guys understand the opportunity here at hand.\u201d\n\nThe opportunity to build on their 2-0 start is key for this USC team. However, while the talent is apparent, they have not been without their mistakes \u2013 Riley would be the first to admit that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some errors, things we\u2019ve had to clean up,\u201d Riley said. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t been overpowered by any stretch and [have been] bringing guys along that we need to bring along.\u201d\n\nThe quest to get that first Pac-12 win starts with the defense. In last year\u2019s matchup against the Cardinal, the Trojans gave up 28 points to a Stanford team that finished 3-9 and second-to-last in total offense in the Pac-12. A big key to shoring up that portion of the game will be getting junior linebacker Eric Gentry and senior linebacker Mason Cobb healthy for the game. Riley is optimistic about their chances to play this week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful, I would honestly right now put them both in the questionable world,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if either of them is a green light, for sure will go, but I can\u2019t say that either one of them doesn\u2019t have a chance either.\u201d\n\nWhile the Trojans surely have more lofty goals than just starting off the season 3-0, this win would keep them on track to fulfill their long-term goals, while also giving the Cardinal a nice going-away present.\n\n\u201cI like where we\u2019re headed, and you can certainly see the results,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThere\u2019s a noticeable difference right now which is exciting.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by: Viktoria Capek)\n\nBy Aerianne Collantes and Katie Simons\nSeptember 07, 2023 at 6:00 pm PDT\n\nThe Roski School of Art and Design announced its new interdisciplinary minor in fashion last month. Despite the program\u2019s absence in the past, students in various majors have found ways to integrate their passion for fashion into their work, which prompted the creation of the minor, said Antonio Bartolome, Roski student services director.\n\n\u201cWe started to notice that there were a bunch of classes offered throughout USC from the partner schools that now are collaborating under this interdisciplinary minor,\u201d he said. While the minor is housed in Roski, students in the minor can take classes at the Iovine and Young Academy, Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, Marshall School of Business and the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.\n\nThe schools worked together to provide students with classes that allow for them to explore fashion in various ways depending on their interests. These courses give students opportunities and experiences in designing, analyzing and utilizing fashion in different ways.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve collected these classes that already exist that our students have been gravitating towards to do fashion projects and fashion initiatives and brought them together into this minor program,\u201d Bartolome said.\n\nThere are 37 courses students can take to fulfill the minor\u2019s requirements that range from marketing to costume construction and even extended reality design. For Imre Meszaros, assistant dean of graduate and professional programs at the Iovine and Young Academy, the wide variety of courses contributes to the minor\u2019s appeal.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of the structure is that it\u2019s intentionally going to draw in people from all over the place,\u201d Meszaros said. \u201cThe students from these different perspectives are going to help each other to sort of jointly think outside of the box.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have business people, you\u2019re going to have psychology, you\u2019re going to have communication, you\u2019re going to have dance, you\u2019re going to have the art, the tech people together,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd together they can come up with solutions that they otherwise would not have been able to imagine.\u201d\n\nEach school is bringing its own niche to the minor. For instance, the School of Dramatic Arts courses will mainly focus on costume construction, whereas the Marshall School of Business courses will focus more on business management.\n\nCommunications professor Alison Trope said she felt a communication class was valuable to the minor because of fashion\u2019s role in visual communication.\n\n\u201cHow we dress communicates something about who we are, about our identities,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s really important to think about fashion in our everyday lives and in our everyday culture so that it\u2019s not just about the materiality or the technology or the tailoring, but that we see it as part of, you know, this broader kind of environment that we live in.\u201d\n\nSince the program was only recently announced, applications are not currently open. Bartolome said there would be more knowledge on the number of students accepted into the minor later this semester.\n\nAlthough the minor is not yet available for students to declare, Bartolome said students have been excited to learn more about the program with emails about the course hitting his inbox after the announcement was made.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an overwhelming and intimidating undertaking because I feel like fashion is very different for whoever you\u2019re talking to,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re hoping to do is not to create a program that is replicating another program at another school or another institution, but really wanting to be able to allow students to start thinking about what they think fashion is and how they can start solving problems that relate to fashion.\u201d\n```"}

Over the past year, AI technology has undergone significant improvements, making it increasingly more capable of handling academic work. This past March, ChatGPT4 \u2013 Open AI\u2019s most advanced chatbot to date \u2013 was released, prompting USC to issue updated syllabus guidelines to professors for the fall semester.\n\nThe update follows instructor guidelines released last March by the University\u2019s Academic Senate. In most cases, the use of AI is considered a violation of USC\u2019s academic integrity policy. The university permits AI for tasks such as fine-tuning and grammar checking, but the software cannot be used to write entire sentences and paragraphs. However, different courses can have policies that range from banning the use of AI completely to allowing free usage of the software throughout the course.\n\nThis is because allowing students to use AI for assignments and research is at the discretion of each professor, though students who do so must properly cite their use of the technology. Computer Science professor Jon May told Annenberg Media that he has decided to allow his students to use AI software as long as they share the transcript for the prompts that were used as well as the responses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made this policy and I have already had students submit work where they were in full knowledge of the policy,\u201d May said. \u201cOut of 15 or so students who I was working with already, two took me up on the offer to use it.\u201d\n\nMay, whose coursework and research involves computational linguistics, said the students who did use assistive software seemed to be forthcoming with its use and were using it appropriately. He said he wants students to use the technology to their advantage, though he makes sure to address ethical barriers.\n\n\u201cPeople who don\u2019t have English as their first language, and they need help with fixing up the grammar, that\u2019s a perfectly reasonable way to use things,\u201d May said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want is for a student to say to a [chatbot], \u2018I have to write a report on this. Please write a report.\u2019\u201d\n\nComputer Science and Psychology professor Jonathan Gratch also encourages the use of AI in his classroom, though he does not require his students to cite their use of the software.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really thought about, \u2018Should I require them to disclose to what extent they use technology?\u2019\u201d Gratch said. \u201cFrom a philosophical perspective, I think I want them to use it as a tool, because I think it actually helps them do more.\u201d\n\nSophomore psychology major Fiona Collins said she understands both sides of the AI debate, especially when it comes to her coding class.\n\n\u201c[Professors] say that it\u2019s really helpful for more intense coding classes but for intro to Python, you\u2019re not supposed to use it,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI think my coding teacher is kind of for ChatGPT, because people coded that. She\u2019s not against it, she\u2019s just against it for learning the fundamentals.\u201d\n\nWith the rising popularity of ChatGPT and other AI sources, teachers and students alike must learn how to adapt to and ethically use the new tool.\n\n\u201cI feel like if you don\u2019t use ChatGPT, you\u2019re going to fall behind,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThe people who really know how to use it well are at an advantage.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2023/09/07/fantasy-football-start-em-sit-em-week-1/", "response": "```\nIt\u2019s finally here: the beginning of football season\u2014and thus, fantasy football season. Buckle up, because this year\u2019s going to be a good one. With new faces in new threads all across the league from the new rookies to the old vets, the NFL is ready to kick off on Thursday night with the Super Bowl Champion Kansas City Chiefs and the forever irrelevant (but hopefully not irrelevant anymore) Detroit Lions. With the first week underway, let\u2019s take a look at some of the players I like to start the season and others I wouldn\u2019t risk in my Week 1 Edition of Start \u2018Em Sit \u2018Em (with a few snoozers in there if you\u2019re feeling extra doozy).\n\nQuarterback\nSTART: Geno Smith (SEA) vs. LAR  After getting his opportunity to start in the NFL for the first time since 2014 last season, Geno Smith did not fail to leave his mark, throwing for over 4,000 yards while amassing the fifth most fantasy points amongst quarterbacks. After his improbable season, fantasy projections have him ranked between 12 and 15 among other quarterbacks. The slander is laughable. Smith opens his 2023 fantasy campaign with a highly favorable matchup against a Rams secondary that took a massive hit trading Jalen Ramsey to the Dolphins. With rookie receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba trending towards playing in the opener, I expect Smith to pick apart the Rams defense for a big fantasy performance.\n\nSIT: Aaron Rodgers (NYJ) vs. BUF  After leaving Green Bay and joining the Jets in the offseason, the entire football community is eager to see how Rodgers fares wearing a different shade of green. Unfortunately, he\u2019s put to the test against the Bills in his first matchup, a defense that allowed the third-fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks last season. With the Jets newly acquiring Dalvin Cook, I expect the Jets to pound the ball downfield and work the clock to keep the Bills offense on the sideline, spelling the potential for a below-average game from Rodgers.\n\nSnoozer: Anthony Richardson (IND) vs. JAX  Don\u2019t hate me for buying into the hype. Richardson has received a ton of attention going into this season behind seemingly low expectations with a Colts squad that has just one returning offensive player with more than 1,000 scrimmage yards. With that being said, Richardson will likely have to create some magic to produce offense for his team, but I think against the Jaguars, who gave up the 9th most points to opposing quarterbacks in fantasy last season, he could do just that. This prediction might be square, but I believe in the rookie from Florida.\n\nRunning back\nSTART: Cam Akers (LAR) @ SEA  I know how Cam Akers fantasy owners feel after last year. Trust me. I was one of them. But after coming off injury and finishing the last 6 weeks of the regular season top 5 in fantasy points per game for running backs, Akers is primed for another big season. Going up against the Seahawks, who gave up the 4th most points to opposing running backs in fantasy last year, I expect Akers to be utilized a ton by the Rams, especially with Cooper Kupp likely out the first week.\n\nSIT: James Cook (BUF) @ NYJ  After gaining the starting role in his second season, fantasy owners have a high outlook on James Cook going into 2023. However, with a Monday night showdown against the Jets, a top-12 defense against opposing running backs in fantasy, I expect the Bills to come out firing on offense under the lights, relying heavily on the pass. Even if Cook gets a favorable workload, against a strong Jets defensive line, it\u2019ll be tough for Cook to thrive in his first fantasy matchup unless he rips off a touchdown. The Bills also added Damien Harris to their backfield this off-season, a man who\u2019s just two years removed from a 900-yard season. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he eats into Cook\u2019s workload on Monday as well.\n\nSTART: Brian Robinson (WAS) vs. ARZ  Brian Robinson turned into a cowbell back for the Commanders at the end of last year, accumulating more than 15 carries in 6 of his last 7 games. As question marks riddled the Commanders\u2019 QB room all season, Washington will likely have to rely on their workhorse running back to open the season. With a favorable matchup against the Cardinals, who gave up the second most points to running backs last season, I expect Robinson to get fed early and often.\n\nSIT: Najee Harris (PIT) vs. SF  Najee Harris and the Steelers offense look to continue on the momentum built from late-season success provided by Kenny Pickett in 2022. Unfortunately for Harris, his first matchup in the new season couldn\u2019t be any worse as he faces the 49ers defense which boasted the least amount of points against opposing fantasy running backs. In a game where the Steelers need to establish the passing game to win, I expect Pickett to throw the ball a lot, eliminating touches from Harris on the ground.\n\nSnoozer: Miles Sanders (CAR)  After a comeback 2022 fantasy season, Sanders welcomed a change of scenery with the Panthers and rookie quarterback Bryce Young this offseason, and I expect him to pick up where he left off with his new squad. Young relied heavily on his running backs at Alabama with Brian Robinson and Jahmyr Gibbs while he was there, and until Young feels confident throwing the ball downfield, I expect him to check down and feed Sanders heavily.\n\nWide receiver\nSTART: Chris Godwin (TB) @ MIN  Tampa Bay\u2019s offense took a historically bad downgrade after Tom Brady retired this offseason, replaced under center with former number-one overall pick Baker Mayfield. While Mayfield is just a shell of his former Heisman self, Godwin should have an opportunity to feast against the Vikings secondary who gave up the second most fantasy points to wide receivers last year. In what will most likely be an offensive showcase, Mayfield and the Bucs will be forced to air the ball out to Godwin and Mike Evans to compete with Minnesota\u2019s high-powered offense. I think Godwin has a slight edge here, as Mayfield likes to throw the ball mid-range and short, and that\u2019s where Godwin thrives.\n\nSIT: Marquise Brown (ARZ) vs. WAS  Marquise Brown enters this season the number one target for a Cardinals offense that parted ways with DeAndre Hopkins in the offseason; however, Brown will have journeyman Josh Dobbs throwing him the ball. In games without Kyler Murray last year, Brown averaged just 7.1 fantasy points per game. Facing the Commanders, a team who bolstered its secondary with its first two draft picks, Brown will have an uphill battle as he matches up against the team that gave up the 13th fewest fantasy points per game to receivers last year. If you had any hesitation to start Marquise Brown, use this as your sign to leave him on your bench come Sunday.\n\nSTART: Christian Kirk (JAX) vs. IND  The Jags offense drew a lot of buzz this offseason with the acquisition of Calvin Ridley and the expectation that Trevor Lawrence will take a step forward going into his second season in Doug Pederson\u2019s system. With an opening matchup against divisional rival Indianapolis Colts, the Jaguars offense will come out firing, proving why they are the favorites to win the AFC South. In last year\u2019s two contests against the Colts, Kirk put up over 100 yards combined with three touchdowns for a banner 20+ point day. While the addition of Ridley will undoubtedly take away looks from Kirk, I expect him to cook again against a Colts secondary who recently took a step back after losing the likes of cornerback Stephon Gilmore in the offseason.\n\nSIT: DJ Moore (CHI) vs. GB  DJ Moore joined a Bears squad in the offseason that has high expectations to improve upon its 3-14 season in 2022 behind third-year quarterback Justin Fields. In a crowded receiver room alongside Darnell Mooney and Chase Claypool, it\u2019s unknown exactly what Moore\u2019s role will look like in Chicago\u2019s offense in their home opener. He could be in the spotlight early and have a productive fantasy week, but the Bears could also look to establish the run game against a tough Packers defense that allowed the 11th fewest fantasy points to wide receivers last year. I think Moore is a risky choice for a WR1 or WR2 spot this week, and only merits flex consideration.\n\nSnoozer: Marvin Mims (DEN) vs. LV  This call is a shot in the dark, but it very well may strike if Denver wide receiver Jerry Jeudy is out on Sunday with a hamstring injury, which is looking very possible after head coach Sean Payton placed him on \u201climited participation\u201d for Wednesday\u2019s practice. The Broncos square off against a Raiders secondary which is bottom 5 in the league, giving Mims the potential to break out in Jeudy\u2019s absence. Mims is rostered in 15% of leagues (ESPN), so if you\u2019re looking for a WR stream to fill a gap in your lineup, Mims could be a good pickup if Jeudy is still questionable come Sunday.\n\nTight end\nSTART: Tyler Higbee (LAR) @ SEA  After concluding 2022 on a horrible note offensively, the Rams come into 2023 looking for a fresh start with quarterback Matthew Stafford healthy again. With Cooper Kupp likely sidelined against the Seahawks, I expect Stafford to rely heavily on Higbee, one of his favorite targets since Stafford joined the Rams three seasons ago. Matching up against the Seahawks, who give up the second most fantasy points per game to opposing tight ends, I believe Higbee should put together a solid stat line as Stafford\u2019s potential main target through the air.\n\nSIT: Cole Kmet (CHI) vs. GB  The Packers gave up the sixth least points to opposing tight ends per game last season and I expect a similar script to open this season, as the Bears will likely prioritize the run and work the ball downfield to work the clock in a key divisional matchup. With Fields at quarterback, Kmet has averaged just 6.7 fantasy points against the Packers, and I\u2019m expecting another flop this week.\n\nSnoozer: Dalton Kincaid (BUF) @ NYJ  The Bills already had a viable option at tight end with Dawson Knox entering 2023, but they saw something in Utah product Dalton Kincaid worthy of the 25th pick. Josh Allen has been needing a big reliable target to throw to and Kincaid could fill that void, as he had three games last season with over 100 yards and two with multiple touchdowns. I expect the Bills to utilize Kincaid often in their opener, especially against a Jets defense that allowed the ninth most points to opposing fantasy tight ends per game last season.\n```"}

That will be the answer to all those questions about the NFL.\u201d\n\nWilliams solely focusing on the college game has done him some good, as his offense has averaged over 60 points per game thus far. It helps that his wide receiver room is loaded with talent. A clear standout thus far has been redshirt senior Tahj Washington, who leads the team in both yards and touchdowns.\n\n\u201cTahj works on his game all the time,\u201d Dennis Simmons, the outside wide receivers coach, said. \u201cSince we\u2019ve gotten here, he\u2019s improved on his focus and concentration on deep balls. So far, with the amount of touches and yards that he\u2019s gotten, scoring three touchdowns on five catches, you can see the proof in his work.\u201d\n\nSimmons was not the first coach this week to praise Washington. After the Nevada win last Saturday, head coach Lincoln Riley called him one of the most unselfish players he has ever coached. Despite the praise, Washington is honing in on how he can get better.\n\n\u201cI still have a lot to clean up in terms of my route running and perimeter blocking,\u201d Washington said. \u201cWe\u2019re two games down, with a lot more to go.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s production has not been a new phenomenon at USC; he was very productive in 2022 as well. However, a major surprise through two games has been wideout Duce Robinson, who is second on the team in yards as a true freshman. After scoring his first collegiate touchdown last weekend, he spoke to the media for the first time as a Trojan on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I kind of blacked out during [the touchdown,]\u201d Robinson said. \u201cI remember catching [the ball,] and I remember touching the end zone. It was an incredible feeling, especially seeing the sideline celebrating and seeing all those guys sprinting after me. It really makes you feel like this team cares about each other. It\u2019s a blessing to be able to play.\u201d\n\nJunior wide receiver Michael Jackson III also made his presence felt in his first game, scoring a 15-yard touchdown. Despite that score being his only catch, Jackson raved about the dynamic in the receiver room.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much talent,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe all thrive off each other to make each other better. We all learn things from each other. We play to each other\u2019s strengths, see what we can work on and hold each other accountable.\u201d\n\nWhile the reigning Heisman Trophy winner has racked up most of the passing stats thus far, the statistics on the receiving end have been remarkably evenly distributed. No individual wide receiver has had more than six catches across the first two games, but seven have had at least four.\n\n\u201cI want to spread the ball around and distribute the ball to all my wide receivers, running backs, or tight ends,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI want to spread the ball around and have everybody be happy, but I also go win big games. I don\u2019t want people to know tendencies from me and our offense. One of the biggest things for me is to spread the ball around to whoever at whatever point I want.\u201d\n\nSaturday night\u2019s matchup will be the last for USC prior to their first bye Week, so coaches and players alike are making sure to keep their feet on the gas before an early break.\n```"}

The program works by supplying U-Pass cards to students, which can be used on 10 different transit agencies, including Los Angeles Metro buses and trains. The cost of the program is included in a $93 Transportation Fee charged to all registered students at USC.\n\nBefore the fall semester of 2023, USC\u2019s U-Pass program was only available to graduate students. \u201cWe launched this program to increase transit riders among the college sectors,\u201d said Metro senior account executive Jocelyn Feliciano. A Metro board report obtained by Annenberg Media shows that in November 2016, only 1% of the 1.4 million public college students in Los Angeles County actively participated in Metro\u2019s reduced fare college pass programs. \u201cSo we needed to figure out what were the barriers to getting those people riding,\u201d said Feliciano.\n\nFeliciano oversees the Metro\u2019s U-Pass program, which covers more than 20 public and private universities in the L.A. area. \u201cHaving the undergraduates be in the program is a real benefit,\u201d Feliciano said. She said that USC students accounted for 97,000 boardings on participating Metro routes for fall and winter of the last fiscal year, the most recent period for which Metro has data.\n\nDespite the fact that every USC student pays a fee for a U-Pass, less than 20% of them actually have the card, according to data from the Metro and USC. Many students still prefer driving over public transit. David Donovan, associate director of USC Transportation, wrote in an email to Annenberg Media that the University has sold some 6,500 parking permits to students at both L.A. campuses so far this semester. USC Transportation oversees more than 15,000 parking spaces between HSC and UPC, all of which require paid permits.\n\nDaniel Ynchausti, a political science and public diplomacy undergraduate student at USC, commutes about 20 minutes from Koreatown every day. Ynchausti decided to live farther away from campus because rent prices are more affordable. While the arrangement works for now, Ynchausti said he\u2019s worried about what increasing gas prices could mean for his budget. He said he\u2019s already shelled out about $530 for a permit to park in Parking Structure X next to McCarthy Quad.\n\nAfter seeing gas prices top $6 in his hometown of Covina, California, Ynchausti said he wished he owned a hybrid. But gas prices aren\u2019t his only concern. Despite the relatively short trip, the looming risk of expensive fixes for his car could force him to find alternative transportation arrangements. Without his car, he said he\u2019d take a Lyft or ride with a friend. \u201cI\u2019m definitely pro-transportation,\u201d he said when asked about the possibility of using public transit, though he prefers the convenience of driving.\n\nRising gas prices and the costly car maintenance are not the only things that might tempt a student to use public transit. \u201cOne study that [Metro] participated in showed that students receiving the free transit passes have a 27% or up to 27% higher graduation rate than other students out there,\u201d said Devon Deming, deputy executive officer of the Metro\u2019s Fareless System Initiative. \u201cA lot of them have said that having a free pass program allows them to not worry about how they\u2019re going to get to school or how they pay to get to school, but really just focus on the ability to do their schoolwork,\u201d said Deming.\n\nBut many students choose to drive, finding the L.A. transit system inconvenient and unmanageable. Kenton Sakurai, a medical student at Keck School of Medicine, commutes to the UPC campus just once per week. Like many Angelenos, traffic is his biggest concern\u2014his commute can take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. Additionally, Sakurai thinks that L.A. public transit has gained a reputation for being slow, unreliable, and even dangerous.\n\nFor Makayla Lysiak, an undergraduate playwriting and screenwriting student, fears about safety on public transit have been the main drawback of using the Metro. She used to pay for a Metro TAP card to commute when U-Passes were unavailable to USC undergraduates. \u201cI took the Metro train at Union Station all the time, maybe every other week, and then sometimes the wire train that runs along the street and then also the subway,\u201d Lysiak said. But that changed this year, when she had several experiences on public transportation that made her feel unsafe. \u201cI had people coming up to me, asking for my name, my number. And it was all just men around me, like, I was the only woman down there,\u201d Lysiak said. \u201cOne guy came up to me saying, \u2018You better be careful, there\u2019s pedophiles down here.\u2019\u201d Lysiak said she hasn\u2019t taken the Metro since. She now drives to USC and has a permit to park on campus.\n\nFor some, the fears become reality. Last week, KTLA reported that a USC graduate student identified only as Anna S. was attacked while waiting to board a 5 p.m. train at Union Station in downtown Los Angeles. KTLA retrieved surveillance footage of the attack, which showed that she was approached from behind and hit over the head. She is now considering other modes of transportation as she is concerned about her safety going forward.\n\nDavid Carlisle, the assistant chief of USC\u2019s Department of Public Safety, said DPS does not distribute flyers or other information materials to students who commute on public transportation. But he advised that everyone should avoid displaying valuable items while on the Metro, travel with a friend whenever possible, stay awake and alert, and keep belongings close by.\n\nDespite safety concerns, use of the U-Pass for Metro is growing at USC. In spring of 2023, only 484 graduate students at USC used the U-Passes, according to Metro data obtained by Annenberg Media. As of the third week of fall semester 2023, almost eight thousand students (including both graduate and undergraduate students) have U-Passes. While the number of students using the program is about 16 times greater than last spring, it still accounts for less than 17% of the USC student population.\n```"}

Many students feel as if the pandemic is over. Dr. Sarah Van Orman, vice president and chief campus health officer, says otherwise.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing an increase in COVID-19 cases and that\u2019s the primary respiratory illness that we\u2019re seeing right now,\u201d said Orman in a student health briefing with Annenberg Media.\n\nFollowing an order from the L.A. County Health Department, several businesses are once again requiring their employees to wear masks in the workplace. At USC, students and staff are beginning to think about the possibility of re-masking.\n\n\u201cThere have been surges again and I think that for most of my classes, [wearing masks] wouldn\u2019t really impact anything,\u201d said V Collins-Laine, a senior majoring in interactive entertainment. \u201cEven if it was just for large lecture classrooms I think that it would make a lot of sense.\u201d\n\nDarrell Harris, a driver for USC Transportation, doesn\u2019t feel masks are necessary and said he would feel upset if a mask mandate took effect again on campus.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t believe that the mask helped at all,\u201d said Harris. \u201cI\u2019ve done some research on it and I just don\u2019t think they would be useful.\u201d\n\nHowever, some students think that masking up could be beneficial.\n\n\u201cConsidering that the COVID cases have been rising especially here in L.A., I think it would be understandable to start having indoor classes to start wearing masks,\u201d said Nathan Hyun, a junior in the Army Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps.\n\nOn Sept. 1, USC\u2019s COVID-19 Resource Center sent out a general update indicating a \u201cslight expected increase\u201d in COVID-19 cases on campus. At the end of August, the university reported less than 40 new cases, according to USC\u2019s COVID-19 notification page. As of Monday, that number has more than doubled to 84 confirmed positive cases. As of Wednesday, reported cases dropped to 20.\n\nL.A. County has been receiving reports of positive cases at increased rates since the beginning of August, a few weeks before students returned to campus.\n\nThe university encourages students who are feeling sick to get tested in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 on campus. Dr. Van Orman wants to decrease the amount of students testing positive.\n\n\u201cWe want to kind of minimize the spread, minimize the number of people that are missing class or staying home sick [and] minimize the risk to people who might be at higher risk because of their underlying health status,\u201d said Van Orman.\n\nUSC recommends students keep up with their health and hygiene to reduce the spread of illness on campus. This includes washing your hands more often, staying home if you are sick and wearing a mask.\n\nAs flu season approaches with positive COVID-19 cases on the rise, Dr. Van Orman is not yet worried about enforcing any mandates.\n\n\u201cWe would follow L.A. Department of Public Health in terms of re-implementing any requirements, such as masking, or, you know, mandatory testing, it\u2019s unlikely either of those things would happen across the board,\u201d said Van Orman.\n```"}

(Photo by Balin Schneider)\n\nBy Sethan Perez, Kaitlyn Kizy, Malcolm Caminero, and Jakob Tatoy\nSeptember 07, 2023 at 12:35 pm PDT\n\nLoud protests have been taking place at the JW Marriott in downtown Los Angeles as hospitality workers continue to strike for fair compensation and working conditions. Some USC students waiting for their off-campus housing to be ready are currently staying at hotels like the JW Marriott and the Moxy, and some said they are having a hard time because of constant noise from protestors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a louder or more intense strike, especially where I\u2019m living,\u201d said USC theater sophomore Olivia Stone. \u201cIt is very disruptive when I\u2019m trying to study or sleep. However, I very much admire how persistent they are, and they really are making it known that they are unhappy.\u201d\n\nBecause of the strike, students said they are also having difficulties getting rides to school as workers block intersections and entrances to the hotel. Sophomore political science major Liana Stoll said it is making the area somewhat unsafe, as protesters are blocking areas near the hotel that people need access to, such as parking facilities.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe in the right to protest, but not when it inconveniences people to a degree where it is unsafe for them to drive their car in and out of the hotel premises,\u201d Stoll said. \u201cI have tried to get to school and have been blocked from turning into the parking area which therefore almost caused me to be T-boned by oncoming traffic.\u201d\n\nWhile some students have been disrupted by the downtown Los Angeles hotel worker strike, strike leaders said the real disruption has been the lack of benefit for those involved in the UNITE HERE movement. UNITE HERE is a workers union that represents a total of 32,000 people in the hospitality and tourism industries across Southern California and Arizona.\n\nMaria Hernandez, an organizer with UNITE HERE Local 11 union, said the workers are striking for \u201cbetter wages, pension contributions and safer working conditions,\u201d as well as a hospitality workforce housing fund. UNITED HERE represents about 15,000 workers, who are currently striking 60 hotels \u201cfor a fair contract,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nThe workers are asking for a $5 hourly wage increase effective immediately. Hotels received $14 billion in federal bailouts during the COVID pandemic, with some facilities cutting jobs and guest services like daily room cleaning. Although 2023 hotel revenues in Los Angeles and Orange County exceeded pre-pandemic levels, hospitality workers said they are still struggling to afford a sufficient place to live as housing costs soar.\n\n\u201cThe companies have really been bargaining in bad faith,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone backwards in their proposal. In reality, all workers are asking for just wages to help people keep up with the rising costs, because many of them are barely hanging on to housing or having to commute two, three hours [to work].\u201d\n\nIn a UNITE HERE Local 11 survey, 53% of workers said that they have moved within the past five years or will move in the future. Hotel workers have even commuted from cities that are hours away, like Apple Valley, Palmdale, California City and Victorville.\n\nSome people outside of the UNITE HERE organization are in support of their aim for more suitable living conditions as well. Amidst the protests, Lionel Messi and the Inter Miami soccer team were set to stay at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel but canceled their stay and stood with striking workers by moving hotels.\n\nWorkers have called for conventions, who are major contributors to revenue in the hotel industry, to join their boycott. The strikes started right before the citywide convention of the American Political Science Association. After APSA leadership denied requests by hospitality workers to cancel the convention, some APSA members decided not to attend.\n\nThe University of California\u2019s largest employee union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Local 3299, and the Service Employees International Union, Local 99, also joined them in this request.\n```"}

And we have to find ways to continue doing that.\u201d\n\nThe USC Shoah Foundation hosted a panel about the protection of Holocaust memory during a time of rising antisemitism. The foundation\u2019s headquarters, located at USC\u2019s Leavey Library, saw a packed house and over 600 registrants for the online livestream. The event was co-sponsored by USC\u2019s Center for the Political Future and moderated by journalist Tami Abdollah.\n\nThe Shoah Foundation was founded 30 years ago by Steven Spielberg and has collected over 50,000 audio-video testimonies from Holocaust survivors. Robert Williams, Finci-Viterbi executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation, said teaching students about the Holocaust in school curriculum isn\u2019t enough. He said the key is teaching the Holocaust as part of a continuum of Jewish life and culture.\n\n\u201cThe [Holocaust] Shoah was a terrible moment in Jewish history, but it was not the only moment in Jewish history,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou need touch points that can be in the university classroom, in museums or in films. But you need to be reminded,\u201d he said during the panel.\n\nJust over 20 states mandate Holocaust education, according to Germain. But, Williams said, a number of these states are teaching the history of Nazi Germany as a replacement for Holocaust education. \u201cIf you\u2019re only teaching the history of Nazi Germany, it doesn\u2019t resonate with people,\u201d Williams said to Annenberg Media. \u201cYou have to make it live in new ways. The old tactics weren\u2019t as effective as they once were.\u201d\n\nEric Pickles, U.K. Special Envoy for Post-Holocaust Issues, said there is an emotional detachment to Holocaust remembrance in younger generations. \u201cWhat we need to do is to ensure that we see these not as six million, but as individuals who could have had a chance,\u201d he said to Annenberg Media.\n\nThe experts said social media platforms can house antisemitic rhetoric such as deep fake distortions and Holocaust denialism. Germain said teaching critical thinking online is important to assess true from false. \u201cIf students don\u2019t know how to think critically about what they\u2019re seeing and assess the sources of information, particularly on the internet and social media, they\u2019re just going to be overwhelmed with deep fakes and information,\u201d she said.\n\nHaving conversations with young people and speaking with new audiences about why people care about Holocaust experiences can build a bridge between communities, Williams said. \u201cI would like to see younger people experiment with ways to present this history. Use our testimonies, find ways to package them so that their cohort becomes interested in the subject. An old guy like me isn\u2019t going to figure out the right solution. But we need to activate people your age and younger,\u201d he said.\n\nPanel hosted by the USC Shoah Foundation, titled \u201cProtecting the Future of Holocaust Memory in an Era of Rising Antisemitism,\u201d on Wednesday in the Leavey Library.

USC Student Health kicked off the flu vaccination outreach program on Tuesday, giving students, staff and faculty easy access to flu shots on campus.\n\n\u201cWe strongly recommend everybody get a flu shot,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Van Orman, USC\u2019s Chief Campus Health Officer. \u201cWe have lots of flu shots available on campus, it\u2019s so easy to get a flu shot. So [we] really encourage everyone to get the flu shot as a way to protect themselves, prevent themselves from getting knocked out for the flu, and also to protect people in their community.\u201d\n\nAlthough influenza is a common infection, many overlook the negative effects the flu can have on your body. Symptoms of the flu may include fever, cough, runny nose, fatigue and headache. Severe cases can require hospitalization. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend everyone six months and older to receive seasonal flu vaccines because of the infection\u2019s changing variants.\n\n\u201cWe get a different variant of the flu and some years it\u2019s only a little bit of a shift, other years it\u2019s a bigger change,\u201d said Dr. Paula Cannon, a professor of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology at USC. \u201cIf it\u2019s very different, the vaccine you got last year or even the bout of flu you might have got last year won\u2019t really protect you against this season\u2019s [flu].\u201d\n\nStudents can either make appointments through MySHR or walk in at the Engemann (UPC) and Eric Cohen (HSC) Student Health Centers, while staff and faculty can walk in at these locations starting from Monday, Sept. 11. All UPC students, no matter the insurance plan, will be eligible for flu shots at no cost on Sept. 20, along with free snacks at Student Health\u2019s Flu Prevention Kick-off Day located at the Farmer\u2019s Market in McCarthy Quad from 11:30 AM to 2:00 PM. The same event will take place for HPC students on September 28th at the Eric Cohen Open House from 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. in Pappas Quad.\n\nThis is not the first time USC has implemented prevention methods against influenza. According to Dr. Van Orman, mandating flu vaccines during the 2021~2022 school year saw great success.\n\n\u201cDuring the 2021-2022 year, we actually required students to get flu shots,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the only year we required it and we actually had almost no flu on campus.\u201d\n\nInterviews with students revealed the reasoning behind USC\u2019s push for flu shot awareness as posters are being hung up around campus. Some students feel very strongly about their annual flu shot.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for me because I get it every year, just because I hate getting the flu. It\u2019s actually the worst. Especially when I\u2019m in school, I don\u2019t like being out of school to be sick. So, when it\u2019s time, I\u2019ll get it,\u201d said Samantha Breen, a freshman majoring in computer science.\n\nFor freshman psychology student Tiare Cabrera, taking the vaccine means being a part of the prevention system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important. I mean, I don\u2019t want to get anyone sick or get sick myself, so I want to try to be a part of that prevention,\u201d said Cabrera.\n\nStudents like Abduowasay Siddiqui, a graduate studying data science, view the responsibilities of being vaccinated as beyond themselves.\n\n\u201cI think [the flu shot] is pretty important for everyone, not only me,\u201d Siddiqui said. \u201cIf I\u2019m getting ill or sick, I might carry on the disease to someone else.

Plaintiff Maya Stewart alleges that during her tenure as an accessories developer in 2021, she suffered retaliation in the form of her hourly pay being reduced from $60 to $50 an hour after she began to complain about meal and rest break violations, in addition to not having been compensated for business-related expenses and working overtime. The plaintiff alleges that her continued complaints eventually led to her termination. Stewart is suing the two corporations in the Los Angeles Superior Court for $1.3 Million in compensatory damages, $2 Million in punitive damages and $500,000 in attorney fees, along with a payment allocated to past and future pay in the amount of $300,000. Stewart claims that the June 2021 invoice she submitted for overtime hours worked has not been paid. Yeezy LLC has yet to comment on the lawsuit, but The Gap has denied any involvement in Stewart\u2019s allegations and directed the blame towards Yeezy founder Ye, formerly known as Kanye West. The Gap seeks to be removed as a defendant from the lawsuit, with Stewart paying their legal fees. The lawsuit comes after the Yeezy-Gap apparel line, which was announced in 2020 to last for a decade, came to an end in September 2022 after Ye terminated the two brands\u2019 agreement citing a breach of contract. Adidas, which recently terminated their nine-year partnership with the Ye in light of numerous anti-Semetic remarks the rapper made last year, is also being sued by shareholders who claim the company failed to properly advise them of the musician\u2019s \u201cproblematic behavior.\u201d\n```"}

On Sept. 1, the California State Assembly amended SB 553, which prohibits non-security workers from being forced to confront robbers in an effort to prevent workplace shootings or assaults. If passed, the new bill is set to go into effect on July 1, 2024.\n\n\u201cWith growing awareness of workplace violence, California needs smarter guidelines to keep workers safe in the office or on the job site,\u201d Senator Dave Cortese said in a statement. \u201cUnder my SB 553, employers would be prohibited from forcing their rank and file, non-security workers to confront active shoplifters, and all retail employees would be trained on how to react to active shoplifting,\u201d Cortese said.\n\nBut the bill has been facing concerns from business owners about the limitation of the stores\u2019 security system against robbers. This comes after a flash-mob burglary that occurred at the Nordstrom store in the Westfield Topanga Shopping Center in August, where a group of about 30 masked robbers flooded the store, overwhelmed staff, and stole $300,000 worth of merchandise. Robberies have increased statewide by almost 10% in 2022, a report from the California Department of Justice shows. According to a report from the Los Angeles Police Department, acts of shoplifting and assaults in Los Angeles have been soaring since 2022.\n\nAnd yet, large retail chains and malls are not the ones that will suffer the most. Small retail stores have seen a spike in reported shoplifting and assaults, according to the LAPD report. Parminder Singh, owner of Lee\u2019s Market & Liquor store, said the bill is especially damaging to local stores. \u201c[The Senate Bill] goes totally against small businesses. I have kids, a family, and mortgages. We work all of our life to build this small business, and we can\u2019t protect ourselves,\u201d Singh said.\n\n\u201cWe need help with the shoplifting,\u201d said Raul Arellano, manager at the ARCO gas station on Hoover St. Arellano said that most of the shoplifters are homeless, and that they pose a physical threat. \u201cI\u2019ve encountered people who want to hit me, they pull a screwdriver or a knife, but I never get close up,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the time, they physically want to attack you. That\u2019s why I try to stay away because I don\u2019t want to get hurt and I don\u2019t want to hurt them either,\u201d Arellano said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna come and I\u2019m gonna kill you, I\u2019m gonna kill your mom, I\u2019m gonna kill your dad,\u201d are just a few of the threats Arellano has received from homeless shoplifters. Ruben Gomez, a customer at the gas station, said that he is starting to get scared, especially at night. \u201cThere has to be security,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cWhen you call the police, they don\u2019t come right away, they come after something\u2019s happened. It\u2019s dangerous. If somebody goes in there and pulls out a gun, I can\u2019t do anything. If I try to do something, they\u2019re gonna shoot me.\u201d\n\nThe amendment of the new bill has received a huge backlash from small business owners across the state, who gathered in Sacramento mid-August to rally against lawmakers. \u201cPeople are totally against it and people are getting together,\u201d Singh said. Singh recently went with a group of store owners to the Pasadena Assembly member Chris Holden\u2019s office to protest, but they received no response. \u201cThen, I went myself to Sacramento for the protest. We were there and nobody came out.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody has to get together,\u201d Singh said. \u201cWe are going to keep protesting, and we are going to keep putting pressure on lawmakers.\u201d \n```"}

On Wednesday morning, President Carol Folt was joined by students, faculty, and staff to celebrate the grand opening of the USC Sustainability Hub in Student Union Suite 101. The campus\u2019 \u201cfirst-ever\u201d sustainability-focused gathering space will serve as a collaborative core and resource center located in the \u201cheart of the USC campus,\u201d said USC\u2019s Senior Vice President for Administration David Wright.\n\nThe Hub will provide students and staff with a space dedicated to cooperating on sustainability-driven solutions and initiatives, while enabling them to seek out further information about sustainability efforts on campus. The Sustainability Hub will also serve as the new home of Assignment: Earth, the university\u2019s \u201csustainability framework for creating a healthy, just and thriving campus and world\u201d created by the USC Presidential Working Group (PWG) on Sustainability in Education, Research, and Operations in collaboration with various teams from across the university.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ambitious, comprehensive, with pillars of education, research, equity and inclusion, operations and engagement,\u201d Wright said.\n\nBuilt with sustainable materials, the Sustainability Hub features Zoom and two-person meeting pods, open collaboration space, a shared kitchen, and a lost-and-found composed of items collected by DPS from around campus which, instead of ending up in landfills, can be taken home by students free of cost.\n\nThe Hub \u2013 USC\u2019s newest accomplishment in navigating climate change, \u201cperhaps the greatest grand challenge of our era\u201d \u2013 will operate as a location for solutions-based events and conversations, uniting those who \u201ccare about creating a sustainable, livable planet where we meet the needs of all people,\u201d Folt said.\n\n\u201cOur Trojan spirit is lifelong, and our people and their impact are worldwide,\u201d Folt said. \u201cAnd right now, our campuses, our cities, our nations, our planet need that power. They need that connectedness and that spirit more than ever before.\u201d\n\nAn early dream for Folt, who previously served as a Dartmouth Professor of Biological Sciences, the space will allow students and staff to \u201cshare a love of the natural world,\u201d while accelerating emerging sustainability solutions across campus and broader Los Angeles, she explained.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re going to see inspired thinking, and it\u2019s going to come out of this beautiful, light, airy campus space,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s coming out of the classrooms, the labs, the studios, the offices in all of our campuses.\u201d\n\nJ.J. Flores, a junior studying International Relations and Urban Sustainable Planning who serves as co-chair of PWG\u2019s Student Committee, hopes the Sustainability Hub will help students find their \u201cspark\u201d to turn \u201capathy\u201d \u2014 the \u201cbiggest climate challenge of today\u201d \u2014 into \u201caudacity to believe that a better alternative is possible.\u201d\n\nFlores, who grew up blocks away from USC\u2019s University Park campus, became interested in advancing sustainability in school settings after seeing water bottle refill stations across USC\u2019s campus as a high schooler. Flores helped implement a series of retrofits that allowed their high school to become a pilot location for green high schools across Los Angeles Unified School District. They are currently working on sustainability efforts including a zero-waste move-out program and reusable food container pilot at Everybody\u2019s Kitchen dining hall.\n\nWith the opening of an inclusive and accessible environment that encourages exploration and collaboration, Flores believes the Sustainability Hub will empower students, staff, and community members to begin cultivating their own innovative solutions.\n\n\u201cThis service was made from the start to try to be an inclusive space, and so I hope it\u2019s proactive in that approach and tries to bring in members of the community and makes it clear that sustainability is a space for everyone,\u201d Flores said.\n\nWith the capacity and resources to create substantive change and a new space designed to inspire future leaders of campus sustainability, Folt said that \u201cat USC, one of the world\u2019s greatest leading research universities, we have the potential and the passion powered...by our beautiful Trojan family to make great advances at speeds we\u2019ve never before considered.\u201d\n\nWhile heatwaves, wildfires, and Southern California\u2019s first tropical storm in 84 years demonstrate the future threats and current realities of climate change, Folt said that the opening of the Sustainability Hub marks \u201can exciting time as well\u201d to promote climate education across the campus community and generate new initiatives to advance the university\u2019s sustainability efforts.\n\n\u201cWhen you know better than anyone else how the problem works, you know better than anyone else how to fix it,\u201d Flores added. \u201cNow, it\u2019s just about being in the room where it happens.\u201d```"}

(AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan\nSeptember 06, 2023 at 2:04 pm PDT\n\nMessi descends on Los Angeles\n\nLionel Messi and the Inter Miami traveling circus arrived in Los Angeles this past weekend to much fanfare and anticipation. Suddenly, a ticket to BMO Stadium for Sunday\u2019s match became the hottest commodity in town as the average ticket went for $695 on the secondary market. The event attracted a truly absurd list of celebrities. Everyone from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to Leonardo DiCaprio (in his classic hat-plus-sunglasses look) to USC\u2019s very own Caleb Williams graced LAFC\u2019s VIP list. Those who wouldn\u2019t grace the luxury suites gathered outside the stadium, where the crowd bubbled with anticipation for Messi\u2019s first MLS match in LA.\n\nLAFC fans Ramon Tarango, 39, and Victor Monroy, 28, both from Inglewood, California, have followed the team for far longer than Messi has played in the U.S. However, even Tarango had to admit that Messi\u2019s visit was a special night. \u201cI like the atmosphere,\u201d Tarango said. \u201cThe bottom line is that the 3252 (LAFC\u2019s supporter section) are going to sing their hearts out... it\u2019s going to be a better atmosphere than when we play against the Galaxy, because you\u2019re playing against the GOAT.\u201d\n\nThey both consider Messi one of their favorites, but their club loyalties came first that night. \u201cWhen I heard about him coming to MLS,\u201d Monroy said, \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, I hope it\u2019s LAFC!\u2019\u201d Even though Messi joined Miami, Monroy at least appreciated that he had the opportunity to see Messi play in his home city. \u201cNow I get to actually see him for once, I don\u2019t have to go all the way to Europe and see my favorite player,\u201d he said. They both wanted to see an LAFC victory and a Messi goal.\n\nCarlos Matamoros, 31, from Valencia, California, only really started following soccer closely during the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but Messi\u2019s performances during that tournament made him a die-hard fan. \u201cI\u2019d known about him,\u201d Matamoros said. \u201cBut seeing him perform that way with what he had, GOAT-ed him in my eyes... I was a soccer fan [before], but that\u2019s my favorite sport now.\u201d His newfound loyalty to the Argentinian wizard convinced him to bite the bullet on tickets. \u201cI was part of that movement,\u201d he said. \u201cI bought this ticket two months ago for $670 bucks.\u201d\n\nBut Matamoros\u2019s Messi fandom pales in comparison to Maximilian Benites, 52. Benites, originally from Peru, tracked Messi\u2019s career since he was a teenager at Barcelona and remained more loyal to the player than any club team. \u201cWhen he was 14, playing in Spain, I knew right there that he was going to become a god,\u201d Benites said. But even Benites didn\u2019t know much about the MLS before Messi\u2019s arrival. \u201cInter Miami, two months ago, was nothing and now everybody\u2019s talking about it.\u201d Benitez had his family of four all decked out in Messi jerseys, of which he owns about 15. The quartet did not yet have tickets to the match, but Benitez was willing to pay up to $1500 to see the seven-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner in person. He was already planning to fly to Miami to see Messi again, but couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to try and see him in Los Angeles. \u201cGod is in town.\u201d\n\nInter Miami stomp on LAFC\n\nUnfortunately for Tarango and Monroy, LAFC did not achieve their dream result. If it wasn\u2019t already, it would be foolish to keep doubting Messi and co. after this match. Their great escape from the bottom of the Eastern Conference continued this weekend with a 3-1 victory over the reigning MLS Cup champions. LAFC suffered from the same affliction in this match that we\u2019ve identified in previous columns: they create enough chances, but their rapid pace of play leaves them too vulnerable at the back.\n\nThe black-and-gold\u2019s inability to control the game\u2019s pace looked even more glaring against Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, for whom dictating the pace is in their Barcelona DNA. All of Miami\u2019s play flowed through Busquets, who completed more passes (50) than almost any other player on the pitch attempted during the match. Then once the ball entered the final third, it was Messi time. According to FotMob\u2019s match stats, the Argentinian forward created three chances for his teammates, tallied 0.65 expected goals himself and finished with two assists.\n\nLAFC took 22 shots of generally decent quality and on another night could have easily won or drawn this match. Denis Bouanga regularly takes five or six shots in a match and usually scores when he reaches that volume, but had an unfortunate night in front of goal. The winger\u2019s failed dink over Miami keeper Drake Callender in the first half stands out as probably his most egregious miss. And until Inter Miami\u2019s Facundo Far\u00edas scored their opening goal, LAFC had dominated the opening exchanges.\n\nCarlos Vela finished the match with an assist for Ryan Hollingshead on a corner kick, but couldn\u2019t match Messi in this game. Despite this, fans still referred to Vela as the \u2018GOAT of MLS,\u2019 outside of BMO Stadium. LAFC have lost consecutive matches a few times previously this season, but their dropped games against Charlotte and Miami have arrived at an unfortunate time. The team travels to Portland for their next match, before playing the Galaxy, St. Louis City and Philadelphia in consecutive matches. The Galaxy are resurgent and will be revved up for El Tr\u00e1fico, while St. Louis City still sit atop the Western Conference and the Union will want revenge for the MLS Cup final. This next series will test LAFC\u2019s mettle and provide the truest window yet into their playoff readiness.\n\nAngel City and the Galaxy keep chugging along\n\nAngel City might just make my playoff prediction look good. At the very least, this team refuses to lose, securing a second consecutive win, this time a 1-0 result against the Kansas City Current. Jasmyne Spencer, who started this match at right back, scored the first goal of her Angel City career to lift her club into eighth place in the NWSL table, just two points out of the final playoff place, currently occupied by the Washington Spirit.\n\nWith that jump in the standings, three of Angel City\u2019s next four opponents sit below them in the table (Chicago, Orlando and Houston). Most importantly, Angel City just does not give up. They didn\u2019t have the upper hand in possession or shots (47% and 15 shots to KC\u2019s 18), but Spencer\u2019s bursts forward in the second half provided her team a boost when they needed it. The forwards have developed better chemistry recently and head coach Becki Tweed\u2019s squad plays a brand of soccer that\u2019s postseason-ready. They look ready to surprise any team.\n\nDown in Carson, the Galaxy drew 0-0 with a fifth-placed Houston Dynamo team, a perfectly respectable result, having beaten the San Jose Earthquakes 3-2 in the Bay in midweek. Riqui Puig continues to be appointment television and the Galaxy\u2019s playoff challenge remains alive for now. Only time will tell.\n\nNext games:\nLAFC: Saturday, September 9 vs. Portland Timbers (away)\nAngel City: Sunday, September 17 vs. Chicago Red Stars (away)\nLA Galaxy: Sunday, September 10 vs. St. Louis City (home)\n\n\u201cSoCal Soccer Spotlight\u201d is a column by Jack Hallinan about the professional soccer landscape in Los Angeles.\n```"}

Beyonc\u00e9's \u201cRenaissance\u201d tour is the latest example, offering the biggest stage yet. Ballroom, a word often associated with high etiquette, is also the name of a queer subculture inspired by Black and Latinx identities. It\u2019s a community where individuals express themselves freely, find acceptance and create their own family: an essence captured and revived on Beyonc\u00e9's album \u201cRenaissance\u201d through house music, and showcased on tour, even in places where LGBTQ+ identities and celebration have been controversial.\n\n\u201cWhen you tour in places that don\u2019t really accept queer people, you\u2019re putting ballroom, house music, and just the culture on blast, not only just for gay culture but gay Black culture especially,\u201d said Dominic Jackson, an avid-concert goer and influencer who runs the popular Beyonc\u00e9 fan account @beybigger on Instagram.\n\nFor those outside the culture, it has given them a window into ballroom and queerness, an experience that\u2019s been very positive for Muna Obiefule, a USC junior in environmental studies. \u201cBlack queerness has always been fun and I\u2019m like, \u2018I want to go to a ball,\u2019\u201d said Obiefule.\n\nKatie Luo, also a junior at USC, said she\u2019s noticed Beyonc\u00e9's world tour changing people\u2019s perception on queer culture in general. \u201c[Ballroom] has been really relevant recently in the sense of popular culture,\u201d said Luo. \u201cBecause of Beyonc\u00e9 and shows like \u2018Pose\u2019 or \u2018Drag [Race]\u2019 and everything, it\u2019s bringing more people in and a lot of them enjoy it.\u201d\n\nLGBTQ+ representation has been a heated political topic, even in Los Angeles, with clashes between parents for and against LGBTQ+ curriculums in schools taking place last month. Anti-LGBTQ+ demonstrators held signs and called out chants decrying queerness itself as evil.\n\nFor Beyonc\u00e9 concert-goer Bryson Gonzalez, the tour has invigorated his belief in ballroom as a way to find love in untraditional places. \u201cShe\u2019s created space for us in a place where we weren\u2019t previously accepted,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cThe fact that she\u2019s acknowledged [the community] so publicly with this tour, I think it says a lot about who she is and where she stands, especially the fact she had an uncle that was a queer pioneer in the ballroom scene.\u201d\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has dedicated \u201cRenaissance\u201d to queer culture and her \u201cUncle Johnny,\u201d a gay relative who was actually the nephew of Beyonc\u00e9's mother Tina Knowles-Lawson. The superstar credited Uncle Johnny for introducing her and her sister to house music and queer culture, which inspired the album.\n\nWith that in mind, Black queer artists have become the soul of the album and the sold-out world tour, which showcased ballroom culture at the front and center. Within ballroom culture and the Beyonc\u00e9 fandom, it\u2019s common to engage in activities like voguing and emoting, and using lingo like \u2018ten, ten, ten across the board\u2019 and \u2018your face card never declines, my god.\u2019\n\nTikTok, alongside other social platforms, has become one of the biggest hives for the subculture, helping it spread to new fans and becoming an avenue for teaching it to friends and family. One of the most recent trends that has been blowing up features Beyonc\u00e9 and ballroom lovers showing others how to unfurl a black fan to make a loud clacking sound to the beat of the song \u201cHeated,\u201d a popular, crowd-pleasing move the superstar has showcased heavily on tour.\n\nIn a time where anti-LGBTQ+ policies are being passed throughout the United States, seeing the beauty and art of ballroom culture on a massive artist\u2019s main stage has been an inspiration to those with queer identities. \u201cIt shines a spotlight on something that has been very intertwined into queer culture and makes it more public,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cIt gives people a reason to research and know the history of what is actually behind a lot of what you see popularized in gay culture nowadays.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s putting a spotlight on us, specifically the ballroom scene, that\u2019s where a lot of trans girls started out,\u201d said Gonzalez. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely impacting the queer community in a big way, in the best way.\u201d\n```"}

While it has just opened its gates this semester, it is already gaining some foot traffic from students looking for peace and nature.\n\nAdams-Ruiz and Phiper told Annenberg Media they were both more than happy to journey out past the Shrine to the Peace Garden.\n\n\u201cI want to make this a weekly thing, like I come back every Tuesday, this is the Peace Garden.\u201d said Adams-Ruiz.\n\nPhiper was also pleasantly surprised by the Peace Garden saying \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more than I thought it would be.\u201d\n\nWhile the USC center for sustainability loves pockets of students coming and going, they aim to get larger student-led groups and organizations to visit the Peace Garden.\n\nMikayla Hisamoto, a fifth year architecture major and intern with USC sustainability, says \u201cwe are planning ahead in the next few months to do more student groups, walkthroughs and more specific events, but recently it\u2019s just been visitors who just see our Instagram and want to come by and help out with maintenance around the garden.\u201d\n\nSome of Hisamoto\u2019s personal goals as an intern for the Peace Garden include spreading the word out on campus about the Peace Garden as well as looking for more collaborative work with groups whether they are on- or off-campus collectives.\n\nWhile Hisamoto keeps the garden functioning, while the garden\u2019s landscape was designed by USC graduate student Daniela Velazco, Master of Landscape Design + Urbanism candidate.\n\nThe garden\u2019s flora and fauna is filled with many California\u2019s native plants, however it also includes some more well known herbs and fruits including, basil, lemongrass, pumpkins and even a still growing tomato plant.\n\nThough the garden\u2019s plants are the main attraction, the USC Peace Garden is more than just a place where students can feel one with nature. The Peace Garden center provides a plant adoption center, where students may take home plants. Students can find the gardening and plant care tips they need on the Peace Gardens Instagram.\n\nFor those who follow the Peace Gardens Instagram, they are looking for two mural entries to add to their scenery. Artists will be provided with up to $300 worth of supplies.\n\nWhile the Peace Garden is new to the USC community, it is already falling under favor with the student body as Adams-Ruiz pointed out \u201cit\u2019s so sweet and nice... it\u2019s just great.\u201d\n\nThe Peace Garden is open on Mondays and Wednesdays from 3-6 p.m., as well as from noon to 1 p.m. on Wednesday, and Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5-6 p.m. and is ready for more involvement with the student body.\n```"}

(Photo by Alex Lam)\n\nBy Rebecca Speier and Lana Diab\nSeptember 05, 2023 at 11:03 pm PDT\n\nHas Blackboard earned a failing grade? Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Andrew T. Guzman recently announced in a statement on Aug. 3 that USC will be switching its primary learning system from Blackboard to a new learning management system, Brightspace. Students and teachers alike have complaints about Blackboard\u2019s functions, ranging from its design to the potential of inhibiting teachers\u2019 creative process. Provost Guzman stated that the decision came after intensive review of other applications and platforms that offer online classroom services. However, the final decision of switching to Brightspace was due to the \u201cuser-friendly design, robust accessibility standards and customer support offerings.\u201d\n\nThe transition from Blackboard to the Brightside will be conducted in two phases by the Learning Management Assessment Committee: Phase 1 that will begin in Summer 2024, and Phase 2 that will transition in Fall 2024.\n\nUSC Journalism Professor Alan Mittelstaedt has experienced steady issues with Blackboard throughout his teaching career. \u201c[Blackboard] puts me in the wrong frame of mind when I open it up. OK. I feel like I\u2019m walking into a corporate meeting run by doll people...Rather than engaging with the most creative minds of a journalism school,\u201d Professor Mittelstaedt said.\n\nOne of Professor Mittelstaedt\u2019s concerns with Blackboard is the predetermined grading system that is based on each class\u2019s individual percentage formula. \u201cMaybe it would be more beneficial for something less subjective than journalism, like the mathematics department or something like that...for some really by the book, by the rules and by formula,\u201d he noted. \u201cBut for me, it just sends the wrong tone to students.\u201d\n\nMittelstaedt and other faculty are not alone in their complaints about Blackboard\u2019s issues. USC students have also raised concerns about Blackboard\u2019s system, having posted a petition calling on USC to switch to a different online classroom service. The petition garnered 109 student signatures out of the original 200 goal.\n\nCarrie Zhu, a sophomore studying public relations and business, says she especially struggled with Blackboard during her first year at USC and that it led to some effect on her grades. \u201cI was really having trouble figuring Blackboard out,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cAnd then also like because nobody actually teaches you or, like tells you, where to figure [Blackboard] out, it\u2019s more just like you go explore yourself. So yeah, for the first couple of weeks it was kind of struggling a bit.\u201d\n\nZhu has hope that the switch to Brightspace will not be as difficult to navigate, in comparison to her experience learning to use Blackboard. \u201c...cause Blackboard is kind of the worst homework system for me. So yeah, I would hope, I would say, that as long as not as bad as [Blackboard], [Brightside] should be easier to figure it out and all.\u201d\n\nPast USC students have also turned to popular social media sites, such as Reddit, to post their concerns with the current Blackboard service. Reddit user \u201claracatalina\u201d shared a post three years ago stating \u201cI can\u2019t believe USC still uses blackboard.\u201d The post accumulated 125 likes and 24 comments as other students agreed and shared their own grievances with the website. One person under the username \u201crosh7887\u2032\u2032 even wrote \u201cCan we start a petition ... BlackBoard looks ARCHAIC and barely works.\u201d\n\nSome students are less excited to transition to Brightspace and leave Blackboard behind. Rami Kabbani, a junior studying mechanical engineering, has no issues with Blackboard, but is not necessarily looking forward to relearning a new system. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a problem using [Blackboard] in the past,\u201d Kabbani said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit annoying to relearn a new system, but I don\u2019t think it will be too bad as long as it does not have too many flaws and as long as the change is worth it.\u201d\n\nStudents are awaiting for the 2024 transition to what will hopefully be a smoother online management space, that allows both faculty and students to have an easier online learning experience.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/09/05/the-big-ten-breakdown-vol-ii-an-ode-to-the-pac-12/", "response": "```\nThe Big Ten Breakdown, Vol. II is a column by Terence Holton about the new look of college football. The Pac-12 is a shell of its former self. \u201cThe Conference of Champions,\u201d as Bill Walton calls it, is a dry, destitute wasteland of what it used to be. With Stanford and Cal leaving the Pac-12 for the ACC, it is safe to say the conference which I have loved so dearly is no more. As a diehard Duck fan my entire childhood, I grew up with the electric duo of Marcus Mariota and De\u2019Anthony Thomas lighting up opposing defenses. Those two are what turned me and so many others into Duck fans. Then, of course, I came to USC, where I witnessed quarterback Caleb Williams win the Heisman in my freshman year. I think I just attract Heisman winners wherever I go. The Pac-12 has molded my emotions from the months of August through December for as long as I can remember. All the way back in 2014, I got off an airplane and immediately started crying as I saw Oregon was losing to Oregon State in their yearly rivalry game. I then made my entire family stay back at an airport bar, so I could watch the Ducks come back and win. More recently, I hold much disdain for Utah senior quarterback Cam Rising and the entirety of the Ute nation after they knocked both Oregon AND USC out of playoff contention in dominant fashion two years in a row. These core memories of the Pac-12 shaped my childhood and teenage years. As of September 5, 2023, all but Oregon State and Washington State have opted to join other conferences. Personally, I will miss playing against the Beavers and Cougars, and I hope that they are invited to join the Big Ten; however, that seems unlikely. If I have to watch Oregon State and Washington State slug it out on a Saturday night against the likes of Hawaii or UNLV, I\u2019ll just feel bad for the people of Corvallis and Pullman. Just know that this season, both the Beavers and Cougars will play with a massive chip on their shoulder and will want to prove they deserve to be in a power conference. One thing I will miss from the Pac-12 will always be \u201cPac-12 after dark.\u201d A favorite memory of my senior year of high school was driving down to Eugene with my friends for a 7:30 p.m. game, then driving home on I-5 at 1 a.m. While it sounds grueling, it was awesome. Night games are always more fun. In Southern California, where the sun is beating down on you for nearly all of a 3:30 p.m. game, a night game is literally \u2014 and figuratively \u2014 much cooler. Of course, there are upsides to the Pac-12 no longer being media relevant. For starters, the dreaded Pac-12 Network, which made it nearly impossible for fans to watch their team and had lackluster commentary (in my humble opinion). Secondly, the Pac-12 was one of the greatest examples of mismanagement you will ever see. Commissioners Larry Scott and George Kliavkoff botched this conference so badly. You can blame USC and UCLA all you want for running for the money, but Kliavkoff is the reason there is no feasible amount of money that the Trojans and Bruins would stay for. The horrific marketing for this incredibly talented conference is what ultimately sunk the ship. Forcing games to be on the Pac-12 Network, instead of ESPN, CBS, etc., is terrible for finances and conference exposure. While I do blame Kliavkoff and the management of the Pac-12 for its ultimate demise, I will miss the conference. Saturday, Sept. 9, will be the last time USC and Stanford clash for the foreseeable future. I wish there was a profitable way the Pac-12 could all stay together, but it seems rather impossible at this point. The good news for us fans is that this is the best football the Pac-12 has seen in years, arguably since the early 2000s. I can\u2019t wait to watch one last great year of college football in the Conference of Champions.\n```"}

The sandwich shop \u2014 which in the past has offered a plethora of grab and go options and an array of self-checkout counters \u2014 has experienced a total makeover, leaving many students wondering why.\n\nThe self-checkout is gone, replaced with a cashier stand. There are less grab and go options, more made-to-order products, and certain menu items can now only be bought using the mobile app. According to USC Hospitality, the \u201cmodernization\u201d is based on feedback from customers and sales data. However, students have other theories.\n\nWhen asked what he thought spurred the changes, Rhian Jones, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, had a simple response: \u201cProbably because people were stealing.\u201d He isn\u2019t the only one. \u201cI think people did steal,\u201d said Maddie Abiera, a senior in film production. Other students, like Jack Eggert, a senior business major, said that social media may have played a role in the alleged pattern of thievery. \u201cI never saw [stealing], but I heard about it on Sidechat all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d always see people talking about how they\u2019d steal from Seeds.\u201d\n\nUSC Hospitality gave no response after being asked if theft played a role in the layout change. Instead, they said the changes were intended to \u201cimprove the overall speed of getting everyone through the line faster.\u201d But students\u2019 experiences so far have been less efficient. Abiera said that the new Seeds checkout system is making it extremely busy and is \u201coverwhelming\u201d for students trying to grab a meal before class. The new cashier system has created a bottleneck \u2014 traffic within Seeds has been moving slower, creating long lines and even longer waiting times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insanely crowded,\u201d Abiera said. \u201cI was too overwhelmed to figure it out. It\u2019s making me more inclined to not go there at all.\u201d The layout isn\u2019t the only change this semester. Seeds has also increased its prices, a decision that many students are frustrated with. Abiera said that chicken tenders, a popular student favorite, are now being sold by the piece. Tara Moreno-Goodwin, a senior student studying public relations said that \u201ccustom salads are like $18 now when they used to be $13. But yeah, everything\u2019s gone up.\u201d\n\nThis leaves many students, like Moreno-Goodwin, to take their Dining Dollars to more budget-friendly options at alternative campus restaurants. Student\u2019s have also criticized the new menu\u2019s lack of variety. USC Hospitality said that they kept \u201cfan favorites\u201d while adding even more choices. \u201cI was trying to see what options they had, they didn\u2019t have a ton of stuff I wanted,\u201d said Freshman psychology major Lily Morse. \u201cI\u2019m a vegetarian and saw they have a lot of chicken stuff, and I was like it\u2019s not for me.\u201d Grayson Salomon, a sophomore journalism major added \u201cIt looks more empty in there [...], it looks like everything got smaller, there\u2019s less stuff.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, students new to USC are more optimistic about the Seeds experience. Malina Freeman, a computer science major said, \u201cI really like [Seeds]. I\u2019ve only gotten the Salmon Teriyaki bowl. I thought [the process] was really smooth. I just ordered online through the app.\u201d Only time will tell how these changes will affect Seeds\u2019 popularity in the long term. Despite the criticisms gathered, there are still plenty of students inside dealing with the traffic and paying up the extra money for their meals.\n```"}

This labor dispute, which influences a wide array of actors, screenwriters, showrunners and various industry stakeholders, also significantly impacts current USC students as they try to establish themselves in the already highly competitive industry.\n\nIn the lead-up to the joint strike orchestrated by the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) and Writers Guild of America (WGA), workers claimed that major players within the realms of television, film and other media enterprises have been exploiting the talents and visionaries within their ranks.\n\nPatric Verrone, a Writer\u2019s Guild Negotiating Committee member and a former president of WGA, said the strike comes at a critical point in American history. \u201cWhat this strike is about is the future of this industry because there hasn\u2019t been enough unity amongst the unions over multiple generations,\u201d Verrone said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of issues building up that have been affecting all of us. The companies that are the employers have been unified and able to negotiate together for many, many years. We have not.\u201d\n\nWhile many artists are currently abstaining from active participation in the field, studios continue to extend job offers during the strike in order to maintain production. Individuals who accept such positions amidst the strike are labeled as \u201cscabs.\u201d\n\n\u201cA \u2018scab\u2019 is somebody who takes work... for a company where that work is being stopped by the people who do it under a union contract,\u201d Verrone said. \u201cAnybody who\u2019s a student at USC who wants to be in the Writers Guild or the Screen Actors Guild and who takes the kind of work that we are otherwise withholding would be considered a scab.\u201d\n\nBeing branded a scab can carry dire consequences for anyone seeking a foothold in the entertainment industry with aspirations of joining either the SAG or WGA unions.\n\nEaston Foster, a senior majoring in film and television production, expressed concern regarding scabbing as he works toward his final year at USC. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about scabbing, actually,\u201d Foster said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a scab at all. I am in full support of these strikes, and I think that everyone should be. I don\u2019t want to be in support of people who are trying to ruin what I define as art.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that expected profits for the year would be about $300 million to $500 million lower than expected mainly because of the strikes. Video game companies may also be roped into the strike pending a vote later this month.\n\nMany aspiring industry professionals are haunted by the erasure of the industry\u2019s artistry that is being overshadowed by its commercial imperatives. Shubhra Dubey, a senior film production major, said the impact of this struggle extends beyond just business considerations and threatens to give rise to artificial intelligence that would be used to produce art.\n\n\u201cThis fear of AI replacing real screenwriters... it\u2019s people preferring to go a cheaper way or a more lucrative way rather than paying screenwriters a fair wage and getting good stories out of that,\u201d Dubey said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just kind of this... capitalist agenda that prioritizes making money rather than making good art.\u201d\n```"}

Students settle in for their Zoom meeting and utilize this collaborative space. Welcome to USC\u2019s new Sustainability Hub. The Hub is a new space that welcomes collaboration and innovation towards sustainable solutions. The grand opening will be at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, September 6. It is located in Student Union, Suite 101, where the USC Pharmacy was previously.\n\nOutside of a space for cooperation, the Hub also intends to be a resource center where students can find out more about sustainability in general and on campus. The Hub will include battery recycling and a shelf where students can take unclaimed DPS lost and found items, like sunglasses. Additionally, the space will be available for meetings and events.\n\nOne of the current goals of the Hub is to grow with students and accommodate their future needs. Inside is what USC\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer Mick Dalrymple calls a \u201chybrid-hoteling office space of the future.\u201d There are pods for Zoom and two person meetings, open space with different sized tables and even a shared kitchen.\n\nBefore the grand opening, the Hub already saw 30 to 40 students a day, according to Dalrymple. The Hub was built with sustainable materials and finished with sustainable furniture to lower its carbon footprint. These include photo wall coverings that are made of biodegradable ink and Steelcase i2i Collaborative lounge chairs made from 99% recycled materials.\n\nIn the future, similar features will be considered for new construction projects on campus, but the needs and uses of each building will determine which principles are used, said Associate Director of Sustainability, Facilities Planning and Management Zelinda Welch. Currently, the same team from the Sustainability Hub is working on the fourth floor of the Student Union and using similar sustainable concepts, said Dalrymple.\n\nThis Hub is designed to include lots of plants, utilize its large windows and natural light, showcase images of nature (primarily California scenery), and is even equipped with a bird chirping noise machine. These are all aspects of biophilic design, which \u201csupport humans in a connection and love of nature,\u201d said Dalrymple.\n\nAccording to the 2023 USC Sustainability Survey results, which included USC student, faculty and staff respondents, over 75% of people claimed to have a \u201cmoderate or strong interest\u201d in finding out more about sustainability. However, less than half stated that they knew of any sustainability initiatives and 38% showed interest in USC \u201csustainability efforts or groups\u201d but were not part of any.\n\nThe Hub aims to bridge this gap for students of all disciplines. Currently, the Hub is displaying student artwork from Roski School of Art Design and the Arts & Climate Collective on rotation. In the future, the space intends to host professor presentations and \u201cbrown bag\u201d lunch events that will be open to the public.\n\nThe intent is to \u201cbuild those partnerships you never thought would exist,\u201d said Welch. The Hub\u2019s opening coincides with Green Week, a series of events which aim to engage the USC community in being more environmentally conscious. Both Green Week and the Hub are part of USC\u2019s conceptual sustainability initiative, Assignment: Earth. The plan is for Hub to become the \u201csymbolic and physical home for Assignment: Earth,\u201d said Dalrymple. \u201cThis is about interdisciplinary working together towards solutions.\u201d\n\nThe space welcomes all students interested in sustainable solutions. The USC Sustainability Hub\u2019s hours will be 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\n\nBy Mark Armendariz-Gonzales\nSeptember 04, 2023 at 2:52 pm PDT\n\nSunday evening, all the stars of Los Angeles seemed to be gathered in the same exact place, BMO Stadium. Everyone from Oscar award-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio to Prince Harry were in attendance for the hottest ticket in town. In a crowd filled with Hollywood A-listers, the biggest star of them all just happened to be on the pitch. LA\u2019s elite, all gathered to watch the little magician that is Lionel Messi, and to see if they could witness some of his Messi magic.\n\nIn his first trip to LA since joining the league, Messi and Miami would face off against reigning MLS champions LAFC. Captained by Mexican forward Carlos Vela, LAFC are currently sitting pretty in third place of the Western Conference, while Miami are still fighting for a spot in the East. Although comfortable at the moment, LAFC came into the match off a 2-1 away defeat to Charlotte FC. Miami struggled as well, as they faced their first scoreless game in the Messi era against Nashville SC.\n\nAfter facing disappointing results, both sides came into Sunday\u2019s match with their own motive for winning. Miami\u2019s to show that they can compete with the best that the league has to offer and LAFC\u2019s to prove that they are still the best team in the MLS.\n\nLAFC had an opportunity early in the game, when in the 11th minute, forward Denis Bouanga took a shot within the box, only for Miami goalkeeper Drake Callender to make a beautiful save. This would be Callender\u2019s first of five saves on the night. Miami answered back to this close call just minutes later when Argentinian midfielder Facundo Far\u00edas made a sliding shot into goal, giving his team the first score of the night. This marked the first goal for Far\u00edas since joining the club in July of the present year.\n\nLAFC had a chance to tie the game in the 17th minute, when Bouanga once again had a golden opportunity in front of goal, only to shoot the ball wide of the net. LAFC outnumbered Miami when it came to shots, having 13 more shots and a total of six on target. As hard as LAFC fought, luck clearly was not on their side, as the ball did everything in its power not go in.\n\nHowever, some of this bad luck did rub off on Miami. In the 38th minute, Messi received a clean pass in the box from Paraguayan midfielder Diego G\u00f3mez. Dancing around the box, he looked as if he was about to brew another batch of his Messi magic. Messi pulled back his magnificent left foot and took the shot, to which LAFC goalkeeper John McCarthy deflected it with his hand. This save was massive as it kept Miami from going up two before the half. Sadly for the fans though, this shot was Messi\u2019s best scoring opportunity for the entire match.\n\nAlthough he missed his chance to score, Messi provided assists for Miami\u2019s next two goals. The first in the 51st minute, when the Barcelona trio of midfielder Sergio Busquets, defender Jordi Alba, and Messi found each other in sync, resulting in an Alba goal. Messi then gave a generous pass to his new favorite partner Ecuadorian forward Leonardo Campana in the 83rd minute, putting Miami up 3-0.\n\nDefender Ryan Hollingshead finally put LAFC on the board in the 90th minute, when he scored a header off a Vela corner, but by then the damage was done and there was no path to victory for the reigning MLS champs. As quickly as they had arrived in LA, Messi and Miami made it known that they are the best team in the league and a force to be dealt with. They completely outplayed and outclassed an LAFC side that currently looks like a shadow of its title winning self.\n\nMiami reached a club-record unbeaten 11 matches, all starting with the arrival of Messi to the club. Inter Miami will continue their quest to reach the playoffs on Saturday as they will play Sporting KC at home at 4:30 P.M.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson\nSeptember 02, 2023 at 8:57 pm PDT\n\nIt only took USC four plays from scrimmage to score a touchdown, a drive indicative of the rest of the game as the Trojans (2-0, 0-0) beat the Nevada Wolf Pack (0-1, 0-0) 66-14. The USC offense, with 668 yards from scrimmage, outgained Nevada by 308 yards. USC, who scored 56 points last week against San Jose State, had not scored 50 or more points in back-to-back games to open a season since 2015.\n\nFreshman wide receiver Zachariah Branch opened up the scoring for USC, hauling in a 22-yard touchdown pass to give USC a lead less than three minutes into the game. Branch was one of three Trojan freshmen to score in the game.\n\n\u201cI thought our young players in particular, really, you could tell this one wasn\u2019t their first game,\u201d head coach Lincoln Riley said. \u201cThe eyes weren\u2019t quite as big at the end and you saw some guys really settle in there and make plays.\u201d\n\nNevada quickly responded to Branch\u2019s score with a four play touchdown drive of its own, highlighted by a 73-yard catch from redshirt senior wide receiver Spencer Curtis, to tie the game up at seven apiece.\n\nUSC regained the lead for good on its third drive as redshirt junior running back MarShawn Lloyd scampered into the endzone after a 24-yard run to put his team up 14-7. Lloyd had 34 all-purpose yards on the drive for USC, as he ended up leading the Trojans in all-purpose yards with 135.\n\n\u201cPatience, that\u2019s my main thing,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cJust patience and being able to just take coaching, being able to be put in the right positions. Coming into this game, just being in the moment, not worrying about anybody else, focusing on nothing on the outside.\u201d\n\nThe Trojan defense tightened up after the first Nevada score, forcing three consecutive punts and allowing only four total yards across those drives. After giving up 85 yards on Nevada\u2019s first offensive series, USC only allowed 96 yards for the rest of the first half.\n\nUSC spent much of the afternoon in the Wolf Pack backfield, recording five sacks \u2014 one each from redshirt senior rush ends Jamil Muhammad and Solomon Byrd, freshman rush end Braylan Shelby, redshirt senior defensive lineman De\u2019Jon Benton and redshirt senior inside linebacker Shane Lee \u2014 and five additional tackles for loss.\n\n\u201cI think [the defensive linemen] are really explosive man,\u201d junior safety Jaylin Smith said. \u201cThey move around, they get to the quarterback super fast.\u201d\n\nShelby accentuated the defensive performance by forcing a fumble on his sack, which redshirt senior defensive lineman Stanley Ta\u2019ufo\u2019ou recovered and ran into the endzone to complete the scoop-and-score.\n\n\u201cWhen big people score, football is more fun,\u201d Riley said.\n\nAfter allowing San Jose State\u2019s quarterback, junior Chevan Cordeiro, to rush for 80 yards last week, the Trojans held Nevada\u2019s starting signal-caller, redshirt sophomore Brendon Lewis, to -15 rushing yards. Prior to this game, the mobile Lewis had five career games with 30 or more rushing yards dating to his time at Colorado.\n\n\u201cWe were just more consistent with our techniques and just being more disciplined,\u201d Byrd said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we did anything outside of ourselves ... It was being very mindful of it. We just figured it out.\u201d\n\nFor USC, junior quarterback Caleb Williams came out firing as he completed his first five pass attempts en route to finishing the game 18-for-24 for 319 yards and five touchdowns. Williams\u2019 stats might have been even more impressive, but he came out of the game in the third quarter as USC had a 35-point lead.\n\nThe reigning Heisman winner threw his five scores to four different Trojans, showcasing USC\u2019s receiving depth. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Miller Moss, who replaced Williams, threw a touchdown of his own. Wide receivers senior Brenden Rice, redshirt senior Tahj Washington, freshman Duce Robinson and junior Michael Jackson III joined Branch as touchdown pass-catchers for the Trojans. Washington caught two of the scores, as he led USC in receiving yards for the second week in a row. Dating to last season, Washington has led the Trojans in that stat in three of USC\u2019s last four games.\n\n\u201cThere are so many things that you don\u2019t see that [Washington] does,\u201d Moss said. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise to see that he shines in the way he does. Dude never complains, never whines about not getting the ball. Always does his job at a super, super high level.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans look to continue their strong start to the season when they start Pac-12 play against Stanford next Saturday at the Coliseum, with kickoff set for 7:30 p.m.\n```"}

At the USC Marshall School of Business, many pre-professional business-oriented organizations tend to be exclusive, and sometimes, even completing the recruitment process can still end without a membership offer.\n\nDebra Erdenemandakh, founder of Avenues Consulting Group, intends to combat the unrelenting nature of USC\u2019s elite registered student organizations. \u201cAvenues Consulting is basically a pre-professional emphasis on the consulting industry... We focus on industries like pre-law, pre-med, education and the arts,\u201d said Erdenemandakh\n\nIn order to foster an open and inclusive professional consulting environment, Erdenemandakh and her peers decided to create Avenues as a pre-professional consulting club open to all majors, including those outside of the business school. \u201cWe are a pro-bono consulting group looking to serve pre-professional, non-traditional industries with consulting and project-based means,\u201d said Erdenemandakh, who is majoring in intelligence and cyber operations. \u201cWe cater to students who are looking to break into consulting but are from non-business majors such as pre-med, pre-law, education and sciences that may otherwise not receive the opportunity to explore the many different avenues to participate in the industry,\u201d she continued.\n\nIn terms of the future, the group is finalizing their clients and projects, as well as looking to recruit their first-ever cohort this fall. \u201cIn order to alleviate that stress, that kind of opportunity gap, we decided to found Avenues consulting because we really want to make sure that all majors, all industries have the ability to create these awesome projects for our clients,\u201d finished Erdenemandakh.\n\nThe recruitment schedule for Avenues consists of the following: The applications are now open. The second info session will take place on September 5 at 7 p.m. at KAP 158. The application closes at 11:59 p.m. on September 9. There are three steps within the recruitment timeline: interview one, a mixer, and interview two. \u201c[The industry] is very competitive,\u201d finished Erdenemandakh.\n\nErdenemandakh and her team aim to create a more inclusive, open and welcoming environment for those across all majors at USC who have interest in consulting, and their upcoming recruitment cycle seeks to bring in a diverse group of passionate consulting minds. \u201cWe definitely have a unique spin compared to the traditional consulting clubs,\u201d said Delane Ly, vice president of Avenues. \u201cI hope everyone from any major is able to find a place here.\u201d\n\nTo stay updated on Avenues, you can follow @USCavenues on Instagram or reach out to uscavenues@gmail.com.\n```"}

(Photo by Matthew Calma of Annenberg Media)\n\nBy Matthew Calma August 31, 2023 at 2:29 pm PDT\n\nThe \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d Bill in Florida is only the beginning of the backlash against the queer community. The legislation was signed into law in March 2022 by Governor Ron DeSantis. The bill states that \u201cclassroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\u201d It bans LGBTQ+ teachers from disclosing their queer identity to their students in any capacity.\n\nDana Goldstein, of the New York Times, reports that \u201cThe language is vague and subject to interpretation. The preamble of the bill further muddles matters. It prohibits not only \u2018instruction\u2019 around gender identity and sexual orientation, but also \u2018classroom discussion\u2019 of these topics.\u201d\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, over 124 anti-LGBTQ bills have been proposed in State Legislatures across the country, with one of the most historically parallel coming from Tennessee. The bill passed in Tennessee states that an \u201cadult cabaret performance,\u201d considered a performance in a location that features topless dancers, go-go dancers, exotic dancers, strippers, male or female impersonators who provide entertainment that appeals to prurient interest, or similar entertainers...\u201d, is illegal.\n\nThe bill was amended to include, \u201cit is an offense for a person to engage in an adult cabaret performance: On public property, or in a location where the adult cabaret performance could be viewed by a person who is not an adult.\u201d\n\nErin Reed, an activist and independent journalist, argued that the Tennessee Senate Bill 3, similar to the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill in Florida, has vague language that does not create specific definitions and is done so purposefully. For example, the legislation\u2019s language puts trans people and drag queens into the same category. It states that it impacts \u201cmale or female impersonators.\u201d\n\nThe bill also bans performance that appeals to a \u201cprurient interest\u201d which is not defined in the legislation. Anyone who is charged with violating this law can be convicted of a felony. Effectively, under this policy, people such as RuPaul, a famous drag queen who hosts RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, and Kim Petras, a trans music artist, would not be allowed to perform in the state of Tennessee.\n\nDue to the vague language of the bill, it has been argued by opponents, such as Erin Reed, that this could effectively be a ban on trans people in the state of Tennessee.\n\nThe core prohibition of the Tennessee bill mirrors pre-Stonewall laws that policed queerness based on clothing. Leading up to the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York, the city used unrelated laws as a means of regulating the queer community. This became known as the \u201cthree-piece rule,\u201d and while it was never officially written anywhere in legislation, the code condemned anyone who wore three or more articles of clothing that did not match their gender assigned at birth.\n\nPolice utilized masquerade laws, which outlawed people from having their \u201cfaces painted, discolored, covered, or concealed, or be otherwise disguised, while in a road or public highway,\u201d as a means to arrest and jail queer people.\n\nLong before the Stonewall Riots of 1969, queer people used clothing as a means of self-preservation. In the 40s, 50s, and 60s, gay men would wear specific accessories to communicate their existence with other gay men. Suede shoes, a change in how a pocket square in a suit was placed, and even a pinkie ring, were subtle ways that only those in the know would understand.\n\nAfter constant abuse by the NYPD made queer existence nearly impossible without the threat of violence, pent-up rage by the LGBTQ community exploded into the Stonewall Riots. The Stonewall Riots were the catalyst of change and dramatically altered how the queer community was treated by police.\n\nAfter the threat of arrest for the choice of clothing was legally dismantled, queer expression exploded. More than 50 years later, fashion, for the queer community, has become a core part of expression that was so long bottled up and forced to be hidden.\n\nDr. Madison Moore, an artist-scholar, DJ, and assistant professor of Critical Studies in the Roski School of Art and Design, argues that \u201cYou have to make choices about what you are going to wear because we have to wear clothing. You don\u2019t get to opt out of the fashion system.\u201d\n\nJack Reid, a journalism student at USC Annenberg who identifies as gay, treats the clothing he wears as a relationship with himself. \u201cIt\u2019s like a little armor. There\u2019s power in the way I can choose to present myself to other people. I dress with what I think is flattering on my body. It has to do with my relationship with gender.\u201d\n\nNate Morgan, a Game Design major at USC, expresses a similar sentiment about self-expression. \u201cGrowing up I never thought about what I wore. Never saw it as an expression. Towards the end of high school, I dipped my toe into fashion as a method of self-expression and how I can be perceived. It really helped with my confidence. When I go to a queer event, I change the way that I dress. I just went to a ball. I would never wear that on a normal day. It made me feel really good. I was putting myself in a queer space so I was comfortable. I wore my fur coat, with my corset, nothing under the corset, a pair of bell bottom skinny jeans with six-inch pumps\u201d Nate laughingly said while dressed in a baby blue blazer and pants.\n\nBut what makes these outfits queer? Is it the items themselves that Jack and Nate pick out? Or is it because they are the ones wearing them? Moore says, \u201cIt is not the objects. They have no meaning on their own until you put it on, then they have meaning.\u201d\n\nWhen a guy puts on a dress it becomes queer because queerness is a \u2018failure of masculinity.\u2019 In really big scare quotes.\u201d\n\nQueer fashion has much to do with one\u2019s relationship to gender. When queer people leave the confines of the \u201cnorms\u201d (of men presenting themselves as traditionally masculine and women presenting themselves as traditionally feminine), and gender is no longer constrained to these binaries, we have queer fashion.\n\nSelf-expression is one of the main ways that the queer community has forced themselves into a world that has long tried to push them out. \u201cWhen you wear clothing in a way that is artful or expressive, you are not just expressing an inner core. It\u2019s about taking up space and seizing space because the world chooses not to see you.\u201d\n\nAccording to Moore, \u201cthe choice of clothing by queer individuals is all about intention\u201d.\n\nArturo, a recent USC graduate, who identifies as bisexual expresses \u201cYou already have the world against you. There are stereotypes of the queer community. Clothing is a way of taking control of that narrative. Creating your own story.\u201d\n\nArturo has grown to dress outside of \u201csociety\u2019s attachment of gender to clothing\u201d, and now participates in clothing that is considered both masculine and feminine.\n\nMuch of how we express ourselves in the world, as a materialistic way of interaction, are the things that we wear on the daily. \u201cFashion is part of the queer experience in terms of self-expression and how you portray yourself to the world,\u201d Arturo says, adjusting the sleeve of his button-down shirt that he got from the women\u2019s section.\n\nQueer fashion also takes shape within the binary that exists. However, for many people not in the know, some fashion might not be seen as queer.\n\nAriana, a USC student pursuing their Masters in Specialized Journalism, identifies as a \u201chigh-fem\u201d, a queer person who presents themselves in a way that could stereotypically fit into traditionalism and the male gaze. But high-fem is done with intention.\n\nAriana points to her large hoop earrings with her long bright red fingernails, a style of queer expression that she describes as \u201cextra feminine\u201d. \u201cImma wear the all pink outfit and not be dumb. Imma school you. It\u2019s an f you to the patriarchy,\u201d Ariana says. \u201cIt\u2019s inherently political. I can do all these high femme things and do all the big boy things.\u201d\n\nIn the workplace, Ariana explains \u201cI have been criticized for getting dressed up for work. Doing too much or being too extra can be seen as competing. The criticism was coming from straight women to my understanding.\u201d\n\nBut with her queer coworkers, it\u2019s a form of communication. \u201cFrom queer coworkers, I get praise and compliments. I see you. You can just see and identify other queer people. It\u2019s an acknowledgment and a matter of respect from other queer people.\u201d\n\nAren, a USC student studying international relations who uses they/them pronouns and identifies as lesbian, thinks about the queer gaze. \u201cI think \u2018Does this look gay enough\u2019 because clothes are your signaling. I fit into the acceptable range of non-binary queer fashion. When I talk to queer people they aren\u2019t surprised based on the way that I dress.\u201d\n\nAren states, \u201cWhen I\u2019m picking the clothes to buy, it\u2019s a little bit different. It feels queer; it feels affirming. If it\u2019s in my wardrobe, it\u2019s sufficiently gay.\u201d\n\nQueer fashion operates for the individual. The relationship that the person has with the clothing that they wear is a unique story, but collectively their identity is being part of a larger community that is not seen as normative.\n\nMonica, a journalism student at USC who identifies as a trans woman, has loved fashion since she was a child. Clothing, and style, have been an interest as an art form for Monica since she was young. \u201cI have looked up to fashion icons and designers. I found a sense of beauty within that world. I\u2019m interested in being a designer to some extent. I view it more as an art piece and its beauty and creative identity. I don\u2019t view it in a materialistic way. I don\u2019t care about the brand as long as it looks pretty and it looks like it\u2019s good quality.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mom used to dress me up and I just ran with it. When we would watch Project Runway, I would get categories and design my own interpretation of it\u201d, Monica reminisced in her conversation, \u201cIf I was a girl I would wear this,\u201d Monica expressed. \u201cThere was kind of a disconnect with fashion prior to my transition. Because of my queerness, I was able to explore. That pushed me outside of the binary.\u201d\n\nMonica\u2019s relationship with clothing continues to stand upon her view of fashion as an art form. \u201cI aspire to be the cute little next-door bimbo girl.\u201d\n\nIn looking at queer fashion as part of the larger mainstream fashion world, Monica believes \u201cQueer fashion is more about breaking away from the gender norms that are placed upon you. The Queer community has been living in a world where they\u2019ve had to assimilate, accept and blend into the fashion world. I think Queer people who are experimenting with gender and breaking the gender binary are joining the fashion world as a whole, and it\u2019s taking the fashion world in a new direction.\u201d\n\nMonica\u2019s sentiments are quite similar to those expressed by Professor Moore in his experience in the queer club scene, where he encourages people to have a bottom-up perspective, rather than top-down. \u201cQueer ideas are at the center, not the margins. Innovations in culture come from the marginalized. Everything interesting happening is at the club. It\u2019s in Bushwick. Those people forecasting trends and at Vogue are at the club. They\u2019re seeing what\u2019s on the up and up.\u201d\n\nBut funnily enough, Moore believes the mainstream will be too late, \u201cThose ideas always start in queer communities. By the time they [Vogue] catch on, we\u2019ll have moved onto something else already.\u201d\n\nMoore is more interested in \u201cwhy people would rather stand out than do the easier thing of fitting in. You know it\u2019s risky. You\u2019ll get catcalled, you\u2019re extra, you\u2019re doing too much. But you do it anyway. There is something so potent and powerful that you would rather absorb the negative criticism.\u201d\n\nLooking forward in queer fashion, Moore says, \u201cOne trend I see is alien, space age, rave. Shaved eyebrows, colored brows, hyperpop. It\u2019s all about challenging norms. And what is more challenging to norms than shaving your eyebrows off?\u201d\n```"}

No; It\u2019s day 121 of the Writers\u2019 Guild Strike, and the category is Dungeons and Dragons. A D&D themed special picket reinforced solidarity between the WGA/SAG-AFTRA Guilds amidst the ongoing industry strike. By Jason Goode, Aditya Thiyag and Jen Byers August 30, 2023 at 9:31 pm PDT\n\nA crowd of wizards, bards, druids and elves gather outside of NBC Universal. They are thirsty \u2014 for provisions, loot... and blood. A red-haired Dungeon Master (DM) looks over a die. He turns to the crowd, grinning. \u201cD20!\u201d The crowd breaks into joy, clamoring their weapons, signs and fists in the air. The DM recounts the party\u2019s next move as the crowd quiets down. \u201cThe rogue in your party surges forward, thrusting his magical short sword in the air. We see the damage that the CEO of NBC Universal is about to take!\u201d The crowd screams: vindication.\n\nA crowd of D&D players battle against the dragons that are the CEO of NBC Universal and the whole of AMPTP. Brennan Lee Mulligan, the DM, begins to narrate the rest of the battle. He\u2019s goading on hundreds of writers, actors and supporters\u2014 players of the ongoing, high-stakes, industry quest: the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike. Brennan Lee Mulligan, host of the popular D&D role-playing show Dimension 20 on Dropout TV, calls for each of the fantasy classes to roll a dexterity saving throw.\n\nToday, at NBC Universal, it\u2019s D&D on the picket line. A strike supporter wearing a Dungeon & Dragons shirt with a red dragon on the picket line. A supporter in elf cosplay stands amid the crowd of Dungeons & Dragons players. Konstantine Anthony, the Mayor of Burbank, is in the crowd, too. He\u2019s dressed like a Roman gladiator. Like Spartacus before him, Anthony sees the value of strength in numbers as a technique to fight the common enemy.\n\nMayor Konstantine Anthony is speaking to the crowd, supporting the strike and boosting spirits. \u201cAt 16 years old, I learned the best way to win a campaign,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cThe best way to win a campaign is to join a guild!\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing today against corporate America is that small, disparate groups of working class citizens are having to band together,\u201d said Anthony, who is also a member of SAG-AFTRA. \u201cAnd it is exactly mirrored in the quests and campaigns that we\u2019ve seen in Dungeons and Dragons... because what we write about in our art, in our media and in our gaming is true to life.\u201d\n\nKirk Damato, a writer dressed like a wizard, continued the metaphor. \u201cI think [this strike] would be called a campaign, which is a long-running collection of adventures, like a season of television. We\u2019re in an extended campaign. I think of this a lot like a siege. We are literally at the studios, where you can hear the horns honking and people cheering in the background, people with the signs trying to get the message across both to the public, and to any executive who might be able to hear it.\u201d\n\nDamato in his wizard robe and hat was drawn to the NBC Universal picket specifically for the theme day and to support others. \u201cThis is the first special picket that's brought me out into the valley, just because I live by a gate that I normally picket at. Yeah, just a lot of love for role playing games. I thought it'd be fun and interesting and I really wanted to support some of my friends who were personally involved in this,\u201d Damato said.\n\nEric Zaman, a pre-WGA writer, dresses up as a Bard for the occasion. \u201cI have gone to many other pickets since the WGA strike started, both themed and non-themed,\u201d Zaman said. \u201cAdmittedly, this is an outfit I wear more for Ren Faire than Dungeons and Dragons.\u201d\n\nOn the Universal line, strikers have faced both hardship and difficult terrain. Universal was voted \u201cthe worst picket\u201d according to strikers, due to extensive construction and road work debris; \u201ctreegate,\u201d when the studio illegally cut down tree branches that provided shade for the picket line; intense parking enforcement; and the presence of a heat-intensive flamethrower at a nearby construction site. In spite of these obstacles, the movement\u2019s momentum has continued to grow.\n\nJust this week, Disney\u2019s visual effects workers publicly filed to unionize with IATSE, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents many behind-the-scenes entertainment workers. Beyond the entertainment industry, this summer, UPS teamsters and airline pilots negotiated significant raises; Los Angeles city workers hosted a day-long strike in August; hotel workers have been on strike since July; and efforts to unionize within companies Starbucks and Delta are ongoing.\n\nMembers of the WGA, SAG-AFTRA and supporters walk the picket line. \u201cIt is spreading. It seems like it\u2019s catching,\u201d Damato says. \u201cWe are leveling up. I mean, look at this party. It\u2019s grown...We\u2019re building a bigger community, which is amazing.\u201d\n\nTheme days, like Wednesday\u2019s Dungeons and Dragons demonstration, have been a key strategy in keeping morale high on the WGA/SAG-AFTRA picket lines. Examples of past theme days include: \u201cBridgerton,\u201d \u201cFamily Guy,\u201d \u201cThe OC,\u201d Late Night writers, Black filmmakers, LGBTQ+ writers and even introvert-only morning pickets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost track of all my costumes,\u201d says Montserrat Luna-Ballantyne, a WGA writer. \u201cI\u2019ve done Taylor Swift, I\u2019ve done Britney Spears\u2019s \u2018Toxic\u2019 flight attendant suit and Megan\u2019s dress, from the horror movie \u2018Megan\u2019. Today, I\u2019m a D20 dice.\u201d Luna-Ballantyne (left) wears her D20 outfit to the picket line.\n\nWriters, actors and supporters have had the opportunity to come together, analyze difficult aspects of their careers and find similarities in their plights at the picket lines. This has resulted in increased solidarity and an ongoing determination to win fair wages and workers\u2019 rights. \u201cThe working class has much solidarity [because] we\u2019re just scraping by, and we\u2019re all in this together. That\u2019s the only way we can get through this.\u201d Luna-Ballantyne explains. \u201cThe struggles you\u2019re seeing in this industry are seen in other industries across the board.\u201d\n\nStrikers continue to see this fight as a boon of what\u2019s to come for the American labor movement \u2014 they largely believe that their win (or loss) will set a public precedent. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen how the AMPTP is willing to put money towards a [crisis PR firm],\u201d said Rachel SJ, a SAG-eligible actor. \u201cBut, they don\u2019t want to give us a fair contract. Because if they give one union a fair contract, it sets a standard for everybody else.\u201d\n\nIn order to maintain the long-term nature of the strike, picket days during the summer heat waves have been cut to just 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. Initially, when the strike began in May, pickets ended around 5 p.m. \u201cIt\u2019s turned into more of a day-to-day occupation. We come in, we strike, we picket. We do our work and go home. It\u2019s almost a job for us,\u201d said Cheech Manohar, a member of SAG and WGA.\n\nAlong with entertaining theme days, picket lines provide sunscreen, hydration and snacks. Strike captains encourage people to take breaks in order to avoid heat stroke. Many strikers consider this effort \u201ca marathon, not a sprint.\u201d\n\nDaniel Berg (left), a Writer, Director and DM, stands with Nicole Peurifoy (right) a SAG member and WGA support staff. Being able to strike together when they have time after her husband, Berg, picked up a non-industry job during the strike is important to them both. \u201cI do feel like the times that we can get away to strike together, we do,\u201d Peurifoy said.\n\nIn order to survive the financial hardship of being without work, strikers have been supported by the Entertainment Community Fund and the Green Envelope Grocery fund, both of which accept donations. A number of businesses, bars, churches and community groups have also offered mutual aid distributions, specifically for industry workers. Special pickets and rallies are open to the public. For more information, the list of future special pickets is available on the WGA website.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan August 30, 2023 at 9:17 am PDT\n\nAngel City impress against the Reign\n\nToday\u2019s column will be one of apologies. Two, to be exact. My first apology is to you, the reader. What for, you may ask? For waffling. As recently as last week\u2019s column, I couldn\u2019t decide what I thought of Angel City FC and their playoff chances. But now I\u2019ve made up my mind. Angel City will make the playoffs. They\u2019ll even win a playoff game, too.\n\nOn Sunday, I had the pleasure of taking in Angel City\u2019s 2-1 victory over the OL Reign in person on a sunny evening at BMO Stadium. That night, I saw a team that played resilient football, working in coordination on defense and using their rare opportunities with the ball to play it forward quickly and create shots.\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned many times before how head coach Becki Tweed has steadied the ship results-wise, but now that all her players have returned from the World Cup and have only the NWSL to worry about, their path to playoff contention looks clear.\n\nThe Reign had 59.6% possession and it felt like more, especially in the second half, when Megan Rapinoe had taken the field and provided the Reign with a creative outlet. The Seattle-based team cycled the ball out to Rapinoe on the left wing often, hoping she could unlock the Angel City defense. But Angel City\u2019s back line never wavered.\n\nEven as Rapinoe sent in cross after cross (she finished the match with 10!), the ACFC center back duo of Megan Reid and Sarah Gorden kept their composure and didn\u2019t allow any Reign players to have a straightforward shooting opportunity. Goalkeeper DiDi Hara\u010di\u0107 offered her usual aggressive, claiming crosses and set piece deliveries with minimal fuss.\n\nEven the penalty Angel City conceded wasn\u2019t cause for structural concern. The defense was set and every Angel City player properly positioned themselves to make a tackle, but winger Scarlett Camberos found herself in unfamiliar territory and mistimed her challenge. On another day, ACFC would\u2019ve kept a clean sheet against a perennial playoff team.\n\nEven in the first half, Angel City pressed cohesively and in a measured fashion. The pink-and-black\u2019s forward line tried to win the ball back quickly after a turnover, but if the initial harassing didn\u2019t work, they sat in front of the Reign\u2019s midfield to block passing lanes. It left the Reign centerbacks Alana Cook and Sam Hiatt with so few options that their midfielders Quinn and Emily Sonnett routinely had to drop in line with their defense just to receive the ball.\n\nTweed underscored the importance of their press in her post-game press conference. \u201cWe never want to just sit in,\u201d she said. \u201cOur game identity relies on getting pressure on the ball.\u201d\n\nIn attack, Angel City used the few breaks they had well. Even as a midfielder, Madison Hammond isn\u2019t known for her superior passing ability, but she picked out Camberos with a beautiful ball over the top to completely expose the Reign\u2019s transition defense. Camberos picked out striker Clarisse Le Bihan with a low cross across the box, who put Angel City up 1-0 and scored her first NWSL goal of the season.\n\nLike a true underdog, ACFC also used set piece chaos to their advantage. In the 57th minute, Le Bihan delivered a free kick about 35 yards from goal right to the edge of the six yard box, finding Hammond wide open to volley the ball home.\n\nI write all this to show how Angel City is already playing playoff soccer. They press together, but not over-eagerly. The back line limits mistakes and plays smartly with the ball. The attack has speed in transition and takes advantage of set pieces. These attributes are how teams beat supposedly more talented opposition, which, make no mistake, the Reign definitely were.\n\nFour U.S. women\u2019s national team squad members from the 2023 World Cup started for the Reign, plus two Canadian regulars and Megan Rapinoe, who played the entire second half. Compare that to just two World Cup squad starters for Angel City.\n\nWith five matches remaining, Angel City only has to play one playoff team (by the current standings). They have a solid away record, too, having lost only two NWSL matches on the road this season (especially considering how the team started the season). The team sits three points out of sixth place, just one win away. It\u2019ll take multiple good results to stay there, but Angel City fans can be as optimistic as they\u2019ve been all season.\n\nSidenote: It was cool (and simultaneously depressing) to see the two teams come together and take a pre-match photo holding a \u201cContigo Jenni\u201d banner. For those who are unaware, in the immediate aftermath of Spain\u2019s World Cup victory, the president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Luis Rubiales, kissed midfielder Jenni Hermoso without consent. His behavior would be unacceptable behind closed doors as well, but cameras witnessed the incident during Spain\u2019s award ceremony, leading to immediate and fierce calls for Rubiales to resign as RFEF president.\n\nEven as pressure has mounted against him, Rubiales has refused to vacate his position, despite having received a 90-day suspension from FIFA. The NWSL\u2019s clubs and players do a great job of coming together to show support in these moments, but Rubiales\u2019 actions serve as an unfortunate reminder that world soccer can improve in its treatment of women and the women\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cThere is still growth that needs to happen in federations, not only here, but also overseas,\u201d Reign midfielder Olivia Van Der Jagt said after the match. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a reminder that we have to never stop fighting.\u201d\n\nSidenote 2: Caleb Williams was in attendance at BMO Stadium on Sunday as well, coming off of the Trojans\u2019 56-28 win against San Jose State on Saturday. It was a fun worlds-colliding moment for Los Angeles and added to a star-studded audience that included Jennifer Garner, Eva Longoria, Hayley Kiyoko and Jane Fonda.\n\nLAFC rush and drag\n\nJust because LAFC have a playoff cushion doesn\u2019t mean they can take it easy. On the road in North Carolina, LAFC dropped Saturday\u2019s game 2-1, with new striker Mario Gonz\u00e1lez scoring the black-and-gold\u2019s lone goal.\n\nLAFC were plagued by the same problem I wrote about at the end of July. The team never struggles to create chances, but their transitional style leaves games wide open and their defense exposed. Even with seemingly superior talent and a well-established coach in Steve Cherundolo, LAFC prefer not to belabor their opponent with possession.\n\nAgainst Charlotte, they only had 35% of the ball, according to FotMob. They want to play the ball into Denis Bouanga as quickly as possible and allow him to take shots (he had four in this match, plus a goal disallowed for offsides), but their preference for fast play sometimes means their shot quality suffers.\n\nFor example, in the 56th minute, midfielder Timothy Tillman received the ball on the turn in midfield and immediately fired on goal from about 30 yards. As Charlotte goalkeeper Kristijan Kahlina stopped the ball with relative ease, I can imagine LAFC fans groaning in despair. What was the point of shooting from there? Bouanga was in a position to make a run off the centerback and Carlos Vela was wide open on the left wing.\n\nI might be overreacting to one sequence, but Tillman\u2019s decision emphasizes that LAFC are trained to chase shot volume over shot quality. Sometimes the gambit pays off, like the Colorado Rapids on Aug. 23, when they scored four goals against the Western Conference\u2019s worst team. But when you have enough talent to beat any team in the MLS, it seems like a bit of extra patience would make LAFC even more threatening.\n\nApologies to Billy Sharp\n\nNow, for the second of two apologies. In a desperate attempt to make the playoffs (or maybe just save face), the Galaxy made a series of free agent signings and transfers that I doubted would have any real effect on their season. Maya Yoshida, Diego Fagundez and Michael Barrios are not exactly a trio that strikes fear into their enemies\u2019 hearts.\n\nOn August 15, to cap off the spending spree, Tom Bogert reported that the Galaxy had also signed Billy Sharp, the Sheffield United cult hero who scored 249 league goals from League Two to the Premier League. Sharp played about 19 years in England, an impressive feat for someone who once donned an undershirt with the words \u201cfat lad from Sheffield,\u201d but I can\u2019t say I was impressed with the move.\n\nSharp had tailed off in the 2022-23 season, contributing 0.18 goals and assists per 90 minutes played. So I tweeted (X-ed?) this:\n\nthis is hilarious and also not good for the Galaxy https://t.co/nO9dkb2LkO \u2014 Jack Hallinan (@jackhallinan17) August 15, 2023\n\nWhelp, I guess I\u2019m already wrong. Sorry, Billy Sharp. It took Sharp just 22 minutes off the bench in his first appearance to score for the Galaxy. In a 3-0 victory against the Chicago Fire, Sharp sealed the win with a 90th-minute penalty to open his Galaxy account, also tallying a shot on target during his cameo.\n\nMaybe the fat lad from Sheffield has the veteran nous the Galaxy have needed up front all season. I hope he continues to make me look silly. Also, Riqui Puig continues to cook. With the notable exception of Lionel Messi, he might be the best player in the league right now. A ticket to Dignity Health Sports Park is worth it just to see the Spanish maestro in person.\n\nNext games:\n\nLAFC: Sunday, September 3 vs. Inter Miami (home) \u2014 IT\u2019S MESSI TIME!!!\n\nAngel City: Friday, September 1 vs. Kansas City Current (away)\n\nLA Galaxy: Wednesday, August 30 vs. San Jose Earthquake (away)\n\n\u201cSoCal Soccer Spotlight\u201d is a column by Jack Hallinan about the professional soccer landscape in Los Angeles.\n```"}

From wardrobe to choreography to stage presence, Danna Paola is the Princess of Latin Pop.\n\nDanna Paola Rivera Mungu\u00eda, more popularly known as Danna Paola, is a Mexican actress, singer, songwriter, and performer who gained prominence from a young age through her work in Mexican television. Her career took off when she starred in the popular children\u2019s telenovela \u201cAmy, La Ni\u00f1a de la Mochila Azul\u201d at the age of eight. Her talent and charm led her to feature in several successful telenovelas and television series, solidifying her status as a child star in Mexico. Over the years, she transitioned to more mature roles, such in \u201cAtr\u00e9vete a So\u00f1ar,\u201d where she portrayed Patito, a timid \u201cugly duckling\u201d lead who encounters teenage drama at a performing arts school, and later as Lu in Netflix\u2019s hit show \u201c\u00c9lite,\u201d who we all know and love.\n\nPaola decided to leave the acting world to pursue her music career more seriously in 2020. It was then that her following albums and singles attracted significant attention, developing from her child-star image into a mature and contemporary musician with a new sound. Danna Paola\u2019s music encompasses genres such as pop rock, R&B, and Latin pop. At 28 years of age, her powerful vocals and songwriting abilities have resonated with a wide audience from childhood into adulthood. Notable songs include \u201cMala Fama,\u201d \u201cSodio,\u201d and \u201cOye Pablo,\u201d which showcased her ability to combine catchy tunes with meaningful storytelling. With her current grunge pop singles like \u201cXT4S1S\u201d, \u201c1Trago\u201d, and more recently, \u201cTenemos que hablar,\u201d leading her growth among American audiences.\n\nEarlier this year, Danna Paola embarked on the \u201cXT4S1S Tour,\u201d kicking off only in Mexico\u2013 where her fanbase is most prominent. During this tour, Danna Paola has been able to perform around the United States\u2013 making it her first USA tour \u2013 tackling California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Arizona, to name a few, in addition to a Canadian show in Toronto.\n\nUna noche loca indeed. Danna Paola knew how to put on a show. From wardrobe to choreography to stage presence, Danna Paola was present and radiant\u2013 a true pop sensation. Taking place at the YouTube theater, the XT4S1S tour showcased not only Danna Paola\u2019s position as a vocal powerhouse but also her ability to connect with her audience on a deeply personal level. As an audience member, I felt the radiant energy of her music, charisma, and, of course, seductive style.\n\nAt the heart of the concert was Danna Paola\u2019s musical brilliance. She effortlessly navigates between various musical genres, showcasing her range. The concert featured a mix of her recent hit singles, fan favorites anthems, and even a surprise guest on stage, Sofia Reyes, with whom she performs \u201ctqum.\u201d The tour setlist makes sure also to include iconic songs such as 2009\u2032s El Primer Dia Sin Ti, which Danna Paola performs with a Pride flag, in support of her loyal LGBTQIA+ fans.\n\nDanna Paola\u2019s performance spanned a spectrum of emotions, resonating with diverse audience members.\n\nWhat truly set the concert apart was Danna Paola\u2019s ability to establish a connection with her fans. Through candid conversations with the audience, she revealed her authentic self, sharing stories that resonated with many of us. Danna Paola\u2019s genuine gratitude and humility were honest, creating a sense of unity that transcended the boundaries between artist and audience. Her concert is a shining example of the profound impact that live music can have on individuals and communities, solidifying Danna Paola\u2019s legacy as a captivating performer and a true artist. The title of Latin Pop-Princess is rightfully hers.\n```"}

He was also a fierce debater in his own right.\n\nMcBride started debating at Westbury High School in his home state of Texas and continued as an undergraduate at the University of Texas, where he received a first-round-at-large bid to the National Debate Tournament three years in a row, winning multiple tournaments and several top-five speaker awards.\n\nThe Trojan Debate Squad shared a message on Facebook on Sunday writing that their \u201chearts are broken\u201d over the loss of their \u201ccoach, mentor and friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrian was unlike anyone else. He was funny, quirky, sarcastic, incredibly smart and so kind. Regardless of when it happened, you didn\u2019t forget that you spent time with Brian,\u201d the post continued. \u201cHe left a big impression on each of us. So many Trojans benefitted from his genius and his kindness. We are so fortunate to have been able to know Brian and so deeply saddened.\u201d\n\nMany of McBride\u2019s students recalled fond memories from their time working with him, from his quick wit to his compassionate guidance.\n\n\u201cHe led weekly practices, took us to tournaments, drove the rental car, brought us to restaurants (often Thai) and made us laugh \u2018til we cried along the way while he recollected his own debate war stories,\u201d said Beau Larson, a member of the Trojan Debate Squad from 2014 through 2018. \u201cHe taught me so much about argumentation but most importantly, life and how to live it. The impact of his coaching and mentorship on my life cannot be understated.\u201d\n\nLarson and their debate partner Aron Berger worked closely with McBride and his guidance shaped the duo into a top-ten team at the National Debate Tournament.\n\n\u201cHe was, first and foremost, a really creative person and he released some really great music, but it also came through with respect to his coaching and intellectual work,\u201d said Berger, member of the Trojan Debate Squad from 2014 through 2018. \u201cHe was always really deep in thought about everything about everyone, which showed he had great consideration for the people he was around.\u201d\n\nAvi Munoz, who was a member of the Trojan Debate Squad from 2009 through 2013, said that the opportunity to work with McBride is what led him to apply to USC in the first place.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d be who I am or where I\u2019m at today without the influences I got from Brian\u2014both in debate and in general,\u201d Munoz said.\n\nIn a 2008 interview with L.A. Weekly, McBride spoke of his role at USC and the perseverance of his students, saying \u201cthe amount of research a college debater does is the amount one would do to write a PhD.\u201d\n\nBeyond his role as an influential coach, McBride was a well-respected ambient musician and one-half of the music duo Stars of the Lid. McBride and bandmate Adam Wiltzie formed the duo in 1993 and incorporated multiple instruments like guitars, piano, strings, horns and untraditional everyday sounds into their music.\n\n\u201cI loved this guy & he will be missed,\u201d Wiltzie wrote in a social media tribute to McBride.\n\nMcBride also released solo albums and collaborated with the musician Kenneth James Gibson through their formation of the band Bell Gardens.\n\nEven those who worked with McBride through debate admired his creativity and talent, especially his longtime Trojan Debate Squad colleague Gordon Stables, who called McBride \u201can artist whose brilliance took so many forms.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just keep coming back to the simple observation that he loved to teach debate,\u201d said Stables, who is also the director of the school of journalism at USC Annenberg. \u201cAs I talk to so many alumni who recall the way in which Brian meant so much to them, I realize he truly found a way to understand each of them. When he coached someone, the topic might have been a debate argument, but he was truly helping that person find themselves. I consider myself so lucky to have been able to spend so much time with him.\u201d\n```"}

Photo by Angelina Hicks.\n\nBy Angelina Hicks\nAugust 29, 2023 at 2:38 pm PDT\n\nLos Angeles city animal shelters are still overcrowded under recent leadership changes, and the city\u2019s six shelters are on track to kill about 40% more animals this year than last year. But now there\u2019s a new general manager ready to address these issues that activists have been calling out over the past year.\n\nStaycee Dains, the new general manager appointed in June, has admitted that there\u2019s a lot of work to be done. She spent her first month in the role touring each of the six city shelters and asking staff and volunteers what they would need to succeed and improve.\n\nAt an animal services commissioners meeting earlier this summer, Dains addressed the board, saying that overcrowding and understaffing are two major issues in the shelter system that need to be addressed immediately.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely true our shelters are overcrowded,\u201d Dains said at the July 25 meeting. \u201cWe have dogs housed in pop-up kennels in every area of the shelter. I was just at Harbor Shelter yesterday afternoon, and as you walk up to Harbor, there\u2019s sort of this large aviary and it has dogs in it, which is not an appropriate setting to house dogs.\u201d\n\nBefore the pandemic, the shelters used to take in around 50,000 animals each year. That number dropped sharply during 2020 when the shelter closed due to the pandemic. In 2021, the six shelters\u2019 total intake was around 28,500. Last year, it reached approximately 33,500. Although total intake has been increasing each year since the pandemic, current intake is still lower than before the pandemic started.\n\nLocal shelter volunteers like Michelle Cornelius have been calling out overcrowding and euthanasia issues over the past few years.\n\n\u201cWhile intakes are down, we\u2019re more overcrowded than we\u2019ve ever been,\u201d said Cornelius, who has been volunteering at the West Valley shelter since 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s so baffling because the intakes are lower.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the shelter system is also on track to euthanize more animals this year than last year. When comparing the first seven months of this year and last year, the combined euthanasia rate for cats, dogs and kittens has increased by 37% while the intake has increased by 9%. Intake for kittens has increased by 2% during the same time period, but euthanasia has increased by 56%.\n\n\u201cThe summer is always known as kitten season,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a lot of kittens. Everybody tells me that every year feels worse than the last one... The euthanasia rate [for kittens] is definitely much much higher.\u201d\n\nEuthanasia rates for cats and dogs have also increased during the same period: the rate for cats has increased by 28% and 19% for dogs.\n\nThere have been months of criticism regarding the city animal shelters\u2019 treatment of animals within its care. Recently, local officials have called for an overhaul of the shelter system to improve shelter practices, including regular walks for all dogs, better handling of sick animals to decrease euthanasia and a better mediation process for volunteers.\n\n\u201cThis one dog that was just red-listed hadn\u2019t been out of her kennel in 29 days,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cThere can still be a high number of dogs who are getting out of the kennel maybe once a week.\u201d\n\nDains has expressed an interest in addressing these issues and improving shelter practices.\n\n\u201cWe just really need to rethink this whole system of talking with one another about which animals need rescue,\u201d Dains said at the meeting.\n\nCornelius said it\u2019s still too early to tell how the new manager will affect the state of the shelters.\n\n\u201cI will give her credit from the meeting,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cI think she did a very good job of informing the board on certain issues.\u201d\n\nDains was appointed by Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and was previously the director of animal services in the city of Long Beach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to visit with all of the shelters,\u201d Dains said. \u201cAnd all of the feedback and my experience of everybody working for animal services is that they are an incredibly committed group of people who are willing to do a lot with very little to try to make things work.\u201d\n```"}

Former President Donald Trump surrendered to authorities at the Fulton County Jail on 13 felony charges of attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. Trump was booked, fingerprinted and photographed at the Atlanta jail on Thursday evening. He was released on a $200,000 bond, set by a Georgia judge. Trump\u2019s bond amount was the highest of all defendants, with Trump\u2019s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani trailing in second place at $150,000. Trump and 18 other named co-defendants were indicted on a total 41 felony charges on August 14. Trump is connected to over a dozen of the felony charges, including racketeering, false statements and conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, according to the indictment. Some of the other major names indicted in the Georgia case include Giuliani, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. The court is also limiting his social media use, a rule set to keep Trump from intimidating witnesses or other defendants in the case, according to Axios. All 19 co-defendants surrendered to Fulton County Jail by the 12 p.m. deadline set by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.

Eight presidential candidates faced off for the first 2024 Republican primary debate in Milwaukee on Wednesday. A live audience of about 4,000 people gathered in the Fiserv Forum as the candidates attempted to win over support from the swing state.

(Photo by Cl\u00e9mence Feniou of Annenberg Media)\n\nL.A. Mayor Karen Bass agrees to give LAPD recruits more money Mayor Karen Bass agreed to hike starting pay for officers by 13%, while also promising four year-to-year raises of 3% to the base wage of each officer. This comes with improved benefits for officers\u2019 health insurance by increasing subsidies by 5%. The agreement, made with the Los Angeles Police Protective League union, is tentative for four years, meaning that these added benefits expire in 2027. Bass acted amid a hiring and retention \u201ccrisis\u201d in the LAPD, where 1,000 officers have quit over the past four years. The mayor argued that officers are leaving the LAPD to be better compensated at other police departments and in response, the city must become more competitive. In total, the new contract with the police union would increase the LAPD budget by $400 million annually by 2027. Activists argue the budget is already big enough at $1.1 billion \u2014 the city\u2019s largest expense. City Controller Kenneth Mejia said the \u201cgenerous\u201d police union contracts are already crowding out other city expenditures, and increasing the budget will only continue to strain other public services. The opposition argues that increases in pay will not add to the ranks of the police. Instead, they believe the reason the LAPD is in a \u201chiring and retention crisis\u201d is because of an image issue for officers in the LAPD. The L.A. City Council voted 12 to 3 on Aug. 23 with progressives Eunisses Hernandez, Hugo Soto-Martinez and Nithya Raman objecting to the LAPD budget increase.\n\nRussian mercenary chief Prigozhin dead in plane crash. Yevgeny Prigozhin, chief of The Wagner Group, was confirmed dead by Russian authorities on Sunday.

On board the aircraft were six other passengers, including the mercenary group\u2019s first commander Dmitri Utkin, and three crew members. The Russian Investigative Committee did not state the cause of the crash, yet a U.S. preliminary intelligence assessment cites an intentional explosion as the likely cause, according to the New York Times. The Kremlin denies having any involvement in the fatal crash. Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned Prigozhin for an armed rebellion on June 23 to 24 that posed a threat against the Kremlin. But, Prigozhin was promised to not be prosecuted for what he deemed an act of \u201ctreason.\u201d Prigozhin, who was allied with Vladimir Putin, founded The Wagner Group in 2014 where it first fought alongside Russian troops for the annexation of Crimea. The group is a private military organization, but it operates as a mercenary group with tens of thousands of fighters aiding Russian forces in Ukraine, according to ABC News. The Wagner Group had also previously operated in Africa and the Middle East.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Kindred Space LA)\n\nBy Alexandra Goldberg and Monique Davis\n\nAugust 29, 2023 at 8:54 am PDT\n\nBlack women are dying at almost three times the rate of white women during or after pregnancy. Researchers say there\u2019s work to be done to combat this crisis\u2014 within medical institutions, but also in American culture at large.\n\nThe maternal mortality rate for Black women was 2.6 times the rate of white women in 2021, according to data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. Data recorded since 2018 shows the crisis is worsening each year, as Black women continue to face the brunt of medical disparities.\n\nPregnancy-related deaths for Black women rose 26% from 2020 to 2021, with women 40 and older affected the most. Maternal mortality is defined by the World Health Organization as death while pregnant or within 42 days of the end of pregnancy.\n\nTyan Parker Dominguez, teaching professor in the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work at USC, said the high Black maternal mortality rates are a consequence of long-standing racial disparities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not novel in the sense that there\u2019s a disparity, it\u2019s just another health outcome that not surprisingly shows this persistent, disproportionate burden of ill health on the African American community,\u201d she said.\n\nLos Angeles County: A microcosm\n\nLos Angeles County is widely representative of the national maternal death data. Black women have a tripled risk of maternal mortality in LA County, according to a California Department of Public Health long-term analysis.\n\nIn February, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved a motion by county Supervisor Holly J. Mitchell to begin creating a doula hub to increase access to a diverse network of doula service providers. Doula care services aid in decreasing the rates of preterm and cesarean births, postpartum depression symptoms, and the need for medical pain control during labor, according to the motion.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Medi-Cal doula care benefit authorizes all pregnant women to receive prenatal and postpartum care. According to the County of Los Angeles Public Health, there were over 96,000 births within LA County, and 41% of those births were covered under Medi-Cal.\n\nAlthough building a doula hub would support thousands of births each year, finding funds to sustain the services of doulas is still an obstacle. Assistant Health Deputy Jessica Jew from Mitchell\u2019s office said that doulas would be paid about $1,000 less than their usual income to provide their services under the Medi-Cal program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable nor affordable for someone to make a living if they are being chronically underpaid,\u201d Jew said. \u201cOne of the issues we are wrestling with is how grant-funded initiatives are a big disparity in terms of what doulas could command in Medi-Cal reimbursements.\u201d\n\nJew said that a staff analyst position is also needed to coordinate the activities of the hub and serve as a point of contact for managed care. Doula advocates are needed for Black women who experience traumatic, life-changing situations due to systemic racism and biased health care systems, she said.\n\n\u201cHaving a doula who understands and has seen this several times before can help to raise issues and teach you the vocabulary of what to say and how to advocate for yourself,\u201d Jew said. \u201cIn some cases they can be that front-line person who can go between and navigate the health care system either with you or on behalf of you.\u201d\n\nWhat are the fatal factors?\n\nWithin the medical system, Black women are impacted by both access to care and the quality of care.\n\n\u201cIn our society, we\u2019ve highly medicalized pregnancy,\u201d USC Professor Dominguez said. \u201cAnd our medical system is not a universal system. So, we certainly have disparities in access to care because of how our system is set up.\u201d\n\nDominguez noted that access to prenatal care, especially within the first trimester of pregnancy, is core to identifying and monitoring pre-existing health conditions which can create adverse birth effects. Black women are more likely to have pre-existing health conditions going into a pregnancy, which may put them at higher risk during the pregnancy, Dominguez said.\n\nCardiovascular health concerns like higher blood pressure might not be known to the patient before their pregnancy, but can result in adverse outcomes. Socioeconomic disparities rooted in American cultural biases can inhibit access to monitoring these conditions.\n\nBut, despite an expecting mother\u2019s access to private medical insurance, Black women are receiving an overall lower quality of prenatal care, Dominguez said. Less routine interventions, less information and more stereotyping affect the quality of care by healthcare providers. And, implicit bias might contribute to the silencing of pregnancy concerns from Black mothers.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, medical providers are less likely to identify facial expressions displaying signs of pain in Black patients, unlike their non-Black counterparts, which ultimately allows the severity of their pain to be ignored.\n\n\u201cIgnoring, for example, their preferences and complaints of pain or of something not feeling quite right, their concerns are being dismissed,\u201d Dominguez said.\n\nShe said educating medical students on the social determinants of health can bring awareness to the Black maternity mortality crisis.\n\n\u201cThere are the factors that affect how we live, breathe and move in the world that shape what our health is like,\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not all on the medical community, why these disparities exist, but they show up in their emergency rooms and their delivery rooms.\u201d\n\nMedical professionals could be exposed to implicit bias as early as medical school. Cynthia Sanchez, teaching associate professor in the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work at USC, said that there are not enough conversations surrounding cultural humility and how it contributes to personal bias.\n\n\u201cI think as educators for medical schools, we all need to look at our curriculum and look for where we are teaching bias and what we are doing to make people think differently about other groups of people in the first place,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nSo, USC\u2019s Department of Nursing program has eliminated race from the case studies students see in their curriculums. \u201cDecolonizing\u201d the curriculum, Sanchez said, helps remove racial bias in the classroom.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nCalifornia has installed various programs to combat Black maternal mortality such as state- and Medicaid-funded Black Infant Health that offers group or individual counseling for Black mothers. In addition to the Black Infant Health Site in Los Angeles, the LA County of Public Health department subcontracts with four other agencies to provide birth services in other locations across the county.\n\nOn a global scale, the United States ranks the highest in maternal mortality rates among 11 industrialized countries. In 2018, the maternal mortality rate in the United States was 17.4 per 100,000 live births, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The industrialized country with the second highest maternal deaths is France, with a rate half of the United States: 8.7 deaths per 100,000 live births.\n\n\u201cOther countries have much better pregnancy outcomes, one reason being different cultural attitudes around pregnancy and childbearing,\u201d USC Professor Dominguez said. \u201cWhere family is central and pregnant women are more taken care of, these attitudes that favor pregnancy there is better support and concerned around taking care of pregnant women.\u201d\n\nContributing reporter: Arun Cherukuri\n\nData was produced by the National Vital Statistics System. We obtained this data from the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics, which wrote an online report. Maternal mortality rates, the number of deaths per 100,000 live births, were calculated by the National Center for Health Statistics. Additional calculations were made to compare the maternal mortality rates by race; we did this by dividing the maternal mortality rate for Black women by the maternal mortality rate for white women. International data was sourced from The Commonwealth Fund, which wrote a report on the health statistics produced by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n```"}

His students\u2019 study outcomes rewarded his effort. He said the class helped him find a clear path to his career.  \u201cI think for many of them [it\u2019s] a very different experience in terms of education because typically they\u2019re used to just sitting and listening in their classes.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to the U.S. classroom,  students in China  are not encouraged to participate in discussion. They sit in the classroom for more than nine hours a day and study with less than a three hour break in between, according to a  blog  post published on the Sohu website. Students in China also have fewer opportunities within the education system. Unlike American students who can go to a community college or trade school to transfer into a 4-year elite institution like USC,  their GaoKao grades are their only way into the country\u2019s top universities , and most of them only get one shot for the test.\n\nRunyu Sun, current counselor of Sendelta International Academy and a USC alumni, called the system very robust and stressful. \u201cEverything is focused on how to get a high score, and it seems that anything else it\u2019s not important, even normal life,\u201d Sun said. Sun said some people might be able to live in that kind of environment, but for those who don\u2019t, study abroad offered them an alternative.\n\nAfter graduating from college in 2008, Sun was accepted for the master program at Sol Price School of Public Policy. \u201cI really want to go abroad to explore other countries in other cultures.

This year\u2019s celebration kicked off the school year with multi-genre performances varying from mellow grooves from Spill Tab to legendary flows from Pi\u2019erre Bourne. The concert is known to students every year as not just a musical experience, but also as a way of bringing the campus community together in a social setting before the school year gets off to a start. The concert acts as a culmination to what is known as \u201cWelcome Week.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s food options included a vast assortment of food truck options including, KOGI - BBQ Food, StopBye - Indonesian Fusion Food, the Churro Man and The Boba Truck. Pop Pay sponsored the event and also offered coupon tickets for certain food items as a courtesy.\n\nUSC Concerts announced Pi\u2019erre Bourne as this year\u2019s headliner in an instagram post on August 7. Although the event is widely marketed through social media by the USC Concerts Committee, a part of USG programming, some students found out about the event through their orientation in June, along with platforms including EngageSC. The concert was free and open only to currently-enrolled USC students, who could reserve a free ticket through EngageSC.\n\nPrevious Welcome Back headliners have included popular artists like Flo Milli, YBN Cordae, Smino, and AG Club, making the annual Welcome Back Concert a staple event during Welcome Week.\n\nFreshman Stella Ruggiero, a neuroscience major at USC, heard about it at orientation. \u201cI knew they had a lot of big names, like Post Malone,\u201d she said. For Jesus Vargas, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering, there was no better \u201cbig name\u201d headliner for this year\u2019s Welcome Back concert than Pi\u2019erre Bourne. \u201cI wrote my USC essays to his \u2018Good Movie\u2019 album,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cIt was kind of like a manifestation.\u201d\n\nZach Gibbs, journalism senior and production director for the USC Concerts Committee, started his production workday at 8 a.m. to make sure the event was a success. \u201cAs much as it is a grind, I love it because live music inspires me. I like to give people that same feeling I get,\u201d Gibbs said.\n\nIn between sets from Frat Mouse, Spill Tab and Pi\u2019erre Bourne, Kahoot games were broadcasted on the stage\u2019s screen, inviting audience members to join in on USC trivia games and \u201cWhere\u2019s Tommy?\u201d \u2014 a game where students locate Tommy Trojan on album covers.\n\nFor juniors Nya Manneh and Jazmyne Aquino, the experience is not only about the music, but also the social environment in which students come together. \u201cI like how it has more of the social environment towards the stage, and more of the chill in the back, I think it caters to everyone\u2019s energy levels,\u201d said Aquino. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m always here for the food. they didn\u2019t really have games last year,\u201d said Manneh, a junior majoring in communications.\n\nAquino was also excited by the opening act, Spill Tab, who also opened for Sabrina\u2019s Carpenter\u2019s \u201cEmails I Can\u2019t Send\u201d Tour. \u201cI was pretty stoked about it because at 9 p.m. that was when the opener for Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s tour came out,\u201d said Aquino, a junior double majoring in PR and theater.\n\nBourne\u2019s performance followed Spill Tab and automatically lit up the crowd with his strong, heavy bass sounds and his energetic stage presence. The South Carolina-based artist knows how to work the stage from left to right, providing entertainment to all areas of the audience.\n\nOn top of being an artist and producer who knows how to work a crowd, Bourne runs his own record label, SossHouse, under Interscope Records. He has signed fellow artists including Sharc, Jelly, Chavo, Frazier Trill, J Billz and Kura.\n\nWhile he rose to fame producing hit songs for rappers like Playboi Carti, Travis Scott and 21 Savage, he\u2019s proved just how well he can work on his own with his three solo albums. \u201cI like how versatile he is,\u201d said Ethan Oblea, a junior transfer majoring in economics. \u201cI know most people know him as a producer. But I do like his sound as well\u2014it\u2019s pretty unique.\u201d\n\nHis set featured a healthy mix of heavy trap headbangers and more euphoric, mellow tracks and included hit songs like \u201cDrunk and Nasty\u201d (feat. Sharc). The Welcome Back concert concluded with \u201cPissy Pamper (Kid Cudi),\u201d an unreleased song with Playboi Carti, wrapping up USC\u2019s Welcome Week.\n\nFreshman Eden Cingrani, an international relations major, expressed what this concert means to her: \u201cAs a freshman, I\u2019ve enjoyed going to all the Welcome Week events, and I was definitely excited for this concert because it\u2019s one of the most hyped up events,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always fun hearing new music and just being with people and the Trojan family.\u201d\n```"}

It is one of 10 strike locations on the West Coast, one of 22 locations for demonstrations across the U.S. and is the same picket line that Mulroney walked for 100 days back in 2007 when the last strike occurred over the writer's role in the emergence of internet content. (Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Hali Mecklin, Kaitlyn Huamani and Mohammed Zain Shafi Khan\nAugust 28, 2023 at 2:44 pm PDT\n\nThe Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA are still striking, leaving a wildly popular USC film elective with significantly less star power as celebrity guests sit out on lectures. Theatrical Film Symposium, a class taught by film critic Leonard Maltin in the School of Cinematic Arts, has been \u201cUSC\u2019s most popular elective for over 50 years,\u201d according to the school\u2019s website. In addition to being open to students of all ages and majors, the course\u2019s campus-wide success can be attributed to its impressive line up of guest speakers, including Joe & Anthony Russo, Guillermo del Toro, Taika Waititi, J.J. Abrams, Chloe Grace Moretz, Sylvester Stallone and Judd Apatow.\n\nHowever, actors and writers who are members of the Writer\u2019s Guild or SAG-AFTRA won\u2019t be able to visit and promote their upcoming projects without crossing the picket line. Per the rules of the ongoing double-strike of the two labor unions, members are not allowed to promote upcoming projects and are specifically prohibited from attending panels, premieres and screenings, including ones at USC\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts.\n\nAlex Ago, the director of programming and special projects at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, said he doesn\u2019t think the strike will \u201cactually affect the class at all,\u201d as he aims to book guests for cinema classes across a wide variety of professions, including production designers, costume designers, animators and more. \u201cWe have so many great people that we can hear from in the production of a movie that the focus on these other professions shouldn\u2019t be as big of a hindrance as it might seem,\u201d Ago said. \u201cThe bigger problem, unfortunately, is that because the studios feel that they really need the actors to help promote their films, they\u2019ve been changing the release dates of some of their bigger films to 2024.\u201d\n\nSome students have a different perspective about the actors and writers\u2019 absence. \u201cAs a student not in the film school, I loved hearing from actors and writers, especially the USC grads, because they were able to give current students advice about breaking into the industry and give us the insight we would not hear in the class setting otherwise,\u201d said Amber Birdwell, a senior studying global geodesign who took the class in her junior year. \u201cThe current students are missing out on valuable career advice because the guests are not attending.\u201d\n\nNegotiations between strikers and studios have not yet led to a compromise after 118 days of the writers\u2019 strike and 46 days of the coinciding actors\u2019 strike. For now, guests for this semester\u2019s symposium will be limited to directors outside of the unions and behind-the-scenes members of the film industry.\n```"}

We all grew accustomed to junior quarterback Caleb Williams\u2019 miraculous escaping acts during his Heisman campaign last season. Freshman receiver Zachariah Branch and redshirt junior transfer running back MarShawn Lloyd, just to name a couple, both impressed with their tackle-breaking abilities in their Trojan debuts.\n\nThe issue is that the USC defense still has issues tackling, well, just about everyone. Despite the 56-28 final score against San Jose State seeming like a blowout on paper, the Trojans continued to show some of the same defensive deficiencies that have plagued them in past years.\n\nUSC head coach Lincoln Riley showed an early willingness to put USC\u2019s new skill players in action from the get-go. Three different running backs and nine receivers earned snaps on the Trojans\u2019 opening drive \u2014 seven of those 12 skill players are either freshmen or offseason transfers making their USC debut.\n\nBranch was the highlight of those newcomers, showcasing the speed and agility that made him a five-star recruit on a 25-yard catch-and-run touchdown in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really have any expectations,\u201d Branch said about his mentality heading into his college debut. \u201cCoach Riley and the rest of the staff just told me to go out there and don\u2019t try to do too much; execute your job and I mean the rest will follow.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a true freshman, by the way, who ran a 10.3-second 100-meter dash as a high school sophomore. As expected, he has impressed several teammates.\n\nAccording to USC rush end Jamil Muhammad, even a Spartan defender marveled, \u201cOh, he\u2019s gone,\u201d midway through the kickoff return.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been showing that, day in, day out,\u201d redshirt senior Tahj Washington said of Branch. \u201cIt was great to see everyone get to see what he\u2019s been doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt like he (Branch) earned it \u2014 made an impact on offense, made an impact on special teams,\u201d Riley added. \u201cI thought he did a good job of not trying to do too much, which guys in their first game sometimes will do. I thought his patience, especially on the return, you saw a lot of patience there, which was key.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 endlessly deep skill position corps have plenty more where that came from. Lloyd\u2019s stat line of nine rushes for 42 yards doesn\u2019t jump off the page, but his elusiveness allowed him to consistently turn 2-yard carries into 5.\n\nAnother five-star recruit, freshman receiver Duce Robinson, caught three passes for 44 yards. Meanwhile, redshirt senior running back Austin Jones, now the wily old veteran of the skill group, added a pair of scores on the ground while averaging 9 yards per carry.\n\nOh, and by the way, you simply can\u2019t forget about Williams, and it didn\u2019t take long for him to remind everyone why. Deep in his own territory midway through the second quarter, Williams fumbled the snap. Most mere mortal quarterbacks would just throw it away in this circumstance. But not Caleb Williams.\n\nInstead, he picked up the loose ball and chucked it downfield. Redshirt senior receiver Tahj Washington found the other end of the throw and took it for a 76-yard touchdown, the longest of Williams\u2019 career.\n\nNow, we all knew that the Trojans\u2019 offense was going to continue to dominate with Williams and his deep group of weapons. That wasn\u2019t the big question mark for Riley\u2019s squad heading into this season. That honor would belong to fixing a porous defense that cost USC a spot in the College Football Playoff last season.\n\nAnd, frankly, the Trojans didn\u2019t show a ton of improvement on that side of the ball to open 2023. San Jose State ran for 7.7 yards per carry in the first quarter, much of it coming on scrambles by senior quarterback Chevan Cordeiro to extend drives.\n\nCordeiro escaped the pocket for 28 yards on third and 22, a big change in momentum leading to the Spartans\u2019 first touchdown. Additionally, six of the Spartans\u2019 27 runs went for 10 or more yards, another bad mark for the Trojan defense.\n\n\u201cWe just got out of our rushing lanes, I think that\u2019s something we can get better at,\u201d Muhammad said.\n\nStill, USC should have been able to break away by halftime, especially once it got the ball back with 1:35 in the second quarter already up 21-7. Instead, a sack deep in Trojan territory gave SJSU good field position with 27 seconds to go.\n\nCordeiro then cashed in on broken coverage with a deep touchdown pass to redshirt junior receiver Nick Nash to reach the break trailing by just a score.\n\n\u201cThe biggest disappointment was the end of the half, when we were really dominating the football game and to have the two series of bad football,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThe busted coverage there on the last play before half was inexcusable. Finishing in those moments when you\u2019ve played a solid half, and to give a team momentum like that coming in was obviously very disappointing.\u201d\n\nFrom missed tackles to blown coverage, in addition to eight penalties for 57 yards, it appears that USC still hasn\u2019t done enough to address the self-inflicted wounds that are holding this team back.\n\n\u201cIt is a lot to work on, but the sky\u2019s the limit. You\u2019ve seen those plays where we\u2019re all on our stuff,\u201d senior linebacker Mason Cobb said. \u201cSo we\u2019re just trying to make sure to limit those mistakes. ... We\u2019re right there, just got to finish.\u201d\n\nTo give credit to the Spartans, Cordeiro is one of the most experienced quarterbacks in the nation, as Saturday marked the start of his sixth collegiate season. He led the Mountain West\u2019s best passing offense last season with San Jose State.\n\nBut, Cordeiro simply isn\u2019t a Bo Nix or Michael Penix Jr.-level talent. In a Pac-12 conference with so many top quarterbacks, USC clearly has a long way to go on defense if it wants to keep winning.\n\nThe Trojans did show some improvement in the second half, holding SJSU to 1-for-6 on third and fourth downs, compared to 4-for-8 in the first half. They were also able to limit Cordeiro\u2019s scrambling ability a little better as the game wore on.\n\nNevertheless, USC didn\u2019t do nearly enough to erase that big question mark that still hangs over the unit. But Riley remains optimistic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a climb,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI like what I see out there in terms of our good plays. ... We will continue to improve the baseline. The ceiling for that group is much higher than it was 12 months ago.\u201d\n```"}

The win extends the Trojans\u2019 (1-0, 0-0 Pac-12) record to 6-0 all time against the Spartans (0-1, 0-0 Mountain West). The win also extends coach Lincoln Riley\u2019s record in season openers to 7-0, two of those coming at USC.\n\nBranch became the first USC freshman to return a kickoff for a touchdown since Adoree\u2019 Jackson in 2014. This is also the first USC kickoff return for a touchdown since 2019. Branch scored his first collegiate touchdown 4:26 prior to his third-quarter kickoff return as junior quarterback Caleb Williams connected with him on a 25-yard pass to put the Trojans up 35-14.\n\nWilliams threw for 278 yards and four touchdowns before being replaced by redshirt sophomore Miller Moss to take a few snaps with nearly 10 minutes left in the game. Moss ran in a 4-yard score of his own halfway through the fourth quarter.\n\nWilliams\u2019 most impressive touchdown of the game came on a 76-yard loft to redshirt senior receiver Tahj Washington after he broke into the open field. Williams dropped the snap prior to the pass, but he got the throw off milliseconds before he likely would have been sacked.\n\nWilliams also connected with junior receiver Dorian Singer, who played in his first game for USC after transferring from Arizona, on a 13-yard dart in the first quarter.\n\nAnother standout performance came from redshirt senior running back Austin Jones, who punched in two short touchdowns and ran for 54 total yards to lead all USC rushers.\n\nSan Jose State kept things close in the first half as the Trojans only led the Spartans by seven going into halftime thanks to a standout performance by senior quarterback Chevan Cordeiro, who threw for 198 yards and three touchdowns. Cordeiro also cooked the USC defense for 80 yards.\n\nThe USC defense, which struggled at times last season, allowed 198 rushing yards and 198 receiving yards on the day. However, USC rushed for only 160 yards, but the receivers made up for it by racking up 341 yards.\n\nThe Trojans take on Nevada Saturday, Sept. 2 at 3:30 p.m. at the Coliseum.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of USC Athletics)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan August 25, 2023 at 5:53 pm PDT\n\nHead coach Jane Alukonis and USC did not go easy on her alma mater. In Alukonis\u2019 return to Durham, North Carolina, to play against her former coach, Robbie Church, the USC women\u2019s soccer team found themselves down early, but maintained their cool and eventually sailed to a 3-1 victory.\n\nUSC dominated possession in the game\u2019s first few minutes, with junior midfielder Simi Awujo \u2014 who spent the summer with the Canadian national team at the Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand \u2014 taking the game\u2019s first shot on target, low to the near post of Duke goalkeeper Leah Freeman.\n\nDuke recovered quickly from the early shock, however, and began to pass the ball comfortably around USC\u2019s press. Duke striker Devin Lynch would often step towards the midfield to receive the ball with teammates making overlapping runs around her to advance the ball. Duke\u2019s methodical passing paid off, with sophomore right back Elle Piper whipping a cross to the back post that went over USC senior defender Zoe Burns\u2019 head and straight to Duke\u2019s Kat Rader. The sophomore forward headed the ball cleanly in, scoring her second goal of the season.\n\nFrom there, Duke continued to dominate possession, using different runs and rotations from their midfielders and forwards to work the ball forward and create shots. USC had infrequent opportunities on the counter attack, and even when they did get forward, they struggled to stay onside, getting called offside seven times in the first half.\n\nOther teams in the same situation as USC may have wilted and allowed Duke to run up the score, but the Trojans stayed sharp despite their lack of possession and eventually broke through with a header of their own. Freshman forward Maribel Flores scored the equalizing goal in the 36th minute, when junior forward Kayla Colbert lofted the ball towards Freeman\u2019s back post with her left foot. Flores made sweet contact with the ball, heading it low and back across goal, sneaking it past Freeman\u2019s left-hand glove.\n\nThe Fullerton, California native won the CONCACAF U-20 Championship with Mexico over the summer and figures to be crucial to USC\u2019s success this season. The goal was the first of her USC career.\n\nWhen the whistle sounded for halftime, it seemed like USC would be lucky to hold on to a draw. Duke had consolidated possession for the entire half and progressed the ball into the final third with ease, generating seven shots to USC\u2019s three. Junior forward Simone Jackson, who scored USC\u2019s winning goal in their season opener against Michigan, had a quiet first half and was subbed off for freshman forward Florianne Jourde shortly after USC\u2019s first goal (Jourde is the newest member of USC\u2019s Canadian contingent, joining Burns and Owujo among Trojans to have played internationally for Canada).\n\nThe second half started in the same fashion the first had ended, with the Blue Devils controlling the ball and USC seizing any opportunities they could on the counter attack. But shots became harder to come by for Duke, and the tides began to turn about ten minutes into the second half.\n\nWith Jackson returning to the game, USC gained momentum. Colbert scored a goal, although the referee disallowed it for offsides. Even though the goal didn\u2019t count, USC displayed some excellent build-up play, moving the ball quickly from the centerbacks into Burns and through the lines for Colbert to run onto.\n\nShortly after, senior forward Angeles Escobar, who started the game at left back, stayed forward after losing the ball. She then regained possession at the top of the 18-yard box and unleashed a rocket from her left foot that Freeman had no chance at stopping. Escobar\u2019s strike stayed high and nestled in the right-side netting to give USC a 2-1 lead in the 62nd minute.\n\nColbert continued to be a nuisance for Duke\u2019s senior left back Olivia Migli and added a third goal fifteen minutes later. Junior midfielder Helena Sampaio played a slick ball over the top for Colbert, who dribbled to the touchline and hit the ball across goal. It wasn\u2019t clear if Colbert intended to shoot or cross, but she hit the ball so hard that it bounced off Freeman\u2019s hands into the net despite the goalkeeper having a favorable position to save it.\n\nDuke never seriously threatened freshman goalkeeper Hannah Poulter\u2019s net after the Colbert goal, and USC coasted to its second win of the season. Duke outshot USC 13 to five over the whole match, but the Trojans made the most of their opportunities and have started the season in fine form.\n\nAfter the match, Alukonis reflected on her team\u2019s performance and her return to Duke. \u201cIt felt good to come back and see my coaches,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201c[I] just wanted to make them proud and give them a really good game.\u201d Church helped inspire Alukonis to become a coach and helped her early in her journey. Before Alukonis coached at UCLA and USC, she worked as Duke\u2019s director of operations from 2015 to 2016.\n\n\u201cBoth teams created a lot, at the end of the day we were lucky to put three in, and really proud of the team,\u201d Alukonis said.\n\nUSC will stay in North Carolina over the weekend, traveling to UNC next for the second game on their road trip. The United Soccer Coaches NCAA poll has UNC ranked as the country\u2019s third-best team. The Tar Heels are the winningest program in Division I, having captured the College Cup 21 times, while no other team has more than three.\n\n\u201cSunday we\u2019ve got to take care of business as well,\u201d Alukonis said. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome to be here and have the opportunity to play [UNC].\u201d\n\nNo matter Sunday\u2019s result, the trip has already been a success for USC.\n```"}

Expand Head coach Lincoln Riley (left) brought defensive coordinator Alex Grinch (right) with him from Oklahoma to USC. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nBy Terence Holton August 25, 2023 at  4:51 pm PDT\n\nLike a battle straight from ancient history, the Trojans will take on the Spartans in USC\u2019s first football game of the year. The only difference between now and ancient Greece? The Trojans will likely dominate the Spartans. USC football is back and vastly improved. After a postseason that can only be described as grizzly, which saw the Trojans being blown out by Utah and choking a fourth-quarter lead to Tulane, USC has revamped its roster and looks to make its first College Football Playoff appearance.\n\nThe ringmaster behind USC\u2019s success, junior quarterback Caleb Williams, is back for one final year before \u2014likely\u2014 heading to the NFL. Williams\u2019 Heisman campaign last year was quite the spectacle, as he threw for 4,537 yards, 42 touchdowns and only five interceptions. Williams will likely light up this Spartan defense, which has not played against a talent like him possibly ever. With how prolific the Trojan offense is, Williams might be subbed out by the third or fourth quarter to make way for the second string players to get some snaps.\n\nThe Heisman winner can\u2019t do it by himself, though. USC\u2019s arsenal of receivers, running backs and tight ends is arguably better than last year and is likely to dominate opposing defenses once again. The receiver position is by far the most stacked, with the Trojans returning senior Brenden Rice, redshirt senior Tahj Washington and junior Mario Williams. The Trojans also brought in junior transfer Dorian Singer, who had 1,105 receiving yards and six touchdowns for Arizona last season, and five-star freshman wide receiver Zachariah Branch, who has been turning heads at training camp. There is even a chance that at least four of these guys score on Saturday.\n\nThe defense for the Trojans last year was... lackluster, to say the least. However, this year, the Trojans look to be much better. USC brought in two big-name defensive linemen from the SEC, sophomores Bear Alexander from Georgia and Anthony Lucas from Texas A&M. Both Lucas and Alexander are game-wreckers, which the Trojans will desperately need after the departure of Tuli Tuipulotu for the NFL. These two will look to impact a USC run defense which was near the bottom of all of college football last year.\n\nAnother player primed to see real playing time is sophomore cornerback Domani Jackson. He was highly touted coming out of high school, being ranked top 10 in the country by most major recruiting sites. However, Jackson missed most of last season dealing with various injuries. If Jackson can live up to his high school hype, he will bring a new energy to the USC pass defense, which ranked 112th in pass yards allowed per game last season.\n\nUSC\u2019s depth chart was released this past Wednesday and it was announced that freshman linebacker Tackett Curtis will be starting. However, this could be due to junior linebacker Eric Gentry resting, as he deals with injuries. This could also be a sign of Curtis excelling at fall camp and the coaching staff recognizing it. This game will be a great test for Curtis, as he was a great run stopper in high school, which the Trojans desperately need.\n\nWhile the Trojans are heavy favorites, the Spartans are not as bad of a team as Rice, who USC opened up the season with last year. San Jose State finished 7-5 last season and was bowl-eligible. The Spartans are led by senior quarterback Chevan Cordeiro, a highly experienced player who threw for 3,250 yards and 23 touchdowns last season. Cordeiro\u2019s kryptonite, however, will be his inexperienced receiver core, as no receiver on the Spartans had more than three touchdowns last season. The Spartans will likely then try to attack in the run game. Senior running back Kairee Robinson ran for over 750 yards and 10 touchdowns last season on 4.8 yards per carry. Robinson could be an issue for a Trojan defense that was known to give up huge gains to opposing running backs, with an extremely bad example coming at the hands of Tulane running back Tyjae Spears.\n\nSan Jose State is not a bad team; however, it is probable that the Trojans will run away with this one in a hurry. USC just has too much firepower offensively for the Spartans to keep up with. Defensively, this should be a great tune-up game for defensive coordinator Alex Grinch\u2019s defense before the Trojans take on some tough offenses later this year. Catch USC taking on San Jose State Saturday at 5 p.m. at the Coliseum.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)\n\nBy Mark Armendariz-Gonzales August 25, 2023 at 4:02 pm PDT\n\nDays after claiming the first title in their club\u2019s history, Inter Miami find themselves once again in another final. After going down early in the match, the team pushed the game to extra time due to the incredible partnership of Argentinian captain Lionel Messi and Ecuadorian forward Leonardo Campana.\n\nComing off an amazing final in the Leagues Cup, Miami came into the semi-finals of the U.S. Open Cup with full confidence. Unfortunately for Miami, things took a turn for the worse early into the match. FC Cincinnati opened the scoring when midfielder Luciano Acosta snuck in a goal in the 18th minute.\n\nAfter taking the lead, the Cincinnati offense did not back down and continued to step on the gas. In the 53rd minute, striker Brandon V\u00e1zquez slotted a shot into the corner of the Miami goal, doubling Cincinnati\u2019s lead.\n\nAfter being undefeated in their last seven games, it looked as if Miami\u2019s luck had finally run out. They were a shadow of themselves on the pitch, having only one shot on target for the entire game.\n\nThen, in the 68th minute, off an amazing freekick from Messi, Campana was able to head the ball into the back of the net and rejuvenated the team. Filled with hope, Miami started to fight back, regaining their former semblance.\n\nAs the game progressed, it became clear that Miami\u2019s biggest threat at the moment was not Cincinnati but time itself. As the match found itself in garbage time, it appeared as if the honeymoon stage for Miami had finally ended.\n\nLuckily for Miami, they have the greatest player in the world in Messi, who knows how to produce in crucial moments. Chipping the ball over the entire Cincinnati defense, Messi was able to find the head of Campana once again, who scored his second header of the game.\n\nWith the score now tied, the match headed into extra time, where Miami continued on with their scoring streak. Venezuelan striker Josef Mart\u00ednez seemed to put the final nail in the coffin when he scored a goal in the 93rd minute off a Cincinnati mistake.\n\nCincinnati would answer right back, though, in the 114th minute when Yuya Kubo tied up the score 3-3 that sent the match into a penalty shootout.\n\nFour days after playing in a crucial penalty shootout, Miami found themselves in the same dramatic situation. Messi would kick off the rotation for Miami and score from the spot, fully calm and collected.\n\nAfter a few rounds, Miami goalkeeper Drake Callender would be the hero in goal for the second time in less than a week when he saved a shot from defender Nick Hagglund.\n\nWith the game on the line, a young Argentine repping the same number his captain once wore at the start of his career stepped up to the penalty spot. Club-grown 18-year-old Benjamin Cremaschi had the opportunity to send his team to their second final of the season.\n\nCremaschi blasted the ball into the corner of the net, which solidified Miami\u2019s victory. The entire team was filled with emotion as they celebrated their comeback win, and nobody was happier than Messi.\n\nIt was definitely an unforgettable moment for the Miami fans and players, but more so for club owner David Beckham. He was able to do the impossible and convince the world\u2019s greatest player to come play for a club that currently sits dead last in the MLS Eastern Conference.\n\nSince the arrival of Messi to the club, the team has won their first-ever title, gone undefeated, become the fourth most followed American sports team on Instagram, and has attracted other big-name players to sign for the club, such as left-back Jordi Alba and midfielder Sergio Busquets.\n\nIt is safe to say that Beckham made a culture-changing signing for his team. Miami will face Houston Dynamo at home on September 27th for the U.S. Open Cup final. Based on how Miami has been playing, it is more than likely that they will be adding some silverware to their trophy cabinet pretty soon.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Will Camardella August 25, 2023 at 3:55 pm PDT\n\nJust three days away from the start of the 2023 college football season, USC took to the practice field fully embracing its opportunity to do something special. Head coach Lincoln Riley donned a pullover with the College Football Playoff logo on the chest, working to get his offense fully in sync ahead of Saturday\u2019s season opener.\n\nThe Trojans have numerous talented receivers on this roster, all of whom needed to get on the same page with junior quarterback Caleb Williams. Williams took the college football landscape by storm a season ago with a staggering 42 to five touchdown to interception ratio and enough highlight plays to earn himself the Heisman Trophy.\n\nDespite his individual accomplishments, the USC signal-caller was only focused on team goals when speaking to the media on Wednesday. \u201cImmortality comes from championships,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI haven\u2019t reached one here in college yet, but we have a special moment here to go and reach one. ... That\u2019s important. I explained to the team that you can\u2019t go win a championship by yourself. The best thing about football is that it\u2019s a whole 110 players that can be immortal with you.\u201d\n\nWilliams, who can declare for the NFL Draft after this season, also shook off comparisons some scouts had made between him and Patrick Mahomes. \u201c[Mahomes] has two Super Bowls,\u201d Williams said. \u201cTo be compared to someone like that gives me a sense of respect, but it\u2019s also irrelevant, because I\u2019m Caleb Williams here at USC. I haven\u2019t even won a national championship yet.\u201d\n\nTo achieve that goal, Williams will rely on a crowded receiver room to make plays for him throughout the season. Many of those pass catchers will be in their second season in Riley\u2019s offense and will look to take a major leap.\n\nOne of those returning wideouts is senior Brenden Rice, who broke out in a big way in the Trojans\u2019 final game of last season with 174 receiving yards and two touchdowns. \u201cIt\u2019s Caleb Williams, this dude is a magician,\u201d Rice said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him roll out and make a cross-body throw 40 yards down the field. His work ethic matches everything he wants to do on that field. He\u2019s a great vocal leader, and I wouldn\u2019t follow anybody else. It\u2019s a privilege, just to go out there and work with him time and time again. It really builds that chemistry with a Joe Burrow and Ja\u2019Marr Chase relationship.\u201d\n\nRice was one of four starting receivers on USC\u2019s depth chart, which was released Wednesday night. Redshirt sophomore Kyron Hudson, sophomore Mario Williams and junior Dorian Singer were also listed as starters ahead of the San Jose State matchup.\n\n\u201cThe chemistry in the wide receiver room] is dynamic,\u201d Rice said. \u201cAny guy can step up at any given moment and take a spot. I went down with a slight hamstring injury. I came back and it was right back on it. ... Some of these guys have to know the next man up mentality. You have to keep driving, because we\u2019re all fighting for a position out here.\u201d\n\nAlthough only four were officially named starters, many more wideouts will likely have a chance to impact the game Saturday. For example, redshirt senior Tahj Washington, who had over 700 yards and six touchdowns last season, will be a formidable depth option for Lincoln Riley.\n\nWide receivers coach Dennis Simmons said he hopes all of USC\u2019s receivers touch the ball. \u201cIn the game plan, we plan on playing a lot of people. Hopefully, those guys get an opportunity to shine and show you what we\u2019ve seen for the last couple of weeks,\u201d Simmons said.\n\nWhile the Trojans have plenty of experience in the pass catching department, they have also used this summer to develop a pair of freshmen. Mekai Lemon and Zachariah Branch are four- and five-star recruits, respectively, getting ready to see their first collegiate action.\n\n\u201cAll of the young guys have exceeded expectations as far as what we\u2019ve seen in camp,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cHopefully, all of those guys will be given an opportunity to showcase what they can do and showcase why they earned the right to play at this historic university.\u201d\n\nUSC gets a head start to its highly-anticipated season with a Week 0 game on Saturday. If practice has been any indication, there will be no shortage of skill players ready to put on a show at the Coliseum.\n```"}

After missing out on the No. 1 player in the class of 2024, quarterback Dylan Raiola, Trojan fans were unsure of who the quarterback of the distant future would be. However, Lincoln Riley, a.k.a. \u201cthe QB whisperer\u201d, has landed the commitment of Julian Lewis, the No. 1 player in the class of 2026. Lewis is one of the most hyped-up quarterback prospects since current Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence. Lewis earned his first Division 1 offer in  eighth grade  from Florida and has not slowed down since. Even though he is only a sophomore in high school, Lewis has received offers from the likes of Alabama, Ohio State, Notre Dame, Clemson and Georgia, just to name a few. In Lewis\u2019 freshman year playing for Carrollton High School in Georgia\u2019s highest division, he threw for 4,304 yards and 49 touchdowns while leading Carrollton to a 14-1 record. Their only loss came in the state championship game. Despite the loss, Lewis threw for  531 yards and five touchdowns , breaking the record for passing yards in a state championship game in Georgia. These stats are unheard of for a freshman. In my home state of Oregon, freshmen aren\u2019t even allowed to play varsity football. Now, comparing Oregon and Georgia high school football is like comparing American soccer to European soccer; it\u2019s just a different monster. Nonetheless, what Lewis did was incredible for a kid who hadn\u2019t even stepped foot onto a high school field until that year. Lewis has been described as a very mature quarterback, especially considering his age. He is known to make big plays on the big stages and is not one to just take the first quick option, but rather find the right option and send his receiver a heat-seeking missile of a spiral. Dare I say that Lincoln Riley has found the next Caleb Williams? The next in line for the throne of USC quarterback is freshman Malachi Nelson, and while I believe Nelson can be a star, Lewis may already have that star player impact that you just can\u2019t teach. It\u2019s ridiculous to fantasize about these things right now, as Lewis will not even step on campus until after I graduate (which makes me feel incredibly old as a 19-year-old); however, this type of player brings that level of hype. Along with his hype, Lewis could attract more star talent. It is a well-known fact that great players want to play with other great players, especially a quarterback. I would not be surprised if USC lands a multitude of skill position players in the classes of 2025 and 2026 who want to play with Lewis. The only issue with Lewis\u2019 commitment to USC now is that he still does not graduate for three years. He lives in the heart of SEC football, which means that\u2019s three more years for Georgia, Alabama, LSU and others to potentially sway him to change commitments. If I were Lincoln Riley, I would try to convince Lewis to reclassify to the class of 2025, so that he can get on campus as soon as possible, to keep Lewis away from the greedy SEC boosters and coaches. It is very possible that Lewis could start out of the gate for the Trojans, similar to how Trevor Lawrence did for Clemson. Of course, Lawrence led them to a national championship his freshman year. Malachi Nelson could be off to the NFL by 2026, so Lewis may come in and start immediately, which could be what drew him to the Trojans. I don\u2019t want to say Lewis is the next great USC quarterback, as he is only 15 years old, but this kid is a star. Even though it is quite a while out until he will become quarterback at USC, I cannot wait to see him play.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Yang)\n\nBy Sam Yang\nAugust 24, 2023 at 6:52 pm PDT\n\nAs the USC Trojans enter their last week of practice before their much-anticipated 2023 season opener, Lincoln Riley and his squad are looking forward to their Saturday matchup against the San Jose State Spartans. With 72 returning players, including 2022 Heisman award-winning junior quarterback Caleb Williams, an impressive recruiting class and the entire returning full-time coaching staff, the expectations for the season are as high as the energy on the practice field.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of youth on the team, even with all these returners,\u201d coach Lincoln Riley said. \u201cThere will be a lot of work to be done; we got some growing to do in the early games.\u201d\n\nThe offensive team conducted multiple 2-minute offense drills, practicing advancing the ball down the field, while the defensive team, led by defensive coordinator Alex Grinch, worked on countering the routes and communicating. The special teams squad also saw some extensive action with an emphasis on field goals and kick returning.\n\nThe practice had a relaxed tone compared to the 85 degree Southern California heat and the business of the first week of classes, as it seems like the entire campus is gearing up and getting ready for the home-opener and the start of its farewell football season in the Pac-12.\n\nNot far away from where the team practiced, on Allyson Felix field, the Trojan marching band rehearsed around the same time, tuning up for Saturday.\n\nThe Trojans look to extend their home-opener win streak to 16 on Saturday. They are ranked No. 6 in the AP preseason poll, the highest they have been ranked to start a season since 2017, when they were ranked No. 4.\n\nAlthough the official depth chart has been released, Riley said he welcomes some competition for minutes, especially on the defensive end.\n\n\u201cThe defensive line looks and feels different...there\u2019s a little more competition across the board, a bit of position battles,\u201d he said. Our secondary team is deep, we have guys that have asserted themselves for their playing time like Tackett but we also have a handful of talented players that are eager to show their willingness to play.\u201d\n\nAfter a historical 2022 season where Riley led the Trojans to their biggest one-season victory turnaround ended in a heartbreaking loss to Tulane in the Cotton Bowl, the 39-year-old and his coaching staff had high expectations for both the returning players and the new additions, including 15 transfers.\n\n\u201cWe obviously want to put the best 11 on the field,\u201d Grinch said. \u201cIn order to feel confident, there\u2019s only one way to get better, and that is practice and game reps.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor all the guys we bring in, we bring them in with high expectations,\u201d Grinch said. \u201cWe want to know the ceiling on all the transfers because we have seen all their work on film. We have been very pleased with them from a consistency and competitiveness standpoint. They are strong and skilled, but again, we will get them some games.\u201d\n\nThe transfers spoke about their excitement to represent the Trojans and play in the coliseum for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe want to play today,\u201d Mason Cobb, a senior linebacker and transfer from Oklahoma State, said. \u201cGuys are excited; the energy is high; we practice hard everyday. We are going to play fast and aggressively without hesitation, and we know that\u2019s what the fans like to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaying in front of the home crowd will be different,\u201d Jamil Muhammad, a redshirt senior transfer from Georgia State, said. \u201cThere is going to be a lot of new things happening this weekend, and I am excited.\u201d\n\nSenior defensive lineman Kyon Barrs, a transfer from Arizona, talked about the excitement felt among the players.\n\n\u201cThis D-line is going after it all day every day,\u201d Barrs said. \u201cWe are all on the same page to disrupt offenses and create problems for the opponents. We have been watching films. It\u2019s game one at the Coliseum. We are all ready to go out there and showcase our energy and talent.\u201d\n\nLincoln Riley also commented on the recent announcement to hire Jennifer Cohen, who spent the last seven years as the athletic director at Washington, as the new Director of Athletics.\n\n\u201cWe shared a lot of the same perspectives,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThis is an elite job. We are positioned to get to our very best. I think she will do extremely well. We are fired up.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans will face San Jose State Saturday with kickoff at 5 p.m. PST.\n```"}

They might struggle to score, but Angel City just won\u2019t lose. It\u2019s become a recurring segment in this column that Becki Tweed\u2019s reign as Angel City interim head coach has proved rock solid, and the streak has continued. In all competitions, Angel City have earned four wins and four draws under Tweed and have shown no signs of slowing down. If anything, Angel City have been unlucky to not win more this summer; they outshot Racing Louisville 20 to 13 on Aug. 19, drawing the match 1-1. Alyssa Thompson created a great near-post opportunity for Savannah McCaskill in the first half and Katlyn Johnson had a free header from close range that both could\u2019ve gone in on another day. McCaskill did assist Johnson for the team\u2019s one goal, though, continuing her good run of form against Louisville, against whom she scored and had an assist in April. Louisville\u2019s goalkeeper Katie Lund also had a moment of madness in the 82nd minute, holding on to the ball for too long and allowing Angel City striker Syndey Leroux to almost slide tackle the ball into the net. But the lack of execution in this match and others is making Angel City challenging to cover at the moment. On the one hand, Tweed has righted the ship impressively, making Angel City a savvy team that\u2019s hard to beat. By all measures, she\u2019s done a tremendous job. Except, the NWSL season is short, and with every passing match, Angel City\u2019s playoff hopes dwindle. As excellent as the team has been since June 15 (when former head coach Freya Coombe was fired), they haven\u2019t really moved up in the table. When Tweed took over, Angel City sat in 11th place. Now, they\u2019re 10th, still four places and six points out of the playoffs. It\u2019s not an insurmountable gap, but beating Racing Louisville would\u2019ve provided a much-needed boost. If Angel City had won, they would\u2019ve pipped Louisville and the Houston Dash to eighth place, halving the difference to the playoff promised land. In a sense, it\u2019s probably reassuring that just one win would propel them so far forward. But given the lack of matches remaining, the pressure increases with every game they fail to win. At this point, Angel City probably needs 30 points to make the playoffs, assuming the clubs around them don\u2019t go on a hot streak. That\u2019s four wins, or three wins and three draws \u2014 and they\u2019ve only won four NWSL matches all season. Like I\u2019ve written previously, they have a favorable schedule, but every matchday is do or die for ACFC.\n\nShould the NWSL be worried? Since the United States lost in the round of 16, for the purposes of this column, I didn\u2019t follow the final matches of the Women\u2019s World Cup as closely. But one thing that did cross my mind as Spain were crowned champions is that not one player who started the Women\u2019s World Cup final for either Spain or England plays in the NWSL. In fact, even going down to the substitutes bench, no NWSL player appeared in the final. Can the NWSL really claim to be one of the world\u2019s best leagues if it produced zero World Cup finalists? Now, I understand that I sound like a concern troll and that the NWSL\u2019s potential presence in the World Cup was heavily dependent on the identity of its finalists. England fielded nine starters from the country\u2019s Women\u2019s Super League and Spain also had nine domestic league starters. If the U.S. had made the final, they could have easily fielded 10 U.S.-based players in the starting eleven. Therein may lie the issue. For the time being (and probably the rest of time), the NWSL and U.S. women\u2019s national team have tied fates. As long as the USWNT\u2019s best players ply their trade in the NWSL, their international performances will reflect on the strength of their league. That\u2019s true for Spain and England, too. Seven of Spain\u2019s squad, including Golden Ball winner Aitana Bonmat\u00ed, play their club football for FC Barcelona, who, under the reign of head coaches Llu\u00eds Cort\u00e9s and Jonatan Gir\u00e1ldez, have become arguably the greatest club team of all time \u2014 in men\u2019s or women\u2019s football. In just the 2022-23 season, Barcelona won 28 of 30 matches, scoring 118 goals and conceding just 10, winning both the Liga F and the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League. That\u2019s simply absurd. And the WSL, even beyond the excellence of its English players, has been attracting the world\u2019s best players to raise the level of its competition. In recent seasons, Chelsea Women\u2019s alone has signed Sam Kerr, Pernille Harder and Catarina Macario. Kerr\u2019s transfer in particular marked a major shift of soccer\u2019s tectonic plates, as she swapped the NWSL for the WSL and then promptly solidified her status as one of the world\u2019s best players (she\u2019s finished third in Ballon d\u2019Or F\u00e9minin voting the past two seasons). The NWSL appears to have fallen behind the top European clubs in terms of their international pulling power, which in turn means the level of competition has taken a hit. The NWSL can still develop American talent relatively effectively, but make no mistake, the Barcelona, Chelsea and Bayern Munich women\u2019s teams would all beat any NWSL team right now. In the wake of the Women\u2019s World Cup, it behooves the NWSL to recruit international talent more aggressively to raise the league\u2019s standard, and in turn, the USWNT\u2019s.\n\nHurricane Hypothesis\n\nDue to Tropical Storm Hilary (it was a hurricane down in Baja California, so it\u2019s staying in the subtitle!) making landfall in Los Angeles over the weekend, LAFC and LA Galaxy saw their matches postponed, leaving me with no MLS updates to discuss. I\u2019m not letting the rain dampen my spirit, however, because I have an MLS hypothesis to pose for you in today\u2019s final section: If Diego Rossi had stayed with LAFC in 2021 instead of transferring to Fenerbah\u00e7e, would he be an MLS MVP candidate and would LAFC still have won the MLS Cup in 2022? Unlike a true scientific experiment, I can\u2019t prove anything definitively in this column, but let me walk you through my thinking. In the season before his transfer, Rossi had become a true star for LAFC, scoring 14 goals and providing three assists in the 2020 season \u2014 his last full year with the club \u2014 and in 2019 he posted 22 total goal involvements. Rossi\u2019s teammate and LAFC legend Carlos Vela won the 2019 MLS MVP, outshining Rossi\u2019s achievements, but the Uruguayan winger had flashed future MVP potential. He slowed down slightly in 2021, with seven goal involvements in 19 appearances before his move to Turkey, but his expected goals plus assists tally actually showed a higher value of 10, putting him on pace for 17.9 npxG+xA in a 34-game season, in line with his previous seasons. Nonetheless, Rossi had become a reliable second star next to Vela who proved he could take over when the Mexican forward retired or lost a step. And if Rossi had never left the club, LAFC would probably never have signed Denis Bouanga, who\u2019s enjoying an MVP-caliber season of his own right now. My conclusion? If Rossi had stayed with LAFC, he would\u2019ve assumed Bouanga\u2019s role as the primary goalscorer, but a season earlier than Bouanga joined the club, meaning Rossi would have still propelled LAFC to the 2022 MLS Cup while also spearheading their efforts to repeat in 2023, winning an MVP this season as by far the league\u2019s best player. Maybe I\u2019m talking crazy, but who knows, that\u2019s the fun of this. We may still see Rossi win an MLS Cup if the Columbus Crew, whom he joined earlier this month, find their best form in the postseason.\n\nNext games: LAFC: Wednesday, Aug. 23 vs. Colorado Rapids (home \u2014 thanks, Hilary!)

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Cam Kauffman and Will Simonds\nAugust 23, 2023 at 12:27 pm PDT\n\nFormer USC star running back Reggie Bush held a news conference Wednesday to announce a defamation lawsuit against the NCAA because of a 2021 statement made by an NCAA spokesperson. Bush\u2019s lawyers called the statement, which they said accused Bush of being involved in a \u201cpay-for-play arrangement\u201d while at USC, \u201ccompletely false and highly offensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NCAA knew Mr. Bush was never even accused of, involved in, much less sanctioned for any \u2018pay-for-play arrangement,\u2019 which never occurred,\u201d Bush\u2019s lawyers said at the press conference. Bush\u2019s lawyer Levi McCathern said Bush \u201creceived a $1,000 stipend that was supposed to cover all of his expenses,\u201d including rent, each month. McCathern also refuted the claim that his client was paid by USC or a university sponsor.\n\n\u201cWe got to clear the defamation, the slander, the libel that has been placed on Reggie,\u201d McCathern said. \u201cReggie has been called a cheater; he\u2019s been called many other things. He is not. He was called a \u2018pay-for-play\u2019 player. He was not.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s record-breaking career has been tarnished by controversy surrounding a 2006 probe into his conduct at USC. The investigation concluded that Bush had received impermissible benefits from a sports marketing agent while he was in college, which resulted in his 2005 Heisman Trophy being rescinded and his collegiate records being cleared. Not only did the investigation result in his accolades being taken away, but the two-time national champion also received a 10-year disassociation penalty from the NCAA. USC was also forced to disassociate with Bush during this time. The penalty ended in June 2020.\n\nWhen the NCAA implemented its name, image and likeness laws in 2021, Bush sought to have his Heisman Trophy reinstated and his records restored. Because the laws allow athletes to now be paid by third parties, Bush believed his prior conduct would now be permissible. The Heisman Trust agreed to reinstate Bush as the 2005 most outstanding football player in the nation, as long as the NCAA agreed to restore Bush\u2019s records. However, the NCAA declined to do so.\n\n\u201cAlthough college athletes can now receive benefits from their names, images and likenesses through activities like endorsements and appearances, NCAA rules still do not permit pay-for-play type arrangements,\u201d the NCAA spokesperson the lawsuit refers to told ESPN. \u201cThe NCAA infractions process exists to promote fairness in college sports.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cpay-for-play\u201d typically suggests that payment or other benefits, which differ from receiving gifts from a third party, were a factor in an athlete\u2019s recruiting process.\n\n\u201cHow many more courts have to tell the NCAA that they are wrong before they finally restore Reggie Bush with his collegiate titles and records, and his Heisman Trophy?\u201d Ben Crump, another attorney representing Bush, said after listing a number of authorities that have declared the NCAA in violation of antitrust laws.\n\nAdditionally, Bush\u2019s lawyers have created a petition asking the NCAA to reconsider reversing the infractions imposed on Bush in order to allow him to reclaim his Heisman Trophy. McCathern said that USC has supported Bush in his petition for reconsiderations. The petition will go before the NCAA\u2019s Committee of Infractions; Bush\u2019s lawyers said they hope it will be reviewed by the end of the upcoming college football season.\n\nBush said that the university has asked him multiple times in the past to lead the USC football team out of the tunnel before a game, but Bush said that he will not do so until his Heisman is reinstated.\n\n\u201cI got dreams of coming back in this stadium and running out of that tunnel with the football team,\u201d Bush said, gesturing down toward the Coliseum field. \u201cI got dreams of walking back in here and seeing my jersey, my banner, right down there next to the rest of the Heisman Trophy winners. But, I can\u2019t rightfully do that without my Heisman Trophy.\u201d\n\nThe press conference was held at the LA Memorial Coliseum, but it was not affiliated with USC or USC Athletics.\n```"}

As one of the winningest head coaches in NCAA Women\u2019s Volleyball History with Stanford, Shaw, 72, has seen success in countless different arenas all throughout the country. But one stadium in particular holds a special place in his heart: the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.\n\n\u201cI remember walking through one of those long Coliseum tunnels, and when you start getting to the light at the end of the tunnel, I remember as a kid walking out and I\u2019d never seen that much green grass in my life,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nFollowing the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 debut at the Coliseum in 1958, Shaw began to frequently attend Dodgers games with his mother. Shaw said no game was more memorable than when Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax equaled the record for strikeouts in a National League game against the San Francisco Giants on Aug. 31, 1959.\n\n\u201cIt was unbelievable.\u201d\n\nDon Shaw's game ticket and a newspaper clipping from the L.A.

(Photo courtesy of Don Shaw)\n\nKoufax\u2019s record game is one of the many historic events the Coliseum staff is reflecting on for its Centennial Celebration \u2013 the 100th birthday of the Coliseum. Initially starting construction in December 1921, the Coliseum took 18 months to complete before its May 1, 1923 groundbreaking ceremony.\n\nAccording to Marina Fote, the assistant to the general manager of the Coliseum, part of the reason for the Coliseum\u2019s construction was to provide a central location for athletic competition in many forms, including an added boost to L.A.\u2019s bid for the 1932 Summer Olympics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been incredible to see how this building can transform into really anything a client can imagine, even going so far as to make it into a race track,\u201d said Fote, alluding to the NASCAR Clash at the Coliseum that debuted in 2022, one of many new and different events the Coliseum is seeking to host in the future as well as the upcoming Super MotoCross World Championship in September.\n\nThe setup for the NASCAR Clash at the Coliseum, the smallest track NASCAR drivers have ever had to race on. (Photo courtesy of LA Memorial Coliseum)\n\nThe Coliseum has been the home stadium for a plethora of L.A. teams including USC Football, UCLA Football, the Dodgers, Rams, Chargers and Raiders. In addition, the Coliseum has also hosted two Super Bowls, three NFL Championships and a World Series. The Coliseum has also been a concert venue for the most world renowned musicians including Drake, the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, U2 and more. The venue also takes pride in its six presidential visits and hosting rallies for historic leaders such as John F. Kennedy, Nelson Mandela, Pope John Paul II and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nAnother reason for the Coliseum\u2019s construction was for it to serve as a memorial for those who served in World War I, hence the \u201cmemorial\u201d in its name. To celebrate its centennial anniversary, the Coliseum launched a marketing campaign called \u201cColiseum Forever,\u201d highlighting the many historic events to take place in the venue and encouraging fans to remember their experiences and \u201cTell Your Coliseum Story.\u201d\n\nAlong with tying the anniversary celebration into different events this year, the Coliseum is lighting the Torch from sunrise to sundown on the first of every month as tribute to the groundbreaking ceremony taking place on May 1, according to Fote.\n\nThe Torch is lit on the first of every month this year to celebrate the Coliseum's Centennial. (Photo courtesy of LA Memorial Coliseum)\n\nJoe Furin, the general manager of the Coliseum, said he\u2019s grateful for the venue\u2019s storied past.\n\n\u201cWe are very fortunate to have a legacy that\u2019s untouchable,\u201d said Furin, a USC alum. Furin began working at the Coliseum in 1986 as a marketing intern and worked his way up to event manager before leaving in 1994 to pursue other opportunities in the same industry before returning to the Coliseum in 2011 as assistant general manager. Not long after USC took over the stadium\u2019s operations, Furin was promoted to general manager.\n\n\u201cThis was not a 9-to-5 cubicle job,\u201d Furin said. \u201cMy office was a football field. My office was the Sports Arena and we got Bruce Springsteen coming in. So how can that not be exciting for anyone?\u201d\n\nWhile the stadium is celebrating 100 years of history, Furin said the Coliseum team\u2019s approach \u201chas been to weave and integrate all our current opportunities and the ones on the horizon really with this celebration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a celebration of a hundred years of an incredible legacy and a bridge to the next hundred years,\u201d Furin said. \u201cWe were careful to look at this as not a celebration of a moment in time and, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s get a birthday cake and celebrate everything we did.\u2019 It\u2019s more important to talk about how we\u2019re in the middle of an incredibly ongoing legacy and we want to recognize what occurred in the first century, but this is all about as we move forward.\u201d\n\nFote said she believes the Coliseum team is \u201cthe most supportive group.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been called \u2018the greatest stadium in the world\u2019 by the NFL, as well as \u2018the best in the business,\u2019\u201d Fote said. \u201cSo those are two monikers that we take very seriously.\u201d\n\nScott Lupold, the associate director of sports turf at the Coliseum, agrees with Fote and couldn\u2019t imagine \u201chaving a better staff.\u201d Lupold, 40, started working at the Coliseum in 2017, but has been a USC football fan since he was a little kid.\n\n\u201cThe draw of that alone sets this place apart more so than others,\u201d Lupold said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty cool place to come in and be around every day.\u201d\n\nFireworks at a USC Trojans Football game in the Coliseum. (Photo courtesy of LA Memorial Coliseum)\n\nLupold said his favorite part of the job is coming into work before anyone else on a game day and seeing an entire empty stadium ready for a football game, knowing 80,000 people will soon enter and see all the work his team did.\n\nFor Lupold, being a part of the Coliseum\u2019s Centennial is incredibly meaningful.\n\n\u201cIt just feels like it\u2019s a little bit bigger than yourself,\u201d Lupold said. \u201cIt\u2019s been around here for so long, so just being around something that gives you that feeling that something is bigger than what you\u2019ve done in the past is pretty special.\u201d\n\nAmidst their celebrations, the Coliseum is also preparing to host events for the 2028 Summer Olympics, becoming the only venue in the entire world to have hosted three Olympic games (1932, 1984). The Coliseum will host part of the opening ceremonies and construct an elevated track on top of the field for track and field events, according to Fote.\n\nJeff Root, a former Air Force Officer stationed at the Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo, attended the 1984 Olympics at the Coliseum and was impressed with how long the venue\u2019s been around.\n\n\u201cI think the Coliseum is iconic even though in 1984 it was getting old and very old now,\u201d said Root, 68. \u201cIt was very meaningful to attend a venue that is such a big part of Los Angeles\u2019 history.\u201d\n\nAlthough Root puts the Coliseum in his lower percentile of favorite venues he\u2019s been to due to its old structure, he\u2019s grateful that he was able to experience a large piece of Los Angeles\u2019 history.\n\n\u201cA big part of it is the spectacle. All the people, the cheerleaders, the concessions and so forth,\u201d Root said.\n\nThe Coliseum\u2019s resemblance to the iconic Colosseum in Rome isn\u2019t only a beautiful aspect of the building, but actually acts as a sound amplifier according to Elliot McKenzie, an R&B singer who performed the national anthem in the Coliseum at a Rams game.\n\n\u201cThe oval shape of the stands on the inside make for really good acoustics,\u201d said McKenzie, 38. \u201cWhenever the audience would scream or cheer, it was extremely loud and it felt very energetic in the building ... I\u2019ve never heard an audience cheer that loud before.\u201d\n\nElliot McKenzie performing the National Anthem at the L.A. Rams vs. Chicago Bears game at the Coliseum on Nov. 17, 2019. (Photo courtesy of Elliot McKenzie)\n\nMcKenzie said his Coliseum performance was his \u201cbest and most exciting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would definitely put it at the top,\u201d McKenzie said.\n\nFor some fans, it\u2019s the Coliseum\u2019s structure and design that captivates them.\n\n\u201cI was always amazed by the Peristyle end of the Coliseum,\u201d said Sal Martinez, 60. \u201cI always thought it was just as special as the Hollywood sign.\u201d\n\nMartinez, a lifelong Los Angeles Rams fan, said that no stadium can compare to the Coliseum because of its history and sense of community, created by local residents who used to let fans park on their front lawns for a small fee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to a lot of stadiums throughout being a diehard Rams fan,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell people now even today there\u2019s a lot of new stadiums that are built, but nothing compares to walking through the dark tunnel and it\u2019s like all of a sudden you see this bright light and it\u2019s like football heaven for anybody that enjoys history.\u201d\n\nWhen the Rams returned to Los Angeles in 2016, Martinez and his daughter were thrilled for the opportunity to root for their favorite team in the Coliseum again. They attended their first Rams game day at the Coliseum together.\n\nAs a gift to her father, Sal Martinez's daughter made a photo collection in the shape of the Coliseum entrance with photos of her and her father cheering on the Los Angeles Rams. (Photo courtesy of Sal Martinez)\n\nMartinez is happy for the Rams to have found a \u201cnew and beautiful\u201d home in Sofi Stadium in Inglewood, but he\u2019d still rather attend games at the Coliseum.\n\n\u201cGive me a stale hot dog, a warm beer and my football team at the Coliseum,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I prefer.\u201d\n\nFurin said the Coliseum plans to continue setting the bar high for its events while adapting to all things evolving.\n\n\u201c20 years ago, it was okay to say, \u2018we have food and beverage, hot dogs and beers.\u2019 Now, it\u2019s we have a culinary program and we offer a variety of elevated experiences,\u201d Furin said.\n\nWith a combined 20 years of working at the Coliseum, Furin feels grateful to be a part of the historic celebration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate to have a long career, and so to wrap my career up being part of a 100th anniversary and bridging into the next century of opportunity is special to me,\u201d Furin said.\n\nAnd obviously, Furin believes no other venue can compare to the Coliseum.\n\n\u201cHow many buildings are 100 years old, the size and scale of the Coliseum and able to put in 50 to 60 to 70,000 people through here on a regular basis?\u201d\n```"}

In those final days before the start of the fall semester, Tropical Storm Hilary loomed large and students and faculty shared anxiety about making it to the first day of classes.\n\nThe Office of the Senior Vice President for Administration sent an email Sunday night reassuring the USC Community that campus for the most part \u201cwill continue to operate normally, and classes for the fall semester will begin on Monday, August 21 as planned.\u201d\n\nKhamani Griffin, a senior majoring in communication, expected classes to continue in some form, as it was predicted that Hilary would just graze Los Angeles. \u201cIt does seem that as time went on, not only did the hurricane downgrade in severity and scale, but also in size and actual tangible effect on most of the major metropolitan areas that we came in contact with, like USC, for example, deciding to hold classes seemed representative of that.\u201d\n\nGriffin was grateful to have professors move classes online in anticipation of the weather. \u201cI was really appreciative of how accommodating the university professors were in offering the Zoom options in the face of a potential hurricane,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cIt would have been really nice if the vast majority of professors followed through with this, because I do have housemates that were forced to be on campus today as a result of attending classes, and I know that was a cause for concern.\u201d\n\nMichelle Garcia Vazquez, a senior majoring in health and human sciences, also experienced the accommodating nature of professors in her second class of the day, which \u201cwas held in-person; however, the professor did offer an option to be able to take that class through Zoom,\u201d Vazquez said. While her third and final class \u201cwas completely canceled\u201d in favor of the professor making \u201ca recording [that the class] can watch asynchronously.\u201d\n\nAccording to Vazquez, the professor of health, gender and ethnicity, \u201csaid that she was concerned for everyone\u2019s safety and that she felt it would be best to cancel the class and just have that through Zoom, so that we can watch it whenever we feel is best, given the unprecedented storm conditions.\u201d\n\nA professor in the psychology department, Dr. David Lavond, walked into his Seeley G.

As to the extent of the water damage, Dr. Lavond \u201ccan\u2019t fully tell\u201d even after moving things around, having to soak up water from his chair and learning that there is a work order in place \u201cto fix the leak and to replace the [ceiling] tile.\u201d\n\nGriffin\u2019s classroom in the Seeley G.

(Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson August 21, 2023 at 6:01 pm PDT\n\nUSC and the University of Washington are currently on similar tracks. They are both starting their last year in the Pac-12 and are poised to make a move to the Big Ten in August of next year. They are two of the preeminent athletic brands on the West Coast. They both have Heisman candidates leading their football teams this year in USC\u2019s junior quarterback Caleb Williams and UW\u2019s senior quarterback Michael Penix Jr. And now, the two schools have an athletic director connection as Jennifer Cohen is taking over the position for the Trojans after holding the same job at UW since 2016.\n\nCohen has her work cut out for her as she prepares to move USC to a new conference, but she showed she could handle it in her time at UW. In her six school years at UW, the Huskies won 19 conference championships \u2014 including two in football \u2014 and made a trip to the College Football Playoff in 2016. Cohen was in charge of 18 sports as UW\u2019s AD and will see that number rise to 21 at USC.\n\n\u201cWe can win a national championship in all 21 of our sports,\u201d Cohen said during a press conference Monday. \u201cAnd at the same time, we can graduate our student-athletes with transferable skills that better prepares them for life after college.\u201d\n\nWhile many expected USC to hire an athletic director with ties to the Big Ten, USC President Carol Folt and her hiring committee decided to go with Cohen, a Southern California native with nearly three decades worth of experience in the Pac-12.\n\n\u201cI admired USC for a long time and have the roots and ties here \u2014 I think that\u2019s helpful,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cBut I think what\u2019s most helpful is just my body of work, of experience, and what I bring holistically to the athletic department.\u201d\n\nCohen also helped orchestrate the plan to move UW to the Big Ten, which likely means she knows what has to happen for USC to be ready for a new conference, despite not having that intimate knowledge of the Big Ten.\n\n\u201cI spent a lot of time studying the Big Ten in my previous role, understanding the dynamics of the Big Ten, benchmarking the Big Ten from a salary standpoint, from a performance standpoint, from a facilities standpoint, and so I have a lot of that understanding already in preparation for where I was before,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nUSC Athletics is at a pivotal point as it prepares to enter a new conference, but also because of the scandal surrounding former athletic director Mike Bohn\u2019s resignation in May, citing health reasons for his departure. Despite Bohn\u2019s sudden resignation and the subsequent search for a new AD, as Cohen pointed out at the press conference, many of USC\u2019s sports have momentum heading into this season.\n\nThe football team was recently ranked No. 6 in the preseason AP poll. The men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams both made the NCAA tournament in the same season for the first time since the 1996-97 season. Beach volleyball has won national championships in three straight seasons.\n\nLikely a factor in hiring Cohen is her membership on the College Football Playoff committee. USC football, which starts its season on Saturday against San Jose State, is poised to make a run to the CFP this season. It certainly does not hurt to have the USC athletic director on the 13-person selection committee as the Trojans look to be playing in either the Rose Bowl or Sugar Bowl, the two CFP semifinal games this season, come Jan. 1.\n\nCohen also enters the job at a pivotal point in college athletics in general. Conference realignment has bolstered the SEC, Big Ten and Big 12, but has debilitated the Pac-12. She will also have to navigate USC\u2019s NIL plan.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of experience in building out an NIL program at my previous institution, and I\u2019ll be rolling up my sleeves to support our coaches in any way possible,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAnd most important, give our student-athletes the opportunities they deserve.\u201d\n\nIn her introductory speech, Cohen focused on providing the best student-athlete experience in the country, as she herself has two sons who are athletes at other universities. Cohen starts her quest to do just that when she starts working at Heritage Hall on Tuesday.\n```"}

Cohen replaces Mike Bohn, who stepped down from the role in May citing health reasons.\n\n\u201cThere was one clear candidate who stood out from the rest, who met our criteria, who energized us all with a passion and determination to go above and beyond,\u201d Folt said at Cohen\u2019s introductory press conference. \u201cThrough her long career working in athletics, [Cohen] knows how to build and run a professional athletics operation that feels like everybody belongs.\u201d\n\nFolt announced that Cohen is set to take over as USC\u2019s 10th athletic director effective Tuesday. Cohen is the first woman to serve as USC\u2019s athletic director and will be the only female AD in the Pac-12 until the university transitions to the Big Ten in 2024. Under Cohen\u2019s guidance, Washington also recently announced its planned move to the Big Ten in recent weeks.\n\nDuring her tenure in Seattle, Cohen oversaw the Huskies\u2019 trip to the College Football Playoff in 2016, and she currently serves as a member of the CFP committee as well. Her hiring of Kalen DeBoer as the Huskies\u2019 football coach proved to be immediately successful, as Washington finished 11-2 in his first season last year.\n\nBefore her promotion to athletic director at Washington, she spent several years in the department\u2019s fundraising program. Cohen has a personal connection to Southern California, as she was born in Arcadia and graduated from San Diego State in 1991.\n\n\u201cThis is extra special for me and very meaningful to come back to my original roots to lead a storied and iconic athletic program at one of the most prestigious universities in the world,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nAfter her successful tenure at Washington, Cohen jumps to a rather tumultuous job with USC. The athletic department has dealt with numerous scandals in recent years; for instance, the LA Times reported that Bohn fostered a hostile work environment and made inappropriate comments about female colleagues while leading the USC athletic department.\n\nCohen will also oversee USC\u2019s own shift to the Big Ten next year, in addition to maneuvering through a chaotic period in college sports in the era of NIL.\n\n\u201cWhen you have momentum like we have here, there is no rest,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to put our foot on the gas, and we\u2019ve got to accelerate, so we can continue to elevate. ... One of the main priorities for us is to cultivate the best student-athlete experience in America.\u201d```"}

(Photo Courtesy of Scott Rovak)\n\nBy Oliver Marks August 20, 2023 at 2:08 pm PDT\n\nThey take the perfect shot, but they\u2019re not in the NBA. They get thousands of hits, but they\u2019re not in the MLB. They have millions of followers, but the average sports fan doesn\u2019t even know their names. The sports photographer is a skilled player on an ever-changing field where new technology and social media have dramatically altered how fans interact with sports.\n\nNew technology is \u201cdefinitely\u201d changing the sports photography industry, professional sports photographer Troy Taormina said. Gear such as drones, automatically triggered remote rigs, and mirrorless cameras are being used now more than ever. Drones allow for new, unique perspectives of the game, from any angle imaginable. Remote rigs give the photographer the ability to shoot from multiple places at once and still get that perfect moment. Mirrorless cameras capture crisp images, firing up to 30 pictures per second.\n\nScott Rovak, a team photographer for the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Blues, said that the biggest change for him was the jump from film to digital to mirrorless cameras, which added breathtaking speed to a photographer\u2019s bag of tricks. Rovak, a 40-year veteran in the industry, shared a story about the lengths hockey photographers went through in order to get the perfect shot before remote shutters were invented.\n\n\u201cBack in those days, one guy put a camera in the net. And because they didn\u2019t have radio triggers back then, basically, the ice people, they melted a line in the ice and he put down a wire and then they refroze over it and so you can actually hardwire a camera in the net,\u201d Rovak said.\n\nSince then, net shots have become a staple of hockey photography and a technique that Rovak himself has utilized in his work with the Blues. A netcam shot of the Captain scoring his 20th goal of the season. (Photo Courtesy of Scott Rovak)\n\nNet shots aren\u2019t the only way photographers are using new technologies. Photographers are creating innovative shots by mounting cameras anywhere from the top of the rafters to down on the floor, and even onto drones to catch a perspective no human has ever seen.\n\nAs technology advances, it also becomes more accessible. \u201cAnybody picks up a camera and gets, you know, a good picture. They think they\u2019re a sports photographer,\u201d Rovak said. Rovak recalled letting his uncle try out his camera at a ballgame; after explaining how he tries to capture the emotion of the moment, Rovak challenged his uncle to snap the pitcher at the release point.\n\n\u201cOh, you mean like this,\u201d Rovak\u2019s uncle said. He looked over to see that his uncle, \u201cKind of nailed it,\u201d Rovak said. \u201cI looked at him and I said, \u2018Yeah, do it again.\u2019\u201d He couldn\u2019t.\n\nCamera technology isn\u2019t the only innovation revolutionizing sports photography. The current direction of sports photography is \u201cmore social media driven,\u201d Rovak said. In a world where print news and magazines are receding, social media is transcending.\n\nMiki Turner, a renowned photojournalist and USC professor said, \u201cI think that social media has definitely enhanced a lot of careers...we\u2019re able to see who\u2019s shooting what and how good they are.\u201d\n\nNot only has social media changed the way sports photographers find exposure, it has also changed their role. Rovak believes that professional sports photography has traditionally had two sides: the editorial side and the commercial side. When team photographers take pictures, they\u2019re not trying to show the players in a bad light. Even if a team or player underperforms, the team wants the content they put out to be encouraging and optimistic because they believe there\u2019s always another story to tell.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers forward Tobias Harris sits on the sidelines during a home game. (Photo Courtesy of Alex Subers)\n\nEditorial photographers, however, try to capture the story of the game. They don\u2019t care about how one specific player or team looks. But this puts the spotlight on the athletes and is just a small sliver of the kinds of stories a photographer might want to tell, which could include displaying a wider variety of emotion in the athletes.\n\nAlex Subers, a photographer with an active social media presence who formerly worked for the Philadelphia 76er\u2019s and currently works as the content manager for Fanatics Inc., says when photographing games, he looks for the \u201cquiet moments.\u201d Subers looks for moments that show detail that a fan wouldn\u2019t otherwise see, such as how exhausted players listen to their coach during a timeout, or the anticipation on an athlete\u2019s face during the national anthem.\n\nThese shots may not serve a team or publication but still intrigue an audience. To get these pictures out to fans, many photographers have their own personal pages where they share the broad spectrum of their work, showing more of the stories they want to tell as they simultaneously market themselves.\n\nIn some cases, the sports photographer becomes the focal point, obtaining a greater following than some of the athletes they cover. The Philadelphia 76ers put their hands together during a team huddle. (Photo Courtesy of Alex Subers)\n\nBut while social networks have endowed some photographers with new artistic freedom, the same platforms have flooded the market with new photographers who work for free. \u201cThe industry has kind of flopped,\u201d Rovak said. Jobs that were once available to print photographers fell with the rise of social media.\n\nDespite social media making sports photography more accessible, the professional industry has become more exclusive, with only the top photographers receiving the remaining paid gigs in a publishing market that has essentially stalled. Additionally, the immediacy of social media has forced professional photographers to race against millions of smartphone-clicking spectators to get exciting live photos out quickly.\n\nThis competition leaves photographers feeling rushed and that they are putting too much effort into speed instead of doing their best work. \u201cThe fact that people want to see stuff right away, kind of changes how we shoot a lot of the time,\u201d Rovak said. He isn\u2019t a fan of the change. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s like just tell the story of the game, don\u2019t miss anything, and then after the game, send the pictures.\u201d\n\nWhile technological developments have imposed some logistical and financial challenges, many sports photographers believe that they have endless creative possibilities. Those opportunities are seen as the emergence of new technology shifts the culture towards the new generation, who some photographers look to for inspiration.\n\n\u201cWhat really influences me is looking at what kids are doing now,\u201d Taormina said. He enjoys seeing ideas come to life on camera through innovative angles and shots.\n\nDespite the industry changing, Taormina said he \u201c[doesn\u2019t] know where it\u2019s gonna go.\u201d In a world that is constantly changing, there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s certain. Although the art form of sports photography continues to evolve with technology, the raw emotion and excitement that sports photographers share with fans will never change.\n```"}

Behind it all is the Concerts Committee \u2014 an organization run entirely by students who have spent the entire summer planning for the event. Welcome Back is only the first of the concerts the Committee hosts; they also plan Conquest the week of the USC-UCLA football game and SpringFest in the spring semester.\n\nIn the past, the Concerts Committee has booked headliners such as Migos, Childish Gambino and Post Malone, all huge artists who have set a precedent for how great the concerts can be. \u201cWe try to balance what artists we think are going to be big in the next few years. That way we can get artists where they\u2019re small,\u201d said senior Riley Wheaton, the co-director of the Concerts Committee.\n\nThe committee is \u201cmanaging our own expectations\u201d for who they can book, said Shea Hanke, the Concerts Committee co-director. \u201cAs far as the booking process, a lot of it is super out of our control,\u201d Wheaton said. The committee is not only confined by their budget, which is set by the Undergraduate Student Government and supplemented by sponsors, but by which artists are available to perform.\n\nThe Concerts Committee largely books through \u201ccollege agents.\u201d Sometimes the committee has a specific artist in mind, but otherwise the agent gives them a roster of artists available to colleges for them to choose from. The committee tries to put together a lineup with artists from a variety of genres to appeal to different students. \u201cIt was kinda like putting together a puzzle,\u201d Wheaton said.\n\nWith so many different artists and genres students are interested in, the committee feels the pressure to put on a good show. \u201cIt\u2019s really nerve wracking to be the one booking the acts. It\u2019s super exciting, but there is always that worry of like, are people going to enjoy this and be super excited about it?\u201d Hanke said.\n\nUltimately, who can perform comes down to what the committee can afford, Hanke said. Despite receiving the most money of any Recognized Student Organization and accounting for 22% of USG\u2019s total budget, money is the committee\u2019s biggest concern. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much [money] to go around and we want everyone to have the funds that they deserve to have. But it\u2019s just like when you\u2019re working with the limited amount, it\u2019s like, what is that going to look like?\u201d Wheaton said.\n\nThis summer, USG cut the Concerts Committee\u2019s budget from $574,300 to $542,000, a 5.5% decrease. At a meeting to discuss USG\u2019s 2023-24 budget, senator Brandon Tavakoli said the Concerts Committee\u2019s budget is  \u201cunjustifiably high\u201d  despite the cuts. Wheaton doesn\u2019t blame USG for the budget decrease. \u201cThe budget that they are giving from student programing fees that goes into like the USG pool, it\u2019s quite honestly not USG\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not enough proportionally for how expensive things are now,\u201d Wheaton said.\n\nWheaton said most of the money doesn\u2019t go towards booking acts, but rather all of the other costs students may take for granted, like production, infrastructure and even the signage and fliers posted around campus. For the Welcome Back concert, only reserving McCarthy Quad is free. Everything else on site, even the porta potties and the fences that enclose the venue, is paid for by the Concerts Committee. Their USG budget is supplemented by sponsors, but the executive board says it\u2019s not enough. \u201cUnfortunately, sometimes it\u2019s just still hard to get a ton of extra supplemental funds,\u201d Hanke said.\n\nPutting on concerts post-COVID has become much more expensive, Wheaton said. Because the live music industry suffered so much during the pandemic, many workers moved onto different industries and physical equipment, like stages, were sold for liquidity. This shortage of labor and infrastructure is at odds with the now-high demand for concerts, leading to higher prices.\n\nDespite concerns about money, the Concerts Committee is excited for the upcoming year, particularly their newly-created community outreach subcommittee. Jordan Rosen, a sophomore studying public relations and music industry, was hired over the summer as the director of community outreach. Rosen\u2019s hope is to \u201ccreate new events on campus that can feature both music, since we\u2019re the Concerts Committee, and nonprofit activism and engagement as well,\u201d he said.\n\nThe subcommittee had been in the works since the fall of last year, Rosen said. He is currently in talks with nonprofits in the hopes that they can be featured at the Concerts Committee\u2019s events to raise awareness for their causes. While the community outreach efforts will not be featured at Welcome Back, the Concerts Committee is hoping to roll them out during Conquest and Springfest.\n\n\u201cI think a big overarching goal that [we] have is to really reintroduce the ethos of the Concerts Committee to campus,\u201d Hanke said.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Alex Gallardo)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan August 16, 2023 at 9:00 am PDT\n\nThe Leagues Cup in review\n\nOne LA team can walk away from the Leagues Cup with their heads held high; the other should be hitting the panic button. I think you can guess who\u2019s who.\n\nAfter enduring a shaky July that saw them win just one match, LAFC immediately bounced back to form in the Leagues Cup. As noted previously, the downtown club earned a bye to the round of 32 as MLS Cup champs, so skipping the group stage gave them about two and a half weeks to rest and work on the training ground. It certainly helped.\n\nThe team scored 13 goals in their three matches but unfortunately lost to Liga MX titans C.F. Monterrey 2-3 in the quarterfinal. If Monterrey win the tournament (they have the second-best odds to do so, behind only Messi\u2019s Inter Miami), LAFC will come away looking even better.\n\nMost importantly, LAFC crushed Real Salt Lake 4-0, with Denis Bouanga scoring twice in the second half and assisting youngster Nathan Ordaz as well. Salt Lake sit in third in the MLS\u2019 Western Conference (currently level on points with LAFC, who have played one fewer game), so beating them thoroughly bodes well for the remainder of the season.\n\nWhat else bodes well, you ask? Bouanga looks like a legit MLS MVP candidate. Including LAFC\u2019s 7-1 demolition of FC Ju\u00e1rez, Bouanga scored six goals and provided three assists in this tournament, adding to his 12 MLS goals and two assists. Only Nashville\u2019s Hany Mukhtar can hold a candle to Bouanga among current players in North America.\n\nThe defensive collapse against Monterrey should worry fans slightly, but the team\u2019s attack makes them as dangerous as any team in MLS and affirms their status as a Contender for the Cup TM.\n\nThe Galaxy, however, saw their Big Bang in early July turn into a dumpster fire. It\u2019s hard to say that the Galaxy have had any \u201cpositive momentum\u201d in 2023, but entering the Leagues Cup, they appeared to have found some decent form.\n\nFrom June 11 to July 8, the team drew four games and won two, with both wins coming against last season\u2019s MLS Cup finalists \u2014 LAFC and the Philadelphia Union. Riqui Puig had earned an All-Star appearance and was playing the best football of his MLS career so far.\n\nIt came crashing down rather quickly. The Galaxy lost both Leagues Cup matches, scoring just one goal and missing the knockout stage entirely. To make matters worse, the Galaxy\u2019s first Leagues Cup opponents, Le\u00f3n, had a travel nightmare going from Vancouver to Los Angeles that forced the match to be delayed.\n\nWith Le\u00f3n\u2019s travel disrupted, the visiting players\u2019 bodies would\u2019ve been discombobulated and their training limited \u2014 the Galaxy faced them at the perfect time. Yet, they couldn\u2019t even score. The match reminded Galaxy fans that the striker position is a black hole for them.\n\nPreston Judd has caught (perhaps unfair) strays in this column for his former frosted tips, but with every passing week, he looks more like a USL Championship player, not an MLS one. The 24-year-old American took zero shots against Le\u00f3n and completed four of his eight attempted passes.\n\nA striker either needs to take shots and make incisive passes, but Judd can\u2019t do either. It\u2019s odd that head coach Greg Vanney persists with him, when Dejan Joveli\u0107 could at least offer more of a threat in front of goal.\n\nThe Galaxy aren\u2019t mathematically out of the MLS playoff race yet, but they\u2019ll need to become a totally different team to qualify. By the time the Galaxy return to action, they will have had three weeks off from games \u2014even more time than LAFC just had\u2014 so maybe the downtime will help them blood the new signings.\n\nEdwin Cerillo (from FC Dallas) will provide solid midfield depth and Michael Barrios (from the Colorado Rapids) could give Tyler Boyd a rest at right wing, but Diego Fag\u00fandez will have Galaxy fans most excited. Don\u2019t expect him to score much, though. The Uruguayan-American has just two goals in 2023.\n\nA World Cup from hell\n\nI didn\u2019t miss anything from the Women\u2019s World Cup while on vacation, right? I assume the U.S. women\u2019s national team waltzed into the semifinals? I wish it were true.\n\nAs everyone surely knows, the USWNT limped into the round of 16 having finished second in Group E and lost to their perennial World Cup rivals Sweden on penalties.\n\nI\u2019m no doctor, but if I had to diagnose the problem, the USWNT simply lacked efficiency and ruthlessness in front of goal. The U.S. outshot the Netherlands 18 to five, Portugal 17 to four and Sweden 22 to nine and scored exactly one goal between those three games.\n\nFor contrast, semifinalists England had just 10 shots against tournament upstarts Colombia in the quarterfinals, but still managed to score twice in regular time to seal the game. In the round of 16, Australia also had a shot deficit against Denmark, but the Matildas scored twice without their star striker Sam Kerr even on the pitch.\n\nThe best tournament teams convert whatever chances they create and find solutions with their backs against the wall. No Kerr? No problem, Australia said. Against Colombia, England were missing Lauren James, who scored twice and assisted three goals against China in the final group game, due to suspension.\n\nThey kept calm, plugged Ella Toone into James\u2019 position and carried on. U.S. fans can whine about pre-tournament injuries to Mallory Swason, Becky Sauerbrunn or Catarina Macario, but ultimately they had enough talent to win this tournament (or at least make the semis).\n\nThe team, and head coach Vlatko Andonovski, however, did not find solutions in difficult situations. It\u2019s hard to see Andonovski keeping his job through the next World Cup cycle.\n\nIf anything, the U.S. Soccer Federation should try and poach the Australian women\u2019s national team coach Tony Gustavsson \u2014 a former Jill Ellis assistant who won the World Cup as part of the U.S. staff in 2019 \u2014 for the masterful way he\u2019s handled Kerr\u2019s injury and taken the Matildas to their first World Cup semifinal.\n\nBy 2027, the USWNT will have fully flushed out the Rapinoe-Morgan-Ertz generation and Sophia Smith, Trinity Rodman and Swanson can run the show. Even if the rest of the world has \u201ccaught up\u201d to the U.S., I\u2019ll still take that front three against anyone (not to mention Alyssa Thompson).\n\nThe disappointment is real, but the future remains bright.\n\nNeymar to LAFC: What if?\n\nNeymar da Silva Santos J\u00fanior has become the latest big-name player to sign for a Saudi Arabian club (Al Hilal in this case), following Karim Benzema, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Riyad Mahrez from earlier this summer.\n\nHowever, transfer guru (and guy who probably averages 2.3 hours of sleep per night) Fabrizio Romano reported that Neymar received MLS offers before a potential $400 million contract swayed him to choose the Saudi Pro League.\n\nSupposedly, LAFC was one of the clubs considering a move for Neymar. Neymar, who is tied with Pel\u00e9 for most all-time Brazil goals, won\u2019t join the hunt for the 2023 MLS Cup, but the rumors got me thinking: what if Neymar did join LAFC?\n\nWhat position would he play? How would he perform? Would LAFC automatically be the league\u2019s best team?\n\nWhat lies below is my Neymar-to-LAFC thought exercise, in bullet point form:\n\n\u2022 Outside of Messi, Neymar would immediately become the second-best player to ever play in the MLS. Galaxy fans might argue that Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 occupies that title, but at his peak, Neymar legitimately threatened the Messi-Ronaldo duopoly.\n\n\u2022 If Neymar had joined this summer, LAFC would have the most talented trio of attackers in the league. A front three of Carlos Vela, Denis Bouanga and Neymar would have the ability to rotate positions and create goals at will.\n\n\u2022 He favors the left wing, but could also play as a No. 10 behind an unconventional front two of Vela and Bouanga.\n\n\u2022 While Neymar struggled with injuries in the 2022/23 season, when he did play, he created 0.77 non-penalty expected goals and assists per 90 minutes, meaning he contributed chances worth about three goals for every four games (per FBRef). That ranks in the 99th percentile.\n\n\u2022 In real terms, he even outperformed his \u201cexpected\u201d totals, scoring 13 goals and accumulating 11 assists in Ligue 1 in just 20 games played, to go along with two goals and two assists in the Champions League group stages.\n\n\u2022 Again, outside of Messi, MLS has never seen a player who was this productive in Europe so recently.\n\n\u2022 The Brazilian star has one of the world\u2019s worst injury records (and has a reputation of taking time off during the season to party), so it\u2019s unclear how seriously he would take MLS and how much he would actually play.\n\n\u2022 Whereas Messi appears to have fully bought into his new club and immediately carried them to a tournament semifinal, we\u2019ve also seen the likes of Gareth Bale use the MLS as essentially a pre-World Cup retreat.\n\n\u2022 The Welshman played a surprisingly vital role in winning LAFC the MLS Cup, but started just two matches for the club.\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s unclear where Neymar would fall on the Messi-to-Bale spectrum.\n\n\u2022 Neymar will sign only a two-year contract with Al Hilal, meaning he could still play in MLS sooner rather than later. In the summer of 2025 (when his Saudi deal expires), Neymar will still only be 33, three years younger than Messi is currently.\n\n\u2022 Al Hilal or another Saudi team could easily throw bags of money at him to stay, but Neymar had fairly positive things to say about his former teammate\u2019s move to Inter Miami and attended Game 4 of the NBA Finals earlier this summer in ... Miami.\n\n\u2022 Playing at any MLS club would bring Neymar closer to his home country, which must appeal to him (I think we can count Minnesota United out of the sweepstakes, though).\n\n\u2022 So, it seems like Neymar might eventually want to play in MLS. Both LA teams could be on the table in two years, but might Neymar prefer to sign with Inter Miami, where he\u2019d become Messi\u2019s supposed successor once again? Only time will tell.\n\nNext games:\n\nLAFC: Sunday, Aug. 20 vs. Colorado Rapids (home \u2014 I will be attending!)\n\nAngel City: Saturday, Aug. 19 vs. Racing Louisville (away)\n\nLA Galaxy: Sunday, Aug. 20 vs. Real Salt Lake (home)\n\n\u201cSoCal Soccer Spotlight\u201d is a column by Jack Hallinan about the professional soccer landscape in Los Angeles.\n```"}

(Photo by Yannick Peterhans)\n\nBy Taylor Marie Contarino August 16, 2023 at 6:24 am PDT\n\nThis year marks the 50th anniversary of the birth of the musical genre of hip-hop. How do we know the birthday of a musical genre that took the world by storm? Let\u2019s take a trip down memory lane. Hip-hop music first received recognition in the Bronx, New York, on the evening of August 11, 1973. At a back-to-school party in an apartment\u2019s recreational center, DJ Kool Herc spun tracks for his sister who had been throwing the party. With a quality sound system, the 18-year-old DJed the party. What party-goers couldn\u2019t know was they were watching \u2014 and hearing \u2014 the foundations being laid for a musical genre that still continues to be revolutionary five decades later.\n\nOn that crucial night, Herc spun a series of genres, including jazz, blues, rock\u2019n\u2019roll, R&B, funk and more. It was not these genres that was most important, however. It was the way he organized the sound. He looped the tracks on two turntables in such a way that the beats \u2014 and the dancing \u2014 never stopped.\n\nBecause of the contributions of Herc, the hip-hop space became dominated by DJs. Later, spurred by the release of \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight\u201d by Sugarhill Gang, hip-hop continued to develop and the spotlight gave way to MCs and musicians on the microphone.\n\nHow can you get involved with hip-hop music at USC?\n\nMusic 320: Hip-hop Music and Culture\nAs an undergraduate general education course, USC offers \u201cHip-hop Music and Culture\u201d taught in the past by Professors Sean Nye and Jae Deal. This course satisfies a GE requirement and can be taken across any majors, minors and program.\n\nHip-hop dance organizations\nUSC is home to a variety of registered student organizations (RSOs). These include several hip-hop focused dance groups including Break Through Hip Hop.\n\nUSC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance\nUSC Kaufman offers a minor known as \u201cThe Hip-Hop, Street and Social Dance Forms Minor\u201d and they also offer hip-hop dance classes each semester, ranging from beginner to advanced.\n\nHip-Hop Maymester in Paris\nUSC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance offers a hip-hop Maymester in Paris each year taught by instructor Edwin C.

{"key": "/2023/08/09/put-down-your-booktok-book-and-pick-up-one-of-these-recommendations-instead/", "response": "```\nPut down your BookTok book and pick up one of these recommendations instead\n\nExpand your summer reading list with this hand-picked alternatives to your favorite BookTok books\n\nBy Grace Harrington August 09, 2023 at 12:00 pm PDT\n\nEvery time I go on TikTok for book recommendations, I\u2019m met with a sad state of affairs. I have to believe that the current literary landscape consists of more than young adult fantasy/romance novels or just plain erotica. Still, you wouldn\u2019t know that by getting your recommendations from TikTok. I promise that I\u2019m not the only person who goes on TikTok for book recommendations. Almost 40% of Gen Z uses TikTok and Instagram as search engines instead of Google. Gen Z users cite the personal reviews that TikTok provides as merit against Google. No better example of that is BookTok, a community on TikTok whose primary purpose is to connect readers, recommend and discuss books.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s easy for any community on TikTok\u2019s primary purpose to be derailed. Recently, BookTok has been in the news because devotees of hockey romance books were accused of harassing a real-life hockey player, Alex Wennberg of the Seattle Kraken. There\u2019s nothing wrong with reading books that lean more towards pure entertainment than literature. I enjoyed reading every BookTok book on this list. But if you find yourself searching to read something more substantive (or if you\u2019ve found yourself unexpectedly banned from Seattle Kraken games), check out one of these books, which have similar premises to your favorite BookTok books.\n\nIf you liked \u201cRed, White and Royal Blue\u201d by Casey McQuiston, then read \u201cAll-American Girl\u201d by Meg Cabot\n\n\u201cAll-American Girl\u201d is the PG-rated cousin of \u201cRed, White and Royal Blue.\u201d \u201cRed, White and Royal Blue\u201d (RWRB) follows Alex Claremont-Diaz, the president\u2019s golden boy son, falling in love with his mortal enemy, the prim and perfect Prince Henry of England. Forced to fake a friendship to save U.S.-British relations, Alex and Henry end up in a steamy secret relationship. Since its publication in 2019, the book has become massively popular online and is being developed as a movie of the same name to be released on August 11.\n\nFor me, a big characteristic of RWRB was its pie-in-the-sky approach to politics. RWRB depicted a liberal fantasy of the 2020 presidential election (no COVID, no Trump, red states magically turning blue...) alongside its fairytale romance. \u201cAll-American Girl\u201d is similarly frothy, and despite being enmeshed in politics, doesn\u2019t take them too seriously either. Protagonist Samantha Madison is a D.C. high schooler who stumbles into the political world when she stops an attempt on the president\u2019s life and catches the eye of the first son. Samantha, who dyed all of her clothes black because she\u2019s \u201cmourning for her generation,\u201d is funny and sometimes ridiculous, and author Cabot deftly balances the irony of Samantha being both a national hero and a total pessimist about the state of the world. Samantha\u2019s voice is snarky and witty, which makes \u201cAll-American Girl\u201d such a fun read. Although the romance is less prominent in \u201cAll-American Girl,\u201d the plot and characters are just as entertaining. If you\u2019re into easy-to-read political love stories, \u201cAll-American Girl\u201d is a classic choice.\n\nIf you liked \u201dMy Year of Rest and Relaxation\u201d by Ottessa Moshfegh, then read \u201cCleopatra and Frankenstein\u201d by Coco Mellors\n\nIf you enjoyed reading about Moshfegh\u2019s listless and unlikeable protagonist being sad in New York City, you\u2019d enjoy Mellors\u2019 more lively but still unlikeable protagonists being sad in New York City. In Moshfegh\u2019s popular 2018 novel, an unnamed narrator embarks on her \u201cyear of rest and relaxation\u201d \u2014 by way of sleeping for an entire year to get a fresh start in life. Rich and beautiful, the protagonist has no real problems in her life, so she decides to create some. Soon, the narrator realizes that she\u2019s leaving her apartment during her long periods of sleep, but can\u2019t remember anything she did.\n\nMore so than any distinctive plot, the novel is marked by the narrator\u2019s biting and sardonic commentary about the substandard world around her. \u201cCleopatra and Frankenstein,\u201d Mellors\u2019 2022 novel, is also about the trials and tribulations of the rich and beautiful. If you read \u201cMy Year of Rest and Relaxation\u201d and thought, \u201cnothing happens!\u201d then you might like Cleopatra and Frankenstein, where there\u2019s a similar vibe but more of a plot. Cleo is a gorgeous but damaged 20-something artist who captures the attention of Frank, a gregarious advertising executive in his 30s. The pair impulsively get married as Cleo\u2019s student visa is about to expire. The couple\u2019s tumultuous relationship changes their lives and the lives of the people around them.\n\nPersonally, I love character-driven novels, so I had no trouble reading \u201cMy Year of Rest and Relaxation.\u201d But for those of you who didn\u2019t understand the hype around the book, \u201cCleopatra and Frankenstein\u201d is less funny and less ridiculous, but certainly more substantive plot-wise.\n\nIf you liked \u201cThe Secret History\u201d by Donna Tartt, then read \u201cBunny\u201d by Mona Awad\n\n\u201cThe Secret History,\u201d Donna Tartt\u2019s cult classic 1992 novel, has spawned many imitators, though none so delightfully odd as \u201cBunny.\u201d \u201cThe Secret History\u201d follows Richard Papen, a classics student at a prestigious liberal arts college in New England. Richard, a loner at odds with his wealthy peers, becomes friends with the five other students in his classics program. Drawn to the bizarre and inexplicable behavior of the group, Richard finds himself ensnared in a murder plot involving their friend Bunny.\n\n\u201cThe Secret History\u201d is a classic for a reason, and no other book can perfectly encapsulate its moody, dark academia vibe. But \u201cBunny\u201d is more fun, easier to read and female-centric, so it\u2019s worth a read too. The novel follows Samantha Mackey, an MFA student at a similarly prestigious New England university. Samantha is an outcast in her cliquey MFA writing group, a group of girls so sickly sweet they seem poisonous. Like Richard, Samantha is inexplicably drawn to the group\u2019s bizarre and frightening antics. \u201cBunny\u201d is filled with magical realism, and every time you think you know where the novel is headed, you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe Secret History\u201d is one of the better books BookTok has popularized and highlights one of BookTok\u2019s greatest strengths as a community. The novel, which was published over 30 years ago, has been able to reach an entirely new generation of readers. But if you\u2019re looking for a \u201cThe Secret History\u201d of today, look no further than \u201cBunny.\u201d\n\nIf you liked \u201cThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\u201d by Taylor Jenkins Reid, then read \u201cBiography of X\u201d by Catherine Lacey\n\nNothing is as it seems in \u201cThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\u201d or \u201cBiography of X.\u201d Not only do both novels have unexpected twists, but their characters could so easily slot themselves into real 20th-century American history that you might have to Google if they actually existed. \u201cThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\u201d follows Evelyn, a golden-age Hollywood star nearing the end of her life. She narrates her life story \u2014 including her biggest secret \u2014 to the journalist she has instructed to write her biography. Each of Evelyn\u2019s stories follows one of her seven husbands, but her true love was someone different all along.\n\nThe journalist, Monique, soon finds that her life is more intertwined with Evelyn\u2019s than she previously expected. In \u201cBiography of X,\u201d the lines between fiction and reality are (intentionally) blurred even more. Half of the characters are real, like David Bowie, Susan Sontag and Jane Fonda \u2014 and the other half are not real, like Oleg Hall, Theodore Smith and notably, X herself. The novel follows CM, X\u2019s widow, writing X\u2019s biography to correct another biography released shortly after X\u2019s untimely death. X was a controversial performance artist who enthralled New York City\u2019s art scene in the 1970s and 1980s. CM is left to unspool the secrets of her late wife\u2019s life.\n\nUnlike \u201cSeven Husbands,\u201d \u201cBiography of X\u201d is written as a full immersive biography, down to a fake copyright page. Part of the intrigue of \u201cThe Biography of X\u201d is the total transformation of America\u2019s political landscape. In 1945, America split into three territories: the Northern, Southern and Western territories. The Northern Territory becomes a progressive haven; the anarchist Emma Goldman was FDR\u2019s chief of staff, Ronald Reagan belongs to the Green Party and male artists complain that their work hasn\u2019t been displayed in the Guggenheim in 20 years. The Southern Territory builds a wall to enclose itself in and becomes a dictatorial theocracy.\n\nLacey told the New York Times that she would \u201crewrite American history just to create a stage on which two women can have a relationship that doesn\u2019t have to be justified.\u201d This makes \u201cBiography of X\u201d interestingly juxtaposed with \u201cSeven Husbands,\u201d where Jenkins creates characters that blend so seamlessly into real American history that the relationship between two women needs to be justified again and again. \u201cSeven Husbands\u201d is heartfelt and easy to read, but \u201cBiography of X\u201d is in an entirely different league of literature. While the narrative can sometimes drag and become self-aggrandizing, X\u2019s story and America\u2019s alternative history are so fascinating it makes up for it.\n\nIf you liked \u201cVerity\u201d by Colleen Hoover, then read \u201cThe Silent Patient\u201d by Alex Michaelides, \u201cThe Woman in the Window\u201d by A.J. Finn and \u201dSharp Objects\u201d by Gillian Flynn\n\nI finally read a Colleen Hoover book for the sake of this article. Hoover is perhaps the most quintessential BookTok author \u2014 her \u201cstruggle love\u201d books are lauded by some and derided by others. Her romance novels were successful before they exploded on TikTok, but BookTok pushed their popularity to new heights, particularly during the pandemic. I don\u2019t like romance novels, so I initially wrote off Hoover entirely. But I do love thrillers, so I decided to give Hoover\u2019s immensely popular novel \u201cVerity\u201d a chance.\n\n\u201cVerity\u201d is an entertaining read, but it\u2019s a very mediocre thriller that doesn\u2019t live up to its TikTok hype. The novel follows struggling writer Lowen Ashleigh, who is tasked with finishing a popular series after its author, Verity Crawford, is hurt in a mysterious car accident. Lowen relocates to Verity\u2019s mansion in Vermont to finish the books. Both of Verity\u2019s daughters have passed away recently in other mysterious incidents, so the only people who remain in the house are the incapacitated Verity, her son Crew and Verity\u2019s grief-stricken but still charming and gorgeous husband, Jeremy.\n\nWhen Lowen finds Verity\u2019s unpublished autobiography detailing her darkest and most chilling thoughts, Lowen is caught between her feelings for Jeremy and her fear that revealing Verity\u2019s sins will turn Jeremy against her, too. Hoover is truly impressive, not just for the massive empire she\u2019s accumulated with her romance books but because of how many people she has encouraged to pick up a book again. So many girls in their late teens and early 20s have said how they hadn\u2019t read since middle school before getting into Hoover.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of these people and have missed out on the most popular thrillers of the past few years, some good options are: \u201cThe Silent Patient\u201d by Alex Michaelides, \u201cThe Woman in the Window\u201d by A.J. Finn and \u201cSharp Objects\u201d by Gillian Flynn. \u201cThe Woman in the Window,\u201d about an agoraphobic woman trapped in her house, has the same eerie atmosphere as Verity\u2019s mansion. \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d about a journalist who returns to her hometown to report on serial killings, has the same unsettling family dynamics. \u201cThe Silent Patient,\u201d about a doctor obsessed with uncovering the motive of his mute patient who murdered her husband, also has a sharp twist. All are, in my opinion, much better written and executed than \u201cVerity.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of Business Wire)\n\nBy Maddy Myer August 07, 2023 at 7:51 pm PDT\n\nArguably one of WWE\u2019s biggest premium live events following WrestleMania and Royal Rumble, SummerSlam took place over the past weekend and showcased great wrestling, great storytelling (for the most part) and wicked surprises. Most notably, there is a new WWE Women\u2019s Champion, but not in the typical fashion. It\u2019s thanks to Iyo Sky cashing in her \u201cMoney in the Bank\u201d briefcase that she won last month. A truly great moment for Sky and her entire Damage CTRL faction, who celebrated the moment with her.\n\nHere are the top pro wrestling matches from the past week:\n\nSeth Rollins vs. Finn B\u00e1lor (WWE SummerSlam, August 5)\nWith the World Heavyweight Championship on the line, Finn B\u00e1lor\u2019s faction, the Judgment Day, was determined to interfere and have B\u00e1lor become the new champ, but that\u2019s not how it worked out. At this point, these men know each other so well, yet they still made an amazing match with incredible chemistry. Both men kicked out of each other\u2019s finishers and seemed to be running on pure adrenaline at some points. Barring an interference from Damian Priest and his \u201cMoney in the Bank\u201d briefcase, Rollins used it to his advantage and curb stomped B\u00e1lor\u2019s head onto the briefcase to pull off the victory and retain his championship.\n\nAsuka vs. Charlotte Flair vs. Bianca Belair (WWE SummerSlam, August 5)\nCompeting for the WWE Women\u2019s Championship, these three had a fantastic match. Triple-threat matches are always high energy with action happening 24/7, even if one competitor is outside the ring. A turning point in the match was Bianca Belair\u2019s knee injury caused by Charlotte Flair dropping her on the ring steps. Asuka and Flair continued to fight in the ring as medical personnel checked on Belair. It seemed like Belair was done with the match and heading back to the locker room, but she pushed herself to continue and ended up winning with a rollup on Asuka in the middle of being held with a figure four submission by Flair. Truly impossible, but Belair won the triple threat match. Sadly, that victory was short-lived as Iyo Sky capitalized on Belair\u2019s injury and cashed in her \u201cMoney in the Bank\u201d briefcase to win the championship after hitting Belair with a moonsault.\n\nCody Rhodes vs. Brock Lesnar (WWE SummerSlam, August 5)\nFew men in the modern era of WWE have beaten the beast Brock Lesnar, and for a good portion of this match, it looked like Cody Rhodes would be just another one of Lesnar\u2019s victims. This was an absolutely brutal match that saw Rhodes pulling out all the stops, from suicide dives to top rope Cody cutters. Lesnar hit Rhodes with too many suplexes to count, but Rhodes would never give up and continuously offered himself up for more punishment. Lesnar gladly gave it with an F5 outside the ring and then eventually through the ring announcer\u2019s table. After three crossrhodes, Rhodes pulled off the victory and earned Lesnar\u2019s respect as he raised Rhodes\u2019 arm to the crowd.\n\nLogan Paul vs. Ricochet (WWE SummerSlam, August 5)\nI often make the comparison of wrestling being like watching two superheroes battle it out in the middle of the ring. Well, if any wrestler lives up to the \u201csuperhero\u201d moniker, it\u2019s Ricochet. The incredible athletic and acrobatic ability of Ricochet is second to none in the WWE, and his match against Logan Paul saw no shortcomings with that. On the other hand, for a newer wrestler, Paul kept up with Ricochet and nailed every move of his own with force and accuracy. Paul, as the heel of course, cheated for the victory by using brass knuckles to hit Ricochet in the face.\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d is a pro wrestling column by Maddy Myer that runs every Monday.\n```"}

USC will be joined in the Big Ten by an extra pair of familiar foes on the West Coast, after Oregon and Washington announced plans to leave the Pac-12 as well.\n\nBy Campbell Donovan August 07, 2023 at 5:11 pm PDT\n\nOnce news broke that USC and UCLA\u2019s football programs decided to part ways with the Pac-12, the end of the conference has been a hot conversation topic. Although the Pac-12 made some strides to acquire teams such as San Diego State and Southern Methodist University, they have yet to find success in their endeavors. Furthermore, rumors began to surface suggesting Oregon and Washington were thinking about hopping on the Big Ten bandwagon. On Friday, it was confirmed that the two programs are set to join the conference in 2024 alongside the Los Angeles schools.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to welcome the University of Oregon and the University of Washington to the Big Ten Conference. Both institutions feature a combination of academic and athletic excellence that will prove a great fit for our future,\u201d Big Ten commissioner Tony Petitti said.\n\nThe Big Ten began exploring the additions of Washington and Oregon last fall, but it could not rally enough support among the conference\u2019s presidents. It wasn\u2019t until Colorado (and now Arizona, Arizona State and Utah) announced their plans to join the Big 12 that talk of the new additions reoccurred. With these departures within days of one another, it leaves just four teams in the Pac-12 and a lot of uncertainty for the future of the potentially bankrupt program.\n\nThe addition of Oregon brings a tension back into USC\u2019s life that the Trojans perhaps thought to escape joining the Big Ten. The two schools have a long history of recruitment rivalries, from coaches to players. USC had the title of Big Ten member to sway possible recruits throughout the past year, but now the Ducks share that same asset. In some ways, the Trojans may have been joining the Big Ten to flee from the ongoing battle with the Ducks.\n\nHead coach Lincoln Riley believes that the addition of Oregon does not change anything for USC; however, it is hard to believe that the Trojans aren\u2019t a little bitter of this decision from their new conference. And to make the LA schools even more frustrated, this news could make the Big Ten reevaluate the schedule that has already been announced for the 2024 and 2025 years. Could this even mean that the conference could now change its setup and create region-based pods?\n\nFor the next few weeks, everyone should be on the edge of their seats to see what the future of the Pac-12 (now the Pac-4) has in store. And, if it goes the way it appears to be, 2023\u2032s football season could become the last one the Pac-12 conference ever hosts.\n\n\u201cBigger Ten\u201d is a column by Campbell Donovan about USC\u2019s impending move to the Big Ten.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\n\nBy Dominic Varela August 07, 2023 at 1:58 pm PDT\n\nRich Hill obviously must have another arm. I say that because I can\u2019t believe that the 43-year-old Hill has managed to play quality baseball for so long without his arm falling clean off. To think that a man originally drafted in 1999 is still pitching in 2023 boggles the mind. And yet, he carries on. Because he can.\n\nLast week, Hill once again went up against the almighty power of MLB\u2019s Aug. 1 trade deadline, and once again, the 18-year veteran fell victim as the Pittsburgh Pirates shipped him off to the San Diego Padres with mere hours to spare. Depending on how you look at it, though, this was much closer to a win. While not a huge difference exists between the Padres\u2019 and Pirates\u2019 win totals, acquiring Hill indicates that San Diego is vying for a playoff spot. Pittsburgh, on the other hand, ruled out the postseason months ago.\n\nSan Diego is Hill\u2019s 13th major league team (tied for the second-most all-time). Of those 13 clubs, only three retained him for multiple years. The last time that happened was with the Los Angeles Dodgers from 2016-2019 and that was six teams ago. He is, by every definition, a journeyman. However, he doesn\u2019t fit the bill of what you\u2019d expect from a journeyman.\n\nUnlike the other two members of the 13-plus club since integration, Hill has never been a World Series champion or even an All-Star. Similarly, most players who last as long as Hill have posted all-time great numbers and racked up countless accolades. Future Hall of Famers Albert Pujols and Ichiro Suzuki come to mind. They hung around because, well, they earned it. Even the notorious Bartolo Col\u00f3n \u2014 who last played in 2018 at the age of 45 \u2014 won a Cy Young at one point.\n\nSo how did Hill do it? Simple. He doesn\u2019t try that hard. That might be a bit harsh. He\u2019s a professional athlete, and I\u2019m a writer who maxed out at Little League. Obviously, Hill tries hard. However, I can say one thing: he definitely doesn\u2019t overexert himself.\n\nHill has never thrown hard, but this year, he\u2019s taken it to the extreme. According to Statcast, his fastball sits in the first \u2014 yes, the very first \u2014 percentile in fastball velocity (average fastball speed measured in mph). At an average speed of 88.2 mph, Hill\u2019s fastball probably wouldn\u2019t get a speeding ticket in a 70.\n\nIn addition to the four-seam fastball, Hill boasts an impressive mix of fastball variations and a variety of off-speed pitches. His repertoire routinely includes a curveball, sinker, cutter, slider and even a sweeper. Pitch speed-wise, those rank third-slowest, second-slowest, second-slowest, fourth-slowest, and slowest, respectively. Even at his fastest, Hill is still in the first percentile.\n\nThe man is an enigma. But, as I indicated previously, he\u2019s never been known for his speed. In 2015, when Hill was a spry 35-year-old, his fastball only landed in the 26th percentile. Whether or not Hill has ever had the ability to throw hard \u2014 or he simply chooses not to \u2014 is up for debate. However, we do know that Hill has chosen to reduce his fastball usage more and more in favor of the curveball since his Tommy John surgery in 2011.\n\nThis year, he\u2019s used his curveball 37.8% of the time and his fastball only 33.2%. The change has clearly paid off; he\u2019s now pitched more innings in his forties than he did in his twenties. By MLB standards, Hill is definitely what you\u2019d call a \u201clate bloomer.\u201d\n\nFollowing an independent league stint, Hill was signed by the Boston Red Sox in 2015 and had one of the strongest years in his career. His next two seasons made up the best multi-year stretch of his career. His career statistics don\u2019t jump off the page, but his late-career numbers are nothing short of extraordinary. Never a star, but always valuable. And sometimes, that\u2019s all you need to be.\n\nHill started his first game with San Diego on Sunday night. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t go well, as the lefty gave up six runs across only three innings of work. His ERA (earned run average per nine innings) now stands at 5.09 on the year. That\u2019s not great. However, there\u2019s a reason why the Padres traded for him in the first place. He\u2019s going to go out there every five days and eat up innings.\n\nSunday night was Hill\u2019s 23rd start of the year. Only four pitchers have more than that (24). At an age where his body should be breaking down, Hill is more durable than ever. At the end of the day, San Diego brought him on to right the ship. Not just on the field, but off of it. The Padres came into 2023 with World Series expectations, and if the season ended right now, they wouldn\u2019t even make the playoffs. The talent is there, but they can\u2019t seem to get it together.\n\nHill could be their glue. Teams across the league recognize Hill for his competitiveness and pure passion for the sport. Most importantly, though, he\u2019s a good dude, and people love to have him around. And unlike age, that\u2019s a quality that numbers can\u2019t measure.\n\nEven if San Diego chooses to part ways with Hill at the end of the year, it\u2019s not a huge deal. Hill has already made it clear that he plans to return for his age-44 season in 2024. No matter how hard the world tries to stop him, Hill and his 88-mph fastball won\u2019t be riding off into the sunset just yet. Because even at 43 years old, nobody \u2014 not even time itself \u2014 can slow Rich Hill down.\n\n\u201cWAR Zone\u201d is a column by Dominic Varela about some of his favorite stats in baseball and the wacky stories they tell us that runs every Monday.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nBy Taylor Marie Contarino August 04, 2023 at 10:05 pm PDT\n\n*This film review may contain spoilers.*\n\nIn all honesty, I had no idea what I was in for when I purchased the tickets for myself, my little sister and my best friend to see the \u201cBarbie\u201d movie this weekend. I naively selected my pink tube top, matching headband and pink floral Nike slides. What I could not anticipate was that every notion I had once had about the iconic Mattel doll was going to be challenged.\n\nI thought this film was just going to be aesthetically pleasing, but it became so much more \u2014 perhaps an allusion to the naive preconceptions society often has about women. A testament to the place of women in the world, \u201cBarbie\u201d was more than just a fun and entertaining superficial blockbuster film.\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d challenged the preconceptions that society has about women in a way that is both digestible and entertaining. The film contained fun, comedic and sparkling elements like the breakout group dance and volleyball beach scenes. However, it also contained poignant moments like when Barbie stepped into the \u201cReal World\u201d for the first time, only to discover an aging, elderly woman at a bus stop. She called her beautiful, only to be met with an \u201cI know,\u201d followed by a silence-filled pause and a moment of shared, relieving laughter.\n\nIt came out soon after the film\u2019s release that this scene was almost cut from the film because staff felt it wasn\u2019t important to the plot. Greta Gerwig, the film\u2019s director, advocated keeping this scene, citing that it was vital to the film\u2019s point.\n\nIn just one hour and 54 minutes, audience members were able to digest a story arc that watched Barbie (Margot Robbie) go from a \u201cplastic,\u201d bubbly yet uncomplicated doll to a complex, feeling human who has felt both obsolete in the hands of patriarchy and disdainfully desired in the male gaze.\n\nAdditionally, viewers had the opportunity to watch a struggling Ken (Ryan Gosling) as he feebly attempts to find his place in the world, only to settle with becoming the byproduct of adopting the patriarchy in the \u201cReal World.\u201d\n\nThis film was far from frivolous. Despite being marked by intense consumerism and enthralling viewers with high-demand and top-tier marketing campaigns, the film was a far cry from the surface level.\n\nI hadn\u2019t even realized the intense emotional level of what I was experiencing until Gloria (America Ferrera) put it into words in a climax-like monologue moment that she captured beautifully in a soulful soliloquy that hardly felt scripted: \u201cIt is literally impossible to be a woman. You are so beautiful, and so smart, and it kills me that you don\u2019t think you\u2019re good enough. Like, we have to always be extraordinary, but somehow we\u2019re always doing it wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll just representing women, then I don\u2019t even know.\u201d\n\nGloria (America Ferrera) in Barbie (2023)\n\nIn this moment, Barbie\u2019s true purpose is revealed, and it\u2019s so much more than what we\u2019ve been told our whole lives, leaving viewers pondering what the doll really signifies. Is Barbie the pretty, feminine, modelesque figure we all desire to be? Or, is Barbie something even greater than us?\n\nBarbie is representative of all of us as women. And through a compelling performance from Robbie, it is revealed that even Barbie Land is home to the inadequacies and expectations that we as women face each and every single day.\n\nWe don\u2019t look good enough \u2014 but if we look too good, we are being overly tempting. We are always \u201ctoo much,\u201d according to somebody out there.\n\nKen conveyed it well in a scene in which he meets a man in a suit in a business setting as they chat over MBAs and other job requirements. He complains that the company is not \u201cdoing patriarchy right,\u201d and the man assures him that they are, but they\u2019re just hiding it better than they used to (wage gap, I\u2019m looking at you).\n\nIn another scene, Ken goes on his own monologue speech in Barbie Land (later, the Ken-dom) and complains that he, and every other man, should be getting everything handed to him just for \u201cbeing a dude,\u201d as they do in the \u201cReal World.\u201d\n\nWatching this extremely accurate representation in Barbie Land was both hilarious and also very validating.\n\nRight now, Barbie is quite literally on the world\u2019s stage, and everyone has something to say, whether it\u2019s about the marketing budget, the hilarious Ken portrayal from Gosling, and/or the way that Robbie was able to so animatedly portray the doll we all know and love.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m stuck here thinking about how grateful I am for all of the mothers, daughters and sisters in the world. Since leaving the movie theater, I\u2019ve been stuck in this trance where I am simply in awe of women.\n\nTaking care of people, nurturing 24/7 and still getting ridiculed for every little thing you do is something that is outrageously difficult and definitely not lost upon me.\n\nSo, to all the women out there, I see you, I hear you and I feel you. Your place in the world may be constantly challenged, but the world simply would not exist without you.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/08/02/socal-soccer-spotlight-the-rise-of-savannah-mccaskill/", "response": "```\nColumn SoCal Soccer Spotlight: The rise of Savannah McCaskill LA Galaxy fill needs; the World Cup provides some surprises.\n\nAngel City FC midfielder Savannah McCaskill (9) celebrates with teammates after scoring during the second half of an NWSL soccer match against the Chicago Red Stars in Los Angeles, Sunday, Aug. 14, 2022. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan August 02, 2023 at 1:43 pm PDT\n\nSavannah McCaskill: ACFC\u2019s cult hero\n\nEvery club needs a good cult hero. Angel City FC has a great one. I would wait to tell you who it is, but it\u2019s already in the section title. Spoiler alert! Before I dig into how McCaskill has earned cult hero status at BMO Stadium, I feel obligated to present a list of qualifications for becoming a club football cult hero:\n\nYou can\u2019t be too good. This one may sound odd, considering fans generally want their players to perform as well as possible. But if a player has a starring role for multiple seasons, then they just become a \u201cclub legend.\u201d For example, John Terry is a Chelsea FC legend, because he made 716 appearances for the club, winning multiple Premier League titles as a captain. David Luiz, however, falls into the cult hero category because he performed well, but not exceptionally, and for other reasons listed below.\n\nYour best performances come at opportune moments, often in cup competitions. This one is crucial. Much like a superhero, a cult hero steps up when their club needs them most, like scoring equalizing or game-winning goals when facing elimination. Case in point: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6er at Manchester United. The Norwegian striker made his name as the prototypical super-sub and most notably scored the winning goal during stoppage time in the 1999 Champions League final against Bayern Munich.\n\nYou have an atypical and/or endearing aspect to your game or appearance that makes you unique. Back to the David Luiz example \u2014 the Brazilian centerback had an epic afro. Additionally, he took free kicks for Chelsea, an unusual role for a centerback. His trademark style was to hit the ball so that it dipped violently downward as it approached goal, fooling many keepers. He also scored this open-play belter against Fulham.\n\nTo be clear, labeling McCaskill a cult hero is not an insult. She could yet become a club legend, as she has the requisite pedigree to be one: collegiate star, No. 2 overall pick in the 2018 NWSL Draft and six U.S. women\u2019s national team caps. It just hasn\u2019t worked out for her so far. Angel City is McCaskill\u2019s fourth NWSL team, and she arguably played her best football in Australia, on loan to Sydney FC. There, she scored two goals in the 2019 W-League Grand Final to help win 4-2. In that match, though, we might have seen an inkling of McCaskill\u2019s future cult hero status.\n\nWith those matters of eligibility out of the way, we move on to McCaskill and the recent performance that has cemented her status as a cult hero, if she wasn\u2019t already. The South Carolina native scored a brace against the Portland Thorns on July 29, winning Angel City the match and, more importantly, keeping them alive in the NWSL Challenge Cup. It was the second match in a row where McCaskill provided a boost in front of goal, having scored the equalizer in their 2-1 win against North Carolina Courage in early July.\n\nI\u2019m going to list a few facts about McCaskill\u2019s latest performance in Portland and, well, let me know if you hear anything familiar:\n\nMcCaskill scored two goals in a cup competition.\nMcCaskill\u2019s performance kept her team alive in said cup competition.\nMcCaskill scored a spectacular free kick to win the game.\n\nI think you get the point. I rest my case. In all seriousness, McCaskill\u2019s recent surge has literally kept Angel City\u2019s season on track. In their speculative hunt for a playoff place, every match feels like a must-win, even Challenge Cup matches such as this one, which don\u2019t count towards the team\u2019s NWSL regular-season record. This isn\u2019t an NBA or MLB season where teams can afford to throw away a few games to rest players or experiment with a different lineup. Even while their stars are away for the World Cup, head coach Becki Tweed needs to figure out which players she can rely on as the season comes to a close. McCaskill can be that player who lifts her club with a few mammoth performances.\n\nThis Challenge Cup win should also remind Angel City fans that success comes in multiple forms. Even if they miss the true NWSL playoffs, making the Challenge Cup semifinals would be a great achievement for ACFC (it would admittedly require a multi-goal win and a multi-goal loss for Kansas City Current in the final group stage game). If nothing else, players like McCaskill give priceless joy to the fans from relatively success-starved clubs. Long live the cult hero.\n\nYoshida signs for the Galaxy\n\nThe Athletic\u2019s Tom Bogert, the Fabrizio Romano of U.S. soccer, reported on July 28 that Japan international centerback Maya Yoshida will sign as a free agent for LA Galaxy. The club haven\u2019t announced the move yet, as they cannot officially sign any players from abroad until the league-wide summer transfer window ends on Aug. 2, due to sanctions for a 2019 violation of MLS roster and salary rules. But if Bogert has reported it, then it\u2019s as good as done.\n\nYoshida certainly fills a need for the club from Carson. Uruguayan centerback Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres, who spent time at Barcelona and Juventus among other European clubs, was a marquee signing for the Galaxy last summer, but made only five starts in 2022 and 15 this season before surgery for an avulsion fracture ended his year. The Galaxy recently used $125,000 of guaranteed General Allocation Money (guaranteed GAM, what a mouthful) to acquire central defender Tony Alfaro from New York City FC, but the 30-year-old American is a reserve option, having only made six MLS appearances in New York in 2023.\n\nBut does Yoshida move the needle on the Galaxy\u2019s playoff hopes? It\u2019s hard to say. Yoshida will bring a lot of European experience to MLS. During his time in the Premier League, Serie A, the Eredivisie and the Bundesliga, Yoshida made 309 appearances and has played in three World Cups, even starting all four of Japan\u2019s matches in Qatar this past December. His pedigree is solid. He also hasn\u2019t played on many \u201cgood\u201d teams. The Southampton squads of 2013-2017 were probably the best sides Yoshida has appeared for, placing eighth, seventh, sixth and eighth again in consecutive seasons, before the club tumbled down the Premier League table during his later years on England\u2019s south coast. Even in those seasons, Yoshida never locked down a role as a guaranteed starter. The most appearances he made in one of those four Premier League campaigns was 23 in 2016-17, where he posted a combined three tackles and interceptions per game. Yoshida earned a similar 2.82 figure for Schalke in the Bundesliga this past season, when the historic German club placed 17th in the league and were relegated to the Zweite Bundesliga. Not exactly spectacular.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m being harsh. After all, signing any player with genuine Premier League experience as a free agent would be a coup for most MLS clubs, especially for a team so low down in the table. But when Galaxy fans look across to their city rivals and see Giorgio Chiellini holding down the fort for LAFC, I\u2019m sure the Yoshida signing feels less exciting. If nothing else, he can serve as a quality minute-eater in C\u00e1ceres\u2019 absence.\n\nThe Galaxy could use anybody\u2019s help, having exited the Leagues Cup on Sunday after losing the second group-stage game to the Vancouver Whitecaps 1-2. The result quashed any hopes that the inter-league tournament could kickstart the Galaxy\u2019s season, putting even more pressure on their MLS run-in.\n\nWorld CUpdate Pt. 2\n\nI owe an apology to the Japanese national team. In my World Cup preview, I questioned Jun Endo and her team\u2019s ability to score and predicted they would face a round of 16 exit. With their group stage games completed, I could not have been more wrong. Japan have scored 11 goals in three matches \u2014 the most of any team so far \u2014 and have yet to concede, placing them firmly among the tournament favorites. On matchday three, they smashed Spain 4-0, with Endo assisting the first goal and featuring at left wing-back in Japan\u2019s 3-4-3 formation once again. Endo played a lethal ball across the pitch for right-winger Hinata Miyazawa to run onto and the floodgates opened for Japan from there. They will play Norway in the first knockout game and would potentially face the U.S. in the quarterfinals if both teams go through.\n\nAli Riley\u2019s New Zealand will miss the knockouts after failing to beat Switzerland on matchday three, but can hold their heads high having secured New Zealand\u2019s first-ever Women\u2019s World Cup win. Riley will be able to re-join her Angel City teammates in training soon as they prepare for the rest of the 2023 campaign.\n\nUSC\u2019s very own Ashleigh Plumptre also deserves a shoutout. Her Nigeria team placed second in Group B, squeezing past Canada to earn a round of 16 berth. They are set to play England, who just put six goals past China (no slouches themselves as FIFA\u2019s 14th-ranked team, for what it\u2019s worth). The quarterfinals seem unlikely for the Super Falcons (another S-tier nickname), but Plumptre has acquitted herself well, starting all three matches at left back and helping the defense keep two clean sheets.\n\nNow, for the moment you\u2019ve all been waiting for: what the hell is going on with the USWNT? The four-time world champions eked through to the next round in uncharacteristic fashion, winning just one of three group games and failing to score against Portugal in their third match. Unlike the Vietnam or Netherlands matches, it\u2019s hard to say the U.S. deserved to win this game, with Portugal dominating possession and nearly scoring a game-winner in the 91st minute to send the U.S. home. From the Angel City angle, Julie Ertz played another solid match at centerback and Alyssa Thompson made a cameo off the bench for her sixth cap, but didn\u2019t have time to affect the game. Given the U.S.\u2019s attacking issues, perhaps Thompson deserves more of an opportunity to provide a spark. Regardless, the USWNT needs to shape up quickly if they expect to make a fourth consecutive final. They\u2019ll play Sweden in the round of 16, who scored nine and conceded just one goal in the group stage.\n\nStoppage Time: Galaxy making moves?\n\nJust when I thought I was done, Bogert dropped another one! Yesterday, Bogert reported that the Galaxy traded for Austin FC star Diego Fagundez, who has two goals and an assist in 14 starts this season. The Galaxy sent midfielder Memo Rodriguez to Austin in addition to $300,000 GAM plus add-ons up to $900,000 \u2014 a hefty, hefty fee. Fagundez hasn\u2019t had an exceptional season so far, but he still manages to help his teammates score goals, with 4.25 shot-creating actions per 90 according to FBRef (shot-creating actions count all passes, take-ons and fouls that lead directly to a shot). That figure puts him in the 73rd percentile among his positional peers in leagues similar in quality to the MLS. The Uruguay-born player moved to the U.S. with his family as a five-year-old and has become an MLS mainstay, making 280 appearances for the New England Revolution before joining the Texas expansion team for its inaugural 2021 season. Fagundez will likely rotate with Douglas Costa and Tyler Boyd for a spot at left-wing.\n\n(By the way, there will be no column next week, I\u2019ll see you on 8/16.)\n\nNext games:\nLAFC: Wednesday, Aug. 2 vs. FC Ju\u00e1rez (away)\nAngel City: Saturday, Aug. 5 vs. San Diego Wave (home)\nLA Galaxy: Sunday, Aug. 20 vs. Real Salt Lake (home)\n\n\u201cSoCal Soccer Spotlight\u201d is a column by Jack Hallinan about the professional soccer landscape in Los Angeles.\n```"}

Taylor Swift began the Eras tour back in March in Glendale, Arizona (or better known as Swift City). Now almost five months later, filled with memories of new surprise songs, music videos and a new Taylor\u2019s Version, it\u2019s hard to imagine a weekend without Swifties dancing the night away.\n\nSwift will be performing at SoFi stadium for the first time since her Reputation stadium tour in 2017 on August 3-5 and August 7-9. The show begins at 6:30 p.m. and doors will open at 4:30 p.m. She has two opening acts.\n\nBefore the big night, there are so many things to prepare for the concert and anticipate including where to park, what to bring and what surprises to expect on the final leg of the U.S. tour. Due to the high levels of existing traffic in Los Angeles and the added influx of drivers going to SoFi, it is highly recommended to plan out a few hours to drive or commute to the concert. Parking passes are also available on the SoFi website but are expensive and in high demand, due to the number of tailgaters also buying passes to watch the concert from the parking lot.\n\nOne way to get to the concert is Uber or to get dropped off. SoFi Stadium released specific instructions for drop off and pick up to occur on Kareem Court westbound of Pincay Drive. Another option for travel is the Metro with the C and K lines passing through the stadium. More trains have been added and hours were extended to run until 2 a.m. For more information about the Metro visit their website.\n\nThe clear bag policy that is common for SoFi football games and is the same for the concert. Additionally, the merchandise truck is open \u2014 and usually already has a line \u2014 the day before the concert. It\u2019s at the truck where fans can secure exclusive Eras tour merchandise, specifically the blue crewneck everyone has been snagging at the first chance.\n\nThere are also many events that are happening before Swift touches ground in Hollywood Hills. Just this week the mural on Melrose released about the Spotify top five Eras feature. On the corner of Melrose and Stanley Avenues, you can find a painting for each Swift Era and take pictures. There is also an Eras Tour Pop Up shop with custom L.A. merch and Eras Tour goodies on August 6 from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. at 1054 South Olive St.\n\nThe Bloc in L.A. will also be making customized cocktails with Taylor Swift photos and will be hosting a party August 2 from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. where you can participate in friendship bracelet making. Finally, there will be a Swift-themed beach bash in Santa Monica Beach on August 8, which will have bracelets, food and entertainment. You can get tickets here.\n\nEach night of the L.A. show also has different openers. Thursday\u2019s show welcomes Haim and Gracie Abrams; Friday, Haim and Owenn; Saturday, Haim and Gayle. Swift isn\u2019t performing on Sunday, but comes back Monday and Tuesday with Haim and Abrams. Finally, she ends the U.S. leg of the tour with Haim and Gayle as the openers.\n\nThe openers have occasionally joined Swift during the set either as additions to the setlist or songs from the opener. Abrams joined Swift to sing \u201cI Miss You, I\u2019m Sorry\u201d on Cincinnati night two and Phoebe Bridgers sang \u201cNothing New\u201d with Swift during the dates when she was the opener. Most recently, L.A. band Haim has joined Swift on these dates of the tour and, during the Seattle shows, debuted the performance of \u201cNo Body, No Crime\u201d during the \u201cevermore\u201d setlist.\n\nSome fans anticipating the L.A. show took to TikTok to talk about how sad it would be if Swift repeated what she did in those shows at SoFi and replace the song \u201c\u2018tis the damn season\u201d with \u201cNo Body, No Crime,\u201d since the former song has the infamous line \u201cI\u2019ll go back to L.A. to my so-called friends who\u2019ll write books about me.\u201d\n\nIf this is your first Taylor Swift concert, there are also a lot of traditions to participate in, with the most famous being friendship bracelet trading. Swifties have been making bracelets with Swift-inspired quotes or lyrics and handing them out at the concert. From experience, most fans are friendly and super approachable to trade bracelets with, so if this is something that piques your interest, now is the time to start bracelet making.\n\nAnother coming tradition is for fans to scream out certain chants during certain songs. If you\u2019d like to keep clear of the set list, scroll past the following list of chants: Fearless - Heart with hands at the end of chorus\nDelicate - Scream \u201c1, 2, 3 Let\u2019s Go B\u201d\nLong Live - Point to Taylor and pump fists in air after the end of the bridge\nAll Too Well - Scream \u201chow did that make you feel\u201d before she sings \u201cthat made me want to die\u201d\nAnti-Hero - Scream \u201cTaylor you\u2019ll be fine\u201d during second chorus\n\nThere are definitely more chants and ways to interact with Taylor during the 3 1\u20442 hour set. A final, very notable tradition of this tour are also the surprise songs. During the setlist of the tour, Swift\u2019s background singers and dancers and all the lights dim down to just her and her guitar for the acoustic set of the night. She starts out with the guitar, singing a song from any era of her discography, then moving onto piano to sing another. The songs are completely random and occasionally are recommendations from famous friends who go and see the tour.

These included: \nOne count of conspiracy to defraud the United States \nOne count of conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding \nOne count of obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding \nOne count of conspiracy against rights \n\nThe indictment also included six other individuals as co-conspirators that have yet to be named because they were not indicted. Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith charged Trump in the case and said that his office is still investigating the co-conspirators.\n\nUnder the First Amendment, the indictment recognized that Trump had the right to speak about the outcome of the election. However, the evidence presented led the investigation to conclude that he was aware and informed that his statements over many months about election fraud were false. They further asserted that his language ultimately led to the violence on January 6.\n\nReactions in Congress have mostly been divided along partisan lines, with Republicans mostly declaring the Department of Justice to have political motivations and Democrats lauding the power of the law. One group remains outside of the norm. \u201cAdditional evidence presented since then, including by the January 6 Commission, has only reinforced that the former President played a key role in instigating the riots,\u201d Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) tweeted. She was among one of seven Republicans that voted to impeach Trump after the insurrection.\n\nTrump has been indicted in three separate criminal cases and is under investigation for a fourth. Despite all of this, he has denied all wrongdoing, and this indictment will not bar him from running for president again in 2024. This is because the Constitution does not require candidates to have a clean criminal record to become president.\n\nTrump will appear in court on Thursday for his arraignment at the Federal District Court in Washington. However, because defendants in criminal cases generally have to be present during their trials, some are concluding that this may prove to be tricky combined with his planned campaign scheduling.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nBy Maddy Myer August 01, 2023 at 7:41 am PDT\n\nWWE\u2019s developmental program NXT has seen the production of some of its greatest stars. From greats like Kevin Owens to Bayley, the pathway to success straight out of NXT has almost become a guarantee. On Sunday, NXT had a pay-per-view event titled \u201cGreat American Bash\u201d that highlighted the caliber of stars that the product has to offer. They are main roster talents in the making, just waiting for the full call-up to shows like Monday Night Raw or Friday Night Smackdown.\n\nHere are the top pro wrestling matches from the past week:\n\nCarmelo Hayes vs. Ilja Dragunov (NXT Great American Bash, July 30)\nThey don\u2019t call Carmelo Hayes \u201cHIM\u201d for nothing. There was high-flying, technical wrestling, reversals, chops that caused welts on both competitor\u2019s chests and everything else you would want in a fierce match. There were times I was sure the match was over, but Hayes or Dragunov would kick out at the last second. This was easily a match I could watch over and over again and never get tired of. Hayes\u2019 friend Trick Williams motivating him outside the ring was also a nice touch that really gave the storytelling piece of a wrestling match. Hayes truly is the NXT Champion for a reason, and though Ilja Dragunov put on quite a spectacular performance of his own, Hayes was the better man in the end.\n\nRoxanne Perez vs. Blair Davenport (NXT Great American Bash, July 30)\nIn a weapons wild match, Roxanne Perez and Blair Davenport absolutely destroyed each other. A match that not only told a true story but also didn\u2019t leave much to be desired with the amount of physicality involved. There were cowbells, belts, chairs and even tables used in this brutal competition. Perez\u2019s mom and sister were even ringside, and Davenport wasted no time taunting them and attacking Perez right in front of them, even making Perez\u2019s little sister cry. Perez fully embraced a new side in this match to defeat Davenport and took the victory after a table spot and her \u201cPop Rox\u201d finisher over a bed of steel chairs.\n\nDominik Mysterio vs. Wes Lee vs. Mustafa Ali (NXT Great American Bash, July 30)\nIn a triple-threat match for the North American Championship, these three put it all on the line. While this match was every man for himself, it started off with Wes Lee and Mustafa Ali both targeting Dominik Mysterio. Lee and Ali even hit a variation of Mysterio\u2019s own (originally Eddie Guerrero\u2019s) three amigos suplex. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Mysterio match without interference from Rhea Ripley, who got in the way of Lee and Ali multiple times and even slammed Lee into the ring announcer\u2019s table after he landed an outside dive on Mysterio. In triple-threat rules, this interference meant nothing except for the match turning back in Mysterio\u2019s favor. Mysterio pulled off the victory with a frog splash on Lee after Ripley pushed Ali out of the ring to stop him from making a pin.\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d is a pro wrestling column by Maddy Myer that runs every Monday.\n```"}

They plan to make the training required for incoming students first. (Photo courtesy of Joshua Sierra)\n\nBy Eric Yeh July 31, 2023 at 7:52 pm PDT\n\nThe USC Office of Sustainability is looking to make its Student Sustainability Training mandatory for students. Created in collaboration with University Communications, the Environmental Student Assembly (ESA) and the Presidential Working Group on Sustainability, the module is available on Trojan Learn. The 45-minute training is an educational presentation with some videos and interactives. Some topics covered are waste diversion, water conservation, energy use, etc. It provides ways students can get involved, like learning to sort waste with the multi-stream waste bins all over campus and much more. It also outlines a few of the university\u2019s sustainability plans, such as achieving zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and 20% water reduction.\n\nCurrently, the module is optional, but the Office of Sustainability plans to make its sustainability training required for incoming students and eventually mandatory for all students to take. \u201cThe long-term goal is to have it be part of that line-up of training that students are required to take like the Title IX,\u201d said Lilian Ledesma, sustainability engagement specialist.\n\nThe module had what was described by Ledesma as a \u201csoft launch\u201d earlier this year in April. Brad Haydel, associate director of the Office of Sustainability, spoke briefly about the module at the How to be a Sustainable Trojan event in April. In an interview with ATVN, Haydel encouraged students to take the sustainability training, saying, \u201cIt covers the background of sustainability, what USC is doing, how students can get involved and the best way that they can make change.\u201d\n\nStill, the \u201csoft launch\u201d resulted in many students not knowing about the new module. \u201cI have not heard about [the training] at all,\u201d said recent alum Shreya Agrawal, formerly Annenberg Media Earth Desk editor.\n\nTo increase awareness, the Office of Sustainability plans to make a big marketing push this upcoming school year, encouraging faculty, staff and students to take the training. Beyond social media and their newsletter, \u201cwe\u2019re really hoping to work with residential ED to encourage their students to take it,\u201d Ledesma said.\n\nAgrawal, who founded the Earth Desk last year, said the training and making it mandatory is a great idea. \u201cI\u2019m actually really proud of USC for doing it because President Folt always talks about how important sustainability and making these initiatives are to her,\u201d Agrawal said. \u201cI\u2019m glad that the Office of Sustainability is finally stepping up to participate in wide student involvement instead of just people who are genuinely interested in doing things by themselves.\u201d\n\nFolt has prioritized sustainability on campus during her time at USC. At her inauguration in 2019, Folt held a university-wide zero-waste luncheon and joined students in a climate strike organized by ESA. In her 2023 State of the University Address, Folt spoke about sustainability milestones the university has accomplished. From reducing carbon footprint, eliminating single-use plastic beverage bottles, diverting half of waste from landfills and reducing water use. In addition, Folt said in her address the university is \u201cpurchasing renewable electricity from LADWP that is 45% less carbon-intensive.\u201d\n\nThere is no timeframe for when the Student Sustainability Training will become mandatory for all students.\n```"}

It\u2019s the time of relaxation and relatively more free time than the academic year. If you\u2019re finding yourself bored in the last home stretch of summer, here are some books that will surely captivate your attention.\n\n\u201cBallad of Songbirds and Snakes\u201d by Suzanne Collins\nFrom the best-selling series first published back in 2008, \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d Collins\u2019 dystopian world is expanded with its newest release. \u201cThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\u201d is a prequel to the original trilogy and follows a young President Snow as he becomes a mentor to the District 12 tribute, Lucy Gray, in the 10th Hunger Games. Although Gray seems like an unlikely winner, as readers of the Hunger Games we all know, Snow will find a way to come out on top. The biggest criticism of this book which was released back in 2020 was the idea of a redemption arc for the villain of the original series. However, \u201cThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\u201d is a far cry from a redemption story. It does show the complexities of Snow while also staying true to the character he\u2019s known to be. Another reason why you should definitely pick up this book is because it gives context to Panem and how the Hunger Games really became the spectacle Katniss and Peeta lived through decades later. Not to mention, this book will soon see the big screen November 17 of this year.\n\n\u201cIn Watermelon Sugar\u201d by Richard Brautigan\nThis postmodern classic published in 1968 is a short, sweet and definitely strange novel. Following an unnamed character who lives in an alternative (some would say post apocalyptic world) community style system all made of watermelon sugar, the narrator guides readers through the main characters and everyday life in the society\u2019s meeting center, \u201ciDEATH.\u201d The central tension revolves around Margaret, the narrator\u2019s ex, who conspired with the villain of the story, iBOIL and his followers who leave the community for the Forgotten Works. The Forgotten Works is where all knowledge and remnants of past society are left and iBOIL\u2019s mission is to show the community \u201cthe truth\u201d about iDEATH. One of the most compelling things about \u201cIn Watermelon Sugar\u201d is the narration style and obscure plot. The unnamed narrator uses short, robotic sentences that assume the reader already knows about the world and its rules. The plot is also told in past tense with the end being the explanation for what happens in the first few chapters.\n\n\u201cThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\u201d by Taylor Jekins Reid\nFrom old Hollywood to today, \u201cThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\u201d spans through the career of movie star, Evelyn Hugo, and her seven husbands. Journalist Monique Grant, received an invitation from Hugo for an exclusive interview/tell-all where she discusses her choices in love and acting back in the 1950s. The truth however, behind Hugo\u2019s love life and intentions with Grant is revealed by the end of the story in shocking twists. This novel will keep you at the edge of your seat as there\u2019s always a turn of events that is completely unexpected. This daring sapphic story deals with themes of abuse of power, womanhood, queerness in the 1900s, bisexuality and so much more. There is never a dull moment.\n\n\u201cAll This Could Be Different\u201d by Sarah Thankam Mathews\nThe debut 2022 novel by Mathews, \u201cAll This Could Be Different,\u201d follows Sneha as she graduates from college during the Great Recession and Obama presidency. She takes a job in Milwaukee, makes new friends and begins dating women. Sneha is a South Asian immigrant who is left alone in the United States by her family to build her own life which comes with challenges and hardships all throughout the journey. Mathews drew from her experience as an Indian-American who faced her own financial and career struggles during the pandemic. Sneha is a fresh narrator with a new voice that is raw, blunt and unforgivingly real. From the first few pages, readers can tell that this novel will bring to light a new voice that is often overlooked in the media; highlighting the brown queer experience. This book will make you laugh and cry simultaneously.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Matt Ludtke)\n\nBy Michael Fiumefreddo July 28, 2023 at 5:03 pm PDT\n\nFor the past two years, I\u2019ve created my own draft rankings prior to draft season. I discovered this system helps in multiple ways, such as knowing the names of and how I value every player, but more importantly using the rankings to choose between players in advance rather than in the one minute or so I\u2019m on the clock. While this task might seem intimidating, time-consuming and risky depending on your knowledge of the NFL, but as I start to build my rankings for this upcoming season, my three-step system simplifies this daunting task. To build your own rankings and gain an advantage on your leaguemates, follow these steps.\n\nStep 1: Make a Player Pool\n\nThe French term \u201cmise en place\u201d is used in cooking to describe the process of preparing all of your ingredients before the cooking begins. This step is the mise en place of building your fantasy rankings. Go to the \u2018Depth Charts\u2019 section of ESPN\u2019s NFL page, go through each team and copy down 1-2 quarterbacks and tight ends and 2-4 running backs and wide receivers into a separate document. By doing this, you\u2019ll now have a pool of about 35-40 quarterbacks and tight ends, and 60-80 running backs and wide receivers. That\u2019s over 200 players. My one fear when creating rankings is forgetting a crucial player or missing a free agent transaction. With the player pool, you\u2019ll be familiar with every roster, eliminating the fear of missing people. Don\u2019t be concerned about the high number of players either. Remember, you are making position rankings only, not full rankings (I\u2019ll explain why later) and most drafts tend to only have 150-180 picks with 20-30 being defenses and kickers, so cap your rankings off whenever you feel comfortable.\n\nStep 2: Place Players into Tiers\n\nNow it\u2019s time to rank. Well, sort of. Now that you have a pool of players to choose from, you\u2019re going to want to make a few tier lists. For reference, these are examples of some tiers I\u2019m using this season: QB/TE Top Dogs Mid-Tier Starters Late Round Picks Worthy of a Backup Pick Undrafted RB/WR Studs Low End No. 1-Top No. 2 Good No. 2 Upside Flex Mid-Round Flex/Bench Handcuffs/Take a chance Deep Sleepers/Afterthoughts Now that you\u2019ve established your tiers, place each player into the one that corresponds with their outlook for this fantasy season. How you do this is very important. Going player-by-player is an option, but gets messy since you might categorize players differently each time, which ends with having to change everything around in Step 3. I like to go tier-by-tier, so you can group players accordingly. It also helps catch mistakes, such as adding players to a tier if you missed out on them the first time around. To make your rankings as expert-like as possible, take inspiration from expert rankings for this step. They\u2019re a good basis on each player\u2019s draft stock, helps eliminate personal bias and can help identify sleepers. If I see a player I\u2019m unfamiliar with or think is way too high on an expert rank, I research why that is to help persuade my own rankings.\n\nStep 3: Rank Each Tier\n\nOnce every player is sorted into their respective tiers, it\u2019s time to rank. At the end of this step, combine each tier to format your rankings at each position. Contrary to what might be expected, take as little time as necessary to decide between each player. Do as much research as needed, but the decision should come down to a simple question: \u201cIf I was drafting right now, which player would I take?\u201d I do this because it\u2019s exactly what I would be doing on draft day, just without any pressure or time constraints. Of course, if you\u2019re unfamiliar with players, do some research to help make your decision now instead of when you\u2019re on the clock.\n\nHelpful Hints\n\nThe time to start ranking is now. Like any good project, waiting until the last minute is never useful. This allows you time to edit and make changes to your list as the preseason goes on. For example, Joe Burrow was carted off the field yesterday at training camp, so edit your rankings accordingly when more information comes out about him potentially missing time. I find ranking players regardless of position a useless and a waste of precious prep time. By the middle of the draft, you\u2019ll find yourself drafting based on team need rather than best player available. There\u2019s no need to have a positionless ranking in that scenario. Instead, go into the draft with players in mind for the first three or four rounds. I suggest making a ranking of the top 15 running backs and wide receivers with a few others mixed in. Once you\u2019ve got the core of your team, reassess your needs and use your rankings the rest of the way. As for kickers and defenses, I tend to stay away from ranking them given the minimal value they have on your team. I like to identify five or six of each that can potentially stay on my roster throughout the season and look for players with good matchups in Week 1 if those are already taken. If all else fails, use expert rankings. Check my website on August 15 for the release of my 2023 Fantasy Rankings.\n\n\u201cFantasy Fridays\u201d is a column by Michael Fiumefreddo about fantasy football draft prep that runs every Friday.\n```"}

{"key": "/2023/07/26/socal-soccer-spotlight-assessing-the-la-clubs-postseason-dreams/", "response": "```\nSoCal Soccer Spotlight: Assessing the LA clubs\u2019 postseason dreams\n\nWith the Women\u2019s World Cup underway and the Leagues Cup just beginning, this week gives us a prime opportunity to step back and judge how the rest of the season could play out for LA\u2019s three top-division clubs.\n\nAs discussed in last week\u2019s issue, LAFC should be a lock for the playoffs but have stumbled in recent matches. Their issue, though, does not seem to be a simple attacking or defensive underperformance. In fact, the defense has admirably withstood injury issues while 2021 All-Star centerback Jes\u00fas Murillo and right back Sergi Palencia have been on the sidelines. Palencia \u2014 a new signing from the winter \u2014 has been a big miss. The Spanish defender is an adept passer who can provide control to LAFC\u2019s build-up play. That\u2019s exactly what LAFC have lacked recently: control.\n\nLAFC\u2019s summer matches have been turning into basketball games, all transitional play that leaves the midfielders running back and forth constantly, unable to slow things down. That has worked well for LAFC\u2019s attackers, but leaves the team vulnerable on the counter. Against LA Galaxy on July 4, for example, LAFC had 17 shots and 5 \u201cbig chances\u201d according to FotMob\u2019s metrics, but the Galaxy just edged them on possession with 52% of the ball and won the game using Riqui Puig\u2019s ability to control his team\u2019s tempo. LAFC\u2019s match against Minnesota on July 15 went similarly, with Emanuel Reynoso creating high-probability chances for the Loons and converting one himself.\n\nIn order to stay in contention for the MLS Cup, LAFC need to be comfortable slowing the game down and controlling the ball, especially against weaker teams who want to play transitional soccer. This break before their first Leagues Cup match should allow defensive midfielder Ilie S\u00e1nchez and box-to-box runner Kellyn Acosta to stay fresh and return to dominating matches once MLS play resumes. Fortunately for LAFC, they have a relatively easy end to the season. Based on current Supporters\u2019 Shield standings, LAFC\u2019s upcoming opponents\u2019 average league position is about 17th out of 29, including five of the bottom seven clubs. They should be able to rack up some confidence-boosting wins in the final weeks.\n\nPrediction: LAFC finish first in the Western Conference and return to the MLS Cup final, where they\u2019ll lose to the Eastern Conference champion.\n\nEven if their form dramatically improves, LA Galaxy will need some luck in order to make the playoffs. With 12 games left to play, the five-time MLS Cup winners sit 13th out of 14 teams in the Western conference. It\u2019s bleak! Riqui Puig and Douglas Costa will need to go, and stay, supernova to propel their team into the postseason. For as excellent as Puig has been in recent weeks \u2014 enough to deserve an All-Star selection (we don\u2019t need to talk about what Arsenal did to the MLS crew in that game...) \u2014 the roster construction demands that he scores goals and he started the season slowly on that front. It\u2019s unfair to demand that a midfielder become his team\u2019s entire offense, but with Chicharito (a.k.a. Javier Hern\u00e1ndez) injured for the rest of the season, it\u2019s not clear who else head coach Greg Vanney expects to score goals. Costa has yet to score in 2023, and even when he was playing for some of Europe\u2019s top clubs (Juventus, Bayern Munich, Shakhtar Donetsk), he never bagged more than six league goals in a season. The Brazilian winger can create chances for his teammates, but at the end of the day, he\u2019s really just a dribbly boi, in the language of Tifo Football. So unless former frosted tips enthusiast Preston Judd starts scoring for fun, it\u2019s hard to see how Puig can put a whole team on his 5\u20327\u2032\u2032 back.\n\nAdding to the Galaxy\u2019s problems, they have a harder run-in than LAFC. The club\u2019s final 12 games are against teams with a current average ranking of about 14th in the combined league table. But if the Galaxy can use the Leagues Cup as a springboard for MLS form, maybe they can pull off a minor miracle.\n\nPrediction: The Galaxy climb a few places up the table to 10th, but fall short of the ninth place play-in berth.\n\nAngel City need only a four-point swing to make the playoffs, but they have just five games left to accomplish it. NWSL matches resume on Aug. 18, two days after the Women\u2019s World Cup semifinals will have been played, so theoretically, most NWSL players on international duty will have returned to their clubs by that date. In Angel City\u2019s case, however, they could still be missing two crucial players when they face Racing Louisville on Aug. 19. U.S. women\u2019s national team fans will be hoping their team makes the WWC final on Aug. 20, but if they do, ACFC will be without Julie Ertz and Alyssa Thompson for that first game. If post-World Cup celebrations and recovery lasts about a week \u2014 which would be reasonable \u2014 the Angel City duo could miss their club\u2019s match against OL Reign on Aug. 27 as well.\n\nIn 2022, the Chicago Red Stars were the sixth and final team to make the playoffs, finishing the regular season with 33 points. At this point, it\u2019s literally impossible for Angel City to hit that mark, but thankfully, considering the league is more competitive from top to bottom (I should also note that the league is playing 20 instead of 22 games this season), they don\u2019t have to. By my estimation, ten or more points (three wins, one draw, one loss) will probably be enough for Angel City to squeak into the postseason. Head coach Becki Tweed\u2019s crew have a kind schedule ahead of them, too. Angel City plays both the clubs below them in the table (KC Current and Chicago Red Stars) and their most challenging opponent, based on the current NWSL standings, is fourth-place OL Reign. The stage is set for a late-season surge, but if ACFC drop points on the road in Kansas City or Chicago, the fans\u2019 wait for the playoffs will continue to 2024.\n\nPrediction: Angel City squeezes into sixth place and makes the playoffs with some final-day drama. In the first round, the three-seed knocks out ACFC.\n\nWorld CUpdate (see what I did there?) In an unnecessary boost to my ego, one of last week\u2019s World Cup predictions came true on the tournament\u2019s first day. World Cup hosts New Zealand, who had never won a Women\u2019s World Cup game in their previous five tournament appearances, secured their first victory, shocking group favorites Norway 1-0 thanks to a goal from veteran striker Hannah Wilkinson. After the match, team captain and LA-native Ali Riley gave this emotional interview about their long wait for a win. However, their ultimate fate remains in doubt after losing 0-1 to World Cup debutants the Philippines (including former Trojan Dominique Randle) in their second match.\n\nJun Endo and Japan launched their World Cup campaign with a five-goal demolition of Zambia. Endo, despite playing in a more defensive left wing-back position, scored a goal and provided an assist for Mina Tanaka in the second half, brushing aside my concerns about her or her team\u2019s ability to score. Japan defeated Las Ticas of Costa Rica 2-0 this morning (Endo did not make an appearance) and Spain also put five on Zambia, so the group will come down to Spain vs. Japan on the final matchday. Whatever happens, Japan has already qualified for the knockouts.\n\nAfter some hemming and hawing on my part last week, Julie Ertz did start the U.S.\u2019s opening match ... but not in the position I expected. Apparently, when Portland Thorns centerback and USWNT stalwart Becky Sauerbrunn was ruled out of the tournament through injury, manager Vlatko Andonovski viewed Ertz as a natural candidate to assume Sauerbrunn\u2019s position. It worked well. The USWNT beat Vietnam 3-0 in their tournament opener (it should\u2019ve been four, had Alex Morgan converted her first-half penalty), dominating the game with 28 total shots and 66% possession. In fact, the U.S. was arguably wasteful with their striking, missing eight out 10 \u201cbig chances,\u201d per FotMob. Ertz at centerback could work going forward, but it certainly helped that Vietnam posed the U.S. little threat \u2014 the Golden Star Women Warriors (quite the nickname, eh?) failed to post a single shot. Against the Netherlands, it may be wise to move Ertz back into midfield (sorry, Andi Sullivan) and bring in a natural centerback to partner with Naomi Girma. Alyssa Thompson also featured from the bench, coming on for Trinity Rodman. If the USWNT beats the Netherlands on matchday two, Thompson could start against Portugal in the final group match. Keep your eyes peeled.\n\nGalaxy Leagues Cup opener rescheduled I was going to watch LA Galaxy play Club Le\u00f3n in their Leagues Cup debut and break it down for this column. Alas, like many travelers have experienced this summer, the airplanes did not cooperate. On Friday, Le\u00f3n beat the Vancouver Whitecaps on the road, with the match requiring 32 penalty kicks to settle (Leagues Cup matches go straight to penalties if tied at the end of regulation). The Mexican team was scheduled to play the Galaxy at 7:30 p.m. PDT on Tuesday, but a mechanical issue with Le\u00f3n\u2019s charter plane delayed the team\u2019s departure from Vancouver and therefore affected their pre-match preparations. A video of the Le\u00f3n players hanging at the gate like common folk went minorly viral. The rescheduled game will take place at the same time on Wednesday.\n\nSo far in the Leagues Cup, MLS clubs have a 6-3 record against Liga MX clubs.\n\nNext games: LAFC: TBD Angel City: Saturday, July 29 vs. Portland Thorns (home) LA Galaxy: Wednesday, July 26 vs. Le\u00f3n (home)\n```"}

(Photo by Balin Schneider)\n\nBy Balin Schneider\nJuly 25, 2023 at 6:24 pm PDT\n\nDown the street from Netflix headquarters, where WGA and SAG-AFTRA members are on strike, stands Gladys Avyla. Painted on her lips is bright red lipstick as she sports a yellow vest that reflects on her bright cherry earrings. She chants \u201cs\u00ed se puede.\u201d The phrase is commonly used by Latinx UFW union strikers, which translates to \u201cyes we can.\u201d It\u2019s the third wave of hotel strikes in Los Angeles following hotel workers\u2019 demands for higher wages and health insurance.\n\nAvyla, who\u2019s lived in Los Angeles since 2009, is an El Salvadoran immigrant who sends remittance back to her family in Central America. She supports her aunt and other family members there, who can\u2019t afford, or don\u2019t have access to jobs in El Salvador. \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough money, so it makes a big difference to be able to support them and send that money back,\u201d Avyla said. \u201cThe other thing in El Salvador right now that\u2019s been difficult for my family is it\u2019s really hard to get jobs.\u201d\n\nGladys Avyla speaks with a fellow union striker at the W Hotel protest in Hollywood on July 21st, 2023. (Photo by Balin Schneider)\n\nThe World Bank, an organization that tracks global remittance data, reported that El Salvador received $270 million in 2022 from U.S. residents. El Salvador\u2019s current total GDP is $28 billion. Remittances from the United States to Central America are very common. In 2022 remittances grew 14% compared to 2021. Avyla says that remittances are vital to supporting communities in laborers\u2019 home counties. \u201cIt\u2019s super essential because the jobs and the wages over there in our home countries are, it\u2019s nothing. It doesn\u2019t reach to survive.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been 11 years since Avyla started as a housekeeper at the W Hotel in Hollywood. Avyla says she\u2019s striking because of a lack of access to good healthcare and her $25 an hour wage, which causes her to commute over an hour to work every day. Avyla lives in Victorville, an outer suburb of Los Angeles. Most hotel workers we spoke to expressed that the cost of living in Los Angeles, in the area of their hotels, was too expensive. For comparison, an average hotel room at the W Hotel is $400 a night.\n\nDown Sunset Blvd, in West Hollywood, workers are also striking at the One Hotel West Hollywood and the Andaz Hotel. Marcus Molina, a bakery assistant at One Hotel, decided to strike due to his lack of equitable pay. \u201cThis is one of the most expensive cities in the world. So they\u2019re asking for $25 and better health benefits. And this, the 1% is saying no. Oh, that\u2019s too much.\u201d\n\nMarcus Molina holds up a \u201cHonk For Justice\u201d sign as cars zoom by at the One Hotel in West Hollywood on July 21st, 2023. (Photo by Balin Schneider)\n\nBoth hotels seem to be striking over a couple of fundamental issues: pay, work hours and benefits. Molina says that most workers are overworked, underpaid, and don\u2019t understand their rights. \u201cYou know, a lot of these housekeepers, they don\u2019t speak English. They\u2019re scared. They don\u2019t know their rights. They\u2019re forced to do like twenty rooms in a day, and that\u2019s too many, sometimes, but they\u2019re scared to get fired. So they clock out early.\u201d\n\nAvyla, who spoke through a translator, a bi-lingual union leader, doesn\u2019t speak English. It is a common issue amongst housekeepers and contributes to workplace literacy issues. Thomas Lenz, a Former National Labor Relations Board attorney and law professor at USC, echoes these issues. \u201cI\u2019m bilingual in Spanish, and I often found that there was a language gap, a lack of information, perhaps, getting to the employees or maybe a lack of understanding of the potential impact of something on the employees themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nLenz says workers are generally unaware of their rights. In addition, laws are generally blurry when it comes to workplace retaliation. \u201cOne other thing that I think tends to maybe discourage strike activity generally is workplaces are able to hire replacement employees for employees who go on strike. Typically, when the strike ends, the employer needs to make a decision whether striking employees go back or the replacements do.\u201d Lenz says that the Clinton, Obama and Biden administrations have all tried to change policy on workplace replacement retaliation.\n\nFor people like Avyla, this pressure weighs heavily when they are unsure if they will ever return to work. Strikers are unpaid while striking, and strike funds tend to be limited in high-demand industries like Hospitality. Both the W Hotel and its parent company, Marriott, did not respond to our request for comment. A manager for One Hotel Hollywood declined to comment.\n\nBut the vision of the strike doesn\u2019t seem to be lost on the workers. Avyla was nothing but optimistic about getting their demands met. \u201cI feel happy. It\u2019s really powerful. It\u2019s really exciting to be out here. It\u2019s the first time it\u2019s a big experience for us to be here, and I\u2019m confident. I think we\u2019re gonna win.\u201d\n\nJaelyn Gonzalez contributed to this article.\n```"}

James, the eldest son of legendary NBA player LeBron James, was rushed to the hospital Monday. According to the James family, the incoming freshman is out of the intensive care unit and in stable condition.\n\nArya Desai, a senior majoring in theatre and journalism from Los Angeles, said that like a lot of Trojans, she has been excited to cheer on Bronny James at games this year. Now, Desai is hoping both Bronny and the basketball team are able to rebound.\n\n\u201cI was shocked that someone so young and experienced could have suffered from something as serious as cardiac arrest,\u201d Desai said. \u201cJames is an exciting addition to the team and I sincerely hope he recovers and gets a chance to play.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I speak for most people when I say we\u2019ve all been looking forward to seeing him continue his family\u2019s legacy this upcoming season.\u201d\n\nOther students like senior cyber operations major Ethan Vicente said they were worried about what the event might mean for Bronny James\u2019s future health.\n\n\u201cFirst off I was really shocked,\u201d Vicente said. \u201cI\u2019m glad the first thing I read was that he is in stable condition. I don\u2019t know much about cardiac arrest, but I assume it could cause permanent damage, even be fatal. I know he\u2019s worked hard to get to this point so I\u2019m really hoping he can continue at a high level.\u201d\n\nVicente is also a Trojan basketball fan, and like many other students, he was excited to see what the team could do this year with James and other high-profile recruits joining an experienced team.\n\n\u201cObviously, for USC basketball it\u2019s really significant if he plays or not,\u201d Vicente said. \u201cI was looking forward to a great season with him, Isaiah Collier and Boogie [Ellis]. But, if he has to stop playing in order to make a full recovery, that\u2019s of course the most important thing.\u201d\n\nAnd students weren\u2019t just concerned about James\u2019s health. They were also worried about the spotlight he must live under, given his father\u2019s global fame.\n\nSenior international relations major Sam Wahl said \u201cit felt strange to learn about it from breaking news notifications from platforms like the NYT and CNN.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has so many eyes on him that this kind of news is making national headlines, probably only adding to the pressure I imagine he would feel,\u201d Wahl said.\n\nWahl added: \u201cMore than anything, I hope he is able to return to good health and that this won\u2019t infringe on his prospective athletic career.\u201d\n\nUSC senior and Vocal Arts major Albert Gonzales said he is a big Laker fan. He even has Laker flags in his room. Gonzales is also a big Trojan fan, and he was \u201creally looking forward to seeing [Bronny] play.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s shocking and unfortunate that this happened to him, but you never know what could happen when you\u2019re playing a sport,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cI am just hoping that he is healthy enough to play.\u201d\n```"}

James was then taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, as reported by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nJames was a consensus four-star recruit coming out of Sierra Canyon High School and is ranked the No. 20 overall recruit in the 2023 class by ESPN. Listed at 6-foot-3 and 180 pounds, the highly touted guard announced his commitment to USC in May over Ohio State and Oregon.\n\nSeveral notable celebrities and athletes have already expressed support for James and his family on social media.

He made his college debut on Jan. 12 against Colorado, just over six months after his medical incident, and went on to play in 14 games for the Trojans last season.\n\nThe USC men\u2019s basketball team was preparing to embark on an overseas trip beginning next week, featuring exhibition games in Greece and Croatia. The squad looks to be one of the best in the nation in the upcoming season, with returning All-Pac-12 guard Boogie Ellis and the No. 1 recruit in the 2023 class, Isaiah Collier, playing alongside James in a supremely talented backcourt.\n\nThis is a developing story with updates to be provided.\n```"}

This past weekend, the brand put on a phenomenal pay-per-view event, \u201cROH Death Before Dishonor,\u201d with banger after banger match. And main eventing that event were the standouts of this entire week of wrestling, Athena and Willow Nightingale. Even with the big hype surrounding ROH\u2019s star-studded event, WWE and AEW also had some great matches over the past week. The ongoing stories between Blackpool Combat Club and The Elite for AEW and The Bloodline falling apart for WWE are also always great to tune into.\n\nHere are the top pro wrestling matches from the past week:\n\nMatt Riddle vs. Gunther (WWE Monday Night Raw, July 17)\nGunther started off this match by hitting Matt Riddle with chops heard around the world and effectively giving Riddle red marks across his chest. For a heavyweight, Gunther still has some technical tenacity with his matches that make them all worth a watch. Riddle gained a bit of momentum with some submission holds, one of which got Gunther out of the ring and led to Riddle delivering a soccer kick. But, Gunther turned that around on Riddle right after and slammed him down on the floor outside of the ring. Riddle\u2019s will to not give up was admirable in this match, considering how much damage he took, but in the end, Riddle\u2019s small bursts of offense weren\u2019t enough to defeat Gunther.\n\nAthena vs. Willow Nightingale (ROH Death Before Dishonor, July 21)\nCompeting for the ROH Women\u2019s World Championship, Athena and Willow Nightingale put on a spectacle in this match. Athena\u2019s striking power is unmatched, but she also has speed and high-flying moves added to her arsenal that makes her a big threat. The number of kicks she hit Nightingale with would be enough to knock out an everyday competitor. Thankfully for Nightingale, she\u2019s not an everyday competitor; she\u2019s a champion in her own right and a true powerhouse. Eventually, though, Athena\u2019s submission hold had Nightingale fading, and the referee was forced to call the match in Athena\u2019s favor.\n\nBlood & Guts Steel Cage Match: Blackpool Combat Club (Jon Moxley, Wheeler Yuta, Claudio Castagnoli), Konosuke Takeshita + PAC vs. The Golden Elite (Kenny Omega, Kota Ibushi, Hangman Adam Page, Nick & Matt Jackson) (AEW Dynamite, July 19)\nImagine a steel cage, no rules and five versus five ... absolute carnage. This match lived up to the name \u201cblood and guts\u201d without a doubt. From Jon Moxley driving a screwdriver into the heads of several Golden Elite members to various competitors getting thrown into a bed of nails, thumbtacks, broken glass, tables, and even suplexed on top of the steel cage. Aside from the extra theatrics, the pure wrestling was also in play, especially by the Jackson brothers and Kenny Omega. At some point in the match, it became three on five as both Konosuke Takeshita and PAC walked out on Blackpool Combat Club. That led to the Elite picking apart their remaining competitors and inevitably pulling off the victory by making Wheeler Yuta pass out due to having a metal chain wrapped around his neck. I\u2019d also like to note that though PAC and Claudio Castagnoli were fighting together for this match, they had an incredible bout against each other soon after at ROH Death Before Dishonor for the ROH World Championship.\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d is a pro wrestling column by Maddy Myer that runs every Monday.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/07/24/war-zone-jarred-kelenics-rise-to-mediocrity/", "response": "```\nWAR Zone: Jarred Kelenic\u2019s rise to mediocrity\n\nBy Dominic Varela July 24, 2023 at 1:01 pm PDT\n\nJarred Kelenic should probably stop kicking water coolers. That is, unless he enjoys fracturing his left foot, which he did last Wednesday after a ninth-inning strikeout. A frustrated Kelenic suffered a lapse in judgment and ensured his spot among a long list of comical baseball injuries. Then again, who could blame him? The water cooler was practically asking for it.\n\nFunnily enough, it was a lack of patience that plagued Kelenic that night; the patience that Kelenic lacked for the first two years of his major league career, and the very same patience for Kelenic \u2014 from Mariners fans \u2014 that had worn extremely thin going into this season. And it was well-deserved \u2014 because he was bad. Very, very bad. By the end of 2022, Kelenic\u2019s career batting average stood at .168, the second-lowest in major league history for batters with at least 550 career plate appearances. The former top prospect had hit rock bottom.\n\nWhat do you do when you hit rock bottom? You dig. And over the offseason, Kelenic must have grabbed a shovel. As of July 24, Kelenic has been worth 2.0 Wins Above Replacement, more than several All-Stars. He\u2019s hitting the ball harder than ever and making weak contact less than two percent of the time. He\u2019s even playing above-average defense in the outfield. Essentially, he\u2019s looked \u2014 and played \u2014 like an entirely different player.\n\nAnd it all comes down to exit velocity. Average exit velocity takes all recorded exit velocities (in miles per hour) and divides by every batted ball event. Basically, it measures how hard you tend to hit the ball. This year, Kelenic\u2019s AEV is up over five miles per hour, a pretty substantial year-to-year change. At 91.6 mph, Kelenic is in the 84th percentile for all qualified batters, which explains why his batting average no longer looks like the price of a Snickers bar.\n\nBut not only is he hitting the ball harder, he\u2019s hitting in the air less. Kelenic is hitting nearly twice as many line drives as last year and has noticeably cut down on fly balls. You have a decent shot at landing a hit on a nicely hit fly ball, but with a hard-hit line drive, it\u2019s almost a guarantee.\n\nThe funny thing is, he was undoubtedly always capable of this. If you can crush a ball once, you can probably repeat it. In 2022, he hit a ball 114 mph, which only 6% of major league hitters managed to do. And despite only playing in 54 games in 2022, Kelenic managed to hit seven homers, which would put him on pace for around 20, a solid achievement. He was still atrocious, but the peripherals were there; Kelenic \u2014 and the fans \u2014 just needed to be patient.\n\nUnfortunately, baseball is where patience goes to die. With players such as Juan Soto and Ronald Acuna Jr. showcasing superstar-level talent before they could buy a beer, fans have come to expect stardom out the gate. The reality is, that\u2019s not fair. Kelenic was doing this when he could have been a college undergraduate. Instead, he was one of 750 players at the top of his field. And yeah, it may have taken him a while to get comfortable, but he just turned 24. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of minor league players older than him.\n\nWith that being said, he\u2019s still not great. Far from bad, and not particularly close to good. He strikes out way too much \u2014 over 32% of the time \u2014 for a guy with only 11 homers. He also hits the ball on the ground nearly half the time, which isn\u2019t great no matter how hard he hits it. If Kelenic truly wants to ascend into the player he was once promised to become, he has plenty of work to do.\n\nSo, is he good? No, probably not. Not yet, at least. For one, he probably shouldn\u2019t make a habit of practicing karate in the dugout. You don\u2019t kick things in baseball, Jarred. But he also needs to \u2014 say it with me now \u2014 remain patient. Players better than Kelenic have fallen out of the league after failing to resolve swing-and-miss problems. It would be a shame if he came this close to the mountaintop and fell right back to base camp.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: baseball teams love mediocre. Mediocre is consistent, easy to understand, and, most importantly, not bad. When you can get \u201cbad\u201d from thousands of guys in the minors, mediocre can be a godsend. Unfortunately, while Kelenic has flipped a switch in 2023, so have the formerly playoff-bound Seattle Mariners. As of July 24, they are 50-49, fourth in their division and 4.5 games out of a postseason spot. They have struggled with consistency all year and, thanks to last Wednesday\u2019s incident, will be without their rock for another few days.\n\nImagine that: at one point, Jarred Kelenic may have been the most inconsistent player in the world. This year, he may have been the only thing keeping Seattle afloat. So while Kelenic doesn\u2019t pile on star-studded stats, he still provides tremendous value for his ballclub. He shows up, does his best to win and goes home. And right now, that\u2019s all he should be expected to do. If he\u2019s able to provide a league-average bat and above-average defense, any team would love to command his services. Above all else, if he can do that every day, then the Mariners may become something serious. After all, as the saying goes, the best ability is availability. In the minds of major league clubs, he\u2019s probably one of the most dependable hitters out there. And if it weren\u2019t for that water cooler, there would be no doubt.\n\n\u201cWAR Zone\u201d is a column by Dominic Varela about some of his favorite stats in baseball and the wacky stories they tell us that runs every Monday.\n```"}

(Photo by Myriam Alcala)\n\nBy Myriam Alcala July 24, 2023 at 9:50 am PDT\n\nThis summer has been packed with venue after venue being booked for tours. Many of which will be making their way to Los Angeles in the fall including Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9. Here are some of the most notable tours making their way into the city.\n\nThe Eras Tour\nBreaking yet another record with the most number 1 albums in history by a woman after Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version), Taylor Swift is sailing smoothly towards the end of the U.S. leg of the infamous Eras Tour. Swift added three additional shows in Los Angeles making it six total nights she will be spending at SoFi Stadium. She will be performing from August 3 through 5 and 7 through 9. Additional sales for the added dates were released earlier this summer and have now sold out. But not to fret, many on TikTok have shown their success in getting tickets the night before or morning of the shows so there is still hope for Swifties that have not secured a ticket yet. The three and a half hour show takes the audience through the entire discography in \u201ceras\u201d and Swift picks two surprise songs every show to perform live for one night only.\n\nThe Renaissance World Tour\nBeyonc\u00e9 is also touring this summer in an all stadium tour across the country and world. Following her seventh studio album, \u201cRenaissance,\u201d this is the first time Beyonc\u00e9 performs solo since her Formation World Tour back in 2016. The highly anticipated performer will make her way to Los Angeles for three shows from September 1, 2 and 4 at SoFi Stadium. To follow updates of the tour, follow https://tour.beyonce.com as each city highlights a different aspect of the tour filled with great music, costumes and choreography.\n\nSnow Hard Feelings\nBroadway singer, Renee Rapp, has been making waves since releasing her EP, \u201cEverything to Everyone\u201d back in 2022 with hits like \u201cToo Well.\u201d Now onto her second album \u201cSnow Angel,\u201d Rapp is set to start touring right away. She has sold out her Greek Theater show on September 30 in Los Angeles but will be playing two shows near the city around the same time; one in San Diego on September 25 and Oakland on October 2. One of the most notable things about Rapp from her last tour is her connection to fans because she is only 23 and relates to the young adult fanbase, so this tour is set to have some fun moments to remember.\n\nThe tour\nThe trio, boygenius, has been touring the U.S. all summer with bandmate, Phoebe Bridgers, joining Taylor Swift on a leg of her tour. Most recently, boygenius, which is made up of Bridgers, Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus, announced they will be at the Hollywood Bowl for one night only, on Halloween. Their most recent album, \u201cThe record,\u201d made waves with songs like \u201cNot Strong Enough\u201d which will surely be a once in a lifetime experience to hear at the Bowl.

(AP Photo/Andy Clayton-King)\n\nBy Michael Fiumefreddo\nJuly 21, 2023 at 5:03 pm PDT\n\nIt\u2019s almost August, which means fantasy football drafts are right around the corner. I always say that it\u2019s never too early to start prepping for the fantasy football season, but there is a point where it becomes too late. Think of it as cramming for a big test the night before as opposed to thoroughly preparing in advance. With about one month until draft lobbies open, that time is approaching fast.\n\nLet me be clear, prepping for a fantasy draft doesn\u2019t mean reading over the rankings and selecting which players to draft; there\u2019s much more to it. Understanding what this year looks like, then applying it to the league you\u2019re in are crucial steps to do before deciding the 15 or so players to roster for Week 1. Thankfully, your leaguemates might not be doing this either, so following these steps already gives you a leg up on your competition.\n\nHere are three things you should be doing over the next month to properly prepare for your fantasy drafts.\n\nSimulated Mock Drafts\nJust like in the actual NFL, fantasy football has mock drafts too. Experts usually get together on shows and podcasts to put together these mock drafts for others to use as research. While these are great insights from people who get paid to give fantasy football advice, this prep means nothing without hands-on experience. Your actual draft shouldn\u2019t be your first of the year. NFL teams run walkthroughs of their game plan; they don\u2019t just go out and play without practice.\n\nThankfully, there are websites where you can do as many mock drafts as you want. There\u2019s two types of mock drafts that you can do: live lobbies and simulated. Live lobbies put you in a draft against other fantasy players trying to prep for their drafts. While it seems smart to draft against human beings, these tend to be time consuming, not taken seriously and an inevitable autopick can ruin the entire experience. I choose simulated drafts because these factors are taken away.\n\nFantasy Pros has a great simulator that proves different results every time. The human aspect of a draft is lost, however simulators are a great basis of what rounds players will be taken and are fast enough that multiple can be done in the time it takes to do one live draft.\n\nPro Tip: If you know what pick you will be drafting at, try multiple strategies at that spot and see which team you like best.\n\nTalk Strategy with your Leaguemates\nThis might sound a bit strange, but think about a game of poker \u2014 knowing your opponents\u2019 tells, tactics and what hand they might have are just as important as the hand you\u2019re playing. While at the table, you\u2019ll have to figure those out on your own, but you\u2019d be surprised how much people are willing to reveal in a casual conversation.\n\nI\u2019ve played fantasy football with friends I\u2019ve had since middle school. As competitive as we are, talking sports is never out of the question. The topic of fantasy inevitably comes up, which means it\u2019s time to do some investigating. By sharing some of your tips and strategy for this season, your leaguemates will respond by oversharing theirs.\n\nI\u2019ve learned what sleepers my friends like, what approach they would be taking in the draft and once was able to predict how the entire first round would play out. Be careful with this though because the idea is to get information, not give too much. Bluffing is a bit tricky since you\u2019ll need to make an argument for a player completely off of your radar and talk with a straight face.\n\nI tend to be honest, only talk about players I\u2019m considering \u2014 not necessarily dying to have on my team \u2014 and let my friends drive the conversation.\n\nPro Tip: Talk about first round picks because everyone will have their preferences set, and a common sleeper that the media is already talking about.\n\nMake Your Own Rankings\nThe most tedious and challenging prep work of fantasy football, but arguably the most beneficial. While there are experts that get paid to do this work, it\u2019s not just reserved for them; anybody with the right knowledge can put together unique rankings.\n\nMy main fear with this is incorporating personal bias more than I should and missing a reason an expert ranked a player higher than I did. Instead of blindly ranking 200 or so players, I take inspiration from expert rankings and put a personal spin on them, which makes the rankings unique.\n\nThere\u2019s two huge reasons why you must make your own rankings. The first is knowing how you value players differently than expert rankings. In online drafts, most of your league will be using the rankings provided to them. In my experiences, I\u2019ll notice a player I\u2019m high on to be an afterthought to the rest because the website rankings have them much lower.\n\nI\u2019m confident in my rankings, meaning I have two options if I want this player: take them right away before someone else notices, or wait a few rounds and get the player at a great value.\n\nThe second reason is even more important. On draft day, you\u2019ll be met with tough decisions on a group of two or more players. Say there are three wide receivers you\u2019re interested in and they\u2019re all available at your pick. Without rankings, the minute or so clock ticks away as you panic and make a tough decision on the fly.\n\nWith rankings, you\u2019ve already made this decision. Pick the player you\u2019ve ranked highest and don\u2019t second guess yourself. It\u2019ll save a ton of time and stress that will help the draft run more smoothly and effectively.\n\nPro Tip: Check out next week\u2019s column for more tips on putting together your rankings.\n\n\u201cFantasy Fridays\u201d is a column by Michael Fiumefreddo about fantasy football draft prep that runs every Friday.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Brooklyn Aguilera)\n\nBy Ennes Kahf July 21, 2023 at 2:07 pm PDT\n\nAs a high schooler, Brooklyn Aguilera received multiple scholarship offers\u2013 but none from the schools she wanted. At least none that could compare to the top water polo programs in the country: the University of Southern California, University of California, Los Angeles, and Stanford University. Aguilera knew that in college, she wanted to challenge herself and push her boundaries as a competitor. She yearned for a program that offered her the same intensity she needed to compete at a high level. \u201cIf I was going to keep playing water polo in college, I wanted to play for a championship,\u201d she said.\n\nOriginally, Aguilera didn\u2019t intend to play for the Trojans. But after visiting the University of California, Santa Barbara, she went on a brief tour of USC\u2019s athletic facilities. The visit changed her perspective on the place she wanted to call home for the next four years. \u201cI remember the minute I walked on the pool deck,\u201d she said, \u201cI was just like this is where I need to be.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Aguilera didn\u2019t end up getting an athletic scholarship from USC. However, she became a preferred walk-on for the water polo team because of her constant communication with Casey Moon, the current head coach of the team. She applied to USC as a normal student, but got placed in a separate admissions pool because of her athletic status. When she got accepted as a Trojan, she was ecstatic. \u201cI got the call and I cried,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the best day of my life.\u201d\n\nBeing a preferred walk-on, Aguilera had a guaranteed roster spot her freshman year, just with no financial assistance. She had immediate success with the Trojans, scoring five goals and helping her team achieve a 12-1 record as a freshman before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted their season.\n\nNow, Aguilera has completely bought into the winning culture at USC, and understands the importance of creating a legacy. In the aquatic center, pictures of prominent USC water polo players who left a mark on the program are hung up on the wall. Along with the pictures, there are plaques for every championship won in USC water polo history, with the names of every player on those championship teams. Every day when Aguilera walks in for practice, she sees those pictures and names and is reminded of the legendary athletes who were in her shoes. This inspires her to leave her own legacy on the Trojan water polo program. \u201cNot many people have their name etched into a piece of USC athletics,\u201d she said.\n\nAs she enters her last year at USC, her goals become her main focus. One \u2013 win a second championship. Second \u2013 be a main contributor to the team. \u201cI want my name to be up there again,\u201d she said. \u201cI want everyone else [on my team] to know how I felt when I first saw my name get put up.\u201d\n\nBefore she found a love for water polo, Aguilera played many other sports. She grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada, with her Hawaiian family. She participated in hula, yoga, and eventually started swimming. Competitive swimming became her focus when her family moved to San Clemente, California. Aguilera was more advanced for her age and was placed in an older competitive age group to showcase her skills. But she often felt lonely. \u201cI was kind of by myself with my coach and [it\u2019s] not that I didn\u2019t like my team\u201dthey were just older than me,\u201d she said.\n\nThe loneliness settled in as Aguilera continued to compete against older swimmers. Because of this, she wanted to participate in a sport with a team aspect to it. She tried out for a club water polo team and found immediate success. At San Clemente High School, she made varsity as a freshman. Although she was the youngest on the team, her fears disappeared instantly. \u201cThe girls were super inclusive and made sure I felt like a part of the team,\u201d she said.\n\nHer teammates were a key component to her success in high school. At San Clemente, she was the 2019 female athlete of the year and league MVP. During her time at USC, she continues to learn from her teammates. \u201cI\u2019m still learning each and every day from freshmen or sophomores who are younger than me,\u201d she said.\n\nBack in Hawaii, Aguilera\u2019s family watches all of her games on TV and supports her in every way they can. Aguilera understands the responsibility she has representing her family and her Hawaiian culture. \u201c[The pressure\u2019s] always there because I want to make them happy. I want them to believe that I made the right choice,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough the immense pressure affects Aguilera, she is adamant about setting a good example for her younger sister, Ella, and the rest of her family. \u201cI want to be someone they can look up to and show that anything\u2019s possible,\u201d she said.\n\nThe pressure doesn\u2019t just come from wanting to make her family proud, however. Aguilera is the first one from her family to play a sport in college, and she\u2019s also the first to attend a four-year university. She is a trailblazer for her family and a role model for her younger sister. \u201cShe\u2019s such a role model [because of] how she just never gives up,\u201d Aguilera\u2019s sister, Ella, said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I love about her.\u201d\n\nAguilera says that because she\u2019s the first one going through these processes, her family expects a lot of her. She has immense pressure to succeed in the pool and in her classes because of the fact that no one in her family has ever been in her shoes. Aguilera holds herself to a higher standard as well, embracing the weight on her shoulders. \u201cI push myself even harder because of that,\u201d she said.\n\nWith her family living in Hawaii, she is also often home sick. Aguilera\u2019s intense water polo program is unforgiving when it comes to visiting family during the holidays. \u201cI feel like I need to do good for them because I\u2019m sacrificing seeing them on holidays,\u201d she said.\n\nBeing the trailblazer and paving the way for future generations as an athlete comes with sacrifice and hard work. Aguilera has had a successful three years at USC, winning a championship in 2021 and scoring 14 goals in her career, while also being a member of the NCAA tournament roster in 2022. She has high hopes for her senior year, and the years beyond that.\n\nCurrently, Aguilera is pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree in health and human sciences. She hopes to start dental school when she graduates in May 2024. \u201cMy dream would be to then do a program like Doctors Without Borders and go to a third world country and help fix teeth for those in need,\u201d she says.\n\nIn the meantime, Aguilera is focused on winning her second championship. \u201cI don\u2019t really plan on playing [water polo] after this year, so I\u2019m going to make it count.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2023/07/20/its-a-catastrophe-capital-c-cornel-west-on-climate-change/", "response": "```\nDr. Cornel West spoke about climate change and the American presidency yesterday in an hour-long webinar hosted by Allison Agsten, the director of the USC Annenberg Center for Climate Journalism and Communication. Dr. West touched on a wide range of topics in the conversation. He mentioned authors like T.S Eliot and Anton Chekhov, musicians like Billie Holiday and the blues, and the philosophy of Martin Heidegger and his critique of European modernity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to see a public intellectual run for office\u201d said Agsten in an interview. But Dr. West\u2019s focus throughout the talk was climate change, repeatedly utilizing the term \u201cecocide\u201d to highlight his views on the gravity of the issue. Dr. West explains the term is part of a language that seeks to convey a \u201creal sense of the life and death situation\u201d he believes the planet is undergoing.\n\n\u201cWhen people talk about genocide, people talk about all kinds of different \u2018-cides.\u2019 That \u2018ecocide\u2019 is simply one particular word among a whole host of words to get to try to seize people\u2019s imagination\u201d Dr. West said. \u2018Climate catastrophe\u2019 is Dr. West\u2019s overarching concern, naming the \u2018destruction of democracy\u2019 and the destruction of the relationships \u2018between people and communities\u2019 as other issues he sees.\n\nDr. West\u2019s discussion with Agsten comes during a record-breaking heat wave that has scorched California and the greater southern United States as extreme weather events like floods have hit countries around the world. Four days prior to the talk, Dr. West tweeted that \u201cEcocide is the ultimate catastrophe,\u201d a view that he explains further in the webinar.\n\n\u201cFor me, there\u2019s a variety of different kinds of catastrophe\u201d Dr. West said. \u201cThere\u2019s ecological catastrophe, there\u2019s economic catastrophe, there\u2019s psychic catastrophe, there\u2019s spiritual catastrophe, there\u2019s political catastrophe.\u201d\n\nTo combat these issues, Dr. West advocated ideas of solidarity, unity, and education throughout his talk, outlining his belief that climate change is a \u201cmoral\u201d and \u201cspiritual\u201d issue that involves all humans and transcends his presidential campaign. \u201cRunning for president is just a moment in a movement. You know what I mean?\u201d Dr. West said. \u201cYou really have a group of people you\u2019re trying to convince to look another way, to act differently, to hit issues [of] poverty, homelessness, corporate greed, inadequate housing, decrepit school systems, militarism abroad, and then, the ultimate catastrophe of ecocide itself.\u201d\n\nHe also advocated ideals of \u2018sensitivity\u2019 and \u2018empathy\u2019 as part of the solution, qualities he discusses when explaining the \u2018moral\u2019 dimension of the climate change issue. \u201cPart of the challenge of speaking to our fellow citizens is to get them not to think so short term, just like the big companies, but to think long term what the Earth will look like later down the road given the massive extractive economy that we find ourselves in at the moment\u201d Dr. West said.\n\nHis message of \u2018connectedness\u2019 with the Earth and long-term thinking is a theme that characterized the webinar. \u201cHe wants to connect with everybody\u201d said Shreya Agrawal, a Climate Fellow at the Center of Climate Journalism and Communication who attended the talk.\n\nAs Dr. West answered Agsten\u2019s questions, other terms came up in the talk, such as \u2018eco-grief\u2019 which refers to the mental distress that people can encounter when thinking about climate change. \u201cEco-grief is something that comes up when I am working with journalists who sometimes spend their day talking about, writing about, thinking about climate change, and that can be awfully heavy\u201d said Agsten.\n\nThe discussion of language between Agsten and Dr. West about the terms that are utilized in the public about climate change is in line with the studies that Agsten and the Center engages in. Throughout the talk, Agsten questioned some of Dr. West\u2019s beliefs and terms, such as his take on climate change being a \u2018moral\u2019 issue. \u201c To me, climate change transcends morals. It is a matter of fact that we all must contend with\u201d Agsten explained.\n\nShe also wonders if Dr. West\u2019s language can \u2018alienate\u2019 some people, his framing of climate change as a \u201cmoral\u201d issue possibly only appealing to the spiritually or religiously minded. Terms such as \u2018eco-cide\u2019 might also only appeal to those who already agree with Dr. West Agsten adds. \u201cWho does the word eco-cide resonate with and who does it potentially alienate?\u201d Agsten said.\n\nThe question of who Dr. West appeals to comes up as he critiques both the Democrat and Republican parties, referring to presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis as \u2018neo-fascists\u2019 in the webinar and recently criticizing President Biden\u2019s \u2018crime against humanity\u2019 in an interview with the New York Post. Dr. West also criticized the Democrats and Republicans for being in a \u2018state of denial\u2019 around the issue of climate change.\n\n\u201cThe state of emergency [around climate change] is beyond really an emergency. It\u2019s a catastrophe capital C\u201d Dr.West said. Dr. West has been observed by progressives and conservatives alike as a \u2018threat\u2019 to President, asserting that Dr. West\u2019s bid may suction off votes from President Biden\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nAll throughout the talk however, Dr. West prefers to use terms such as \u2018citizens\u2019 and \u2018humans\u2019 to refer to the people he is trying to appeal to. He emphasizes his belief that humans are \u2018organisms in the world of organisms,\u2019 and finished the talk with a message of hope against climate change. \u201c I think in the end, we have a chance. I\u2019m not a naive optimist. I\u2019m a prisoner of hope. There\u2019s a qualitative difference. \u201d```"}

It was a verdict that hit close to home. \u201cBarack Obama was president at the time and he said, \u2018If I had a son, he\u2019d look like Trayvon Martin.\u2019 Well, I actually do have a son,\u201d said Abdullah, 50. \u201cHe was three years old at the time and he actually does look like Trayvon Martin. He had the same shiny brown skin and dancing eyes as Trayvon Martin. In Trayvon, I saw my own son.\u201d Motivated by her son, Amen, she went to the streets to protest. And she hasn\u2019t stopped. \u201cI was compelled to get into the streets for Amen, to do work for Amen,\u201d Abdullah said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that on the third day of protests we were actually pulled together and we pledged to build a movement, not a moment. I didn\u2019t realize that my life would be transformed in making that pledge, but my life has been transformed.\u201d\n\nAbdullah is the co-founder and director of Black Lives Matter Grassroots and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles. Celebrating the 10th anniversary of the birth of Black Lives Matter, Abdullah acknowledged that progress has been made, but there\u2019s more work ahead. \u201cWe birthed it as a movement, not a moment, and celebrating 10 years is a testament that so far we\u2019re making good on that promise,\u201d Abdullah said. \u201cThat it\u2019s not just a moment of uprising but a movement to undo unjust systems.\u201d\n\nThe People\u2019s Justice Festival in Leimert Park on July 15 celebrated BLM\u2019s 10th birthday with hundreds of supporters in attendance on a scorching summer day. The heat, however, didn\u2019t slow down the celebration as children ran joyfully around the park\u2019s many vendors and live performers got people out of their seats and dancing. The festival was headlined by keynote speaker Cornel West, a philosopher and third-party 2024 presidential candidate. West spoke on the greatness of the movement and assured those gathered that the celebration was not just for the last 10 years, but the last four centuries. \u201cWe [are] here for the 400 years that we have been wrestling with what means to be human in this strange land,\u201d West said from the Black Brilliance Stage at the festival. \u201cHow do you sing a song in a strange land?\u201d\n\nWest also spoke on the significance of love. \u201cWhy is it that Black people never formed a Black version of the Ku Klux Klan? Too much love!\u201d West said. \u201cLet that love flow. And when the love flows, then you have a lens to which to view the world.\u201d\n\nThe festival had multiple stages and spaces set up where panels, performances and workshops took place. Organizers from various BLM chapters across the country were some of those who spoke on stage. \u201cThe movement is not done. We have not got justice,\u201d said Chauntyll Allen, an organizer of BLM Minnesota. \u201cWe just had a moment of uprising and so there is so much more to do.\u201d\n\nAmong those who spoke was Jacob Blake Sr., father of Jacob Blake. Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot seven times in the back as he walked towards his car by a white police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin on August 23, 2020. Blake Sr. emphasized the importance of unity in the fight against police brutality and racism. \u201cYou all must remember the power that you possess individually,\u201d Blake Sr. said. \u201cWe must collectively unite that power to defeat the beast because the beast is real, and if we do not unite, we can not beat that beast back.\u201d\n\nFor Abdullah, \u201cbeing able to be unapologetically Black\u201d is one of the biggest things to celebrate in BLM\u2019s 10th anniversary. \u201cThere was a time when we couldn\u2019t be real vocal about organizing for Black people specifically,\u201d Abdullah said. \u201cNow, people are painting \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 on streets. People get why we have to say \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 \u2014 that Black people remain at the bottom of virtually every single social, economic [and] political measure. We have to push for Black freedom [and] fight for Black freedom because when Black people get freed, everyone gets freed.\u201d\n\nWhat keeps Abdullah optimistic for the next 10 years isn\u2019t just the progress that\u2019s already been made, but the older and younger generations simultaneously fighting for change together. \u201cWhat gives us the greatest hope is that there\u2019s a lot of us,\u201d Abdullah said. \u201cThat the movement continues and spans generations and we are winning. That also gives me hope that we\u2019re going to struggle until we win.\u201d\n```"}

Dominique Randle, who is on the Philippines\u2019 first-ever Women\u2019s World Cup roster, was a member of the USC program from 2012-17.

He\u2019s also excited to see what DeMelo brings to the USWNT roster. \u201cI\u2019m excited for the World Cup just as a USWNT fan, but I\u2019m also pumped to see DeMelo in particular,\u201d Hallinan said. \u201cShe was great at USC but has really had a breakout season in the NWSL, scoring a bunch from midfield, and she has really earned her place in this World Cup team.\u201d\n\nAlready featuring for Canada at just 19 years old, Awujo is coming off of a strong season for USC. She contributed two goals and four assists in 11 games in 2022 to earn herself All-Pac-12 First Team honors. She has made six appearances so far for the Canadian senior team and was named the 2022 Canada Soccer Young Player of the Year. \u201cTracking Awujo\u2019s progress for Canada will be great as well, since she\u2019s still at USC and could become one of the best college players in the country in the 2023 season,\u201d Hallinan said.\n\nRandle has made 24 appearances for the Philippines in her international career, including a goal in a 2022 friendly against Fiji. Plumptre, a former England youth national team star, has made 11 appearances since deciding to represent Nigeria instead through her paternal grandfather. Both players should play significant roles for their respective squads in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThe USC women\u2019s soccer has already cemented itself as a premier program in the nation through a pair of national championships in 2007 and 2016. Still, the ability to claim four players in the Women\u2019s World Cup means a lot to those around the program. \u201cIt\u2019s always great seeing people who were in your shoes doing what we have all been dreaming about since we were little,\u201d Keely Roy said. Roy, a graduate forward, transferred to USC this offseason after playing four years at Cal. She was drawn to USC\u2019s program because of its culture of excellence. \u201cYou want to be in an environment where you\u2019re loving the game and you\u2019ll have a chance to win national championships. That\u2019s everyone\u2019s dream,\u201d Roy said.\n\nGrossman shares the same sentiment around the allure of USC thanks to its past and present success. Players have the ability to win during their time as a Trojan, while developing into thriving athletes in their post-college careers. \u201cUSC has one of the best women\u2019s soccer programs in the nation, and that\u2019s been true for many years now. It\u2019s one of the main reasons I chose to come to USC, and I know that\u2019s true for all my teammates,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see that we\u2019re continuing that level of play.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Roy hopes that this Women\u2019s World Cup can build more and more excitement around the sport. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty exciting. The women\u2019s game has had so much growth over the last five years ... the trajectory is so exciting,\u201d Roy said. \u201cSo many countries, including the U.S., have been putting money into women\u2019s soccer ... I think this will be a big World Cup to watch.\u201d\n\nThe tournament starts early Thursday morning, with co-host New Zealand playing against Norway at midnight PST, followed by other co-host Australia taking on Ireland at 3 a.m. PST. Awujo\u2019s Canada and Plumptre\u2019s Nigeria will then face off on Thursday evening at 7:30 p.m. PST \u2014 a must-watch match for all Trojan fans. If you\u2019re still on the fence about tuning into the Women\u2019s World Cup even after these intriguing USC storylines, Roy has one more reason to watch. \u201cIf you supported the U.S. men\u2019s team, you should go and support the women\u2019s U.S. team,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWe\u2019re the reigning champions, and some people don\u2019t even know that. They can\u2019t brag because they just don\u2019t know.\u201d DeMelo and the USWNT debut on Friday at 6 p.m. PST against Vietnam, as they seek to win a third straight Women\u2019s World Cup.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Toni Hall)\n\nBy Matthew Suh\nJuly 19, 2023 at 1:30 pm PDT\n\nOn February 12, 2023, while millions of fans tuned into Super Bowl LVII to cheer on their favorite players and teams, Toni Hall, age 26, found herself feverishly working on uploading content to the NFL\u2019s Instagram account as a social media coordinator for the National Football League. All eyes were on her. There was no room for errors. One mistake and the whole world would see. \u201cYou guys can not mess up,\u201d she remembers her bosses told her.\n\nThe 26-year-old was born to Tony and Michelle Hall in Houston, Texas. She lived in Texas for most of her life, moving from San Antonio to Austin. At a young age, Hall aspired to be a meteorologist and work for the Weather Channel. Hall\u2019s passion for meteorology stemmed from her father\u2019s passion for smooth jazz music. When Hall was growing up, her father would turn on the Weather Channel to watch a special segment, Local on the 8s. The two would listen to the weather report and soak up jazz music in the background every night.\n\nFor Hall\u2019s 15th birthday, her parents drove her to Atlanta, Georgia, to see the Weather Channel building. After witnessing her first natural disaster, Hurricane Katrina, Hall was attracted to watching and studying the weather. Natural disasters fascinated her and made her want to chase tornadoes in particular.\n\nAs a senior in high school, Hall had her sights set on one college to pursue her passion: Texas A&M University. Every day, Hall anxiously waited for her acceptance letter to her dream school. It never came. Instead, Hall decided to attend Prairie View A&M University, a Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and sister school to Texas A&M University. Hall planned to transfer to Texas A&M after attending Prairie View A&M for a year. But unexpectedly, she fell in love with the campus and made lifelong friends. \u201cI tell you my everything changed my freshman year. It was a hard decision, but I just knew in my heart it was meant for me to stay at Prairie View,\u201d Hall said.\n\nAfter deciding to stay at Prairie View A&M, Hall\u2019s passion for meteorology started to fade, knowing she would not transfer to Texas A&M to study meteorology. Because Hall was still interested in being on the Weather Channel, she decided to shift her focus from meteorology to media and reporting. Shortly after, Hall secured her first internship with ABC13 Houston, the eighth-largest television news market in the nation. During her internship Hall hoped to develop her television reporting skills. At the time, Hall was commuting one hour to and from ABC13\u2032s studio in Houston and was required to report to the studio at five in the morning every day.\n\nHall was shocked after being called to her boss\u2019s office at the studio one day. She had been fired from her internship. The reasons: Hall was working too hard as a sophomore in college, they could tell she did not love reporting hard news, and the company wanted her to take a break. \u201cThat was the first time I experienced tough love in my career,\u201d Hall said.\n\nGetting fired from her first internship at ABC13 scared Hall away from the TV screens, cameras, and bright lights. Again, Hall shifted her focus and passion. This time from television and reporting to the business side of media. She thought she would be interested in advertising and marketing, but she wasn\u2019t. Hall was passionate about sports and wanted to immerse herself in the culture. She conducted interviews with Black and African American celebrities ranging from the sports industry to the music and entertainment business. \u201cA journalism bug started developing,\u201d Hall said.\n\nAfter Hall graduated from Prairie View A&M University, she continued to pursue her growing passion for journalism by attending the University of Southern California to earn a master\u2019s degree in Specialized Journalism in Sports and Entertainment. Determined not to pay the hefty price tag for her tuition at USC, Hall was the first-ever recipient of the GRoW @ Annenberg Scholarship. According to the USC Annenberg website, the GRoW @ Annenberg Scholarship is \u201ca philanthropic initiative dedicated to supporting humanitarian efforts across the globe, as well as innovative projects in health, education, art, the environment, civic and cultural life, and more.\u201d\n\nToni Hall at USC after graduating. (Photo courtesy of Toni Hall)\n\nAfter she graduated, Hall worked at FOX Sports as a Production Assistant before applying for a job at the NFL. Hall first discovered the job opening at the NFL through a friend in the sports industry who sent her the job posting and encouraged her to apply. Hall was hesitant because she was comfortable at FOX Sports. Eventually, she decided to apply, and six rounds of interviews later, she became the Social Media Coordinator for the NFL\u2019s Instagram account.\n\nHall\u2019s Sundays were forever changed. While most people look forward to relaxing and watching football on Sundays, Hall\u2019s Sundays were quite the opposite. As an NFL Instagram Story Lead, Hall posted between 40-50 Instagram stories every Sunday. After the NFL\u2019s New York Instagram team kicked the morning games off, Hall would log on at 12 PM and work until 9 PM, posting player entrances, sponsorships, and highlights throughout the day. Every Sunday, Hall would receive hundreds of raw photos and video clips from the NFL\u2019s photographers and videographers and have to use her creativity and judgment to decide what content went on the NFL\u2019s Instagram.\n\nToni Hall attending the NFL Honors ceremony. (Photo courtesy of Toni Hall)\n\nTony and Michelle Hall were thrilled and blown away after finding out that their daughter would be working for the NFL. Growing up, the Hall family was a huge Alabama football fan, and Hall\u2019s father, Tony, was a football coach for her brother\u2019s team. Hall said her parents are beyond proud of her, because she is making an impact in a professional sports league every day. Hall thanks her parents for being so supportive of her career and journey to the NFL. \u201cHaving parents who want to see their kids grow up and change the world means everything,\u201d Hall said.\n\nFor Hall, one of the hardest challenges about her job was fatigue. Hall described being a creative content creator as both physically and mentally draining. \u201cBy week 15, I was ready for football to stop,\u201d Hall said. Hall offered advice to other social media content creators. She suggested taking breaks to recalibrate and regather oneself after working for such a long period of time. Hall takes her own advice seriously and enjoys spending time in nature, whether it\u2019s taking a long hike or soaking up sun rays at the beach. Hall considers herself a \u201cnature nerd\u201d and even dedicates her Instagram username to nature: @lost_n_nature.\n\nToni Hall attending an NFL workshop as a Social Media Coordinator. (Photo courtesy of Toni Hall)\n\nAs a Social Media Coordinator for the NFL, Hall has been able to collaborate with some NFL players like Marshawn Lynch, Kenny Stills, Ryan Neal and Tre Norwood. Off the field, Hall says her faith has played an important role in her life. As a strong Christian, Hall strives to act as an \u201cagent\u201d and spread her faith to those who have never heard about God. Hall\u2019s ultimate goal in life is to combine her love for sports and her love for God. She hopes to create a safe and inviting platform where professional athletes can talk about God and share their testimonies and relationship with Him. Hall said that all the money, fame, and material objects are not important to Hall because she believes the true treasure is knowing God.\n\nThroughout her time at the NFL, Hall has learned countless lessons that have impacted and shaped her life. From her first day, Hall dealt with imposter syndrome being the only African American woman on her team. However, she quickly learned that she was chosen to be in this industry and that she was meant for the job. Hall said she appreciates her boss, who took a chance on her because she entered her job at the NFL with little to no experience in social media. \u201cNFL social - I don\u2019t care what anyone says, that\u2019s the best social team in the world,\u201d Hall said.\n\nToni Hall attending the NFL Honors ceremony. (Photo courtesy of Toni Hall)\n\nAfter reflecting on her journey to the NFL, Hall provided advice to those looking to follow in her footsteps and eventually work for the NFL. \u201cThe NFL is a great place to start, but not to stay. You\u2019re going to learn so much from the greats, you\u2019re going to want to build something on your own,\u201d Hall said. Hall learned from the best of the best of social media from her time at the NFL. In the future, she hopes to take her talents and use them in a different way. \u201cAlways reach back to the next generation and show them that you [they] can do it too,\u201d said Hall.\n\nToni Hall is currently transitioning into a new role within the NFL. For the upcoming season, Hall is moving from the NFL\u2019s Los Angeles offices to the New York office. Hall will work as a Player Content Coordinator out of the NFL\u2019s New York office, where she hopes to capture unique content and inspire the next generation.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Law & Crime YouTube Channel)\n\nBy Jinge Li July 19, 2023 at 12:36 pm PDT\n\nWhat started as a traffic stop for road rage ended with a Colorado woman being hit by a train while detained in a police car stopped on the train tracks. She was severely injured but survived, and is suing two police departments as individual officers also face legal battles.\n\nYareni Rios-Gonzalez recently appeared in court on the charges of road rage that started the incident last year. She was sentenced to probation by a judge who pointedly apologized for what she experienced at the hands of police, calling it \u201creckless, negligent, stupid behavior.\u201d\n\nIt all dates back to the night of September 16, 2022 when Rios-Gonzalez was pulled over following a 911 report accusing her of being involved in road rage and pointing a gun at a victim. Officers detained Rios-Gonzalez inside a police car parked on the tracks. Video captured the horrific moment.\n\nThe police officers involved in the incident, Jordan Steinke from the Fort Lupton Police Department (FLPD) and Pablo Vazquez from the Platteville Police Department (PPD), are facing charges from the Weld County District Attorney\u2019s Office for reckless endangerment and careless driving. Those cases are now moving forward in the legal process.\n\nSteinke is charged with one count of attempt to commit manslaughter and one count of reckless endangerment. Vazquez is charged with five counts of reckless endangerment, one count of obstructing highway/other passageways, one count of careless driving and one count of parking in a prohibited place.\n\nThe Weld County District Attorney dropped the second-degree felony assault charge against Steinke late February; the DA\u2019s office declined Annenberg Media\u2019s interview request, citing pending litigation.\n\nA few months before the hearing against Rios-Gonzalez, Paul Wilkinson, one of her attorneys, talked about the case in an interview with Annenberg Media. Wilkinson said he disagreed with those charges and believed \u201cthe police destroyed evidence.\u201d He explained that the evidence police destroyed was Rios-Gonzalez\u2019s memory of the event. He stated that the incident caused memory loss, leaving her unable to defend herself because she couldn\u2019t remember certain things that happened that night.\n\nUltimately, Rios-Gonzalez entered a no-contest plea for her actions in late June and received one-year probation. The judge ruling the case, Vicente Vigil, used harsh terms against the police officers and took an unusual step of apologizing to Rios-Gonzalez.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what happened to you. I think it\u2019s, quite frankly, ridiculous what you were subjected to with respect to that accident and the cause of your injuries.\u201d Vigil said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that \u2014 that the system failed with respect to you. ... [N]o one should ... be left in the back of a squad car while they\u2019re in front of a train.\u201d\n\nVigil also recognized Rios-Gonzalez as a mother. \u201cI hope that you\u2019re able to move past that,\u201d Vigil added. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine how difficult it is having to go \u2014 live with the results of those injuries while at the same time taking care of a young child.\u201d\n\nOne legal expert said it\u2019s important to separate what happened to Rios-Gonzalez from the crime she was accused of committing. \u201cIt goes without saying that law enforcement shouldn\u2019t be leaving anyone handcuffed inside a patrol car on active train tracks,\u201d said UCLA law professor Diane Birnholz. \u201cHowever, despite how terrible the collision was, neither the officers\u2019 behavior nor her own subsequent injuries negate whatever activity she engaged in before her arrest.\u201d\n\nHer injuries were substantial. \u201cShe is recovering well physically,\u201d Wilkinson said in April. \u201cThe hardest thing is the head injury she suffered. I can\u2019t imagine what it feels like to be locked inside a cage and seeing [a train] coming at you and knowing [what will] happen next.\u201d\n\nIn January, Rios-Gonzalez filed the lawsuit against the police officers involved and their department to seek compensation for what she said was mishandling behavior during the incident. A third officer, Ryan Thomeczek from FLPD, was also named in the lawsuit for failing to help Rios-Gonzalez escape when the train approached.\n\nWilkinson told Annenberg Media that both cities had shown interest early on in a settlement outside the court. He did not disclose the total amount they are seeking, but according to his court filing, cumulative damages from the incident have exceeded $5 million. The current focus is on the settlement amount. Rios-Gonzalez is asking for the maximum insurance payout from both cities.\n\nWilkinson explained that he was doing that to allow the cities to protect themselves. \u201cI could get a verdict in court that is more than the insurance they have,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cIf that happens, those cities will have to come up with the money themselves.\u201d\n\nThe case is now proceeding forward and lawyers are gathering evidence for court hearings. The lawsuit also accused the PPD of hiring Vazquez despite knowing he had a history of a lack of situational awareness.\n\nAccording to the filing, Vazquez\u2019s previous employer, the Federal Heights Police Department (FHPD), saw Vazquez as a significant liability risk. The investigation document provided by Wilkinson\u2019s law firm accused Vazquez of turning his walkie-talkie off during his duty, leaving the city during his work hours often, and saying he was en route when his automated vehicle locators indicated he would be traveling in a different direction than the call or stationary at another location altogether.\n\nIn 2019, Vazquez received a \u201cpoor\u201d quality of work from his supervisor in FHPD, the document stated. When addressing his leadership skill set, Vazquez\u2019s supervisors said, \u201cEmployees are unable to achieve effective results,\u201d according to the document.\n\nVazquez left the FHPD on March 14, 2020, and joined the PPD shortly after. He was a police sergeant at the time of the incident, a leadership position in the police department.\n\nFLPD declined Annenberg Media\u2019s interview request, also citing pending litigation. Steinke, Vazquez and PPD did not return Annenberg Media\u2019s calls seeking comments.\n\nThe trial day for Steinke is scheduled for July 24. Vazquez\u2019s pre-trial conference is scheduled for September 14.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/07/19/socal-soccer-spotlight-four-angel-city-stars-set-to-feature-at-world-cup/", "response": "```\nSoCal Soccer Spotlight: Four Angel City stars set to feature at World Cup\n\nWhile the USWNT starts their campaign in Australia, the MLS breaks for the All-Star Game and Leagues Cup.\n\nAngel City's Alyssa Thompson controls the ball against OL Reign during the first half of an NWSL soccer match Wednesday, April 19, 2023, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan July 19, 2023 at 11:35 am PDT\n\nWomen\u2019s World Cup preview\n\nWith the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup kicking off this week in Australia and New Zealand, LA\u2019s club teams are taking the backseat in this week\u2019s column. To put an Angel City spin on a World Cup preview, I have predicted how much each ACFC player at the tournament will play and how far their team will go. (Note: Midfielder Amandine Henry received a call-up to France\u2019s World Cup squad, but a calf injury ruled her out of the tournament and thus excluded her from this exercise.)\n\nFirst up, let\u2019s look at winger Jun Endo and the Japanese national team. Endo has been a mainstay for Angel City since their founding, having made 40 appearances for the club across its two seasons while being regularly involved in the Japan national setup despite her youth. At 23 years old, Endo already has 32 Japan caps and three goals. Four years ago, she made two starts (three total appearances) at the 2019 World Cup, where the Netherlands knocked Japan out in the round of 16 \u2013 a disappointing result for the 2011 champions.\n\nUnfortunately for Endo and Japan, it\u2019s hard to see them performing much better at this year\u2019s tournament. They have a solid group of players who play regularly for top European teams and in the NWSL, but they lack a reliable goalscorer to take them over the edge \u2014 and Endo probably can\u2019t provide those goals. Endo is a proficient dribbler and ball carrier, but she only takes 1.37 shots per 90 minutes in the NWSL, with three total shots on target this season.\n\nAssuming Japan qualifies for the knockouts by securing second place in Group C, they would likely have to play Norway, a tough draw for any side. Prediction:  Endo starts every match, Japan places second in Group C but falls in the round of 16.\n\nAngel City club captain Ali Riley may have grown up in Los Angeles, but she qualifies to play for New Zealand through her father and has been a stalwart for the Kiwis since 2007. Riley has 152 New Zealand caps and the 2023 tournament will be her fifth (and potentially final) World Cup. She typically plays fullback at club level, but played centerback for New Zealand in their January friendlies against the US Women\u2019s National Team (USWNT).\n\nDespite qualifying for the tournament regularly, New Zealand has never won a World Cup match. Thankfully for them, with this year\u2019s expansion to 32 teams, New Zealand may no longer be one of the tournament\u2019s worst sides. According to FIFA\u2019s world rankings, the 46th-ranked Philippines qualified for their first-ever tournament and landed in Group A alongside Norway, Switzerland and New Zealand. Norway will almost certainly win this group, but New Zealand have a golden opportunity to earn their first win against the Philippines on July 24 at Sky Stadium in Wellington.\n\nAt 35, Riley could be playing in her last World Cup and, with the tournament on home soil, the Football Ferns will be as motivated as ever. Prediction:  Riley starts every match, New Zealand miss the knockouts but earn their first World Cup win.\n\nFinally, we have Angel City\u2019s two USWNT stars: Alyssa Thompson and Julie Ertz \u2014 one player at the beginning of her international career, the other probably playing in her final World Cup. Ertz played the entire match against the Netherlands in the 2019 World Cup final, but it\u2019s no guarantee that Ertz starts in this year\u2019s tournament. Ertz did not play at all in the USWNT\u2019s send-off match against Wales on July 9, but it\u2019s also possible that manager Vlatko Andonovski was simply preserving her minutes for later.\n\nUSWNT fans should hope that\u2019s the case, because no one in the squad can play the defensive midfield role better than her. That being said, Andonovski may opt for a no-DM midfield against Vietnam and Portugal in the group stage, as the U.S. will expect to dominate those matches. Once the team reaches the knockout stage, though, Ertz\u2019s experience and leadership will be vital to the team.\n\nOn the attacking end, Thompson started at left wing against Wales \u2014 a positive sign for sure \u2014 but it\u2019s unlikely that the team relies on her during on the tournament, especially after Trinity Rodman scored two goals off the bench in the same game. Right now, Andonovski and the fans should consider whatever Thompson contributes as an added bonus. If she provides a spark off the bench, it might help the USWNT win a tight match, but she simply does not belong in the starting 11 yet.\n\nIn addition to Rodman\u2019s recent excellence, Sophia Smith is the reigning NWSL MVP and Alex Morgan has shown no signs of slowing down. Prediction:  Ertz only starts one group stage match, while Thompson plays a super-sub role. USWNT tops Group E and makes a run to the final, where they lose to England (sorry guys, England are really good!).\n\nLA clubs send three players to MLS All-Star Game\n\nAs expected, D\u00e9nis Bouanga and Riqui Puig have earned their first MLS All-Star accolades after both players posted a strong opening half of the year. Bouanga in particular has thrived in his first full season for LAFC, with 12 goals and two assists in 19 starts. Only Nashville SC\u2019s Hany Mukhtar has more MLS goals than the Gabonian so far, giving Bouanga a real opportunity to win this season\u2019s Golden Boot award. Mukhtar\u2019s status as Nashville\u2019s designated penalty-taker boosts his tally, whereas Carlos Vela is LAFC\u2019s typical first-choice.\n\nAs one of the 14 \u201cCoach\u2019s Picks\u201d for All-Star coach Wayne Rooney, LAFC\u2019s Ryan Hollingshead will travel to Washington, D.C., for the game, too. Hollingshead lacks the flashy, attacking-oriented qualities that earn players fan votes, but the 32-year-old American defender absolutely deserves the selection.  Per FBRef\u2019s defensive action stats , Hollingshead averages 4.36 tackles plus interceptions per 90 minutes, a really solid number for any defender, but especially for a fullback who likes to get forward such as him.\n\nHollingshead takes almost one shot per match and can progress the ball competently with either his passing or dribbling. He may not be a household name, but Hollingshead is a seasoned MLS pro who has legitimately earned this All-Star appearance.\n\nThe MLS All-Stars will play Arsenal in the nation\u2019s capital on Wednesday, July 19, at 5:30 p.m. PDT.\n\nBreak comes at the right time for LAFC\n\nBouanga may be racking up goals, but LAFC have had a torrid summer. Since the club beat San Jose on May 20, LAFC have played 14 matches in all competitions and won just three, while drawing three and losing eight. On Saturday, Vela opened the scoring against Minnesota United, but it took only three minutes for the Loons to equalize and LAFC held on for dear life to draw 1-1.\n\nThankfully for the black and gold, this hasn\u2019t really impacted their playoff hopes, as they still occupy second in the West, nine points above Minnesota in 10th (one place outside the playoffs). But the table can be a slippery slope and no club needs a break more than LAFC.\n\nAfter the All-Star game, the MLS will begin the inaugural Leagues Cup, a new World Cup-style tournament pitting MLS clubs against their Liga MX counterparts. As the reigning MLS champion, however, LAFC have automatically bypassed the group stage and won\u2019t begin play until the round of 32 (Pachuca earned Mexico\u2019s bye on the other side of the bracket), meaning the club won\u2019t play their first match until August 2 at the earliest.\n\nThis gives the squad the rest of July to recoup and sort out any tactical issues. Fixture congestion has certainly not helped the team\u2019s recent struggles. With their run to the CONCACAF Champions League final, LAFC have played eight more matches this season than MLS teams who did not qualify for that tournament.\n\nHead Coach Steve Cherundolo would be smart to go light in the team\u2019s training sessions and leave time for plenty of ice baths and sports massages.

Mexico extends their record of most Gold Cups with this win, but more importantly they reclaim their throne as kings of CONCACAF.\n\nThousands of fans flocked to Inglewood to witness the finale of the 17th edition of the CONCACAF Gold Cup. The final had a higher attendance rate than when the stadium hosted the Super Bowl in 2022, with a total of 72,963 fans showing up to watch Mexico vs. Panama.\n\nThroughout the first half, Mexico had more than their fair share of scoring opportunities. They looked to have taken the lead in the 33rd minute when striker Henry Martin smashed the ball into the back of the net after a precise pass from midfielder Luis Romo. Unfortunately, after using VAR for closer inspection, the referee deemed Martin to be offside and the game was leveled once again.\n\nAlthough Panama did not have many scoring chances, what they lacked in offense, they made up for in defense. The Panamanian defense disrupted Mexico\u2019s attack numerous times and was completely locked in. The standout defensive play came from goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera minutes before halftime, when he did not just save the ball once, but twice. Mosquera dove right in front of goal and swatted away a shot from winger Orbel\u00edn Pineda, and then immediately blocked a ricochet shot from Martin using his legs.\n\nAs the match wound down, it looked more and more likely that it would go to extra time. That all changed in the 85th minute when striker Santiago Gim\u00e9nez was subbed on. Just three minutes later, he received the ball at the center of the field from Pineda, and took off on a terrific run in which he battled and outpaced Panama defenders Harold Cumming and Fidel Escobar. Once he reached the penalty area, Gim\u00e9nez slotted in a bouncing shot into the corner of the net solidifying Mexico\u2019s victory and himself as El Tri\u2019s newest star.\n\nEven though it was Gim\u00e9nez who secured the win, the one really responsible for Mexico\u2019s success is interim manager Jimmy Lozano. Since taking over the national team, Lozano has rejuvenated life into a failing team and brought confidence to this young squad. Now that the Gold Cup is over, Lozano\u2019s contract with Mexico comes to a bittersweet end. As the Mexican federation begins their search for their next manager, I believe there is no better option for the position than Lozano himself. He already has the full support and backing of the players and fans, and with how quickly he has elevated this team, I think he has proven himself as the right manager to lead Mexico into the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\nAlthough an accomplishment, Mexico must not be content with winning the Gold Cup. Even though they reclaimed their throne as kings of CONCACAF, USA and Canada are not far behind. Within the coming months they need to improve and grow as they start to prepare for next summer\u2019s Copa America. In this tournament, they will not only face their typical CONCACAF rivals, but will come face to face with South American heavyweights like Argentina and Brazil.\n\nThe 2023 Gold Cup was an important tournament for the Mexican players. Not because they won their 9th title, but because they were able to gain confidence, establish much-needed new playing tactics and rediscover the passion that comes with playing with the Mexico badge. Mexico\u2019s next match will be an international friendly against Australia at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, TX on Sept. 9th.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nBy Maddy Myer July 17, 2023 at 6:13 pm PDT\n\nThis past week in wrestling saw women across multiple brands take over. These female wrestlers not only showed out in matches, but also in promos, backstage moments and ringside antics. It was refreshing to see and a trend I hope is continued in the future.\n\nImpact Wrestling, or should I say Trinpact, caused an uproar on social media as Trinity won her first championship with the company. And, aside from the ongoing Bloodline storyline, the match between Bianca and Belair was the talk of Smackdown.\n\nHere are the top pro wrestling matches from the past week:\n\nAsuka vs. Bianca Belair (WWE Friday Night Smackdown, July 14)\n\nAsuka and Bianca Belair are already two of the biggest draws in Smackdown\u2019s women\u2019s division. Add in the efforts of Iyo Sky with the aid of Bayley to cash in Sky\u2019s \u201cmoney in the bank\u201d contract for Asuka\u2019s championship and Charlotte Flair\u2019s efforts to thwart that, and you have a killer main event.\n\nAsuka\u2019s speed versus Bianca\u2019s pure strength is magic to watch, because even though they both have different wrestling styles, they still match each other so well in the ring. Before the chaos started outside the ring with Sky, Bayley and Flair, Bianca hit Asuka with her KOD finisher on top of the announcer\u2019s table. The match ended in disqualification due to all the interference.\n\nTrinity vs. Deonna Purrazzo (Impact Wrestling\u2019s Slammiversary, July 15)\n\nTrinity made the biggest impact in her career since joining Impact Wrestling (pun intended) by winning the Knockouts World Championship over Deonna Purrazzo. Trinity hit Purrazzo with everything in her arsenal, as well as some newer moves, such as her use of the Samoan Drop. Her picture-perfect face kick with the aid of the ring ropes sent Purrazzo into shock and almost won the match.\n\nPurrazzo came back with her own power moves and even a submission, but the momentum soon shifted back to Trinity, who hit a facebuster and split-legged moonsault. Purrazzo hit Trinity with her finisher, but somehow Trinity kicked out and was able to earn the victory with her own submission move, becoming the new Knockouts champion.\n\nFinn B\u00e1lor and Damian Priest vs. Carmelo Hayes and Trick Williams (WWE NXT, July 11)\n\nAfter seeing Hayes and B\u00e1lor fight one on one, it was great to see them battle again with tag team-style wrestling. Hayes\u2019 speed came into play throughout the match, hitting move after move on B\u00e1lor without a second to breathe. Meanwhile, on the outside of the ring, Priest planted Williams\u2019 spine first on the announcer\u2019s table, effectively isolating him from Hayes.\n\nAs Hayes began to run out of steam and tried to avoid Judgment Day\u2019s cheating antics, Priest hit his finisher, followed by a quick tag to B\u00e1lor for his finisher to get the victory over Hayes and Williams. Even though only B\u00e1lor and Priest were competing, it was nice to see the rare appearance of the Judgment Day on NXT.\n\nRicky Starks vs. CM Punk (AEW Collision, July 15)\n\nTwo of the most talented in-ring performers met in the finals of AEW\u2019s Owen Hart Foundation Tournament. Starks\u2019 leg drop to Punk on the side ring apron was devastating, as was his second take at his satellite DDT. Punk\u2019s technical ability also was a highlight of this match. He countered multiple efforts from Starks and even hit a piledriver.\n\nThese two brought out the best in each other, or maybe the worst, as Starks pulled off the victory by cheating and using the ropes for the pin.\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d is a pro wrestling column by Maddy Myer that runs every Monday.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Ryder Dodd)\n\nBy Sophie Wimmer\nJuly 17, 2023 at 5:47 pm PDT\n\nOn the right side of the podium, Ryder Dodd is facing the flag. His team stands beside him, all in matching dark robes. The Star Spangled Banner plays as they mentally prepare for the first game. The 17-year-old high school water polo player is the only high school student-athlete to compete on the United States Men\u2019s National Water Polo Team. He competes for his country and soon, the University of Southern California as well.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot just to have the opportunity to be on this team,\u201d Ryder said.\n\nRyder is going into his senior year at JSerra High School in San Juan Capistrano, California and has committed to USC. Last year, as a junior, he was already competing with professionals. Ryder started his aquatics journey on a swim team with his older brother, Chase Dodd, a sophomore at UCLA. After observing how their friends enjoyed playing water polo, they decided to give it a try. The brothers chose to fully commit to playing water polo, the sport they grew to love.\n\nAlthough Chase is two years older than Ryder, their bond became stronger through their interest in playing a sport. \u201cWe both understand each other really well,\u201d Chase said. They carry an almost synchronized mindset and because of this, they know each other\u2019s next moves in the pool. Even while on the same team, the brothers have a sibling rivalry. The tough love they have for each other helps push them to be better athletes.\n\nWhile playing at the championship, the brothers are constantly building off each other and know competitively where they both stand. While competing for the World Cup, Ryder got a preview of his future campus. Playing with and against professionals has had a great effect on him. \u201cIt means a lot playing with all these guys that have so much experience,\u201d Ryder said.\n\nThe USC Uytengsu Aquatics Center hosted the event, which invites national teams to compete against each other for gold, silver, and bronze medals. Shots were flying at 50 miles per hour out of the water. Players were on the sidelines scoping out their competition and rushing in and out of the locker room. The young ball boys and girls were giddy with excitement to participate in the event.\n\nThis year, the event garnered a crowd of water polo fans ranging from all over to root for their teams. The USA head coach, Dejan Udovi\u010di\u0107, said their team came to win. On the first day of the tournament, the national team won a match against Serbia. The game was close but the United States managed to secure the win. On the second day of the tournament, the men\u2019s team lost another close game, this time against Italy.\n\nThe last day ended with the team competing in the finals against Hungary for a bronze medal. The concluding game was finalized with a devastating loss for the United States in a shootout. The crowd was already packing up to leave, thinking the score was finished but a USA player contested the last four minutes of the game due to a penalty call. The referees added the remaining minutes of the game back onto the scoreboard. Ryder proved he was meant to be there with his defensive attack. This was more than enough time for the United States to bounce back and secure the bronze medal.\n\nComing out of the weekend, Ben Hallock is the name on everybody\u2019s mind. Hallock was influential in the USA\u2019s victories. Located at the center of the play, Hallock was often a leader for the rest of the team. In and out of the pool, Ryder credits Hallock as a mentor. \u201cEver since I\u2019ve been on the team, he\u2019s been the most comforting guy,\u201d Ryder said.\n\nUSC will experience significant growth in the future, as a national team player joins them. However, Ryder is still entering his senior year of high school at JSerra. While he is an experienced water polo player, he will continue to train and compete with the national team before he makes his debut at USC.\n\nAnother challenge he will face is competing against his brother, who plays for UCLA. The games in 2024 will carry a different intensity based on their closeness, \u201cIt will be very interesting to see who brings something new to the table or who is able to perfect what we have been lacking in the past,\u201d Chase said.\n```"}

From reality TV and book adaptations to horror, this summer is full of great watches. Here are just a few shows that will keep you wanting more.\n\nUltimatum: Queer Love - Netflix\nNetflix\u2019s first queer dating show follows five couples where each pairing issued the ultimatum of marriage. The group then finds a new partner to date and live with for three weeks before living for three weeks with their original partner. In the end, each couple decides if they want to get married, be with someone else from the show or walk away alone. Not only is this show drama filled to the point where you\u2019ll be at the edge of your seat, but it also follows a diverse array of sapphic couples, which is a rarity to see so much representation on TV. There are 10 episodes that fly by quickly and end with the reunion (if you thought the show was dramatic, just wait until the end). It is an easy, fun watch.\n\nDaisy Jones and the Six - Amazon Prime\nAdapted from the novel by Taylor Jekins Reid, the story follows a 70s rock band in their eventual demise. The first thing you\u2019ll notice is the stacked cast with Camila Morrone, Sam Claflin, Suki Waterhouse and the granddaughter of Elvis Presley who is an Emmy nominated powerhouse in her own right, Riley Keough. From addiction to affairs and simply good music, the show has something for everyone. What makes this show extraordinary is that the cast of \u201cDaisy Jones\u201d actually recorded the album in the show titled \u201cAurora\u201d and released it on Spotify. Some notable tracks include \u201cLet Me Down Easy\u201d and \u201cThe River.\u201d\n\nYellowjackets - Paramount+\nThis show is a bit darker than the rest, but it is still worth the watch. Following a 60s girls soccer team, the Yellowjackets, as they try to survive in the wild after a deadly plane crash. If you like gore and horror but also friendship and mystery, this is definitely the show for you. The show is formatted as flashbacks from the present, following the life of the survivors. In the past the team has to face the villain of the story: the forest. From dangerous animals to haunting spirits, the girls begin to believe that the forest won\u2019t let them go home and the winter is a looming threat to their survival. The second season just finished airing, so this is a great show to binge without the wait.\n\nCruel Summer - Hulu\nFollowing the creepy streak, this show is also in the format of past and present following the disappearance of a popular girl, Kate Wallis, played by Olivia Holt. The show takes place in a 90s small town, and upon the return of Kate, she accuses the main character, Jeanette Turner, of being complicit in her kidnapping. Whether that is the truth or if one of them is lying is not resolved until the very last few minutes of the show with a shocking twist. This is another show that is easy to watch and will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Even at the end, you find yourself questioning what you just watched. Season two of \u201cCruel Summer\u201d also was recently released, following another disappearance story.\n\nThe Summer I Turned Pretty - Amazon Prime\nAdapted from the book trilogy by Jenny Han, the show follows four childhood friends who grew up together as they begin to change and fall in love. Belly, the protagonist, begins to feel a shift in how her friends, Jeremiah and Conrad, begin to treat her one summer. What made this show special was the summer romance love triangle, friendship, family and of course the show\u2019s musical playlist. The soundtrack includes Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Ellish and Taylor Swift. In fact, Swift released \u201cThis Love (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d just for the show last summer. The highly anticipated season two premieres July 14 and is said to feature nine Taylor Swift songs, including \u201cAugust\u201d and \u201cBack to December (Taylor\u2019s Version).\u201d This show is definitely for the swifties.\n```"}

Rose Hall on Monday, July 10, 2023, in New York. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan\nJuly 16, 2023 at 2:40 pm PDT\n\nIn the same way that the James Bond franchise has its own \u201cshaken not stirred\u201d shtick, the Mission: Impossible series does its own self-mythologizing and internal one-upmanship that makes each successive film more enjoyable, not less. Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One has arrived in theaters five years after the breathtaking sixth installment Mission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout and absence has certainly made the heart grow fonder. Dead Reckoning Part One delivers all of the action and story beats the series\u2019 fans expect while also introducing exciting new performances and a timely antagonist.\n\nThe seventh M:I installment finds Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and Impossible Missions Force partners Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) racing against time to defeat a new global threat: a rogue AI program called the Entity, which has supposedly infiltrated the network of every global intelligence agency and could wreak havoc at any moment. A two-piece key exists that can supposedly harness the Entity, but Hunt believes it would be too powerful for any one world power to possess, so he has gone rogue from the CIA to destroy the program. As the IMF crew tries to find and combine the key\u2019s pieces, they encounter Hayley Atwell\u2019s Grace, an international super-thief, while also being chased by U.S. officials and a mysterious figure from Ethan\u2019s past named Gabriel (Esai Morales).\n\nIf that description sounds convoluted, that\u2019s because it is. In any given scene, there are at least three, and often four, distinct parties trying to prevail over each other in a chase or open combat. But the M:I franchise\u2019s strength, at least in the past two films, lies in writer-director Christopher McQuarrie\u2019s ability to make something complicated on paper easily understood in the film\u2019s visual language. For one, McQuarrie frequently employs Dutch angles in his camera work, shots that are tilted horizontally to instill a sense of tension. McQuarrie does this partly to call back to the original Mission: Impossible film directed by Brian De Palma, who loved a Dutch angle, but also because the shot makes a typical cross-cutting expository dialogue scene much more engaging.\n\nBut for all of Dead Reckoning\u2019s tech-debate timeliness, it still falters slightly with its human villain, Gabriel. In the era of ChatGPT and Hollywood\u2019s writers and actors guilds striking in part due to disagreements about AI, the Entity has a compelling relevancy and the film\u2019s opening sequence makes it clear why the sentient software poses a threat. Except, it never clarifies why Gabriel wants to be the flesh-and-blood extension of its power, why it even needs him to be, or how he discovered it in the first place. It\u2019s worth remembering that this movie is the first of two parts, so McQuarrie could answer any or all of those questions in Dead Reckoning Part Two. But it certainly makes it harder for the viewer to buy into Ethan and Gabriel\u2019s psychological battle during the movie, especially since the Gabriel character has not actually appeared in any of the previous M:I films.\n\nThis is not to say that Morales, who plays Gabriel, fails to give a compelling performance. Even with what little the audience knows about the character, Morales still imprints Gabriel with a smugness and ruthlessness that shows, rather than just tells, why the IMF crew needs to stop him. The series\u2019 other first-time performers, Atwell and Pom Klementieff, the French actor best known for her performance as Mantis in the Guardians of the Galaxy series, both deliver performances worthy of a top action movie. Klementieff barely has any lines to deliver, but still imposes her physical will on the story as a hyper-competent hired assassin helping Gabriel to chase down Hunt and his allies. Atwell also develops a brilliant chemistry with Cruise throughout, although her role leaves Rebecca Ferguson\u2019s Ilsa Faust character in an awkward position.\n\nBest of all, Dead Reckoning\u2019s chase scenes and action set pieces will simply leave you with your jaw on the floor. Every sequence is tightly edited and dynamic from start to finish with bone-crushing collisions and slick knife fights. McQuarrie and co-screenwriter Erik Jendresen also ensure that there\u2019s a slapstick\u2013y, physical comedy in the various sequences that lets the audience know its creators are in on the joke, none more so than the absurd face mask disguises that have been a part of every installment. Mission: Impossible is best when it leans into the over-the-top action and meta-commentary about how physically far Cruise is willing to go to make those impossible stunts believable. As thrilling as car chases across Rome and knife fights in Venice are, at the end of the day, all the average Mission: Impossible fan wants is Pegg and Cruise to banter about how he needs to drive a motorbike off a cliff then unfurl his parachute to land on a train. On that front, this film delivers with aplomb.\n```"}

(AP Photo/John Locher)\n\nBy Michael Fiumefreddo July 15, 2023 at 11:01 am PDT\n\nThere\u2019s one smokescreen over the fantasy football landscape that is so dark and thick that looking past it takes years of experience and a strong will: last season\u2019s results. Obviously analyzing how players performed last season is a key indicator of their abilities. In some cases, players that outperformed expectations last season can and should be drafted accordingly. But that applies to the players I mentioned as \u201cleague winners,\u201d such as rookies, role players and players in good offenses, not the players I\u2019m mentioning today. These players to avoid have their draft stock boosted by last season\u2019s performance, yet in reality, other factors \u2014 age, new teammates or rookies looking to increase their role \u2014 will result in an underwhelming year considering where they were drafted.\n\nHere are three types of players you should avoid at all costs this year in fantasy football.\n\nBig Contract Recipients\n\nWhen a player receives a large contract in the offseason, it means their previous deal was coming to an end last season, and they needed to up their game in order to convince a team to sign them for next year. This typically leads to a strong season filled with skepticism by experts whether or not a deal is beneficial for a team. However, by the offseason, a general manager rewards the player. But when it comes to skill position players \u2014 specifically running backs \u2014 the experts tend to be right. Once a player gets paid, their motive to prove their worth fades. They just want to stay healthy and be good enough to have a roster spot for the remainder of their contract. No more risking it all for one season. One injury can completely change the trajectory of their career, so they focus on longevity.\n\nThe reason being is age. A running back\u2019s best years are his first few. The big contract they receive is after four or five seasons in the league, meaning they are in the back half of their 20s once they get paid. Those ages signal the end of a player\u2019s peak performance, and only the best running backs remain on rosters past the big 3-0. Just look at what happened to Ezekiel Elliott. Got paid after a strong season, saw a decline after his big contract, got hurt and is currently a free agent at age 27. Same goes for Dalvin Cook.\n\nThis trend is nowhere near something new, and seeing two big running back deals in this year\u2019s free agent class raises my eyebrows. Josh Jacobs just turned 25 and signed a four-year deal after a stellar season. Saquon Barkley is 26 and should do the same. But last season\u2019s performance aside, Barkley has been prone to injury, and Jacobs was rumored to be on his way out before his career year. I\u2019d be careful seeing either of these guys in early rounds and hoping they can repeat their success this year.\n\nOld Receiver, Young Quarterback\n\nThis one works a bit differently than the previous category, but the same smokescreen applies. Last year, a receiver played very well despite a poor offense, and a young quarterback kick-starts a rebuild that could mean high upside for the star pass catcher. At least, that\u2019s what should happen, not what actually happens. In reality, the rebuild tends to diminish the wide receiver\u2019s role in the offense. The team will also bring in younger skill position players to aid the QB\u2019s development and build the roster for the future.\n\nI fell for this two seasons ago, when Allen Robinson got a supposed upgrade with Justin Fields at quarterback. I was confident Fields would help Robinson have a top 10 season, but it was the exact opposite. Robinson was arguably the biggest bust of 2021, and out of my lineup altogether by the middle of the year. His role in the offense was diminished, with young receivers like Darnell Mooney seeing an uptick in targets. Robinson is now on the Steelers, who have a young quarterback in Kenny Pickett. Despite not scoring a touchdown last season, Diontae Johnson put together a solid campaign last year. But be wary of a revival from Johnson with a more-developed Pickett at the helm; second-year receiver George Pickens was drafted for the future, and the Pickett-Pickens connection is the one to target in the Steelers offense.\n\nMiddle of the Pack Quarterbacks\n\nI\u2019ve been an advocate for taking one of the big three quarterbacks in drafts, contrary to what experts may say. They say to wait on your quarterback, but the best value is from the top. However when I say \u201cthe top\u201d I only mean three, maybe four players: Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow, Josh Allen and Jalen Hurts. In the event your draft isn\u2019t going as planned, and you miss out on those players, it\u2019s best to wait on a quarterback. The reason being is that middle of the pack quarterbacks are a high risk, low reward move. Those players will be available in a crucial part in drafts, where skill position players with high upside start flying off of the board. Instead of settling for the sixth- or seventh-best quarterback, take a chance on a player with a chance to be a weekly starter at another position.\n\nIn leagues with only one quarterback starter, most managers will only pick up one quarterback in the draft and leave over half of league starters on the waiver wire. After missing out on a top player, you will have your pick of the rest at the end of drafts. Last season, Geno Smith was a top 10 quarterback that went undrafted in most fantasy leagues. There will always be time to find a quarterback, and unless it\u2019s in the top three, don\u2019t look towards last year to find one early in the draft. ESPN\u2019s rankings have Justin Fields, Justin Herbert and Deshaun Watson at 6-8, respectively.

(AP Photo/John Locher)\n\nBy Mark Armendariz-Gonzales July 13, 2023 at 8:40 pm PDT\n\nAfter 30 matches across the country, the stage is now set for Mexico vs. Panama in the 17th final of the CONCACAF Gold Cup. Although both sides secured a spot in the final, how they earned their place was very much different.\n\nIn the semifinals, Panama claimed victory over reigning Gold Cup winners the United States, but only after going toe to toe with them in a penalty shoot. From the start, the U.S. came out aggressive, with winger Cade Cowell blasting a shot on goal 20 seconds into the match. The shot would hit the goal post and ended up being the team\u2019s best scoring opportunity for the entirety of regular time.\n\nFor the first 90 minutes, both sides played very tight and had little to no goal scoring chances. It was not till extra time when things started to heat up. In the 99th minute, defender Iv\u00e1n Anderson would take advantage of a defensive error by U.S. goalkeeper Matt Turner, and score with ease. It did not take long for the U.S. to retaliate though, as they would score just six minutes later when forward Jesus Ferreira would rocket the ball into the top right of the net.\n\nBoth offenses stayed hot the rest of extra time, but the score remained tied, leading to a penalty shootout. Panama goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera stepped up as the hero, saving two penalties, leading his team to a 5-4 shootout win and their first Gold Cup final appearance in a decade.\n\nWhile Panama vs. U.S. was competitive for the majority of the match, the opposite could be said for the semifinal between Mexico and Jamaica. Mexico destroyed the Reggae Boyz in a 3-0 landslide. Mexico came out hungry and with a chip on their shoulder. They drew first blood with a goal from striker Henry Martin, who scored off a cross from defender Jes\u00fas Gallardo two minutes into the game.\n\nThe bleeding did not stop though, as midfielder Luis Chavez floated the ball over the heads of the Jamaican defensive wall and into the net off a freekick in the 30th minute. This goal by Chavez was undoubtedly the moment of the match, and possibly the goal of the tournament so far.\n\nMexico dominated Jamaica the rest of the game and put the final nail in the coffin with a third goal by striker Roberto Alvarado during garbage time.\n\nLeading into the final, both teams are motivated by their own reasons for victory. Panama looks to win their first ever Gold Cup championship, and become the fourth nation to ever achieve this feat. While Mexico searches for their ninth championship and in hopes of regaining their title as kings of CONCACAF.\n\nA key player for Panama in the final will be winger Ismael D\u00edaz, who will be important in getting the offense up and going early in the match. D\u00edaz currently has the second most goals in the tournament with four.\n\nA key player on the Mexico side will be goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa, he will be responsible for having the defense set and bringing the veteran mentality needed to win a championship. Ochoa currently has the most-clean sheets in the tournament with three and has only allowed two goals in five games.\n\nI think the game will be very physical and we may see a few yellow and red cards by the end of it. Both sides will favor offense more than defense, but in the end, defense will be key to which team makes fewer mistakes and overall wins. My pick is for Mexico to win 2-0. Mexico is playing with much more confidence at the moment than Panama and they have a more well-balanced side.\n\nThe CONCACAF Gold Cup final will take place on July 16 at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, CA at 4:30 P.M. You can follow the action on Sunday on Univision and TUDN. We will have the latest details at the end of the match.\n```"}

On Sunday, the team defeated the NWSL\u2019s first-place club, the North Carolina Courage, in a 2-1 victory on home soil at BMO Stadium. After falling behind 0-1 in the 15th minute from a Brianna Pinto goal created by a scintillating, quick Courage attack, Savannah McCaskill equalized just two minutes later. The Los Angeles fans had to wait until the 77th minute for a winning goal, when Elizabeth Eddy lashed a shot across goal that Courage centerback Kaleigh Kurtz deflected into her own net.\n\nAfter five matches unbeaten with three wins against teams currently set to qualify for the playoffs, we can officially declare that Angel City are experiencing the infamous soccer phenomenon known colloquially across the pond as \u201cnew manager bounce.\u201d Based on the imbalance of scoring opportunities, Angel City did not simply get lucky with this win \u2014 they outplayed the Courage, straight up. Angel City had 21 shots to North Carolina\u2019s nine and, according to FotMob\u2019s match stats, created four \u201cbig chances\u201d while the Courage had none. The shots passed the eye test, too. Sarah Gorden arguably should\u2019ve put ACFC up before the first half even ended, when she had a wide-open, unpressured volley off a corner kick in the 40th minute that hit the post.\n\nIt should also be said that Angel City\u2019s current run of form \u2014 their best of the season so far \u2014 could simply be due to some positive regression in their underlying numbers.  According to FootyStats, Angel City have created shots worth 1.41 expected goals per match this season while only scoring 1.2 actual goals per match.  It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Angel City start converting a few more shots than they did in the first half of the season.\n\nAngel City have also managed this run without their supposed best players, Alyssa Thompson and Julie Ertz, who are with the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team ahead of the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup, which starts next week in Australia and New Zealand. Club captain Ali Riley, Jun Endo and new signing Amandine Henry were all called up to their national sides as well, although Henry has been ruled out from competing in the World Cup due to a calf injury.\n\nBefore you try to poke a hole in that argument, yes, every NWSL club has lost players to the World Cup. But many of the clubs ahead of Angel City in the table, including the Courage, have deeper squads that are less reliant on individual star power to cover up holes elsewhere in the team. The Courage also have a handful of players who could easily be in contention for USWNT squad places for the next World Cup, when the generation of Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan has fully turned over, such as Pinto and centerback Malia Berkely.\n\nEven if you leave the temporary weakness of their opponents aside, executing a turnaround without Ertz and Riley\u2019s experience and Thompson\u2019s spark is still impressive. After 15 matchdays, Angel City sit 10th out of 12 in the table on 17 points, four behind sixth-place San Diego Wave, who occupy the final playoff spot. With each week, it looks increasingly possible that Angel City could sneak into that final qualifying position.\n\nOpoku trade signals future moves for LAFC\n\nLAFC made a surprising trade on July 5 when they sent winger Kwadwo Opoku to CF Montr\u00e9al in exchange for $1.75 million in general allocation money (a.k.a. GAM, one of the MLS\u2019 acronyms for their overcomplicated system of financial exchanges between clubs that is impenetrable for any soccer fans who are used to following soccer transfers elsewhere in the globe).\n\nHere\u2019s what you really need to take away from the Opoku trade: despite sitting comfortably in a Western Conference playoff spot, LAFC were not satisfied with the status quo and are loading up for one or two big acquisitions in the summer transfer window.\n\nOpoku made 34 appearances for LAFC in their MLS Cup-winning 2022 season, establishing himself as a key member of the club\u2019s rotation of first-team regulars. That role continued into 2023, where he has been a member of the LAFC\u2019s best front three alongside Denis Bouanga and Carlos Vela.\n\nUltimately, though, it seems like LAFC wants to add a potential star attacker to replace Opoku. For all of the Ghanaian winger\u2019s hard running and tidy passing, he hasn\u2019t offered much of a goal threat. In the past season and a half, Opoku has contributed nine goals and four assists \u2014 an okay return for a team\u2019s third musketeer, but not a title-winning contribution, at least in LAFC\u2019s eyes.\n\nSo, who will LAFC move for? It\u2019s not clear yet, but they now have two methods to recruit a game-changing pair of players. For one, LAFC has an open Designated Player spot, which allows MLS clubs to sign up to three players whose salaries can exceed the typical wage limit. Vela and Bouanga are the two players at the club who currently fall into this category, both obvious star attackers.\n\nThis gives LAFC carte blanche to arrange a transfer for, most likely, a player currently in Europe or South America who would slot straight into the starting eleven. LAFC are looking for a player with potential Gareth Bale-esque impact here, although it must be said that Bale didn\u2019t start many matches and was also signed using targeted allocation money (TAM \u2014 another weird acronym!), not a DP spot.\n\nShould LAFC look towards South America, my recommendation would be striker Mateo Retegui from Tigre in Argentina. The 24-year-old Retegui has scored 11 goals in 20 matches so far this season and has growing name recommendation in Europe after he made his international debut for the Italian national team.\n\nIf Retegui pops in MLS, LAFC could eventually sell him to a European club and collect a healthy profit. Even if he didn\u2019t contribute in the MLS, he would still have suitors back in Argentina or among the lower-tier Italian clubs considering his national team reputation.\n\nLAFC might also decide to keep their DP spot open and wait for the right player, but if they do, they could also use the $1.75 million in GAM they received in the Opoku trade to acquire a proven MLS body in midfield or defense and give Stipe Biuk, the 20-year-old Croatian winger, more attacking responsibility. The club has options. Expect them to act on it.\n\nAre the Galaxy trending up after their Tr\u00e1fico victory?\n\nTo quickly wrap this week\u2019s column, the team from Carson carried their momentum from El Tr\u00e1fico into a home match against a solid Philadelphia Union side, who the Galaxy beat 3-1. Tyler Boyd and Riqui Puig, the stars of last week\u2019s Tr\u00e1fico, contributed here once again, each with a goal. Boyd scored the opener while Puig capped off the win with the Galaxy\u2019s third.\n\nMore importantly, Puig continues to be the beating heart of this Galaxy team, completing 70 of his 85 passes, which is an unremarkable stat on its own, but here\u2019s the catch: Puig completed more passes than any other player on the pitch attempted. Even with Chicharito sidelined for the remainder of the season, LA Galaxy are officially on \u201cnever say never\u201d watch for playoff qualification.\n\nNext games: \nLAFC: Saturday, July 15 vs. Minnesota United (away)\nAngel City: Saturday, July 29 vs. Portland Thorns (home)\nLA Galaxy: Saturday, July 15 vs. Vancouver Whitecaps (away)\n\n\u201cSoCal Soccer Spotlight\u201d is a column by Jack Hallinan about the professional soccer landscape in Los Angeles.\n```"}

(Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nBy Ethan Huang\nJuly 11, 2023 at 6:08 pm PDT\n\nFourth of July weekend: a time where many Americans gather with friends and family to eat, watch fireworks and enjoy the holiday. But each year, the Los Angeles Convention Center is the destination for more than 100,000 people from across the globe. The reason? Anime Expo, a massive four-day convention that draws in crowds of people who line up around the entire building early in the morning to prepare for days of panels, performances, photo ops and merchandise focused on anime, manga, and popular culture.\n\nWhile it is infamously dubbed \u201clinecon\u201d with its large crowds, stuffy halls and long lines even for the vending machine, it is an exciting annual tradition for many who attend. The hall\u2019s main entrance this year is decorated with a massive banner promoting a new \u201cNaruto\u201d video game with fans piling in to pick up complementary bags and take pictures with the photo booths set up.\n\nThis lobby is the hotspot for one kind of attendee \u2013 the cosplayer \u2013 fans who spend months crafting elaborate costumes of their favorite characters so that they can pose, waiting for photographers and eager attendees. Around the main lobby, visitors can spot familiar characters. A crew of \u201cAcross the Spider-Verse\u201d cosplayers draw in a crowd as massive mecha suits designed after \u201cGundam\u201d tower over onlookers. But donning a brilliant gold suit of armor, Jean Baredes glows as the sun shines through the glass, reflecting off his armor. He\u2019s dressed as Aquarius Camus from the 90\u2032s series \u201cSaint Seiya,\u201d and is excited to see fans of an older series.\n\nJean Baredes: Because we are cosplaying old characters, these people that come in and they\u2019re like, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was going to see that.\u201d It\u2019s really nice to see their faces and light up when they see characters that they love.\n\nPast the main hall are a row of stairs that lead into the busy exhibition hall. Here, vendors, brands, and companies set up decorative booths and displays with activities, merchandise, and of course free swag. In the first two days, some of the busiest booths had to close their lines because of how many people piled in. As attendees squeezed their way through the aisles, some tried snagging pictures of cardboard cutouts of their characters they recognize or checking out demos for up and coming video games.\n\nOne of these booths is SEGA, the company behind popular video games like \u201cPersona,\u201d \u201cSonic\u201d and \u201cYakuza.\u201d But one highlight was \u201cHatsune Miku: Colorful Stage,\u201d a rhythm game people can play on their phones. Fans lined up to try the game and win free prizes for playing at the convention. Lindsey Lichtenberger is a Community Coordinator for the game. She says that this is her second time working at a booth, and says that she enjoys the different experience.\n\nLindsey Lichtenberger: I love it because I used to be an attendee a long time ago and coming in early, it\u2019s a whole different feeling being away from the crowd, the sea of people waiting downstairs. It\u2019s kind of euphoric kind of. She says that these events allow her to connect with people she normally knows virtually.\n\nLichtenberger: Honestly, it\u2019s great to talk to the players and see more than just a face on like Discord or social media.\n\nBeyond the exhibition hall, is another popular draw at the convention. Down below the center in what is normally a parking lot, is Artist Alley, the place where hundreds of independent artists can set up shop and sell their unique artwork. Cindy Duong, or sakuradragon on Instagram, creates cute, relatable artwork featuring characters like a small dinosaur who loves to eat. Her booth, adorned with plushies, binders full of art prints, and keychains draw in curious attendees.\n\nCindy Duong: I love this energy. I love that everyone I know comes out to this event, so it\u2019s kind of like once a year, you see everyone you know and you see your friends that you haven\u2019t seen in forever. But this event means even more to her as an independent artist, as she is finally able to connect with fans without the divide of a digital screen.\n\nDuong: When I was having a hard time, it was my fans that were my lights. I\u2019d like to provide that for them... Every year you see the same customers and they come back and say, \u201cI love your stuff,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m using your stuff in my room,\u201d or \u201cYour socks are really comfy.\u201d It\u2019s just love all around.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only kind of artwork showcased in the alley. This year, a makeshift tattoo parlor sprouted up in the middle of Artist Alley, with a line snaking around the booth with fans hoping to get art branded on their body. Taurin Hurley works with Mimik Tattoo, a company with shops all around Charlotte, North Carolina. It\u2019s their business\u2019s first time at the convention, and Hurley comments on how fruitful it has been.\n\nTaurin Hurley: We were booked half way through the day. All of our artists\u2019 books were filled. We had people in lines until the end of the day, asking questions, inquiring about coming back. But a tattoo is a permanent commitment, which makes this experience all the more unique.\n\nHurley: For the clients, a special event being able to be tattooed at the biggest convention for anime in the country, getting something permanent on your body, it\u2019s special for the clients, it\u2019s special for the artist to be able to do that for them.\n\nWhile some come for the art and the merch, there are some who attend Anime Expo looking to see some popular stars in the industry, whether it be voice actors... Or idols... Or even Japanese rockstars. One of these guests performed at AX\u2019s Summer Fest, their annual concert held at the Novo. MIREI (Mirei Touyama) is a singer-songwriter from Japan. She mentions how the audience here is unique compared to other performances she has experienced.\n\nMirei Touyama: I think at the concert hall, I feel like they have a connection to each other by me, like my music. But at the convention, they all have connection in the audience by their culture and the topic of anime, and that makes the bond much stronger.\n\nAnd despite all the different events, many of the attendees say that the biggest highlight is exactly that: building a new community based around shared passions. Cosplayer Keek Forsyth wears the black armor and cloak of Guts the Black Swordsman from the series \u201cBerserk.\u201d They say they have made countless connections through these kinds of events.\n\nKeek Forsyth: I\u2019ve made like hundreds and hundreds of friends through cosplay and through conventions that were Internet friends and now are real life friends that hang out with and see all the time, and it\u2019s just awesome that we have this community.\n\nYuka Matsushita has attended the convention a few times before. But this time, her experience was vastly different. She met new friends during the weekend and ended up walking around and attending panels with them throughout the expo.\n\nYuka Matsushita: I couldn\u2019t survive and make it all by myself. I don\u2019t know where to go, what to see, but my friends help me through. So it\u2019s had so much meaning to meet great people here because this is the first time I met them, but they helped me through a lot, so it\u2019s really amazing.\n\nTo some, the hordes of people are a turn off, but to others, the merch, the stars, and above all else, the friends they make in a single weekend makes it all worth a while.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Ethan Huang.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/07/07/bigger-ten-what-does-the-future-hold-for-the-pac-12/", "response": "```\n\u201cBigger Ten\u201d is a column by Campbell Donovan about USC\u2019s impending move to the Big Ten. The fresh look of the Big Ten is just over a year away. This change will transform the college sports world as mega-conferences begin to form, but where will it leave the Pac-12? The teams that will remain in the Pac-12 after the Los Angeles schools leave are Arizona, Arizona State, California, Colorado, Oregon, Oregon State, Stanford, Utah, Washington and Washington State. The two Los Angeles schools were already a core part of the conference. With the loss of them, the Pac-12 is expected to lose about 200 million dollars in revenue each year according to sports expert John Canzano. There has been lots of speculation about what direction the conference will go in to recoil. Some experts argue that this exit is the end of the West Coast league. Others predict that the Pac-12 will try to acquire other schools to turn its sinking ship around. Currently, it sounds like the Pac-12 is exploring expansion to save themselves from extinction. The team that would make the most sense to help the revival would be the San Diego State Aztecs due to both their location and highly competitive athletics. It was reported on June 16th that the Aztecs had requested to leave the Mountain West Conference, but needed to come to a final deal with other conferences first. However, without an invitation from the Pac-12 by June 30 of this year, the Aztecs would now need to pay a 33.5 million dollar exit fee from the Mountain West Conference, which at this point sounds very unlikely and unaffordable. Another ideal scenario would be if the Pac-12 could claim a Texas school and begin expansion in the Lone Star State. SMU is another target school from the conference, but after watching the San Diego State fiasco, the Mustangs will probably be much more cautious with their decision making. Plus, the Mustangs were determined to get into the conference with the Aztecs. Now that San Diego State sits still, it leaves the Mustangs with an even tougher decision. The Pac-12 already likely lost the nationally-viewed top contender for the conference. July will be an important month for the fate of the league, and without any change in this upcoming month, the end of the Pac-12 may begin to get a little closer.\n```"}

Her music is not limited to a single language and her discography portrays a collage of tonal diversity not restricted by the confines of consistency. Born in Osaka, Japan, the 24-year-old artist started singing and dancing when she was in second grade. Since her debut in 2013, she has never been defined by a sole musical brand. In her decade of performance, she has released six albums, numerous EPs and singles with songs in both Japanese and English.\n\nMost recently, MIREI took the stage at Anime Expo 2023, where she performed at the opening and closing ceremonies as well as at the Novo during AX Summer Fest on Sunday, July 2. In an empty conference room on the third floor with a window revealing a hectic exhibition hall below, MIREI spoke with Annenberg Media about her experience throughout the weekend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m enjoying this event so much, like I just bought the \u2018Oshi no Ko\u2019 English manga, I went to the \u2018Jujutsu Kaisen\u2019 booth, I\u2019m enjoying it a lot as an otaku and also I am enjoying it as a musician,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough this is not her first time performing at a convention like this, she sees a distinct difference in the audience compared to her usual performances. Well, aside from the \u201cNaruto\u201d and \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d cosplays she can spot in the crowd.\n\n\u201cI think at the concert hall, I feel like they have a connection to each other by me, like my music,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the convention, they all have connection in the audience by their culture and the topic of anime, and that makes the bond much stronger and that makes it super fun and easier to connect with audiences from the stage.\u201d\n\nDespite anime and manga being more recent hobbies of hers, MIREI\u2019s earliest influence is pop music from the United States. She grew up listening to hit songs from American artists like Lady Gaga.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw Lady Gaga for the first time, she blew my mind as she amazed me because of how she expressed how she feels and how she is,\u201d she said. \u201cThe song \u2018Born This Way\u2019 is amazing, and that gave me the courage to say that I might be kind of weird or unique, but I can be myself through music.\u201d\n\nBut Lady Gaga is just one of the singers MIREI admires, as she cites Britney Spears, Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna as other artists that inform her own songwriting. The work of these artists is also one of the reasons for her flexibility with her music\u2019s genre.\n\nAt times, MIREI\u2019s music may feel like R&B with relaxing beats woven into the melody\u2019s background. Other times, it has the upbeat rhythm and vibe of some K-pop songs. It\u2019s hard to label her work under one sound, and that is because MIREI isn\u2019t too concerned about the \u201cstyle\u201d of music she makes.\n\n\u201cI make music not from the sound, but I first write from the lyrics and what I want to say and tell the story,\u201d she said. \u201cI always have the draft image of how it sounds like, and it is so random because I come up with my story and I don\u2019t make songs like, \u2018Oh, I want to do hip-hop next,\u2019 \u2018I want to do R&B next\u2019 or something like that.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven the languages she sings in represent her work transcending musical norms. With both English and Japanese songs under her belt, she finds that writing of the two could not be more different. Having lived in New York, MIREI feels that the cultural gap is visible in her work.\n\n\u201cIn Japan, if you talk a lot, then you would get an image of noisy people or you don\u2019t care about other people because there\u2019s a culture of us reading the other side of the mind, or there is a word called \u2018kuuki wo yomu,\u2019 which means \u2018read the atmosphere,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAmerican culture is kind of like the opposite, if I see it in that perspective, because in American culture, if you don\u2019t say [something] out loud, nobody will notice it.\u201d\n\nThese cultural characteristics may be most present in her latest release, \u201cLonely In Tokyo,\u201d a rerelease of the 2020 song translated to Japanese. While the melodies and lyrics remain the same, there are slight differences. The new edition carries more of a mature tone, along with a music video that shifts the focus away from the exploitation of the Japanese entertainment industry to the general loneliness of women in Japanese society.\n\nAccording to MIREI, this change is partially due to her own experiences over the past three years as well as the shifts in Japanese society during the pandemic, such as income inequality.\n\n\u201cThe problem in Japan like poverty or the gap between rich people and poor people, and poor people includes really young people, is really serious right now in Japan, so I wanted to include all of that,\u201d she said. \u201cSo maybe my tone in the Japanese version seems kind of exhausted, tired because we\u2019ve been in this financially bad situation for 30 years. In Japan, it\u2019s kind of normal for us to be poor or normal to be tired, and we are just looking for ways to numb it.\u201d\n\nOn top of this, her work takes into account her own identity as well, especially as an Asian woman working in the music industry. She recalled how when she was studying abroad in middle school in the U.S., she realized both the sexualization and stereotypes that often contributed to others\u2019 perceptions of her as a girl from Japan.\n\n\u201cThe most popular [Japanese] word for [others] was \u2018yamete\u2019 and later I found that it\u2019s from like porn videos of Japanese people,\u201d she said. \u201cAt that time, I realized that Japanese people are so sexualized.\u201d\n\nShe explains that her appearance also played into the way others viewed her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of a short person. I\u2019m only 154 centimeters and so people see me as I am kind of like Lolita,\u201d MIREI said with a laugh. \u201cIt really struck me a lot because it doesn\u2019t fit to my personality. Obviously because I am not a person who\u2019s like cutesy, fit to the standard, but it happens.\u201d\n\nOver the years, MIREI sought to break away from that mold and now goes beyond the barriers often present in music. Unrestrained by country, language, genre and perception, MIREI forged her own artistic identity.\n\nBut what is the future of MIREI? She is currently planning on touring the United States, and hopefully will return to Los Angeles soon. Not only is she working on new Japanese music, but she has several works in English that she is waiting for the right time to release.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really a mixture of the English side of me and the Japanese side of me, so it\u2019s going to be super fun,\u201d she says.\n\nMIREI continues to be the enemy of conformity.

On June 25, Felix was first yet again, but this time not on the track. Felix became the first female honoree of the Roy Firestone Award at the 28th Annual Roy Firestone Award Gala hosted at the Beverly Hilton Hotel by Westcoast Sports Associates (WSA), a nonprofit organization that helps give disadvantaged children the opportunity to play sports.\n\n\u201cFrom the bottom of my heart, the person we\u2019re honoring tonight is one hell of a human being,\u201d said Roy Firestone, an acclaimed sports journalist who originally hosted ESPN\u2019s Up Close. The award was named after him in 1996 for joining WSA after being the first honoree for his community service towards assisting disadvantaged children play sports. Felix now joins a prestigious list of former honorees including Jim Brown, Wayne Gretzky, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, USC alum Pete Carrol and more.\n\nFirestone also noted that WSA was embarrassed to have taken this long to honor a woman. \u201cWe have tried to have a great woman figure as our honoree for many years,\u201d Firestone said. \u201cBecause of mostly scheduling \u2013 people like Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert, Serena Williams \u2013 they couldn\u2019t do it, or they committed to it and at the last minute they had to cancel.\u201d\n\nThe award was yet another incredible accomplishment for Felix in the past year. Felix was USC\u2019s 2022 commencement speaker after receiving an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree the same year. In April, USC renamed Cromwell Field after Felix.\n\n\u201cWhen I reflect back on my career and just the things I\u2019ve been able to do, I feel extremely blessed,\u201d Felix said from the stage during an interview with Firestone as audience members ate quietly. \u201cNot in my wildest dreams would I have dreamt that life would take me in these places.\u201d\n\nDuring the Firestone and Felix interview, the two conversed about a variety of topics surrounding Felix\u2019s accomplishments, both on and off the track. At times in the interview, a screen displayed pictures of Felix and the important people in her life, as well as videos of major races Felix won. She narrated her thought process as they showed.\n\nFor example, Felix talked about the struggles of hiding her pregnancy in 2018, going as far as working out at 4 a.m. so no one could see her body. Felix feared Nike, a sponsor of hers for nearly a decade, wouldn\u2019t pay her if they knew she was pregnant. Although Felix later became the forefront activist of securing maternal protections for female athletes, she noted she was initially nervous to speak up and set a precedent.\n\n\u201cThere are so many women who came before me who went through the same thing,\u201d Felix said. \u201cBecoming a mother and realizing this is so much bigger than me led me to speak out on these issues.\u201d\n\nFelix also spoke on the tragic death of Tori Bowie, an Olympic track and field athlete who won a gold medal with Felix in 2016. Bowie died on April 23 due to complications related to childbirth, an issue Felix cares deeply about due to her own personal experience of nearly losing her daughter who was born two months early.\n\n\u201cWomen of color are at risk,\u201d Felix said. \u201cTo have this happen with Tori is just so devastating and I think it is another wake up call of the work we have to do to combat these issues that women are facing. It should not be this dangerous to give birth here in America in 2023.\u201d\n\nFelix and Firestone discussed the issue of transgender athletes in sports and Felix expressed her belief in making sports inclusive. \u201cEveryone should be included in sports,\u201d Felix said. \u201cSports has the power to transform. It has meant so much in my life and it is a complicated issue, but it\u2019s one that I think we need to get right.\u201d\n\nThe gala featured a silent and live auction with autographed sports memorabilia, event tickets, vacation packages and more. At the end of the night, it was announced that more than $100,000 was raised for WSA. Since its creation in 1994, WSA has been able to administer more than $250,000 a year in grant funding to youth sports programs and community recreation centers in Southern California, meaning more than 10,000 kids per year have had new opportunities to be involved in sports.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a source of pride for these kids,\u201d Firestone said. \u201cStaying away from gangs, staying away from drugs, getting invested and being a part of a team.\u201d\n\nMike Gottlieb, current WSA president and co-founder along with W. Chip Eggers, Allen Lynch and Mike Rosenberg, reflected on what WSA\u2019s journey meant to him and his co-founders. \u201cAlmost 30 years ago we came up with this idea and never in our wildest dreams did we think it would turn into this,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201c[Never] did we think we would help tens of thousands of kids get an opportunity to play sports, and without us, they wouldn\u2019t have those opportunities.\u201d\n```"}

{"key": "/2023/07/05/affirmative-action-is-gone-what-does-that-mean-for-usc/", "response": "```\nAffirmative action is gone. What does that mean for USC?\n\nUSC professor says Supreme Court affirmative action ruling will have \u2018chilling effect,\u2019 and change will be seen on campus\n\nTwo USC students walking down staircase in Wallis Annenberg Hall. (Photo by: Jinge Li)\n\nBy Jinge Li, Isa Johnson and Taylor Marie Contarino\nJuly 05, 2023 at 2:04 pm PDT\n\nLast week\u2019s Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action struck down race-conscious admissions and has sparked nationwide debates about the future of college admissions. USC and other highly selective colleges will now face limitations in their ability to create diverse campuses by the court\u2019s decision, which many believe is a step back from achieving racial equity.\n\n\u201cLots of folks think that affirmative action is about giving opportunities to folks who are not qualified. There are lots of folks who are qualified. It\u2019s the system that is not equal,\u201d said Royel M. Johnson, a tenured professor at the USC Rossier School of Education and Director of Engagement for the USC Race and Equity Center.\n\nBroadly speaking, affirmative action refers to policies and practices designed to help promote historically disadvantaged communities. Since the 1970s, colleges, specifically prestigious universities like USC, have used race in their admissions process to create a more equitable and diverse campus.\n\nJohnson believes that Thursday\u2019s decision will prohibit waves of qualified applicants from achieving their full potential, creating broader implications than just college admissions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely to have a chilling effect and to slow down progress towards racial equity,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cConsideration of race is a recognition that we live in an unequal society that is fundamentally shaped by issues of race and racism,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the consideration of race in admissions was one tool we had for fighting back against white supremacy.\u201d\n\nCurrently, USC\u2019s student body is primarily made up of international students who account for 26.6% of the school\u2019s population, and white or Caucasian individuals who make up 24.8% of the undergraduate population. Asians make up 19.3%, Latinos make up 15.3%, and Black/African Americans make up 5.8% (other populations accounted for the last 8.2%).\n\nPrior to the court\u2019s decisions, nine states in the US banned affirmative action, including California. Though it is too early to say how the court\u2019s decisions will affect the future of college admissions nationwide, examining data from UC\u2019s school admissions could provide a roadmap for understanding the potential impact of these decisions.\n\nAccording to research analyses conducted by the University of California in 2020 on the impact of Proposition 209, which is a ban on considering race, sex, and ethnicity in the areas of public employment, contracting and education, the study concluded that the end of Prop 209 caused 10,000 annual underrepresented minority college applicants at UC to attend lower-quality public and private universities.\n\nAs a result, underrepresented minorities\u2019 wages declined by five percent annually between ages 24 and 34. The research further concluded that by the mid-2010s, Prop 209 had caused a cumulative decline in the number of early-career underrepresented minorities in Californians earning over $100,000 by at least three percent.\n\nIt is important to recognize that the impact of Prop 209 was mainly seen in top-tier colleges in the UCs system, like UCLA and UC Berkeley. By 2017, 21 out of 23 Cal States campuses had met the Hispanic Serving Institute (HSI) criteria, and five out of the nine UC campuses met the HSI criteria.\n\nHispanic students at UCLA and UC Berkeley made up only 21.5 percent of the 2020 first-year class, 29 points below the state\u2019s college-age Hispanic population, according to a Washington Post analysis.\n\nUSC was not subject to Prop 209 due to its status as a private university, however the recent SCOTUS decisions will restrict USC ability to practice race-conscious admissions policies.\n\n\u201cThis decision will not impact our commitment to creating a campus that is welcoming, diverse, and inclusive to talented individuals from every background,\u201d said President Carol Folt in a statement posted on Instagram following the court ruling. \u201cWe will not go backward.\u201d\n\n\u201cUSC has long understood that excellence and diversity are inextricably intertwined.\u201d Folt added, \"Each of our students, faculty, and staff have earned a place here and contributes to creating one of the most stimulating and creative educational communities in the world.\u201d\n\nRising sophomore Breanna Sanchez, a Non-Governmental Organizations and Social Change major said while appreciative of Folt\u2019s response, they still felt uncertain about how this change might affect USC.\n\n\u201cWhile President Folt\u2019s reassurance of diversity and inclusion was very heartfelt, it ultimately won\u2019t change the fact that this decision will impact those to come; as the Supreme Court has completely disregarded the fact that inclusion is impossible without equity,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to believe USC will not retrograde, but with the policies currently set in place; as a first gen person of color myself, I\u2019m uncertain and fearful of the repercussions of this decision,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nWhen it comes to this fall\u2019s college 2024 admissions cycle, potential applicants and their family members are already concerned of what the implications of this decision may look like, and how it may affect them.\n\nAgustin Leon Saenz is a third-year environmental science and engineering student at Harvard, protest organizer, and the only Ecuadorian student in his year studying environmental science and engineering. Saenz has family members who are approaching the college admissions age and said he fears for their upcoming experience.\n\n\u201cI have a cousin who is applying to college in the fall. My little brother just finished his first year in high school,\u201d Saenz said. \u201cThese decisions had an immediate impact for them, and I think it almost brings me to tears to a certain point,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI know that I was among the last classes in the history of us to benefit from affirmative action.\u201d\n\nPaige Tang, a rising high school Junior currently enrolled in the USC Annenberg summer program, told Annenberg Media her first reaction was selfish and one she considers not politically correct.\n\n\u201c[My] thought was,\u201d she said, \u201cwas maybe I would get into a couple more schools now.\u201d\n\nTang explained that growing up in an East Asian family, college was a big emphasis in her household. She called herself an overachiever growing up.\n\nIn the recent SCOTUS case of Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, the plaintiffs argued that the school used subjective personality scores and discriminated against Asians in favor of White, Black, and Hispanic applicants.\n\nAccording to The Harvard Crimson, a student-run newspaper in Harvard, from 1995 to 2013, Asians earned the highest average SAT score of any racial group but experienced the lowest admission rate among all racial groups.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s more Asian Americans applying, it\u2019s more competitive,\u201d Tang said. \"I don\u2019t agree with the sentiment that colleges discriminate against Asians. I think that\u2019s just often a scapegoat for why you didn\u2019t get in. But I do feel like, if race [isn\u2019t a factor], it\u2019s definitely going to be easier for more privileged communities.\u201d\n\nPresident Biden also weighed in his thoughts on the court\u2019s decision, acknowledging his disappointment and agreeing with those on the court who voted in dissent following the ruling.\n\n\u201cI believe our colleges are stronger when they are racially diverse. Our nation is stronger because we are tapping into the full range of talent in this nation ... Our nation\u2019s colleges and universities should be engines of expanding opportunity through upward mobility. But today, too often that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThe conversation regarding this particular SCOTUS decision relates to an even larger discussion on the latest string of decisions from the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to contextualize this decision within this broader context of what\u2019s been happening in the world with state legislators and conservative right wing politicians and think-tank organizations who have been placing restrictions and advocating for the restrictions of how we teach and learn about race,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nColleges like USC and Harvard both have various outreach programs outside of affirmative action in order to recruit students from underrepresented communities.\n\nAccording to USC\u2019s website the Neighborhood Academic Initiative has garnered more students from the local community.\n\n\u201cNAI annually prepares almost 1,000 6th-12th grade students from low-income households from the neighborhoods closest to USC in South Los Angeles and East Los Angeles for admission and graduation from college,\u201d the website stated. \u201cThe majority of USC NAI Scholars will become first-generation college students.\u201d\n\nThere is also a conversation surrounding the discontinuation of legacy admissions and early decision, which many view as an unfair advantage, primarily benefiting children from white households.\n\nAccording to an article published by the Daily Trojan in 2022, USC\u2019s class of 2025 is made up of 13% legacy students, and currently, USC does not offer early admission.\n\n\u201cI hope we start moving forward because right now, we\u2019re moving backward,\u201d Tang said. \u201cWhen I go to college, I hope to go to one where I see all sorts of people, not just certain rich White or Asian groups. I would rather be surrounded by a global group than one with a high SAT score.\u201d```"}

Puig simply looked a cut above every player on the pitch. Each Galaxy attack flowed through him, allowing him to dictate the game in varied ways. Sometimes, Puig would drop deep and play long passes into Douglas Costa or Tyler Boyd to pin the LAFC defense back. Other times, he would simply carry the ball through midfield himself, shaking off LAFC defenders like flies.\n\nAccording to FotMob\u2019s match-tracking stats, Puig completed 10 out of 10 dribbles in El Tr\u00e1fico and played nine passes into the final third. He assisted Boyd\u2019s opening goal and scored the winner with a lung-busting run into the box to tap Boyd\u2019s cross past LAFC keeper John McCarthy.\n\nWhile Puig and the Galaxy put forth a spirited performance, LAFC can only blame themselves for the loss. Steve Cherundolo\u2019s team took 17 shots and even put eight of them on target, creating more than enough opportunities to score a second goal. Left winger Denis Bouanga had a night he\u2019d surely like to forget, taking eight shots without converting. The Gabonese forward has scored 11 goals in MLS this season \u2014 the second most in the league \u2014 but he lacked his usual cool finishing at the Rose Bowl.\n\nThe loss leaves LAFC third in the Western Conference with one game in hand on second-place Seattle, while the Galaxy are still 13th in the West and the fourth-worst team in the entire MLS by record. If Puig keeps playing like he did on Independence Day, though, at least Galaxy fans will be entertained.\n\nAngel City: It\u2019s all about the money\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight: HBO\u2019s Angel City series is a business documentary, not a sports one. Of course, I\u2019m being a bit absolutist here, but not by much. Over Angel City\u2019s three-episode run, it becomes apparent that the club\u2019s ownership group had more interest in building a profitable and sustainable business than they did in fielding the most competitive team possible.\n\nI don\u2019t mean that as a criticism. In the series, the club\u2019s primary three owners \u2014 entrepreneur Julie Uhrman, venture capitalist Kara Nortman and actor Natalie Portman \u2014 speak at length about their desire to prove that women\u2019s sports can be as popular and highly-valued as men\u2019s professional sports. Given the success that Angel City has had off the field, it\u2019s impossible to say that owners did not achieve their goal. Angel City earned a $100 million team valuation before they ever played a match, higher than any other NWSL club\u2019s estimated value. According to The Athletic, the club has over $40 million of sponsorship deals and in its first season averaged an attendance of about 19,000 fans per game, more than 14 MLS clubs.\n\nThe business clearly works. But at times the documentary struggles to decide whether it wants to focus on the owners building a brand, or the players\u2019 successes and failures on the field. The sporting drama revolves around Angel City\u2019s efforts to make the playoffs in the club\u2019s first season (spoiler alert: they didn\u2019t). As an expansion team, Angel City had to work with a hodgepodge group of players in 2022. The upside of that, from a documentarian\u2019s lens, is that less-heralded players tend to have great stories about how they clawed their way to the top level.\n\nExcept, the series only deigns to give the audience brief glimpses of these tales. For example, DiDi Hara\u010di\u0107, Angel City\u2019s goalkeeper, arrived in the US with her family as a 2-year-old refugee of the early \u201890s Bosnian War and she spent her first 10 seasons as a professional footballer as a backup keeper before Angel City finally gave her a chance to be the No. 1. That\u2019s a fantastic story that arguably deserves a whole episode unto itself, but the documentary brushes through it much too quickly.\n\nThe series also introduces the audience to many players whose \u201carcs,\u201d in so much as they have them, never see completion. The camera takes us into club captain Ali Riley\u2019s childhood home, where she talks about how the legendary U.S. Women\u2019s National Team \u201c\u201899ers\u201d squad inspired her to become a professional, but as the team nears the end of its season in the third episode, Riley is nowhere to be found.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to enjoy in Angel City, but as a sports story, it over-promised and under-delivered, much like Angel City have done on the pitch. In the third episode, when the club ultimately does not qualify for the NWSL playoffs, the audience briefly sees that the player and coaching staff are disappointed with the result, before quickly moving on to the owners\u2019 discussions of the Yates Report fallout and their positive vision for the NWSL\u2019s future. To be sure, that future indeed looks bright. But when the show ended with a series of valuation and attendance graphics straight from the slide deck of a consulting presentation, Angel City bared its true colors.\n\nTweed steadies the ship, but is it enough?\n\nJust as Angel City missed the playoffs in 2022, the club\u2019s wait to play postseason games seems likely to continue this season. The Becki Tweed reign at Angel City has had a fairly auspicious start, but it remains to be seen whether or not the English coach can actually take the team to the next level. When the club fired Freya Coombe, it sat in 11th place. Despite not having lost a game in Tweed\u2019s first four matches in charge, the pink-and-black still sit second-to-last.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because Tweed, in the classic fashion of an interim coach, has steadied the defense while the attack is still sputtering. Through four games, Angel City has conceded two goals, keeping two clean sheets in NWSL play, but has only scored four, all of which have been against rivals San Diego Wave, who they played twice within 11 days.\n\nThe club\u2019s latest match, against the awkwardly-named NJ/NY Gotham FC, seemed to epitomize the Tweed era so far. Angel City played solid enough defense to win the match, but when presented with a golden opportunity to score, they failed to capitalize. In the 28th minute, defender Megan Reid played attacking midfielder Savannah McCaskill through on goal with a beautiful over-the-top ball, but even with just the goalkeeper to beat, McCaskill failed to convert.\n\nIf Angel City hopes to make a late-season surge up the table, they need to start turning these 0-0 draws into 1-0 wins.\n\n\u201cSoCal Soccer Spotlight\u201d is a column by Jack Hallinan about the professional soccer landscape in Los Angeles.\n```"}

With the current state of affairs in the United States, it seems impossible to listen to music and just drown it all out. From the Supreme Court to anti-trans bills and even a declining overall mental health state, it\u2019s all so overwhelming. Music here can be a tool to reflect and make sense of society. Here are songs that are about rage and social issues but also healing and mental health because right now it is also important to take care of each other and empower one another to keep going.\n\n\u201cSWINE\u201d by Demi Lovato\n\u201cUnder-compensated, too domesticated...underestimated, over regulated...hate-dominated,\u201d goes the newest lyrics of Lovato\u2019s song. Highlighting the rage of not having autonomy over one\u2019s own body, this song is a call to action to continue to fight for basic human rights. Although focusing on abortion in this song, the rage and discontent with the current political system could be translated to also include the anger of Black and brown communities, LGBTQ+ communities and other marginalized people who are currently losing their rights.\n\n\u201cEugene\u201d by Arlo Parks\nSinger/Songwriter Arlo Parks not only knows how to perfectly encapsulate young adult emotions and tribulations, her latest album \u201cMy Soft Machine\u201d released this year also acts as a platform for mental health advocacy but also pop fun. Though, \u201cEugene\u201d takes on a lighter theme of falling in love with your friend who complains about being with Eugene. \u201cYou read him Sylvia Plath, I thought that that was our thing,\u201d the lyrics read. Not only catchy, the song is somber and well written. Parks, 22, is an artist to look out for as they never stray away from telling LGBTQ+ stories and mental health advocacy. This seems to also be why her work is so relatable to the college student.\n\n\u201cVampire\u201d by Olivia Rodrigo\nQueen of angst, Olivia Rodrigo announced earlier in June the release of her new song \u201cVampire\u201d and sophomore album \u201cGuts.\u201d \u201cVampire\u201d was released June 30, 2023 and broke Spotify. People reported the streaming service crashing due to the overwhelming amount of people streaming this song as well as Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s new album. The song talks about a toxic relationship, as Rodrigo sings, \u201cyou went for me not her, \u2018cause girls your age know better.\u201d Although it\u2019s not clear the song is about anyone, it highlights the common relationship dynamics of older men praying on and dating younger girls. Other artists also touched on this issue in their discography including Demi Lovato with \u201c29\u2032\u2032 and Taylor Swift with \u201cWould\u2019ve, Could\u2019ve, Should\u2019ve.\u201d Talking about this issue and making it a mainstream conversation draws attention and hopefully prevents this abusive power dynamic from continuing.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Give Up\u201d by Black Belt Eagle Scout\nNative American indie artist, Katerine Paul, draws from her heritage and her experiences in her newest album \u201cThe Land, The Water, The Sky\u201d released this year. The song \u201cDon\u2019t Give Up\u201d is an affirmation to heal and never give up, \u201cI found healing in you, windy leaves are flowing.\u201d The entire album, but in particular this song, are grounded in nature and healing from the past weather that be mental health or trauma related. This album is sonically interesting as well as lyrically empowering; and, only a taste of Black Belt Eagle Scout.\n\n\u201cSnow Angel\u201d by Renee Rapp\n23-year-old, \u201cyoung ex-wife\u201d Renee Rapp shows off her broadway vocals in this ballad. Single \u201cSnow Angel\u201d came after the entirety of writing her sophomore album, Rapp wrote in her instagram announcement. Although the majority of this new album was complete, Rapp had a traumatic experience that led to her writing and adding this song. Then, the song became the title of the album coming out August 18, 2023. \u201cI\u2019ll angel in the snow until I\u2019m worthy,\u201d the chorus goes. Not only does the song showcase a raw, rough period in Rapp\u2019s life, it also shows her immense talent as a singer. More than anything though, it\u2019s a reminder we can all \u201cmake it through the winter\u201d even if it seems impossible right now.\n\n\u201cNot Strong Enough\u201d by boygenius\nQueer group, boygenius, is made up of Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus. In their newest album \u201cthe record,\u201d the group puts at the forefront mental health and queer love. Their song \u201cNot Strong Enough\u201d portrays what it\u2019s like to live with mental illness, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I am the way I am,\u201d read the lyrics. This song doesn\u2019t shy from being real in how mental health is portrayed, how it can be all consuming and never ending. Boygenuis formed as counter culture to the stereotypical boy band and male artists who are \u201cgeniuses\u201d just because they\u2019re men. They are unapologetic in their existence.\n```"}

(Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nBy Ethan Huang\nJuly 04, 2023 at 12:43 pm PDT\n\nWhat is a rockstar? When that word comes to mind, many might think of icons like the Beatles, Queen or Jimi Hendrix. But to some, the word \u201crockstar\u201d is synonymous with Yoshiki, who since his musical start in 1982, has extended his reach beyond his home in Japan across the globe.\n\nAt this year\u2019s Anime Expo in Los Angeles, musician Yoshiki was recognized as a guest of honor, hosting his own panel on Sunday, July 2 at the convention. There, he discussed his latest musical endeavors and the driving force behind his work at this stage of his life.\n\nYoshiki Hayashi, or known simply as Yoshiki, is many things. He is a composer, a songwriter, a classical pianist and an innovator within the rock music scene. The co-founder of bands X Japan and The Last Rockstars, Yoshiki is known to be a pioneer of visual kei, a genre that incorporates rock music, heavy makeup, elaborate costumes and androgynous style.\n\nOver his career, he has partnered with Coca-Cola for his own energy drink, composed music for the Golden Globes, started his own fashion line, had a Hello Kitty named after him, and met with Queen Elizabeth II. But among anime fans, he may be known for his work on the popular series \u201cAttack on Titan,\u201d composing the opening theme \u201cRed Swan\u201d for the show\u2019s third season.\n\nYoshiki speaks in his panel about his long career and upcoming projects. (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nAs he walked onto the stage at the L.A. Convention Center\u2019s Petree Hall, the audience cheered for the musician\u2019s arrival. He had just flown in a few hours before after a busy day in Tokyo performing on live TV.\n\nThroughout the panel, the audience was treated to highlight reels of Yoshiki\u2019s diverse music repertoire, from his time frantically drumming shirtless with X Japan, to his elegant piano performances, to him conducting an orchestra for the emperor of Japan.\n\nAfter many decades of work, Yoshiki expresses that one of the reasons he can keep this energy is partially due to the passing of some of his old band members, including X Japan\u2019s Taiji Sawada and Hideto \u201cHide\u201d Matsumoto.\n\n\u201cI really thought that I was going to be the one to die first, but for some reason I\u2019m still here,\u201d he said in the panel. \u201cI almost feel like I have an extra life. So might as well live as much as I can.\u201d\n\nHis latest project is a new song titled \u201cRequiem.\u201d It is dedicated to Yoshiki\u2019s mother who recently passed away, but he speaks on how that loss is what fuels the creation of this piece.\n\n\u201cI was crying and crying... I said, \u2018Doctor, can you stop my tears? Any medication or anything?\u2019 and they said \u2018No medication can stop you crying,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cI started playing piano and started writing songs, and wow, my tears somehow becoming melodies.\u201d\n\nArtist Yoshitaka Amano and Yoshiki unveil the new artwork for Yoshiki\u2019s new song \u201cRequiem\u201d painted by Amano. (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nThe upcoming song\u2019s cover art is just as notable, as it was painted by another one of AX\u2019s guests of honor this year, Yoshitaka Amano. The famed artist is most known for his work on the \u201cFinal Fantasy\u201d video game series, but once Yoshiki realized Amano\u2019s panel was back-to-back with his, he reached out asking if he would paint for him.\n\nMaking a surprise appearance at the end of Amano\u2019s panel, Yoshiki unveiled the artwork for the first time. Painted over a dark orange background was an image of Yoshiki holding a rose, representing his mother\u2019s spirit.\n\nBefore the end of the panel, the emcee invited audience members to ask questions to Yoshiki. The first asked for an autograph, in which Yoshiki simply gestured for them to walk up as he signed their notebook. The second similarly asked for a selfie.\n\nAs a catwalk was conveniently placed out for the fashion show earlier in the day, Yoshiki strutted out to greet the fan. In an instant, the entire audience stood up from their seats and rushed to the stage to grab their own pictures with the musician.\n\nMicrophone in hand, Yoshiki smiled and asked, \u201cAny other questions?\u201d As the audience laughed, some raised their hands with the hopes of getting picked and others recorded videos of him up-close.\n\nEven without music, Yoshiki transformed the panel into the image of a rock concert. Fans clamor to get close to the stage, making an \"X\" with their arms, as Yoshiki takes a selfie with the audience. (Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nAs the panel came to a close, the emcee directed audiences to either leave the room or return to their seats for the next panel, but some were still living in that moment.\n\nAs Yoshiki returned backstage, Yuka Matsushita wiped away tears and sniffled as she had been a fan of his ever since she was a teenager.\n\n\u201cWhen I grew up in Japan, I always listened to his music, Yoshiki, X Japan, all the time, and I know how he had hard times when his father took his life and his mother just passed away,\u201d she said. \u201cI was crying because he was so touching and he was moving.\u201d\n\nFor those who simply knew about Yoshiki in passing, his music and words still struck a chord. Matsushita attended the panel with casual fan Maxine Castro. The two just met during the convention, but became quick friends.\n\n\u201cIt was surprisingly fun. Very, very fun, Nothing like I expected,\u201d said Castro. \u201cI like the energy that he brought into the panel because he was very welcoming with everyone in the audience.\u201d\n\nIn just 45 minutes, Yoshiki ignited the love of longtime fans and new listeners alike. Although he previously had two neck surgeries, the musician is armed with a \u201csecond life.\u201d\n\nBetween traveling from Tokyo to L.A. to London to Paris within this same week, it is clear that he shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nYoshiki will perform in the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles on October 20 as part of his Yoshiki Classical 10th Anniversary World Tour.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez)\n\nBy Dominic Varela\nJuly 03, 2023 at 6:18 pm PDT\n\nI\u2019m angry. If you weren\u2019t aware, the Oakland Athletics will relocate to Las Vegas in 2025. In a move downright encouraged by Major League Baseball, the A\u2019s will leave behind the city they\u2019ve called home for over five decades. Truth be told, this move has been in the works for years. Regardless, their departure wholly disrespects a fanbase that still exhibits a serious passion for their baseball team, despite decades of neglect. The fans worshiped and loved them \u2014 until they couldn\u2019t anymore. Not only are A\u2019s fans losing their team, but \u2014 unlike a sports movie \u2014 they\u2019re not going out with a bang. I wouldn\u2019t even call it a whimper. As of July 3, they have the worst record in the league and are on pace for the worst run differential in modern history.\n\nOf course, the blame does not lie with the fans. Any money the team receives from people willing to sit in their black hole of a stadium goes directly into the owners\u2019 pockets, not their checkbooks. A\u2019s fans have searched for hope, and they can\u2019t seem to find it. But that\u2019s where Esteury Ruiz comes in.\n\nRuiz has turned the stolen base into a tool of fear. Whenever he reaches first (something that, unfortunately, does not occur that often), the threat of Ruiz taking second occupies the mind of the pitcher, the catcher and surely everyone else in the stadium. Ruiz currently leads Major League Baseball with 42 steals. Last year, the Marlins\u2019 Jon Berti led the league with 41. Ruiz matched that before June was over. If he keeps up his current pace for the rest of the year, he will finish with around 82 steals. Nobody has stolen that many in 35 years. Even the 70-steal mark hasn\u2019t been reached since Jacoby Ellsbury in 2009.\n\nOf course, Ruiz benefits from several new rules meant to bolster stolen base numbers, but that shouldn\u2019t overshadow the incredible work Ruiz has done for an offense that, unsurprisingly, struggles to score. His occasionally ill-fated efforts to steal an extra base give the A\u2019s a chance they wouldn\u2019t usually have. As I said, Ruiz doesn\u2019t actually get on base that often; his on-base percentage is 111th in the league. He\u2019s not the absolute fastest, either. That may be why he also leads the league in times caught stealing (8). I don\u2019t think he cares. He\u2019s going to try his hardest to steal second base, even if he gets thrown out. Why is that? Because it effectively turns every single \u2014 or walk \u2014 into a double. And a double is better than a single. Way, way better.\n\nHowever, despite all those steals, Esteury Ruiz is not a good baseball player. Actually, that might be an understatement. He\u2019s just plain bad. Not only is he a below-average defender, but his average exit velocity (speed of the ball off the bat) is the lowest in the league. In baseball, the goal is to hit the ball hard. And he is literally the worst at it. His Wins Above Replacement (WAR), a stat meant to measure a player\u2019s value, stands at negative 0.1. A WAR of zero would mean that Ruiz has provided the same value that an average minor leaguer would provide if given the same number of opportunities. So, yes. Technically, Ruiz shouldn\u2019t be in the majors.\n\nBut these are the 2023 Oakland A\u2019s. Calling them a Major League Baseball team already feels wrong. Symbolic, isn\u2019t it? The team\u2019s only source of hope hurts them in the long run \u2014 just like how hope from the fans, no matter how much they want it to, won\u2019t save their franchise. But that\u2019s what\u2019s so interesting about Esteury Ruiz. He doesn\u2019t need to be good at \u201cbaseball.\u201d He can provide a positive impact by being good at one thing, and one thing only.\n\nAt the end of the year, fans across the league will have to stare up that stolen base leaderboard. And there\u2019s a solid chance an Oakland Athletic comes out on top. To these Oakland fans, that would mean everything. The league announced the All-Star rosters on Sunday, and unfortunately, Ruiz failed to make the cut. However, a couple of American League outfielders who made the team remain on the injured list and may still be there by mid-July. With enough luck, Ruiz may find himself in Seattle a week from now. But as I\u2019ve been saying, luck hasn\u2019t been on the side of A\u2019s fans for a while now.\n\nIn 2025, when this team is finally ripped away from them, they can thank those money-hungry robbers who reside in the owner\u2019s box. Because even with all those steals, Esteury Ruiz is not the biggest thief in Oakland.\n\n\u201cWAR Zone\u201d is a column by Dominic Varela about some of his favorite stats in baseball and the wacky stories they tell us that runs every Monday.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nBy Maddy Myer\nJuly 03, 2023 at 5:42 pm PDT\n\nFollowing the phenomenal Forbidden Door pay-per-view AEW put on, WWE had a lot riding on its Money in the Bank pay-per-view. Thankfully, WWE held its own with incredible matches, high stake performances and even a surprise appearance from John Cena. The premise of Money in the Bank is two ladder matches, in which superstars compete for a contract for a world title shot at any time within the next year. The caveat is \u2014 to earn that contract \u2014 superstars must climb a ladder and remove the briefcase hanging from the air, all while trying to outmaneuver the other superstars in the match. It can lead to some wild moments and high-risk spots that pro wrestling fans don\u2019t want to miss. It is by far one of my favorite pay-per-view concepts the WWE has, and each year is different from the last.\n\nAside from WWE\u2019s standout performance, AEW Collision had some great Owen Hart Foundation tournament matches, and Impact had a great triple-threat bout. Here are the top pro wrestling matches from the past week:\n\nWomen\u2019s Money in the Bank Ladder Match (WWE Money in the Bank, July 1)\nSix female superstars, Bayley, Becky Lynch, Iyo Sky, Trish Stratus, Zelina Vega and Zoey Stark fought hard for the money in the bank contract and a chance to challenge one of the current women\u2019s champions, Asuka or Rhea Ripley \u2014 anytime, anywhere. The action started right from the beginning before some superstars even made it to the ring. These ladies used the ladders in crafty ways. From Lynch\u2019s manhandle slam to Stratus, to Sky\u2019s moonsault from the top of the ladder laying waste to all five competitors below her, to Vega\u2019s code red against Stark, if you blinked for a second, you would miss some action. In the final moments, it appeared Lynch or Bayley were keying in on the victory until Sky handcuffed them together to climb the ladder and earn the victory.\n\nFinn B\u00e1lor vs. Carmelo Hayes (WWE Monday Night Raw, June 26)\nHailing from NXT, Carmelo Hayes, the current NXT Champion, made his way to Monday Night Raw to take on Finn B\u00e1lor. B\u00e1lor is an established talent, and everyone knows it, but Hayes still had something to prove to some wrestling fans that may not know him from NXT. All throughout the match, Hayes used the ropes in a crafty way, in an almost luchador style. My favorite was his move called the Fade Away, which looked like a reverse leg drop. B\u00e1lor was able to match Hayes\u2019 speed, while also using his strength with moves like the gutbuster. Even though Hayes took the loss against B\u00e1lor, he showed just how much star power he has and that he can keep up with main roster greats like B\u00e1lor.\n\nRobbie Eagles vs. Frankie Kazarian vs. Chris Sabin (Impact Wrestling, June 30)\nAs part of Impact Wrestling\u2019s Down Under tour in Australia, the X-Division title was on the line in a triple threat match. This match started out with three competitors that were so evenly matched, they all went for a dropkick at the same time. Sabin hit some impressive sentons on both Eagles and Kazarian off the ring apron and outside onto the floor. When Eagles attempted a submission hold against Sabin but was instead hit with a reversal, he used that momentum to launch himself outside the ring and crash into Kazarian. Wrestling is all about adapting, and that\u2019s something that these three have mastered. Sabin earned the victory with a Cradle Shock against Eagles.\n\nRicky Starks vs. Juice Robinson (AEW Collision, July 1)\nRicky Starks is one of the most talented wrestlers in AEW. He has all the makings of a future world champion, and even though he was dealing with a knee injury, this match against Juice Robinson further showed his in-ring ability and tenacity. Robinson gave Starks hell with brutal chops targeted to damaged areas of his body, but Starks never gave up. Even after Robinson hit Starks with a spear, which is usually a finisher for most matches, Starks kicked out. Starks came back with a spear of his own to show Robinson how it\u2019s done and rolled up Robinson for the win.\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d is a pro wrestling column by Maddy Myer that runs every Monday.\n```"}

SCOTUS made the decision to strike down affirmative action at colleges and universities that use this policy to decide who gets accepted. In the state of California, the UC and CSU systems will remain unaffected by this policy. USC President Carol Folt also announced on Thursday via Instagram that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision was disappointing. She added that this decision will ultimately not impact USC\u2019s commitment to creating a campus that is \u201cwelcoming, diverse, and inclusive to talented individuals from every background.\u201d\n\nWhat is Affirmative Action? Affirmative action highlights the concept where the race of a college applicant will not be discriminated against when applying for a higher education. This would encourage diversity and discourage race-based discrimination among these institutions. For decades, affirmative action has been used on college campuses and has allowed many students who come from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds to enroll in higher institutions. Those who have come from these backgrounds often identify as BIPOC. It is also no surprise that Latines make up a significant portion of those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds in the United States.\n\nSteven Lepe, a rising senior majoring in Choral Music, commented about SCOTUS\u2019 decision through his perspective as a Latine student. \u201cJust because we cannot afford [going to college], it does not mean we don\u2019t belong here.\u201d Lepe grew up in East Los Angeles, where the poverty rate is 17.6%, higher than the national average of 12.8%. Lepe also highlights how finances can act as a barrier to students who want to pursue higher education. \u201cI think it\u2019s super important for the Latine [community] to be a part of higher education because in the socioeconomic status, some are not able to go to school due to financial situations or due to generations of going straight to work right after middle school or high school.\u201d\n\nLatines make up 18 percent of the U.S. population. A third of those Latines are immigrants and they contribute over 2.3 trillion dollars in our economy. Despite this, Latines likely experience higher rates of unemployment, make 26 percent less compared to white workers, and are overall likely to be less educated compared to other racial groups as a result. The reason as to why Latines are less likely to be educated has nothing to do with intelligence but rather refers back to Lepe\u2019s statements about finances. Latines from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds often find themselves unable to make ends meet, resulting in many of these households containing parents who work long hours, the children in those same households working at another job, or a combination of both.\n\nIn addition, almost one-fifth of students in the United States are either attending a high-poverty school, living in poverty, or both. Latines, African Americans, American Indian/Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders make up a significant portion of that statistic. High-poverty schools also tend to have less academic resources for students. Students living in poverty face another set of challenges in their personal lives \u2014 affording health care. Having less access to medicine and health care due to high costs can lead to the detriment of the student\u2019s health which can negatively impact their ability to academically succeed.\n\nMariana Torres, another rising senior majoring in Psychology, foresees the consequences of this decision in the long run. \u201cYou\u2019re going to stop seeing as much diversity [...] like the conversations in the classroom are going to get more privileged,\u201d Torres said.\n\nAs Latine students expressed areas of concern, incoming second year doctoral student and former admissions officer at the University of Vermont Sam Yang also shared his opinion regarding the decision. \u201cThose who agree with [the decision] would say \u2018oh this is what real equality looks like. We eliminate those unequal policies so that it\u2019s like meritocracy.\u2019 [...] They\u2019re speaking from a very meritocracy perspective, which if you look at the history of meritocracy is whiteness.\u201d Yang acknowledges that this perspective is missing the much bigger picture, especially those who hail from communities with less resources. \u201cThey have to understand that this society is allocated by limited resources and those who benefit from those resources are those who distribute it or those who have the power to distribute it.\u201d\n\nThough affirmative action will mainly affect certain institutions, the diversity in those same institutions will likely diminish, building a barrier among students from less fortunate backgrounds. These students will be blocked from entering into the classroom, suppressing those who want to have a say in building a new world altogether. Yang said, \u201cIn education, the effect of an educator is not measured by numbers within a year, is not measured by some statistics. Within five years, it is being measured by how many leaders we produce and how much impact these leaders put on society.\u201d```"}

You failed.\n\nSupporters of LGBTQ rights hold placards in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019, in Washington. The Supreme Court heard arguments in its first cases on LGBT rights since the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nBy Myriam Alcala June 30, 2023 at 4:26 pm PDT\n\nIt seems hell has made it to earth. Friday the Supreme Court ruled 6 to 3 in favor of Colorado web designer Lorie Smith to discriminate against same-sex couples. Now allowing businesses across the United States, including progressive states like California, to refuse to serve LGBTQ+ people. How did this happen? Years ago, the Colorado bakery case threatened a similar notion to refuse to serve fellow humans just for loving who they love and being who they are, so this isn\u2019t a new sentiment. However, with the anti-trans bills flooding states and the Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action and student loan debt, there seems to be a larger crusade going on. This is real. It was easy for some to ignore what has occurred in Florida and Texas but not anymore.\n\nAs reported by the L.A. Times, \u201cThe decision applies even in states like California where civil rights laws forbid discrimination based on sexual orientation.\u201d Smith argued that her Christian faith \u201crequires her\u201d to turn away customers seeking same-sex union celebrations, claiming it is within her first amendment right to do so. What won today wasn\u2019t free speech, it was hate. Denying right to spaces is the next step in othering the LGBTQ+ community, distinctly creating an \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d and a \u201chere\u201d and \u201cthere\u201d for people to be categorized in the hierarchy of society. Because now the hierarchy is as clear as ever.\n\nThese three Supreme Court decisions all work together to perpetuate a systematic categorization. First, affirmative action: making it clear that if you are Black or brown, you do not belong at a university and if you belong here, your \u201cmerits\u201d will show it. Second, student debt: perpetuating generational wealth and making it difficult for low-income people to have access to university education. Last, LGBTQ+ rights. For a while, it seemed equity was possible within the United States governmental system through reparations and legalization of same-sex marriage. Now, it seems even the loudest voices opposing the system are trapped in an echo chamber asking for basic respect and rights.\n\nWe foresaw this coming after Roe v. Wade was overturned. It made people bold enough to hate outwardly even more and impose their politics on people\u2019s bodies. A consequence we see now as the bodies of Black, brown, low-income and LGBTQ+ are being discarded and discriminated against. This draws attention to the problem with the \u201cfor life\u201d tenure of the Supreme Court. Not only does one individual have the power to appoint whoever they want, the appointees are tenured for life. So even if public opinion and needs shift, the people who are meant to act as advocates of the people do not have to change or adhere to us. The U.S. Supreme Court is not for the people. And us, the younger generation, will be left with this dystopian reality.\n\nThe trickle-down effects of these three decisions are undeniable. Take USC for example, although President Carol Folt assured the university will stay committed to diversity, they raised tuition recently yet again. They still consider legacy, donor and athletic admissions which ultimately benefit who? The rich and white who have access to education and other resources already. This also surely will deter marginalized community members from applying to college, especially because now student loan debt is running rampant. And if businesses are allowed to discriminate based on sexual orientation, what\u2019s to stop this from beginning to resemble racial discrimination and gender-based discrimination?\n\nLorie Smith chose to take away the right to spaces and services for LGBTQ+ people. She, like other white women in the GOP, believes this ruling won\u2019t negatively affect her. Little does she know that the rights of white women will also be under attack when all the rights of marginalized groups are taken. Because if you are not a rich, white, cis-man, you\u2019re inferior. We already see this happening with the threats to ban no-fault divorce in some states, which would trap women in their marriages. How can you not see your rights are next?\n\nTo the U.S. Supreme Court, I only will say this: we can only take so much. With enough anger and mobilization, I see a future without you or your hate. Your sun will set.\n```"}

But how can you find those players?\n\nBy Michael Fiumefreddo June 30, 2023 at 3:37 pm PDT\n\nA common mistake made in fantasy football drafts is putting together the best team possible for Week 1. While it is fun to start the season on a high note \u2014 winning your first matchup and scoring a boatload of points \u2014 the right strategy is crafting a team that will improve as the season goes on. The way to do so is drafting players referred to as \u201cleague winners,\u201d players who impact the roster at the end of the year significantly more than at the start.\n\nBefore every draft, every analyst and expert (including me, as you\u2019ll find out later) will identify players they think will fit into this category, but picking which ones will actually turn out that way is like finding a needle in a haystack. However, the search isn\u2019t as bad if you know where to look.\n\nI look for players that fit into these four categories to determine which players will help bring my team to glory.\n\nUndervalued players\n\nThis category comes off as very broad, but let me explain. Last week, I talked about taking players above their average draft position (ADP) if they\u2019re a must have on your roster. This is overvaluing a player. Typically, every draft has a handful of players that get undervalued, meaning every expert or casual player knows their ADP and final ranking don\u2019t match up. The main reasons for this are uncertainty with their fit in the offense or impact at the start of the season. These are targeted towards one group specifically. Rookie running backs. First-year players need time to get used to the pros, but a running back\u2019s best years are his first. All it takes is an underperforming or injured starter for the head coach to turn towards a young guy, and if all goes well, their spot in the offense will be tough to lose. While Bijan Robinson figures to be a first round pick in drafts, the talented class has plenty of backs looking to make the most of their situation. Jahmyr Gibbs has workhorse back potential after the Lions traded De\u2019Andre Swift, and Devon Achane doesn\u2019t have much competition for touches in the Dolphins backfield. The good news, they\u2019ll be afterthoughts on most draft boards.\n\nPlayers following an underwhelming year\n\nThe dreaded down year for a football player is followed with questions about their future. Are they too old? Is their prime over? Are they trusted by the head coach anymore? Basically the opposite of job security. However, we\u2019re talking about fantasy football, and in the fantasy world, a down year means an opportunity to steal a league winner. Enough with the speculation, these guys always bounce back. More specifically, top draft picks from last season like Jonathan Taylor and Cooper Kupp might be available in the second round of drafts this season just one year after finishing with the most points at their position in 2021. This isn\u2019t because they aren\u2019t good enough to be first rounders, but rather everyone else is scared to look past one bad season. Don\u2019t make the same mistake. This also goes for players who will start the year on IR or suspended. DeAndre Hopkins completely solved my wide receiver issue last season after I drafted him \u2014 a top-10 wide receiver in terms of weekly average points \u2014 in the sixth round. The player that fits this category this season is Calvin Ridley. A year-long suspension and a new team has many people \u2014 including experts \u2014 forgetting how good he is. Most rankings sites have him outside the top 20 wide receivers with a fifth-round ADP. He\u2019ll be returning from a year off from football, joining an electric Jacksonville offense that made Christian Kirk the wide receiver 12 last season. I see top 10 potential in Ridley this year and a fifth round price tag is more than enough to convince me of taking him.\n\nPlayers who play their role and do it well\n\nThis category goes out to the slot receivers, the third-down backs or the injury replacements. Despite their standing on the depth chart, they, too, can be league winners. Just look at last year\u2019s RB13, Jamaal Williams. Overshadowed by D\u2019Andre Swift in the Lions backfield, I remember telling people to take him towards the end of the draft because of his upside as a goal-line monster and competence to be a workhorse if Swift got hurt. He did just that, as nearly half of his total points last year came from a league-leading 17 rushing touchdowns. From a wide receiver standpoint, don\u2019t overlook No. 2 or No. 3 options on a team because the top guy will get most of the target share. Oftentimes, it\u2019s the next man up when teams face off against some of the best cornerbacks in the league. It\u2019s why Tee Higgins works so well as a fantasy option. Ja\u2019Marr Chase has the potential to score the most points at the receiver position this year, but with that comes attention from opposing team\u2019s top cornerbacks. With a schedule featuring some tough defenses, Joe Burrow will have to acknowledge Higgins when Chase is blanketed by coverage. It made him a top 20 receiver last season and it will happen again this year.\n\nWhen all else fails, pick players on good offenses\n\nThis one\u2019s a no brainer. Offenses that score points get everyone involved no matter where they are on the depth chart. Believe it or not, this doesn\u2019t normally produce top players. The top five teams in points per game only produced five total players that finished in the top 10 at the running back, wide receiver and tight end positions last year. But we\u2019re not necessarily looking for top players, we\u2019re looking for league winners. In the back half of drafts, a player on the Chiefs or Bills makes more sense than someone on the Colts or Commanders because of the upside their offenses provide. Making those smart choices is the difference between winning and losing, and in the case that one of those guys becomes a standout player for their time, you\u2019ve found yourself a league winner.\n\n\u201cFantasy Fridays\u201d is a column by Michael Fiumefreddo about fantasy football draft prep that runs every Friday.\n```"}

(Photo by TAS Rights Management)\n\nBy Megan Chan\nJune 29, 2023 at 10:42 am PDT\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming. Fans watched as Taylor Swift\u2019s highly anticipated 2020 tour, Loverfest, was canceled because the world went into lockdown. The global pandemic did not stop Swift from creating and sharing art. The superstar amassed even more new supporters with the release of her experimental albums, \u201cFolklore\u201d and \u201cEvermore,\u201d during the peak of the pandemic. While the release of new music did not stop, fans waited for the moment in which they could shout the words to their favorite songs in a room of thousands of other Swifties.\n\nBack in March, Swift embarked on the beginning of The Eras Tour in Glendale, Arizona, marking her first tour since the Reputation Stadium Tour in 2018. Each weekend she travels to perform in cities across the United States, including Las Vegas, Foxborough, Nashville and Los Angeles. Swift will continue to tour for the rest of the year finishing up her United States tour and kicking off the Latin American leg. The tour will continue next year with international performances in Argentina, Brazil, Japan, Australia, France and more.\n\nHer set list extends from her 2000s anthems to tracks from her most recent album, \u201cMidnights.\u201d Paying proper homage to each of her musical eras, she constantly changes into outfits that resemble her previous tours and famous pop culture moments. Not only do the voices of fans ring throughout the stadium, but masses of Swifties gather outside the venue just to hear her performance, as well.\n\nFans match her dedication by dressing up as their favorite Swift era and in song-inspired outfits. With just a singular glance around Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, I could identify a plethora of iconic outfits worn by fans. Couples showed up wearing ballgowns and elaborate wigs, replicating Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff\u2019s royal outfits from the \u201cBejeweled\u201d music video. Little girls walked around the stadium with arms covered in friendship bracelets to trade with older Swifties. Tens of thousands of fans painted Swift\u2019s iconic lucky number, 13, on their hands, too.\n\nThe Eras Tour fosters a community of fans with a shared love for one another and Swift\u2019s musical career. Even as an avid concert-goer, never before have I seen such an enthusiastic group of security guards at a concert. Immediately as I walked into the stadium, I was greeted by dancing security guards with wrists stacked with friendship bracelets. It was evident that Swift\u2019s dedication to storytelling has developed a once-in-a-generation result of dedicated fans and a loving community.\n\nSwift gazes into the audience as she sings \u201cThe Archer\u201d from the Lover era. (Photo by TAS Rights Management)\n\nThe three-and-a-half-hour-long spectacular began with Swift\u2019s voice ringing, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d as she sang \u201cMiss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince.\u201d The concert continued with tracks such as \u201cCruel Summer\u201d and \u201cThe Man\u201d from the \u201cLover\u201d album. The stage remained decked out in pink and visuals to match each song. The iconic house with a room representing each of her albums from the \u201cLover\u201d music video appeared behind Swift as she played the track.\n\nSwift\u2019s set then extended into pure feelings of high school nostalgia with the \u201cFearless\u201d era. As a giant gold guitar was projected onto the long stage, she sang some 2008 classics. \u201cFearless (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d sent chills over my body, as it produced an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia. \u201cYou Belong With Me (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d resulted in an impressively loud audience that chanted every word to the song.\n\nThe \u201cEvermore\u201d portion of the show was one of the longest, as prior to The Eras Tour, she had never performed songs live from this album. One of the most memorable moments of the entire concert was the performance of \u201cMarjorie\u201d from the 2020 album. \u201cHearing \u2018Marjorie\u2019 live was really beautiful because the whole stadium felt like it was silent,\u201d one New England Swiftie said. As fans sang along to the track about her late grandmother, a collective peace existed among the flashing light-up bracelets and cellphone flashlights.\n\nWhile Swift\u2019s last tour was dedicated to her 2017 album, \u201cReputation,\u201d she did not hesitate to give a showstopping run of the album this time around. The fan-favorite track, \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me,\u201d dominated this section of the set list. Rays of light projected from the stage towards the sky, forming a cone of light and making The Eras Tour visible from miles away from the stadium.\n\nThough Swift only included one song, \u201cEnchanted,\u201d from the 2010 album \u201cSpeak Now\u201d in The Eras Tour, the track was of the most visually and audibly stunning moments of the show. The audience turned into a sea of lights as she performed the heart-wrenching track on a purple stage. Swift gave fans a taste of what\u2019s to come ahead of the July 7 re-release of this album.\n\nFor the lucky audiences with Phoebe Bridgers as an opening act, Swift brought the boygenius leader back out to sing their fan-favorite duet, \u201cNothing New (Taylor\u2019s Version).\u201d Some Swifties described the \u201cRed (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d part of the concert to be their favorite era because of the iconic ballads. \u201cAll Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d played a major role in fans\u2019 deep appreciation for this part of the show.\n\nSwift performed seven songs from her album, \u201cFolklore\u201d in what was one of the longest eras of her set. From one Grammy-winning album to another, she then transitioned into \u201c1989\u2032\u2032 to sing some of her radio-dominating pop anthems.\n\nSwift kneels on the ground as she sings the latter half of her \u201cFolklore\u201d set. (Photo by TAS Rights Management)\n\nThe surprise songs section of The Eras Tour has sparked masses of videos online along with discussions among Swifties at concerts. During each show of the tour, Swift performs an acoustic rendition of two songs that have yet to be sung at previous shows. Fans have gone as far as creating playlists of surprise songs they want to be sung at their shows and spreadsheets of songs that have been lost to other cities. This portion of the set acts as a motivating factor for Swifties to tune into live streams of the show each weekend.\n\nTo end Swift\u2019s performance, the \u201cMidnights\u201d era unfolded with her most recent singles and tracks from last year. As someone who has been a fan for years--even writing my college essay about Swift--I knew I needed to attend The Eras Tour from the moment it was announced. The dedication I have participated in and witnessed in regard to this tour specifically is unlike any other.\n\nSimilarly to many Swifties, my roommate and I would watch TikTok live streams every weekend just to hear the surprise songs in anticipation of our own show. The pre-concert buildup, including spending countless hours on Ticketmaster and making friendship bracelets, was well worth it. The Eras Tour exceeded all of my pre-existing high expectations.\n\nBetween the elaborate outfits and thousands of Swifties that tune in every weekend on TikTok live streams, fans, like myself, are extremely passionate about the tour. Some connect with upbeat classics like \u201cBlank Space\u201d and \u201c22 (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d while others embrace the ballads and emotional moments. The flashing of multi-colored lights across the audience during \u201cAugust\u201d is a truly unforgettable moment. The fake snow falling from the sky at the end of \u201cAll Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d fills the crowd with nostalgia and peace. There is a great deal to be appreciated about The Eras Tour.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Kyusung Gong)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan June 28, 2023 at 11:02 am PDT\n\n\u201cSoCal Soccer Spotlight\u201d is a column by Jack Hallinan about the professional soccer landscape in Los Angeles.\n\nWho Will Take Over at Angel City?\n\nAfter a tumultuous start to the season, Angel City FC fired head coach Freya Coombe on June 15. At the time of Coombe\u2019s firing, the team had played 11 matches for a record of two wins, three draws and six losses. They were second-to-last place in the NWSL, better only than the Kansas City Current.\n\nFormer sporting director Eni Aluko (whose role at Angel City changed to Director of Recruitment when Angela Hucles took over as general manager) appointed Coombe to be the club\u2019s first ever head coach after she led NJ/NY Gotham to a fifth-place finish in the 2021 NWSL season. Gotham conceded the second-fewest goals in the league that season (21), but her team\u2019s attack struggled at times, scoring only 29 in 24 matches.\n\nIn Angel City\u2019s debut season in 2022, from a simple goals for and against perspective, Coombe basically replicated her Gotham side with less impressive resources. They were defensively solid for an unfancied team, letting in the tied for fourth-fewest goals, but only scoring 23, tied for third-fewest.\n\nThat pattern did not continue in Angel City\u2019s second campaign. In fact, in the 2023 season, Coombe\u2019s side has suffered from the opposite affliction. While Angel City would certainly do with more firepower \u2014 Alyssa Thompson and Claire Emslie co-lead the squad with just three goals each \u2014 the team\u2019s 16 total goals actually ranks seventh in the league, just outside of the playoffs. Their 22 goals conceded, however, has them as the third-worst defense, only two better than second-worst Kansas City.\n\nTo put that figure in perspective, with nine NWSL matches left to play, Angel City will almost surely surpass their total goals conceded in 2022, when they allowed 27.\n\nBecki Tweed will assume interim head coach duties after serving as Coombe\u2019s assistant at both Angel City and Gotham. Tweed is undefeated in her two matches so far, leading the squad to a 2-1 win over SoCal rivals San Diego Wave and a scoreless draw against Houston Dash. Tweed has sufficient coaching experience at both the NWSL and international level (as a former U-20 USWNT assistant) that if she continues winning matches, Angel City could very possibly appoint her full-time.\n\nThat being said, the club will likely wait until the end of the season to conduct a thorough head coach search. OL Reign head coach Laura Harvey\u2019s contract is up at the conclusion of the 2023 season, of which Angel City is surely aware. Harvey, a two-time NWSL Coach of the Year, rescued OL Reign\u2019s season in 2022, steering them to first in the table after taking over in August. OL Reign currently sit third on 23 points, only two behind league-leaders Portland and just behind North Carolina Courage on goal difference.\n\nIf hiring a coach with NWSL experience is the goal, the club could do much worse than Harvey.\n\nThompson and Ertz Named to USWNT Roster\n\nDespite Angel City\u2019s up-and-down (mostly down) season so far, both Thompson and Julie Ertz will represent the US Women\u2019s National Team at the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Ertz\u2019 inclusion was not much of a surprise, as the midfielder has already been a part of two World Cup-winning sides and made over 100 appearances for the national team.\n\nWhile pundits have speculated Thompson might earn a spot ever since she forewent college soccer to enter the NWSL draft, the 18-year-old\u2019s addition to the squad is nonetheless remarkable. She will be the team\u2019s youngest player at the World Cup and likely one of the youngest players at the whole tournament.\n\nHow much Thompson actually features remains to be seen, but the experience will no doubt be excellent for her career.\n\nMLS Clubs\u2019 Opposite Fortunes\n\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times. For LAFC, it\u2019s the former, and for the LA Galaxy \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 it\u2019s the latter.\n\nAfter winning the MLS Cup in 2022, LAFC\u2019s good fortunes have continued as they currently sit tied for first place atop the Western Conference, with one game in hand on St. Louis City. Most encouragingly, though, is that LAFC fans would probably say that their team has a higher performance gear still left to reach this season.\n\nHead coach Steve Cherundolo has rotated his squad regularly because the team made a deep run in the CONCACAF Champions League. The black and gold progressed all the way to the final where they faced Mexican side Le\u00f3n, losing 1-3 on aggregate in the two legs.\n\nWith that competition out of the way, Cherundolo & Co. can focus more heavily on the league, where they have already been among the MLS\u2019 best. LAFC has a deep roster that can be competitive no matter who steps onto the field.\n\nThe team recently defeated Sporting Kansas City with a starting front three of Stipe Biuk, Nathan Ordaz and Mateusz Bogusz. Typically, LAFC first-choice attack trio would be Denis Bouanga, Kwadwo Opoku and club legend Carlos Vela, so to win a match with none of those players starting deserves merit.\n\nKellyn Acosta has also struggled with an injury in June, but he should be ready to return to the lineup for the Leagues Cup, a new showcase tournament where MLS teams will compete against Liga MX clubs. As the MLS champ for 2022, LAFC have automatically qualified for the Round of 32 and will skip the group stage, allowing them extra time to rest and prepare for the second half of the season.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that on a league-wide scale, the Eastern Conference currently dominates the Supporters\u2019 Shield standings. Four Eastern teams sit above St. Louis and LAFC in the cumulative table, so LAFC have some serious wood to chop to retain that trophy.\n\nRegardless, LAFC are poised to make another serious run at the MLS Cup. No team has retained the title since LA Galaxy did so in 2011 and 2012.\n\nThe Galaxy, meanwhile, have almost no hope of regaining their former title. They are ten points adrift of the playoffs in the West, with only three league wins so far this season.\n\nThe team\u2019s three Designated Players \u2014 Douglas Costa, Riqui Puig and Chicharito \u2014 have all either underperformed or been scarcely available. Costa has made just seven appearances, providing two assists and scoring zero goals. Chicharito tore his ACL this month, ruling him out for the remainder of the season. Even when he played, the Mexican legend had scored only one goal this season.\n\nPuig has played 17 of the 18 matches, adding three total goal contributions, but the midfielder can\u2019t turn around the team\u2019s fortunes by himself.\n\nIt figures to be a long and painful season for Galaxy fans. If there\u2019s one thing to take solace in, they did defeat LAFC 2-0 in the U.S. Open Cup (we don\u2019t have to mention who played for LAFC in that game).\n\nThanks for reading my debut column on everything LA soccer.

(Photo by Anthony Clingerman)\n\nBy Anthony Clingerman\nJune 26, 2023 at 7:35 pm PDT\n\nA multi-decade veteran of the USC Annenberg community bid farewell to Wallis Annenberg Hall Thursday after a long career overseeing many innovations for students and faculty alike. Charles \u201cChuck\u201d Boyles, director of media technologies, has spent over 20 years as a member of the USC Annenberg staff.\n\nBoyles helped to develop numerous programs for the institution - Annenberg Radio News, Annenberg TV News and the current Media Center inside of Wallis Annenberg Hall all owe their inception to his efforts. Boyles spoke to Annenberg Media about the early years of his career and discussed how he began his tenure with the University.\n\n\u201cI was going to radio-television school in Long Beach, and the head of the department was in touch with the head of the broadcast department at USC,\u201d Boyles said. \u201cThey were looking for someone to help with video editing and studio production - I applied and got the job.\u201d\n\nThe broadcast industry evolved rapidly during Boyles\u2019 tenure with Annenberg, and keeping current with these changes was an important part of his duties. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019ve stayed here as long as I have... this is a great environment to keep up with all the different technologies as they were introduced,\u201d Boyles said. \u201cWhen I first came, we were editing tape-to-tape... we would physically have baskets of tape. Students would use their skateboards to race over from the ASC (Annenberg School of Communication) building to the studio to deliver them for the show.\u201d\n\nBoyles is responsible for many improvements to the Annenberg curriculum\u2019s technology, and oversaw the implementation of non-linear editing, a change in the program. \u201cWe had a weekly magazine show called \u2018Impact\u2019 when I first started, and around 1998 we started ATVN which was a nightly news program,\u201d Boyles said. \u201cI installed the Avid news cutters and worked on building the first studio for ATVN.\u201d\n\nThe internet also became an important facet of journalism during Boyles\u2019 career, and he helped to integrate this concept around the campus. \u201cI was also involved in building the Digital Lab, which was a training facility in the ASC building - after that, I built the first radio booth for Annenberg Radio News,\u201d Boyles said.\n\nThe Media Center remains one of the biggest accomplishments of Boyles\u2019 career, as he was directly involved with planning the construction of the Journalism program\u2019s central hub. \u201cWhen they announced the donation for the building - they literally said it was going to house a state-of-the-art facility,\u201d Boyles said. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018As technology evolves... how in the world am I going to build state-of-the-art 10 years in the future?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Media Center features multiple recording studios and a large newsroom for students to hone their craft - Boyles had a hand in deciding the layout and features of the facilities now used by hundreds of students each semester. \u201cTen years ago I had a $10 million budget... It was a huge project. We spent about a year doing research and a year doing design,\u201d Boyles said. \u201cIt was such a great experience working with the architect... you wouldn\u2019t believe the time and energy that went into determining the exact size of the assignment desk (also known as the \u201chalo\u201d).\u201d\n\nBoyles attributes many of his positive experiences to the companionship and professionalism of his colleagues. \u201cI\u2019m the most proud of the Media Center out of everything I\u2019ve done here... one of the reasons Annenberg TV News has been so successful is because of the faculty,\u201d Boyles said. \u201cSerena Cha, Stacy Scholder... have taken the show so seriously. They treat the show like a major market.\u201d\n\nCha and Scholder paid tribute to Boyles this week at events on campus. Dean Willow Bay attended a cupcake send off for Boyles held in the Digital Lounge Wednesday. The room was decorated with archival photos and superhero characters as a nod to all Boyles has done for Annenberg.\n\nAt the ceremony, Annenberg Associate Dean of Operations and Strategy James Vasquez thanked Boyles for all he\u2019s done. In an interview with Annenberg Media, Vasquez shared his thoughts on Boyles\u2019 career accomplishments. \u201cI call Chuck our Annenberg \u2018MacGyver\u2019 - he had this uncanny ability to fix things and come up with mechanical or construction solutions to any issue,\u201d Vasquez said. \u201cThroughout his career, he accomplished a lot... from the design of the halo to the Studio C sets and the Studio A rotating set and lighting grid, Chuck\u2019s legacy will remain in these spaces.\u201d\n\nThe longtime technical supervisor is ending his career on a high note here and intends to pursue a career in the automotive field. Boyles reflected on his experiences before his farewell ceremony. \u201cThere\u2019s that expression, No regrets. There was a time when I first started here when I felt I should\u2019ve moved onto other things,\u201d Boyles said. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m grateful for my 28 years, and I wouldn\u2019t give it up for anything.\u201d\n```"}

For years, I\u2019ve echoed the sentiment of Billy Beane in Moneyball to anyone who will listen (a surprisingly low amount): a walk is as good as a hit. I don\u2019t care about \u201cbatting average.\u201d At a minimum, I evaluate players based on their on-base percentage and the slew of statistics that complement that figure.\n\nBut the Marlins\u2019 Luis Arraez doesn\u2019t care what I think. He\u2019s managed to do something I never thought I\u2019d see: get a hit so often that it makes walking nearly inconsequential. Nearly halfway through the year, Arraez is tied for 111th in walks (24). But nearly halfway through the year, Arraez leads the league in on-base percentage \u2013 by 26 points.\n\nAs of June 26, Arraez has a batting average of .399. If he manages to hover above the line over the next week, Arraez will join a microscopic club of hitters since World War II to go into July with an average of over .400. In late May, his average dropped to a season-low .371. To make up for it, he batted .438 in June and had three five-hit games in a two-and-a-half-week period. Derek Jeter had five such games in his entire career.\n\nAgonizingly, Arraez has managed to do all this while being in the 39th percentile in average exit velocity (speed of the ball off the bat) and just the 2nd percentile in hard-hit rate (percentage of balls hit 95 mph or harder). Basically, it shouldn\u2019t be possible for Arraez to do what he\u2019s been doing because, well, most players need to hit the ball hard to get a hit. But not Arraez.\n\nTo put it simply, Luis Arraez gets on base more than anyone in baseball, even though he doesn\u2019t like to walk, and when he puts the ball in play, it doesn\u2019t go that fast. Great. That doesn\u2019t bother me at all.\n\nBut let\u2019s take another look at the leaderboard. On the other end of the on-base spectrum is the Padres\u2019 Juan Soto, whose .273 batting average is good for 50th in the league. Certainly not bad, but a far cry from Arraez\u2019s eye-poppingly impossible mark. Unlike Arraez, however, Juan Soto probably HAS seen Moneyball and chooses to end 20.8% of his plate appearances in a walk. Thanks to his league-leading 71 walks, Soto\u2019s .425 on-base percentage is enough to take the silver medal.\n\nSoto and Arraez have been better at getting on base than anyone in baseball, and they\u2019ve done so through completely contrasting methods. But see, that\u2019s the funny thing about on-base percentage. It does not care if you got on via a walk or a hit, just if you got on base at all. For most players, that probably means a healthy mix of both outcomes. Arraez and Soto have each chosen to focus primarily on one aspect and run with it.\n\nI\u2019m willing to bet that Arraez probably could walk more if he wanted to. After all, it\u2019s not like his plate discipline is lacking; he strikes out less frequently than he walks. In a strikeout-dominated world, his vision and feel-for-the-strike-zone skills are highly exceptional. But for him \u2014 and ONLY him \u2014 he doesn\u2019t need to walk more. Walking more would actually be a detriment to not only his game, but the Marlins offense as a whole.\n\nFor what seems like the first time in years, the Marlins have life. As of June 26, they have the third-best record in the National League. They\u2019ve won 70% of their games in June. None of that would be possible without Arraez. That\u2019s because that .400 mark holds a power that no other statistical figure in the sport can. Pitchers fear it. Defenses do their best to stop it. Managers stay up at night, thinking of a way to avoid it. But most importantly, it gives the Marlins \u2014 and Luis Arraez \u2014 something to rally behind.\n\nAnd while that league-leading on-base percentage is higher and probably more impressive statistically, I\u2019m willing to bet that the Marlins would let Arraez swing away instead of taking a walk 100 times out of 100. Because of course, you definitely can get on with a walk. But you can also reach base on a 70-mph single to left field. For one man on this planet, such an unnecessary risk is truly necessary. And I think Billy Beane would be proud.\n```"}

WrestleMania broke the Levi\u2019s Stadium attendance record at 76,976 fans from all 50 states and 40 countries. (Don Feria/AP Images for WWE)\n\nBy Maddy Myer June 26, 2023 at 4:00 pm PDT\n\nThis week, the world of pro wrestling was in for a big treat. WWE\u2019s developmental brand NXT started its \u201cGold Rush\u201d week, featuring high-profile matches with champions and seasoned WWE superstars. AEW put on a phenomenal pay-per-view event with NJPW called Forbidden Door that featured some of the best wrestling I\u2019ve seen in weeks. Unfortunately, that event came with Bryan Danielson suffering a fractured right forearm, which likely means he\u2019ll be out of wrestling action for the next 6-8 weeks. On the bright side, I did get to attend this week\u2019s WWE Friday Night Smackdown in person and had a blast. The energy wrestling fans bring to an event is unlike any other sporting event I\u2019ve attended, and going to a live show is something I recommend for anyone, even if they\u2019re not a wrestling fan.\n\nHere are the top pro wrestling matches from the past week:\n\nKenny Omega vs. Will Ospreay (AEW Forbidden Door, June 25)\nTwo of the best wrestlers in the world proved why they\u2019re a tier above so many others in the ring with this match last week. These wrestling veterans had to pull out all the stops on each other, as it seemed each time one of them got momentum, the other would come back with a reversal. Ospreay\u2019s dive to Omega outside the ring was a highlight that was soon followed by him slinging Omega into the steel steps and bouncing his face off the ring post before sending him back in the ring. But Omega matched this intensity as well, from connecting with a flying knee to Ospreay\u2019s head against the barricade outside the ring to hitting a DDT on top of the steel steps. Ospreay took the victory and won the IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship from Omega.\n\nSolo Sikoa vs. Sheamus (WWE Friday Night Smackdown, June 23)\nAfter Solo Sikoa attacked Ridge Holland, one of Sheamus\u2019 best friends, Sheamus challenged him to a match. The main event of the night didn\u2019t disappoint, even though the match ended in a no contest. For a portion of the match, Sheamus looked to be in control, as he was hitting his signature moves like his devastating backbreaker and brutal chest pounds on Sikoa. But that all changed when Sikoa hit Sheamus outside the ring and started a true beating against him. He slammed Sheamus on top of the announcer\u2019s table, dragged him to sit in front of the barricade and ran at full speed to connect with Sheamus against the barricade and break it. The referee had no choice but to call the match.\n\nSeth Rollins vs. Bron Breakker (WWE NXT, June 20)\nReturning to NXT was the current WWE World Heavyweight Champion, Seth \u201cFreakin\u201d Rollins. He faced one of NXT\u2019s most successful stars of this era, Bron Breakker, putting the title on the line. Even with his ribs taped up from the brutality of a previous match, Rollins delivered like he always does. Rollins hit a frog splash outside the ring onto Breakker, who was situated perfectly on the announcer\u2019s table. From Rollins\u2019 splash and impact, the table broke, with Breakker falling to the floor. But this wasn\u2019t the end for Breakker; as Rollins tried to hit another frog splash inside the ring, Breakker avoided it and came back with a tight submission hold on Rollins. In the end, Rollins hit Breakker with the stomp to pick up the victory.\n\nJoe Hendry vs. Yuya Uemura (Impact, June 22)\nThis fast-paced match was the highlight of Impact Wrestling last week. Joe Hendry is a naturally gifted athlete that puts on a show every time he\u2019s in a ring. From neck breakers to suplexes, Hendry could put on a clinic for perfecting these moves. The slightly quicker Yuya Uemura outpaced Hendry for part of the match, hitting a picture-perfect dropkick that rocked Hendry to the mat. Uemura matched Hendry in power but made the mistake of jumping off the top rope at a point where Hendry wasn\u2019t tired enough. Hendry caught Uemura and hit his finishing move, the Hendry Slam, for the victory, causing Uemura\u2019s first title opportunity in Impact Wrestling to end with a loss.\n\nAcross the board, this was a great week for professional wrestling. AEW\u2019s Forbidden Door will be hard to beat, but WWE has amazing storylines and matches in place for its next pay-per-view event, Money In the Bank, which takes place on July 1.\n\n\u201cSports Entertainment Solidified\u201d is a pro wrestling column by Maddy Myer that runs every Monday.\n```"}

(Photo Courtesy of Anika Nyman)\n\nBy Myriam Alcala June 26, 2023 at 11:09 am PDT\n\nArt has been a part of senior Anika Nyman\u2019s life since they could remember. Nyman is an art and narrative studies major, and through art they have been exploring storytelling and advocacy these past few years. The LGBTQ+ community, especially trans and nonbinary people are marginalized, misunderstood, and in turn face disempowerment and lack of autonomy over their own bodies. For example, trans community members in the U.S. face anti-trans legislation that prevent them from having access to gender affirming care. There are other ways in which trans and nonbinary identities are disempowered, and one of those ways is representation in art.\n\nNyman noticed a serious lack of representation of queerness within art. The little representation there was of queerness, specifically the nonbinary community, was still so binary and stereotypical. \u201cPhotography or painting of nonbinary people emphasized gendered characteristics,\u201d said Nyman. Specifically, the nonbinary community often faces inaccurate portrayal. For example, people portray all gender conforming or nonbinary people as androgynous (indeterminate gender) or as overly sexual. As someone who is nonbinary, it\u2019s frustrating to continue to be looked at in terms of other people\u2019s perception or comfort. \u201cMy identity is so much more than what my body looks like or how my body can be perceived,\u201d Nyman added.\n\nSo they married the two and began to tell stories about queerness. Most recently, they\u2019ve been working on a project titled \u201cDisembodied Portraits\u201d of which they invited myself and USC alum Yessi Pi\u00f1a. Pi\u00f1a studied geodesign and is also an artist. Growing up, they fell in love with the challenge and the creative endeavor of art. As they got older, they began to see it more and more as a tool to learn more about other cultures, people and places. They also saw how important representation was in art. \u201cIt was a super big thing for me when I started to see art including Black and brown bodies,\u201d Pi\u00f1a said.\n\nThis extended into their art and queerness. Pi\u00f1a saw the same underrepresentation and misrepresentation in art as Nyman. So, Pi\u00f1a began to welcome queerness into their art, something that was always there, but now intentional. \u201cI find myself gravitating towards art that blurs the line and pushes the boundaries of what is socially acceptable,\u201d Pi\u00f1a said. They especially wanted to pursue art that worked towards decentralizing the body or sexualizing it in an empowering way for trans, nonbinary, Black, and brown bodies.\n\nThat\u2019s why when they heard about Nyman\u2019s project, they decided to participate. \u201cI am something worth being captured,\u201d Pi\u00f1a said. Disembodied Portraits was Nyman\u2019s way of rejecting how their identity and the identity of so many other people was being portrayed. \u201cI wanted to see if I could represent people, especially nonbinary people, in a way that was not objectifying,\u201d Nyman said.\n\nAs a femme presenting nonbinary person, Nyman\u2019s project was appealing. For once, I wanted my body to stop being a thing for others, so along with Pi\u00f1a, I joined the project. We each were painted full body by Nyman and laid on a 6-foot tall canvas. Imprinting our bodies onto the canvas was a way to be represented by an essence/abstract rather than the body itself, \u201c[the whole process] shows that bodies don\u2019t have to be sexualized,\u201d Pi\u00f1a said.\n\nAfter posing, Pi\u00f1a felt that they were a part of the process of making the art. \u201cIt was an expansion of my own relationship with my body,\u201d Pi\u00f1a said. The fear of perfection caught up to me when it was my turn to lay on the canvas. I wanted to make a perfect representation. In the end, it wasn\u2019t perfect; it was me. An abstract version with long limbs and two heads. It was the first time my brown, queer, femme, nonbinary body was my own. That is the power of art.\n```"}

Ohio State is considered a top 10 football school in the nation. The Buckeyes\u2019 spring game highlighted their new QB1, junior Kyle McCord, along with their consistent powerhouse offense.\n\nPenn State is another university that prides itself off of its football program. Head coach James Franklin leads the team, along with sophomore linebacker Abdul Carter, sophomore running back Nick Singleton and sophomore running back Kaytron Allen.\n\nWith the release of their 2024 and 2025 competition, USC football\u2019s once distant future is feeling much more realistic.

If you\u2019ve listened to one fantasy football show, you\u2019ve listened to them all. Hosts and experts tend to preach the same strategies, sleepers and busts, while we flock to them hoping for some groundbreaking advice that will win us our leagues. That\u2019s where I come in. I won\u2019t be reiterating what any other analyst and expert is telling you with this column, but rather where they\u2019re wrong.\n\nLie #1 \u201cDraft players around their average draft position for the best value\u201d\n\nTechnically, this isn\u2019t a lie. Using average draft position (ADP) to determine when a player should be picked is a useful tool to determine who should be available at what pick. When it\u2019s taken too literally, it becomes a lie. ADP is just an average of where players got picked in MILLIONS of leagues \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have to be where they get picked in YOUR league. Relying on ADP leads to missing out on players because somebody else wanted them more, or not considering players because they won\u2019t be available when you\u2019re on the clock.\n\nFantasy football is about building the best team possible, not creating nearly identical teams to the expert that did a mock draft at the same draft slot. The better strategy is going into the draft with an idea of players you want to have on your team, use their ADP to determine what round to pick them in and make sure they\u2019re on your roster by the end of the draft. Don\u2019t worry about what your leaguemates say after reaching on a player, but rather hope that 17 weeks later, they\u2019ll regret not taking them sooner.\n\nLie #2 \u201cWait to take a Quarterback\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve fallen victim to this multiple times, and every time I do, the same problems happen. The theory is that in standard league settings, the weekly average score for a starting quarterback is minimal. It\u2019s best to fill your roster with running backs and wide receivers, and it won\u2019t matter if you\u2019re left with the QB1 or QB10. Issue is, it does matter. Well, at least for the average league.\n\nThe experts that say wait on a quarterback play against other experts doing the same thing; typically the top three go off the board relatively early and quarterback is an afterthought until the mid-rounds. When I\u2019ve waited for a quarterback, I watch the top three go off the board, everyone else panic, start taking the rest and I spend the rest of my season with a headache. I can\u2019t tell you how much stress I\u2019ve had deciding whether to start Kirk Cousins, Jameis Winston or Ryan Tannehill each week.\n\nTaking a top quarterback early comes with benefits much more valuable than an extra five points. Consistency, reliability and one less position to worry about each week. Drafting Patrick Mahomes in round two or three might be a bit too steep of a price, but Joe Burrow, Josh Allen or Lamar Jackson are worth taking over a skill position player in rounds four through six.\n\nLie #3 \u201cUse the \u2018Zero-RB\u2019 strategy\u201d\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know what this is, here\u2019s the quick version: Overload your team with top wide receivers, quarterbacks and tight ends while only drafting high-upside running backs in later rounds. Then, spend the year watching those drafted guys slowly gain more opportunities, trading talented wide receivers for other running backs and grabbing the midseason breakout player off the waiver-wire.\n\nIt makes sense. The running back position is the most unpredictable and injury prone in all of fantasy football, so play it safe during the draft and figure it out during the long season. I actually won my league using this strategy last season, so it might seem strange as to why I\u2019m including it here. Despite my success, I still despise this strategy.\n\nIt took two trades that happened to work out perfectly, picking up breakout receivers, not running backs (since my drafted receivers either busted or got hurt), Patrick Mahomes and a colossal collapse of my opponent in the championship game. In short, I got lucky. Luck is the game with this strategy and it makes the most unpredictable position in fantasy football even more unpredictable.\n\nLeaguemates need to be willing to trade, you\u2019ll need top priority on the waiver wire most weeks (which means spending the year at the bottom of the standings) and you\u2019ll need to absolutely nail the late rounds in the draft in order for it to work. Oh and did I mention getting lucky?\n\nThe pros outweigh the cons of drafting a top running back. If injuries or busts are still a concern, handcuff them to their backup and keep current with the waiver wire. They say it\u2019s not about how you start, but rather how you finish. But believing these lies that experts tell you could end your season before it even begins.\n```"}

Much of his research is based around studies of biogenic material fluxes to the sea floor.\n\nAnnenberg Media spoke to the professor Thursday after the United States Coast Guard announced that a catastrophic implosion may be what doomed the OceanGate\u2019s Titan vessel. Concerns about the safety of the vessel itself have been raised. \u201cThe submarine has to be really, really well constructed and really well safety tested...some people said that maybe the safety testing wasn\u2019t as good as it should have been,\u201d Berelson said.\n\nUp until now, the USCG had been continuing its search for the missing Titan, owned and operated by OceanGate Expeditions, a company dedicated to its mission to \u201chelp expand understanding of the ocean by providing opportunities for citizen explorers and scientists to explore its depths with their own eyes.\u201d On Sunday, Titan lost connection with the mainland. Since then, authorities including the Coast Guard and OceanGate have been desperately searching for the submersive vehicle.\n\n\u201cA debris field was discovered within the search area by an ROV near the Titanic. Experts within the unified command are evaluating the information,\u201d the Coast Guard tweeted Thursday morning.\n\nOn Thursday at 3 p.m. EDT, Rear Admiral John Mauger, the First Coast Guard District commander, and Captain Jamie Frederick, the First Coast Guard District response coordinator, held a press conference in which they announced their suspicions about the fate of the submersible and its occupants. During the press conference, the USCG offered condolences to the families of the Titan\u2019s passengers. Additionally, the USCG offered more information regarding a debris field they discovered on Thursday.\n\nThe USCG announced that they \u201cfound five different major pieces of debris that told us that it was the remains of the Titan.\u201d This is an incredibly unforgiving environment down there on the seafloor. The debris is consistent with a catastrophic imploding of the vessel,\u201d Mauger said. \u201cWe will continue to work and search the area.\u201d\n\nThe location of the Titan submersible vessel was in an area that was approximately 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said. The next phase of the search will include investigating the site of the debris field and documenting the scene in the hopes of providing the families of the victims with a better understanding of what occurred.\n\n\u201cThroughout the search efforts, we reacted to the information that we had available to us. We continue to send it off for deeper analysis,\u201d the USCG said. Although previous reports of banging sounds were reported, they are no longer expected to be related to the site of what the Coast Guard thinks is the debris field of the vessel.\n\n\u201cThere doesn\u2019t appear to be any connection between the noises and the location on the seafloor. This was a catastrophic implodement of the vessel which would have generated a significant broadband sound that we would have picked up,\u201d Mauger said.\n\nFive passengers, otherwise known as \u201cmission specialists,\u201d were aboard the watercraft, including: Shahzada Dawood and his son, Suleman, Paul-Henry Nargeolet, Hamish Harding and Stockton Rush, the CEO of Ocean Gate, the company responsible for the exploration. Dawood was 48 years old and was a trustee of the SETI institute, which is a non-profit organization that dedicates itself to researching life and intelligence in the universe. He was originally from Pakistan but resided in southeast London. He was also the vice president of an investment company named Dawood Hercules Corporation, which manufactures chemical products.\n\nNargeolet was in the French Navy for 20 years, and he joined the French Institute for Research and Exploration of the Sea afterwards. He made more than 12 dives and had recovered numerous objects from a previously recovered ship. Harding was the president of Action Aviation, which is a company that specializes in purchasing and selling aircrafts. He has also been a part of the Blue Origin Project spearheaded by Jeff Bezos and flew to the edge of space previously. Rush, the CEO of OceanGate, founded the company 13 years ago and simultaneously acted as the executive director. He became the youngest qualified jet transport pilot when he gained captain rank at just 10 years old.\n\nDr. Michael Guillen was a scientist and author who was previously in a vessel that got stuck in the Titanic wreck and survived. \u201cIt had to have been a catastrophic failure,\u201d said Guillen. When it comes to the reported previously heard noises, Guillen never sensed a correlation, given the intense and panicked nature of the situation. \u201cFrankly, if I were in that sub stranded, I wouldn\u2019t wait for 30-minute intervals,\u201d said Guillen.\n```"}

(Photo by Ben Cohen)\n\nBy Ben Cohen\nJune 21, 2023 at 1:52 pm PDT\n\nLong after the final whistle, The 3252 are still singing in a Little Tokyo parking lot. This is Los Angeles! LAFC has just finished a 1-1 tie in Nashville, but the heartbeat of the club pumps from The Escondite, where various supporter groups, or SGs, have organized a watch party. This is Los Angeles! Ahoo, ahoo, ahoo, ahoo!\n\nNamed for the number of seats in LAFC\u2019s Supporters Section at BMO Stadium, The 3252 has been the club\u2019s independent supporters union since before the team first kicked a ball in 2018. They are loud. They are loyal. And they are a big reason why LAFC has succeeded where others have failed.\n\n\u201c[The 3252] is a lot of different communities and people from a lot of different parts of the city coming together for this one club,\u201d said Sean Park, an LAFC fan from Koreatown.\n\nIn October 2014, Major League Soccer awarded Los Angeles a second soccer team\u2014in addition to the already existing L.A. Galaxy\u2014to be named Los Angeles Football Club. As it prepared to join the league in 2018, Co-President and Chief Business Officer Larry Freedman set out to build a club and a community to support it.\n\n\u201cThat afforded us nothing but time to get out there in the community and meet people, talk to them about their interest in and love for the game of football,\u201d Freedman said. \u201cAnd if we were going to build a club\u2014not a team, not a franchise, but a club\u2014what would they like that club to look like and would they like to build it with us?\u201d\n\nFreedman and the rest of LAFC had the luxury of coming after Chivas USA, which joined the MLS in 2005 and shared a stadium with the Galaxy. Chivas ultimately failed to garner support from L.A.\u2019s already crowded sports scene and folded after just 10 seasons. Freedman said he learned a lot from Chivas\u2019s failure, both as a business and as a soccer team. But he believed that what it left behind was a population of soccer fans without a club to support.\n\n\u201cAll we needed to do was create something that would resonate with [fans] as authentic to the global game, and the rest would take care of itself,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, the club went to local bars and pubs, gauging L.A.\u2019s soccer culture, building relationships and developing a fanbase.\n\n\u201cWe really took a very grassroots approach,\u201d said Patrick Aviles, who has been at LAFC since the start, working mostly in supporter relations. \u201cIt was going out in the community, meeting people where they are, talking to them about the culture of football, about global football, about our city, the culture around the sport as well. And, you know, really connecting with people.\u201d\n\nIt appears to have worked.\n\n\u201cThey really put their finger on the pulse as to what was happening in the city, in the areas around us and what we wanted, and I was in,\u201d said Eldrick Bone, a fan from South Central.\n\nBoth the fans and the club speak highly of their relationship, with the club holding collaborative meetings with the 3252 consistently to address fan ideas and concerns.\n\n\u201c[LAFC] actually listen and they want to be inclusive,\u201d said Keaton Cashier, who lives in the San Fernando Valley. \u201cThey want people to feel like, \u2018This is somewhere I wanna be.\u2019\u201d\n\nEn L.A. hay una banda\nQue no para de saltar\nSon los locos Angelenos\nQue vinieron a alentar.\n\nIn L.A. there is a band\nThat doesn\u2019t stop jumping\nThey are the crazy Angelenos\nWho came to cheer.\n\nAt home matches, drums bang, flags fly and voices ring for 90 minutes; LAFC fans don\u2019t know how to support their team any other way.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not only at the L.A. games, we\u2019re also at the traveling games,\u201d said Jerico Hernandez, a member of a traveling sect of the 3252 called the Road Trip Boys. \u201cSo you will always see our support in house and out house, baby!\u201d\n\nChanting in both English and Spanish, The 3252 believe they make a direct impact on matches from the stands.\n\n\u201cOur spirit and what we give is almost as important as what the players are giving,\u201d Bone said.\n\nBone is a member of the 42Originals, one of the many sects of The 3252, which brings fans of both LAFC and recreational cannabis together. The group advocates for the decriminalization of marijuana, using it as a tool to unite like-minded people who want to cheer for LAFC and smoke together.\n\nCashier, also part of the 42Originals, speaks regularly with other supporters unions in the MLS, advocating for more cannabis groups across the league.\n\n\u201cNowhere in sports will you find somebody else as enthusiastic about cannabis as we are,\u201d he said.\n\n42Originals flags wave throughout The North End during home matches, and green scarves with the slogan \u201cWhere the Weed At?\u201d dot the crowd.\n\nFor the match against Nashville, the Originals have partnered with the Tigers Supporters Group to organize a watch party for fans in both SGs and anyone else interested.\n\nBased in Koreatown, TSG isn\u2019t just for Korean fans, according to Park.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a melting pot,\u201d he said.\n\nPark plays the drums at games and watch parties, keeping the crazy Angeleno band rooting in rhythm. He has played drums his whole life, so when his group needed a drummer, Park stepped up, saying the role felt \u201cnatural.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the same,\u201d said Hernandez of the different SGs. He dances to the beat of Park\u2019s drum and passes his joint to a stranger.\n\n\u201cCome and hang out with us and have fun and cheer for L.A. Football Club,\u201d he said with a grin.\n\nDale, dale, dale, Black and Gold!\n\nLAFC is for all Angelenos, especially the abandoned ones.\n\n\u201cThe Galaxy didn\u2019t really care about reaching out to the rest of the city,\u201d Park said of his club\u2019s rivals, who play in Carson, California. \u201cThey got complacent in a way, and LAFC did a good job of coming in and taking care of the rest of it. All of the neglected parts of L.A. are coming together, that\u2019s what this is.\u201d\n\nChristian Ixcol grew up in South L.A. without a team.\n\n\u201cI remember we would go to Exposition Park before it became turf, when it was all dirt and, you know, messed up,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom the lumps on the field when he was a kid to the state-of-the-art BMO stadium where he watches his team play now, Ixcol has seen LAFC bring in fans as local as he is, to Cashier, who took the train in from the Valley to watch his favorite team with the people he calls family.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come through the sport, that\u2019s what brought us in, but then you meet these people and then you really become part of this family,\u201d said Cashier, a founding member of The 3252.\n\nNow, having won the 2022 MLS Cup in just its fifth season in the league, LAFC has its sights set on the global stage, according to Freedman.\n\nThe Black and Gold are in the finals of the CONCACAF Champions League this season, and, should they win it, will qualify for the Club World Cup and face the best teams from all over the world.\n\nRegardless of the result, LAFC\u2019s loyal fanbase will still be there, Hernandez said, \u201cthrough thick and thin, whether we win or lose.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Mateo Gutierrez)\n\nBy Mateo Gutierrez and Taylor Marie Contarino\nJune 21, 2023 at 12:13 pm PDT\n\nFelecia Fernandez, 67, first came to Leimert Park to celebrate Juneteenth more than 25 years ago. Before the official Leimert Park Juneteenth Festival started, it was Jonathan Leonard, a local resident originally from Texas, who began the tradition in 1949. Since then, many in the community would gather at Leimert Park for informal barbecues and celebrations until the festival\u2019s formal organization in 2018.\n\n\u201cTo see where it has grown to today, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d Fernandez said. Leonard passed away in 2017, but his memory is carried by his family who continue to attend the festival and run a stand dedicated to him where they giveaway ribs, watermelon and red soda for free. Fernandez, a volunteer at the stand and close family friend, reflected on what the festival would mean to him.\n\n\u201cIf he were able to see what he has started has turned into such a large magnitude [event] of people coming here and then actually have it turned into a federal holiday, then he would surely be proud,\u201d Fernandez said.\n\nThe Jonathan Leonard stand at the Leimert Park Juneteenth Festival on June 19, 2023. (Photo by Mateo Gutierrez)\n\nThe Leimert Park Juneteenth Festival was just one of many events celebrating the holiday in Los Angeles and around the country. Along with Leimert Park\u2019s celebration, you can find many others in and around L.A., whether you venture to the Greek Theatre, or to The Beehive in South L.A.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see this many people in the streets,\u201d said Warren G., a festival attendee. \u201cYou don\u2019t see this much unity, peace and togetherness. This is awesome.\u201d\n\nSince the first official Leimert Park Juneteenth Celebration, South L.A. has been filled with energy as the streets of Leimert Park Village turn into the site of the annual block party filled with more than 300 Black-owned vendors showcasing art, food, drinks, clothing and more. This year, tens of thousands of people attended to experience cultural foods, activities, and performances which took place in Leimert Park Village by Crenshaw Boulevard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a very friendly, family-oriented atmosphere,\u201d said James Walt, a senior citizen who attended this year\u2019s festival. \u201cI think it would be great if somehow cities and towns could have more events where people can get together, be together and share together.\u201d\n\nThe scene at the Leimert Park Juneteenth Festival on June 19, 2023. (Photo by Mateo Gutierrez)\n\nBecoming a federal holiday in 2021, Juneteenth celebrates the anniversary of General Gordon Granger informing the last enslaved Americans in Galveston, Texas on June 19, 1865 that all slaves were free according to the Emancipation Proclamation. Although slaves were free more than two years before then, many slaves in the then-Confederate states were unaware their freedom had been granted until federal troops informed them.\n\n\u201cTo understand Juneteenth is to understand that we are arriving but there is still a lot of work to do. It\u2019s not just a federal holiday where we say, \u2018It\u2019s a good day for barbecue ribs,\u2019\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cIt\u2019s the understanding of the struggle and the strive that African Americans have had to walk for all these years.\u201d\n\nDespite the countless aspects of Black culture highlighted throughout Leimert Park, Fernandez said it was the amount of attendees that truly made her proud of the event and where its history has brought it.\n\n\u201cSeeing families of all race, color and creed here to absorb the historic understanding and foundation that was placed by a mistake that now we can glorify it,\u201d Fernandez said about her favorite part of the festival. \u201cTo see a day like this is pride and dignity.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, performers across several stages of the festival included Malachiii, Masego, Smino and Buddy. This year, Philadelphia\u2019s own Jazmine Sullivan was announced as the headliner, but did not end up performing due to safety issues involving crowd rushes. This year\u2019s festival had also booked major artists Wale and Kalan.Frfr. Additionally, large-scale sponsors such as Chase Bank and McDonald\u2019s supported the annual event.\n\nThe Hoopbus at the Leimert Park Juneteenth Festival on June 19, 2023.

On Sunday, Los Angeles Center Studios became the stage for the two year anniversary and Juneteenth celebration of Black On The Block. The event took place from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. and featured DJ sets and performances from TiaCorine and Phabo. On Monday, the Greek Theatre became the site of celebration as the event, \u201cJuneteenth: A Global Celebration for Freedom,\u201d unfolded at the outdoor amphitheater. This special event was organized by Live Nation Urban and Jesse Collins Entertainment, and broadcasted nationally by CNN. The electric evening event featured performances from musicians including Miguel, Nelly, SWV, Muni Long, Davido, Chloe Bailey and Coi Leray. Amongst the performances was a tribute to the late icon Tina Turner.\n\nLooking forward, more celebrations of Juneteenth are still on the horizon. The Black Market Flea will be returning to celebrate both Juneteenth and its two-year anniversary. The monthly event features a large array of Black-owned businesses, ranging from clothing businesses to food vendors sporting different cuisines with options for everybody. Known for its vibrancy and high energy, this monthly event is returning in full swing on Saturday in honor of its anniversary, and it\u2019s an event that you will not want to miss.\n```"}

One way to better support the LGBTQ+ community is by supporting LGBTQ+ creators. There are countless amazing LGBTQ+ authors to choose from, but here specifically are what I think are some of the best trans books written by trans authors.\n\nTrans authors demonstrate through these books the value of \u201cown voices\u201d representation \u2013 stories told by members of the group being represented. By telling their own stories, trans authors effectively combat negative representation in media and increase awareness of the trans community to readers. By supporting these authors, readers can learn more about the experiences and diversity of the trans community and to trans readers, they hopefully can take comfort in seeing their stories being told.\n\n\u201cThe Sunbearer Trials\u201d (2022) by Aiden Thomas\nContent Warnings: Death, human sacrifice, dysphoria\nRepresentation: Latino, transmasculine (transmasc), trans man, nonbinary, men loving men (mlm), deaf, Afro-Latino, trans man author\nFavorite Quote: \u201cYes, a single choice could end the world [...] And only one of you gets to make that choice. What does that say about the rest of your power?\u201d -Opci\u00f3n\n\n\u201cThe Sunbearer Trials\u201d is a young adult (YA) fantasy novel that combines \u201cPercy Jackson\u201d with \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d and has a trans man main character with an all-Latinx character list. The main character, Teo, is the demigod son of the bird goddess Quetzal in a world where the Jade gods, with his mother, are deemed less than the Gold gods. By extension, the children of these Jade gods are underestimated, so when Teo is chosen to compete in the deadly Sunbearer Trials, everyone is shocked. Rather than striving to win the honor of becoming the Sunbearer, Teo is more concerned with keeping himself and his friends out of last place to avoid being sacrificed to renew the sun stones that protect them. Teo\u2019s transness throughout the novel is not the focus but it is present. Teo had long undergone top surgery and begun taking testosterone, but experiences dysphoria around his wings that are colored as female birds are rather than the vibrant coloring of a male bird. Teo also befriends and mentors the young trans boy Xio, who competes in the Sunbearer Trials alongside him. It decenters the characters\u2019 transness in a way that portrays them as complete characters without erasing the significance of their identities.\n\n\u201cA Million Quiet Revolutions\u201d (2022) by Robin Gow\nContent Warnings: mentions of sexual abuse, homophobia, dysphoria\nRepresentation: Trans MCs, transmasc, trans for trans relationship (T4T), Puerto Rican, Jewish, nonbinary, nonbinary author\nFavorite Quote: \u201cI think how wildly beautiful it is to exist in spite of all the places the stories of men like you, like us, are left untold.\u201d -Oliver\n\n\u201cA Million Quiet Revolutions\u201d is a realistic fiction novel written in simple verse/letter format. It features a small cast of characters but follows two extremely loveable main characters (MCs), both of whom are trans boys in a relationship with each other. The novel opens with the moment that the two main characters choose their new names. They name themselves Aaron and Oliver after two Revolutionary War soldiers whom they believe were trans. Aaron is Puerto Rican and comes from a Catholic family, while Oliver is Jewish \u2014 identities that play into their very different family dynamics. They also have very different personalities and interests. Aaron is a creative who loves video games, comics and art, while Oliver is soft-spoken and obsessed with history. Each uses these interests to help them find their places in the world and navigate their identities. This book portrays a T4T relationship that is extremely uncommon in mainstream media. The characters explore their unique experiences with their transness as a couple where they are both valued and desired. For many trans audiences, this is a special dynamic that is close to home and underrepresented.\n\n\u201cI Wish You All the Best\u201d (2020) by Mason Deaver\nContent Warnings: transphobia, homophobia, panic attacks, anxiety disorder, dysphoria\nRepresentation: nonbinary MC, transfem, anxiety disorder, Black love interest, bisexual love interest, pansexual, Muslim, hijabi, nonbinary author\nFavorite Quote: \u201cIf you\u2019re queer, your life has the potential to become one long coming-out moment.\u201d -Ben\n\n\u201cI Wish You All the Best\u201d is a realistic YA novel that follows a nonbinary main character named Ben after they are suddenly kicked out of their parents house after coming out. Ben goes to live with their sister and her husband and starts a new school where they\u2019re not yet ready to be out. Nevertheless, Ben makes a small group of friends, including Nathan, a young man they may have a crush on, and finds solace through their art. Ben also gets support from their internet-famous friend Miriam, a nonbinary, pansexual hijabi who they meet in person for the first time after getting kicked out. Ben also begins therapy while living with their sister to address their anxiety. Through their many newfound sources of support, Ben begins to grow more confident in their identity and opens up to their loved ones. The book, although it delves into difficult subject matters at times, is a feel-good story surrounding a loveable main character that you truly root for. It portrays trans people as both worthy of love and desirable, making it great representation for a younger audience.\n\n\u201cHell Followed with Us\u201d (2022) by Andrew Joseph White\nContent Warnings: Death, gore, body horror, religious abuse, parental abuse, transphobia, dysphoria\nRep: Trans man MC, gay MC, nonbinary, autism, mlm, Latino, neopronouns, trans woman, Muslim minor character\nFavorite Quote: \u201cIt\u2019s harder for someone to pin you down as a girl when they need a moment to pin you down as human.\u201d -Benji\n\n\u201cHell Followed With Us\u201d is a dystopian YA horror novel following a young trans boy named Benji after he escapes a compound of an Evangelical cult that has unleashed a virus called the Flood on the world that transforms humans into monsters. This cult seeks to wipe the world clean of nonbelievers and intends to use Benji as their weapon to do so. After his escape, Benji finds refuge with a group of LGBTQ+ teenagers camped out in an old LGBTQ+ center. While attempting to conceal his origins, Benji and the rebel group work to resist the cult\u2019s control and protect each other. The book is dark and unapologetic in its representation and its criticism of organized religion. It is a large ensemble of young characters that show the wide range of diversity within the LGBTQ+ community and has no qualms with showing beaten-down kids taking their revenge on the people and institutions that have hurt them.\n\n\u201cNevada\u201d (2013) by Imogen Binnie\nContent Warnings: dysphoria, internalized transphobia, drug use, alcohol abuse, housing insecurity, LGBTQ slur, mild sexual content\nRep: Trans woman MC, trans man minor character, questioning, lesbian\nFavorite Quote: \u201cEventually you can\u2019t help but figure out that, while gender is a construct, so is a traffic light, and if you ignore either of them, you get hit by cars. Which, also, are constructs.\u201d -Maria\n\n\u201cNevada\u201d is an unconventional realistic fiction novel regarded as one of the cornerstones of trans literature. The first MC introduced, Maria, is a trans, punk lesbian who goes through a breakup and gets fired from her job in the same week, spurring a spontaneous road trip across the country where she meets the second MC, James H. Maria immediately clocks James, a young adult stoner working at Walmart, as questioning his gender and takes it upon herself to mentor him. James, who may or may not be trans, however, has come to his own conclusions about his identity that, no matter how harmful, are not so easily erased. Both characters are deeply flawed and nihilistic, though Maria simultaneously is a vessel for much social commentary throughout the book. Some of this commentary, however, features problematic sentiment around trans men and genderqueer people, making the authority this book has been granted concerning. Nevertheless, the book is an \u201cown voices\u201d story, providing raw and unfiltered representation of a flawed and extremely human trans woman. It also holds extremely significant historical and cultural value as an early example of trans storytelling.\n```"}

Professional wrestling is an ever-evolving sport filled with acrobats, never-before-seen athleticism, perfectly crafted characters with attitude and so much more. Each week, men and women lay their bodies on the line inside the ring for the audience\u2019s entertainment and bring their all on the mic to invoke emotions into the audience\u2019s hearts. New storylines are crafted within minutes, fan reactions can change how a wrestler acts in front of a live crowd and an injury can end a career that could have gone down in history. Each week, fans tune into the sports entertainment spectacle with WWE at the helm. All Elite Wrestling (AEW), New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) and Impact Wrestling are all big hitters as well and attract large audiences. The unexpected thrill of waiting for the winner of each match is like the adrenaline rush one gets right before the big drop at the top of a roller coaster. There\u2019s truly nothing like it. Not everyone can be a John Cena or The Rock, the type that transcends professional wrestling and enters into popular culture forever, but these wrestlers can surely try their best each week to make it to that level.\n\nHere are the top pro wrestling matches from the past week.\n\nCM Punk and FTR vs. Samoa Joe and Bullet Club Gold (AEW Collision, June 17)\nIn AEW\u2019s newest weekly show, AEW Collision, CM Punk made his return to wrestling in over nine months. This return had an incredible amount of buzz surrounding it, and Punk did not disappoint. He brought out all the stops, from his Macho Man Randy Savage-inspired elbow drop from the top rope to his running high knee to the corner. His chemistry with Samoa Joe was something out of a movie as well, which is fitting, considering they both started on similar paths on the independent wrestling scene. FTR also delivered agility-filled performances against Juice and Jay White (Bullet Club Gold), which helped keep the audience\u2019s eye not only on the middle of the ring, but also on what was going on outside of it. Punk hit his \u201cgo to sleep\u201d finisher to pick up the victory for his team.\n\nSami Zayn and Kevin Owens vs. Gunther and Ludwig Kaiser (WWE Monday Night Raw, June 12)\nSami Zayn and Kevin Owens are two of the most gifted wrestlers on WWE\u2019s roster.

Zayn\u2019s quick reversals against Kaiser showed his speed and veteran status, while Owens vs. Gunther was like watching two technically sound, but still powerful behemoths going at it. While both Owens and Gunther are over 260 pounds, it doesn\u2019t show in their performance, as their speed matches their strength in every aspect. From Owens\u2019 superkick, cannonball and swanton bomb alone, one wouldn\u2019t be able to turn their eyes away from the match. Zayn picked up the victory for his team after nailing the blue thunder bomb against Kaiser, while Owens hit Gunther with a DDT move outside the ring.\n\nSkye Blue vs. Toni Storm (AEW Dynamite, June 14)\nFrom nailing hurricanranas to running knees, Skye Blue showcased a flurry of killer offense against Toni Storm that was quite impressive for a wrestler who only signed with the company in April. Even with the can of spray paint thrown into the ring that was supposed to be sprayed on Blue by Storm and with Ruby Soho outside the ring trying to distract Blue, Blue was able to hit her finisher as well. Still, Storm\u2019s almost-perfect Texas Cloverleaf submission hold was too much for Blue after the damage she had already sustained.\n\nMoose vs. Rich Swann (Impact, June 15)\nThe tale is as old as time: a little man versus a big man \u2014in this case, however, a cruiserweight (Swann) versus a heavyweight (Moose). The chemistry in this match was undeniable. The much quicker Swann was landing high-risk moves like dropkicks from the top rope until his momentum shifted. Swann\u2019s dive toward Moose outside the ring ended with a Moose reversal, two powerbombs and Swann being thrown into the metal barricades at ringside. Once back inside the ring, there was a lot of back and forth, but Moose got the upper hand after some chops to Swann\u2019s chest and a superplex from the top ropes onto the mat. In the closing moments, Swann was able to counter Moose\u2019s finisher for the quick rollup pin and victory.\n\nFrom Punk\u2019s triumphant return to a David and Goliath matchup with the likes of Swann and Moose, last week\u2019s wrestling matchups were stacked. Let\u2019s see if next week continues this momentum, as several pro wrestling promotions have pay-per-view events coming up soon.\n```"}

(Photo by Myriam Alcala)\n\nBy Myriam Alcala June 20, 2023 at 11:49 am PDT\n\nNot too far away from the sunny campus of USC lies the vast Mile High City where history was made June 12 as the Denver Nuggets beat the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals at Ball Arena. As a Colorado native, there is something special about being a Nuggets fan, something even distance can\u2019t change.\n\n\u201cYou grow up being a Nuggets fan,\u201d said Karina Chavez Saucedo, a senior global health major who grew up in Longmont, a suburb of Boulder, Colorado. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been a fan since I was born.\u201d\n\nUSC Trojans come from all over the world to study in Los Angeles, some experiencing homesickness because it\u2019s their first time away from home. The question then becomes, how do you keep home close when it\u2019s so far away?\n\n\u201cTwitter,\u201d Chavez Saucedo said. As she studied abroad during the spring semester, Chavez Saucedo followed the basketball season through live updates and video highlight games. \u201cIt was hard because of the time difference. If you wanted to watch a game, it\u2019d be like four in the morning,\u201d Chavez Saucedo said.\n\nNonetheless, the Nuggets spirit prevailed. Sports is one of those things that brings people together and creates a sense of community within the home team but also nationally as Chavez Saucedo mentioned, one of the best parts of sports: rivalry.\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite memories was sweeping the Lakers because of the Colorado-California [rivalry],\u201d Chavez Saucedo said.\n\nOther USC Nuggets fans took a more traditional route in staying up to date with the sport. Andres Quintanar, a longtime Nuggets fan and junior neuroscience and data science major, watched the season from his apartment back at school.\n\n\u201cMy roommates probably hated me because I was the only Nuggets fan,\u201d Quintanar said. Quintanar, who grew up in Denver, has been a Nuggets fan all his life. \u201cI remember when Carmelo Anthony got drafted ... [it was] what really made me fall in love with the sport.\u201d\n\nQuintanar also played with Anthony at a camp program in Colorado when he was younger. \u201cI got to play basketball with them and I got to meet my idol, my favorite basketball player to this day,\u201d Quintanar said.\n\nFor fellow Trojans, there were an array of opportunities to be a part of the NBA Finals in the city of Denver. For non-home games, the Ball Arena as well as other notable locations in downtown hosted watch parties, including the infamous sweep of the L.A. Lakers. By the time the NBA Finals came around, there was nowhere left to watch the game.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t even play in the arena and it was sold out, even nosebleeds,\u201d Quintanar said. And when the Nuggets won at home in Game 5, the town erupted.\n\n\u201cWhen we actually won, I watched that with my friends out in Denver,\u201d Chavez Saucedo said. \u201cAfter we all rushed to the streets. The energy was just insane.\u201d\n\nAnd as the team made their way down 17th Street to the Capitol building for the official victory parade, the team was met with a sea of blue and yellow. It might not have been the gold and red that Trojans are used to, but for Nuggets fans who are also Trojans, this was a victory all around.\n\nThe Nuggets winning the final serves as a reminder that Trojans are from everywhere and how sports, like the NBA, can be a unifying tool or lifeline for students studying at USC.\n```"}

The Expo, or E line, which runs from downtown L.A. to Santa Monica and has two stops adjacent to USC, will be expanding into East L.A. and adding three new stops. The stops downtown are Little Tokyo/Arts District, Historic Broadway and Grand Avenue Arts/Bunker Hill. While the Metro is useful for hitting the beach or venturing downtown, the E line\u2019s easternmost stop was previously 7th Street/Metro Center. This meant that for students, most of downtown L.A. was inaccessible on public transportation without having to transfer onto another train line or bus. Now, many of downtown\u2019s famous landmarks, shopping centers and restaurants are a short ride away from USC.\n\nHere are some of the attractions less than a 10 minute walk away from the new Metro stops:\nHistoric Broadway : Grand Central Market, The Last Bookstore and Broadway Theater District\nGrand Avenue Arts/Bunker Hill : The Broad, Angels Flight, Walt Disney Concert Hall and The Museum of Contemporary Art\nLittle Tokyo/Arts District : Japanese Village Plaza, the Japanese American National Museum and the Arts District\u2019s many art galleries and trendy restaurants.\n\nThe E line originally opened in 2012 and connected downtown L.A. to Culver City. In 2016, it was expanded to connect Culver City to Santa Monica. This project, called the Regional Connector Transit project, began construction in 2014 and has cost $1.4 billion in funding. It was originally slated to open in 2020, but was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic and construction difficulties. To accommodate this change, the L line is being absorbed into the E line and the A line. The L line previously connected East L.A. to the San Gabriel Valley. Now, the A line will stretch from Long Beach to Azusa in the San Gabriel Valley while the E line goes from Santa Monica to East L.A. The color of the E line will also change from blue to gold.\n\nTo celebrate the opening, all Metro systems will be free from 3 a.m. Friday to 3 a.m. Monday.\n```"}

Jokic, looking seemingly confused, asked when the parade would be. The reporter followed up with, \u201cThursday.\u201d Immediately, Jokic responded with, \u201cNo. I need to go home.\u201d Luckily for Jokic, it is time to go home for him, but this time he\u2019ll be returning to Serbia as a NBA Champion, Finals MVP, Nuggets legend and an all-time great in the history of basketball.\n\nThe 2022-2023 Denver Nuggets didn\u2019t just win the franchise\u2019s first NBA title, but did so in dominating fashion all season long. After claiming the best regular-season record in the Western Conference, the Nuggets went on to lose only four games in their championship-winning playoff run. Jamal Murray and Jokic made a strong case for the title of the NBA\u2019s best duo in their incredible postseason, both averaging at least 25 points, seven assists and five rebounds per game while utilizing a nearly unstoppable pick-and-roll game. Denver\u2019s role players also took turns stepping up when it mattered, switching off dominant offensive games, but anchoring a tough defense all playoffs.\n\nFor Miami, it\u2019s another close year to a title that ultimately fell short. While the No. 8-seeded Heat had an underdog playoff run for the ages, they were unable to find efficient offensive production from their role players and had a really tough time containing the Jokic-Murray two-man game. Heading into the offseason, the Heat will have a lot to think about when it comes to reshaping their roster.\n\nGoing into this year\u2019s NBA Finals, many believed this matchup wouldn\u2019t be interesting to watch and that the Nuggets would make easy work of the Heat. Now, the Nuggets did win this series in five games, but anyone who watched the Finals could tell you that it wasn\u2019t as easy as it looked, and each game had its moments of electricity.\n\nHere are my three biggest takeaways from these NBA Finals:\n\nNikola Jokic had an all-time great playoff run\nEveryone knew Jokic would be the difference maker and the Finals MVP if the Nuggets were able to win the series. What most people didn\u2019t expect, however, was that Jokic would have an out-of-this-world Finals run that caps off a historic postseason. Who would have thought that a Serbian center drafted in the second round during a Taco Bell commercial would become the first player in NBA history to lead all players in points, rebounds and assists in a single postseason? Averaging 30 points, 13.5 rebounds and 9.5 assists per game on nearly 55% shooting, Jokic broke too many records and joined too many lists of NBA legends this postseason for me to name them all.\n\nAside from all the crazy statistical records, Jokic\u2019s impact in the playoffs stretched further than his individual accomplishments. Watch any Nuggets game from this postseason, and it\u2019ll be easy to recognize how important Jokic is to orchestrating the Denver offense \u2014 not by just dominating the paint, but getting his teammates involved and making them better. Defenses swarmed around him. Opposing coaches drew up specific gameplans just to limit his presence. Jokic was quite literally The Joker, terrorizing the rest of the NBA like it was Gotham City, with no Batman to save them. His playoff run is even more impressive when you list all the players he left in his decimation: Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, Karl Anthony-Towns, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler. Nikola Jokic, take a bow. Your postseason run will forever be enriched in NBA history.\n\nThe Heat couldn\u2019t find their offense ... even when it was on the bench\nThe Heat\u2019s unbelievable postseason run wasn\u2019t highlighted by \u201cPlayoff Jimmy Butler,\u201d but rather their ensemble of undrafted role players that stepped up in huge moments and became game-changers with their scoring outbursts. What worked for Miami all postseason, however, then became dormant in the Finals. The Heat\u2019s role players struggled shooting, leading Miami to only score more than 100 points once in five games. When Miami was desperately looking for an offensive spark, they received the lucky news that Tyler Herro, their third-leading scorer in the regular season and former Sixth Man of the Year, was available for Game 5 after being injured the entire postseason. Herro seemed to be the hero that Miami needed for the Finals, but Heat coach Erik Spoelstra apparently thought the offense was good as it was and didn\u2019t play Herro for a single second. Miami went on to score 89 points in the loss, the least amount of points it has scored all playoffs.\n\nLike many out there, I have a strong opinion on Spoelstra\u2019s choice to not play Herro, but I believe Miami\u2019s performance in the Finals does open lots of discussions on how it can reshape its roster for a more successful season. Their undrafted ensemble showcased their superb talent this playoffs, but the Heat will probably use some of them as trade bait to potentially acquire another star along with Butler and Adebayo. As impressive as the undrafted role players were, the Heat need more offensive consistency to compete for a title. But, it was good while it lasted. NBA fans should thank the Heat for a truly entertaining playoff run.\n\nBeware NBA, the Nuggets aren\u2019t going anywhere\nDuring the Larry O\u2019Brien Championship trophy ceremony, Nuggets coach Mike Malone took the microphone and said the following statement that probably gave the rest of the NBA goosebumps: \u201cBut I got news for everyone out there. We\u2019re not satisfied that we won. We want more! We want more!\u201d Every NBA team immediately wants more titles after they win one, but the Nuggets are serious contenders to repeat their success for years to come.\n\nNikola Jokic is 28. Murray is 26. Aaron Gordon is 27. Michael Porter Jr. is 24. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is 30. Christian Braun is 22. All still in prime years, but the best part about the Nuggets\u2019 starting lineup and young rookie off the bench? All are still under contract for next year. The Nuggets are looking at a potential dynasty; they may be even better next season than this last one. Jokic and Murray continue to be stars in this league. Gordon and Porter Jr. are still developing their offensive games. Caldwell-Pope keeps shooting well, and Braun is entering only his second year after making a large impact in the NBA Finals. With several other role players\u2019 contracts to figure out, the Nuggets could be at the beginning of the NBA\u2019s next dynasty, and they are only getting better. The rest of the NBA has been put on notice. The Nuggets are the team to beat going forward.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/06/13/the-ncaa-is-broken-meet-the-people-trying-to-fix-it/", "response": "```\nThe NCAA is broken. Meet the people trying to fix it.\n\nThe Future of College Athletics summit highlighted needed reforms.\n\nBy Yoav Gillath\nJune 13, 2023 at 11:28 am PDT\n\nOn a smoky day in the nation\u2019s capital, scores of college athletics\u2019 top minds converged not far from the White House at a first-of-its-kind conference. Hosted by the University of Arizona on June 8th, the Future of College Athletics summit attracted journalists, conference commissioners and student-athletes. ESPN\u2019s Paul Finebaum kicked off the festivities with a joke about Arizona joining the Big 12 that drew some nervous laughs from around the room.\n\n\u201cNext time someone asks what\u2019s wrong with basketball, football...\u201d Finebaum continued, \u201cI can tell them I went to Washington and heard the solutions.\u201d After finishing a short monologue, Finebaum introduced the first panel of the day, headlined by NCAA President Charlie Baker.\n\nThe head of college athletics\u2019 governing body started off by addressing the elephant in the room: Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) policy. Baker expressed regret that the NCAA seemingly missed its opportunity to make a framework for NIL deals when it had the chance. He argued Congress should now be responsible for fixing a system no one is happy about by legislating three key reforms. Baker called for a registry for NIL deals that would increase transparency, a certification process for agents and a uniform standard contract agreement to protect student-athletes.\n\nFrom that point on, it was clear Baker had set out his talking points on NIL and did not intend to budge on them. Pushback soon came from CEO Amy Privette Perko of the Knight Commission, a student-athlete rights organization that often finds itself at odds with the NCAA. She called on Baker to fight for more equitable revenue-sharing in athletics.\n\nThe College Football Playoff (CFP) will soon make 2 billion dollars a year, Perko said, and yet the NCAA does not receive any of its profits to distribute to its member programs. The money flows directly to schools, where it goes disproportionately to coaches\u2019 salaries. Today, nine schools spend more money on 11 football coaches than all of their players combined, and Perko claimed that number is projected to balloon to 21 schools in the next few years.\n\nBaker, who has just passed his 100th day on the job, responded to Perko by maintaining the NCAA can\u2019t do everything all at once. He wants the NCAA to focus on regulating sports betting and moving towards gender equity with NIL revenues first, before handling issues like the CFP later.\n\nIn the current legal environment for NIL, states operate under a patchwork of laws that incentivize a legislative \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d Schools lobby states to give them a competitive recruiting advantage, and other schools respond in turn. In California, the College Athlete Protection Act would require college sports teams to provide a share of their revenue directly to their athletes. President Baker believes it would be catastrophic for athletics in the state, wiping out all programs in Division III, most in Division II and some in Division I.\n\nA lack of federal regulation has also led to a skewed economic landscape for female college athletes. Representatives from NIL collectives around the country estimated around 95% of their funds go towards male athletes, as their separation from universities allows them to dodge Title IX requirements. Walker Jones, Executive Director of the Ole Miss-affiliated collective The Grove, said organizations like his need regulation to fix this inequity. He added that student-athletes are generally better off under NIL than they were before, disagreeing with President Baker\u2019s read of the terrain.\n\nThe average Division I football player receives 18k, the average starter gets 40k, and the average Power 5 basketball starter pulls in 70k. Jones added that despite being called Name, Image and Likeness deals, he estimates that around 90% of the funding they disburse to athletes comes directly from donors.\n\nCoaches haven\u2019t been shy about voicing their complaints with this new normal. Arizona football head coach Jedd Fisch spoke on an afternoon panel alongside former USC quarterback JT Daniels. Fisch worries about well-endowed programs drowning out teams like his in recruiting by outbidding them for the top-rated recruits. He proposed a number of reforms to stop this scenario, including a cap on spending and a two-year minimum stay requirement for players committed to play for a university.\n\nWhile those reforms are unlikely to come to pass, everyone at the summit agreed on one thing: there has to be change. As Perko put it, these are the dog years of college sports, with 14 years of change crammed into the last two years. If the NCAA can\u2019t keep up, it\u2019s past time for someone who can to step in.\n```"}

This $38 million renovation of Soni McAlister Field, where the Trojans\u2019 soccer and lacrosse squads currently play, recently received a $10 million gift from the Fritz B. Burns Foundation. Construction on the new stadium is set to begin by the end of this year, according to Folt.\n\n\u201cRawlinson Stadium will be the place for the Women of Troy to dazzle us with their athletic prowess even more,\u201d  Folt said in a video released by USC Athletics, which featured images of the project . \u201cUSC\u2019s commitment to women\u2019s sports is stronger than ever.\u201d\n\nMcAlister Field was built in 1998 to be the home of USC women\u2019s soccer, and it has also housed the university\u2019s women\u2019s lacrosse program since its inception in 2012. The new stadium will increase the spectator capacity by about two and a half times, from the about 1,000-person accommodation of McAlister Field, to seating for around 2,500 people at the new Rawlinson Stadium. The new stadium will also feature viewing decks, social spaces, a press box, a box office and concession stands, upgrading from the current, cramped bleacher setup of McAlister Field along West 30th Street.\n\nThe project includes plans for new, dedicated locker rooms for the soccer and lacrosse teams, as well as an LED video board and field lights. Both the USC women\u2019s soccer and lacrosse programs have enjoyed plenty of success in recent years. The Trojans won national titles in soccer in 2007 and 2016, and the women\u2019s lacrosse squad is coming off of its fifth conference regular season-championship since 2016, in addition to its second Pac-12 Tournament title.\n\nWith USC\u2019s upcoming move to the Big Ten in 2024, the new stadium will welcome spectators from across the country for fresh conference matchups. Rawlinson Stadium is named afterJoseph Rawlinson, a well-known philanthropist in Los Angeles. His son, Rex Rawlinson, is a graduate of USC and runs the aforementioned Burns Foundation. The charity was founded by another local philanthropist, Fritz B. Burns, which donated the lead naming gift for the stadium to the university.\n\nThis announcement by Folt comes soon after the university renamed its track facility after alumna and Olympian Allyson Felix, in part to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Title IX. Some of the Trojans\u2019 coaches and student-athletes expressed their excitement for the project, including women\u2019s lacrosse head coach Lindsey Munday and rising junior forward Simone Jackson of the women\u2019s soccer team.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely grateful for the support from the athletics department to ensure that our players have a state-of-the-art facility to train and compete in,\u201d Munday said. \u201cI am beyond proud to be a part of this time, and I hope to inspire many more girls when my team plays on a field made just for the Women of Troy,\u201d Jackson said.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nBy Mateo Gutierrez June 12, 2023 at 11:04 am PDT\n\nTeams that have taken a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals have gone on to win 35 out of the previous 36 times. In NBA history, only one team has ever won the Finals after going down in such a deficit: the 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers led by Lebron James. Now, what can similarly be said about that Cavaliers team and this Miami Heat team? They both love to defy the odds.\n\nThe Miami Heat have surprised almost everyone in its playoff run this year. Beating the No. 1-seeded Bucks in five games and winning a seven-game series against the No. 2-seeded Celtics in Boston, the Heat have demonstrated they are a fierce, competitive and gritty team that will claw their way to victory and shock the world. So, being down 3-1 in the NBA Finals, can the Heat make a historic comeback like the Cavaliers? As much as I would love to believe the Heat are capable of winning, that Cavaliers team had Lebron James, and the Nuggets have been playing some of the most exceptional basketball I\u2019ve seen all year. So ... probably not.\n\nGame 4 on Friday night was yet another example of Denver making the correct adjustments and receiving much-needed offense from their role players \u2014 qualities of a true championship team. Struggling with causing turnovers and hitting threes in Game 3, the Nuggets flipped the script around, winning the turnover battle 15 to eight and draining 14 threes on 50% shooting. Aaron Gordon and Bruce Brown also deserve their rounds of applause. The pair combined for an explosive 48 points in a game where Nikola Jokic fell into foul trouble early in the fourth quarter and Jamal Murray struggled shooting. Gordon led all scorers with 27 points along with seven rebounds, six assists and a wildly impressive plus-minus of +29.\n\nThe Heat had no answer for Denver\u2019s adjustments. Even when they were able to slow down Jokic and Murray, the Heat had trouble making threes and taking care of the ball on offense. Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo continued to carry the load offensively with at least 20 points each, and while four Heat role players were able to get into double-digit scoring, Miami still lacked a true offensive spark on Friday.\n\nAfter some speculation earlier in the playoffs, it\u2019s clear now that the Heat could really use Tyler Herro back. Averaging 20 points per game before his injury, Herro would hands down provide the scoring spark that the Heat are missing from players not named Jimmy or Bam. Interestingly enough, however, Herro was initially listed as inactive for Game 5 but received an upgrade to questionable Monday morning and is now expected to suit up for the Heat. If Herro can play like his regular self in Game 5, the Heat may have a hero.\n\nDoes Miami have what it takes to save their season? Won\u2019t lie, it looks really bleak for the Heat faithful, but anything is possible with this team, and they\u2019re no strangers to road victories. Here\u2019s what the Heat have to do to have a chance Monday:\n\nAttack the paint early and get Denver into foul trouble Adebayo finally seemed much more aggressive in the paint on Friday, attacking Jokic more often and drawing contact. While Adebayo could be better at actually making layups or turnaround floaters, he did his job putting Jokic in foul trouble, as Jokic got his fifth foul with nine minutes left in the game. Murray was able to orchestrate a strong offense in Jokic\u2019s absence that kept Denver\u2019s lead in the fourth, but for Miami, that is something you 100% live with and a situation you want to happen again. The Heat need to continue to draw contact down low and get the Nuggets into foul trouble early.\n\nOther than targeting Jokic on defense, the Heat should also take advantage of Murray\u2019s size and draw more isolations on him with Butler. The Nuggets will try to send more help on defense, which should leave more Heat shooters open for much-needed threes. The Heat also have to put the game into the hands of Denver\u2019s role players. They tore it up Friday night, but the Heat should test them again on Monday and see if they can rise up to the occasion yet again.\n\nTurnovers, turnovers, turnovers. It\u2019s pretty easy to summarize. If you turn the ball over a lot, you will probably not win. Additionally, if you don\u2019t generate turnovers, you will also probably not win. The Heat did both Friday night, and, as expected, they did not win. The Nuggets not only caused 15 Heat turnovers, but did a fantastic job taking care of the ball by only allowing two steals while generating 11 of their own. The Heat need to be more aggressive on defense and get out more in transition. Even with the turnover and steal difference, the Heat scored 14 fast break points to the Nuggets\u2019 12. Miami does a great job of capitalizing on the break, so they must snag steals on defense to get to that position more often.\n\nThe Nuggets are in really good shape to close the series at home Monday. Role players are stepping up, Jokic and Murray continue to dominate and it\u2019s hard to find a flaw in their performance the past two games. Here\u2019s how the Nuggets can assure a party tonight in Denver:\n\nIsolations on smaller Heat defenders When it comes to size, the Nuggets have a much bigger advantage (no pun intended) and have done a great job using it so far this series. Denver must continue isolating the smaller and skinnier Heat defenders on offense, and like the Heat should do, back them down in the post and generate more contact. Once Miami begins to double-team more, the Nuggets must be vigilant and find the open man early to get uncontested shots off. If they can shoot the same way they did Friday, then Denver should have no issue.\n\nDon\u2019t let Miami shooters get hot At this point, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that the Miami Heat\u2019s success relies on if an undrafted role player can score 20 or more points on 50% shooting or better. I believe the Nuggets share a similar opinion, so they cannot let any of them pop off Monday. Miami\u2019s shooters have struggled these past two games, but if anything, it\u2019s more of a sign that one of them is bound for a big game. If that is so, Denver has to adjust quickly and focus more defensive pressure on the hot hand. The return of Tyler Herro will also generate more defensive attention, so the Nuggets must be locked in all game. Denver can\u2019t afford another undrafted explosion, or this series will get real interesting.\n\nPrediction: No better story than an underdog and this Miami team embodies it to the core. Denver struggles from three and foul trouble while Miami shoots lights out and grinds its way to another road victory. Miami wins 107-102.\n```"}

(Photo by Skye Lee)\n\nBy Skye Lee\nJune 09, 2023 at 9:08 pm PDT\n\nIt was 4 a.m. in Echo Park. Ryan Lagasse, the founder and operator of The Little Lamb Coffee + Clay mobile shop, was waiting for her delivery man to bring her pastries for her food truck. He would knock on her door, hand over the pastry boxes and wish her a good day. Then, he would turn around and close the door behind him. But this time it was different. He knew the door code to Lagasse\u2019s building. He knew that she lives alone. The first time he tried to converse with Lagasse for longer, he commented that her \u201cbody was beautiful\u201d and asked if she was a runner. In her robe, Lagasse was caught off guard by the comment, but she dismissed it. She gave him the benefit of the doubt that he was just being friendly, so she tried not to think much more into it.\n\nThe following day, Lagasse grabbed the pastry boxes and turned away, but something seemed different from the normal routine. She never heard the door close. When she looked behind, she was startled to see that he was peeking through a crack in the door he had left. Since the incident occurred, Lagasse installed a video doorbell camera so she no longer has to face the fear of answering the door.\n\nBut this type of misogynistic behavior is what perpetuates the gender inequality gap that often occurs at top positions in the food industry. Despite women traditionally being the household\u2019s head chef, their title does not extend beyond the home kitchen in contemporary society. In a 2022 Industry Insights report by Lunchbox, women make up nearly half of the workforce in the restaurant and food service industry, but only 20% of head chefs identify as female, while 77% identify as male.\n\nLola Olivares, owner of Lola\u2019s Tacos, said, \u201cTraditionally, women are always in the kitchen. So why is it shocking that a woman is good [at her food business]? Because there\u2019s always a taco man? ... But never a taco woman?\u201d This was made clear to Olivares when a male customer assumed that one of Olivares\u2019 male employees, Ryan, was the owner instead of her. But even when Ryan pointed to Olivares as the owner, Olivares explained, \u201c[The customer] looks at me. He goes, \u2018Huh? Does she know what she\u2019s doing?\u2019\u201d\n\nThough many women are starting to become business owners in the food industry, gender discrimination still persists. According to a research summary by Zippia, nearly half of the people attending the Culinary Institute of America in 2021 were female. But women like Elvia Huerta still faced disrespect from her male counterparts, despite getting a degree from culinary school and being the lead cook when she worked at the UCLA dining hall kitchens.\n\n\u201cI felt the difference,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThe pay was different. The opportunities didn\u2019t come as easy for me as it did for my colleagues, who were males. When it came to certain responsibilities and jobs, the male colleagues would be the ones who would get first dibs on it.\u201d\n\nIn an article by Forbes Advisor, the male median salary was $34,476, while women\u2019s was just $31,096. This meant that men received 11% more money than women in the food preparation and serving industry. In addition, Huerta regularly faced sexist remarks from her manager and male colleagues. She eventually decided to quit when her manager told her that because she\u2019s a woman, she should vacuum and wipe the tables while her male coworker finishes her job in the kitchen.\n\n\u201cI walked away. I went home, and then the next day, that\u2019s when I put in my resignation. That was my breaking point,\u201d Huerta said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s still a lot of machismo. There\u2019s still a lot of men that [think] \u2018women [should be] in the kitchen, but [they] can\u2019t run a business,\u201d Olivares said.\n\nThe struggles of prejudice and sexual harassment against women are a common occurrence and should come as no surprise. Nonetheless, the women who have faced uncomfortable situations in the industry have highlighted the importance of speaking up.\n\n\u201cUse your voice and stand up for yourself. ... Do not give [the haters] your energy, but learn how to speak up,\u201d Olivares said. \u201cIf men don\u2019t have accountability, they\u2019re not going to care enough to change on their own,\u201d Lagasse said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to keep in their same pattern of what\u2019s comfortable. ... But there needs to be consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I would have been angrier and really made a scene during that time,\u201d Huerta said. Despite Huerta\u2019s regret, she reported a separate misogynistic incident to management. Lagasse reported what the delivery man did to her at the bakery. And Olivares has made it apparent to male customers that she will not get pushed around.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve let [men] get away with it. ... [that] they don\u2019t even know when they\u2019re making a woman uncomfortable anymore. So call men out. Women, stop saying sorry [when] you know, you\u2019re not doing anything wrong,\u201d Lagasse advocates.\n\nWhile women can do their best to speak up, there are still systemic gender inequities in the food industry that must be addressed. In this present day, it\u2019s unacceptable to confine women solely to certain domestic duties only when it\u2019s convenient for men. Instead, we must normalize seeing women not only excelling in their culinary skills but also in their professional pursuits within and beyond the food industry.\n```"}

Plant medicine helped him heal.\n\nIan McCall is a former professional Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter who suffered from symptoms of traumatic brain injuries. After retirement, McCall experienced confusion, anger issues, depression, addiction and suicidal ideation. He tried brain stimulation therapy, but that did not work. So, he turned to a less traditional form of therapy: psilocybin mushrooms.\n\n\u201cI am a very loving, happy person, and I wasn\u2019t for a large portion of my life. Because I was just tortured. I was tortured, and then I was confused, and I was addicted, and I was just crazy for a long time,\u201d McCall said.\n\nPsilocybin mushrooms, also known as magic mushrooms or shrooms, are naturally occurring psychedelics that can affect all senses. They can alter a person\u2019s way of thinking and can cause hallucinations.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing to know is that if you take psilocybin or LSD, they\u2019re incredibly safe from a physiological standpoint. You can\u2019t really overdose on them,\u201d Dr. Daniel F. Kelly, a practicing neurosurgeon in Santa Monica said. \u201cThey don\u2019t create an addictive behavior like say opiates or alcohol do or nicotine. And in fact, as you probably know, they\u2019re used to break addiction.\u201d\n\nAthletes in high-impact sports such as football, hockey and mixed martial arts are at high risk of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). At least  320  former NFL players have been diagnosed with CTE and MMA fighters suffer from a TBI in about  one third  of UFC fights.\n\n\u201cIt is estimated that between 1.6 and 3.8 million sports-related TBIs occur annually, and sport-related head injuries make up 20% of TBI cases in the United States each year,\u201d according to the  National Center for Biotechnology Information , U.S. National Library of Medicine.\n\nIf one endures repeated TBIs they are at higher risk of CTE, a fatal brain disease. As of now, there is no cure, so many athletes who endure brain trauma suffer from symptoms similar to McCall\u2019s for the rest of their lives.\n\nMcCall says a friend gave him psilocybin mushrooms because the friend knew McCall was thinking about suicide every day. Shortly after, McCall met with Shane Norte, a Native American spiritual healer, who he met through Instagram. Norte founded Church of the People for Creator and Mother Earth at the La Jolla Indian Reservation in San Diego County. It\u2019s a place where he leads psychedelic ceremonies.\n\n\u201cI had my first shamanistic experience in his little Wamkish. It\u2019s a teepee sort of thing with no top.\u201d McCall said.\n\nPeople gather in the Wamkish, and Norte helps them heal with psychedelics. He begins by giving everyone a Wamkish dose of mushrooms which is about 15 grams. A normal high dose is only about four grams, according to Dr. Kelly.\n\n\u201cAs you go through the process, you start to talk about your intentions and you know, obviously why you\u2019re there,\u201d McCall said. \u201cA lot of hardened men talking about their traumas, talking about their issues, veterans, athletes, but it\u2019s an incredible place to heal.\u201d\n\nAbout nine hours later, everyone helps build a sweat lodge, and they sweat together for about 60 to 90 minutes.\n\n\u201cWhen you come into the Wamkish and you take earth-based sacraments, they can cause your mind to go to a lot of places. So, it\u2019s good to have that mental fortitude and that mental toughness and that mental endurance that the sweat can help people build with. Because I always tell people that the things that we endure here, you know, life is a lot harder than just sitting here taking some heat,\u201d Norte said.\n\nAccording to Norte, psychedelic ceremonies help people reconnect.\n\n\u201cI think the reason why we\u2019re in the mess as human beings is the lack of connectivity to the earth and to the creator or whatever people want to call it,\u201d Norte said.\n\nMcCall says his psychedelic experience helped him heal, but microdosing or taking no more than half a gram of psilocybin mushrooms daily is what really turned his life around.\n\n\u201cJust the fact of waking up every morning and looking in the mirror, the first thing I did was I wasn\u2019t going to sit in bed and think about killing myself anymore. I got up and I looked in the mirror and I laughed, and I smiled,\u201d McCall said.\n\nThis form of healing is not accessible to all. Psychedelics, including psilocybin mushrooms, are federally illegal under the controlled substance act of 1978. Critics fear that people will abuse the drugs for recreational use. Norte\u2019s ceremonies are protected by the American Indian Religious Freedom Act. States like Oregon and Colorado have chosen to  legalize psychedelics . In California, psilocybin is not a crime in Arcata, San Francisco, Oakland and Santa Cruz.\n\nThe American Medical Association said in a  report  that it does not support the use of psychedelics because, \u201cto change the schedule of these drugs before medical use is established is pre-mature and dangerous.\u201d\n\nDr. Kelly explained how psychedelics work in the brain.\n\n\u201cThe effects of psilocybin and LSD turn down the gating and they let all of this sensory stuff flow up into your cortex and all these different parts of your brain that don\u2019t normally communicate, communicate. And this is probably part of the therapeutic basis. By shutting down the default mode network or your ego, you are allowed to have these sorts of epiphanies. And this new interconnectedness helps people come up with a different shift in their perspective,\u201d Dr. Kelly said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really the essence of the healing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s most likely what happened during McCall\u2019s healing journey with psychedelics. Now, he uses his past struggles to help others. He is a psychedelic integration coach for high-level athletes and performers. He also coaches Muay Thai and jiu jitsu to both children and adults. McCall also finds happiness in spending time with his 11-year-old daughter. Every morning, he practices meditation and breathwork. He works out daily and tries to make the most out of every day.\n\nMcCall\u2019s message to people dealing with mental health issues is that they too can heal.\n\n\u201cIf I can do it, anyone can do it.\u201d McCall said. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science. We can all get it done.\u201d\n```"}

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nBy Mateo Gutierrez June 09, 2023 at 9:48 am PDT\n\nKobe and Shaq. Lebron and Wade. Jordan and Pippen. All three are historically great duos in the NBA, especially when it comes to playoff success. None of these duos, however, have ever had both players record a 30-point triple-double in the same game. In fact, no duo in the history of the NBA had ever accomplished that in both the regular season and playoffs ... until Wednesday. Denver\u2019s Batman and Robin \u2014 Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray \u2014 made history Wednesday night in a dominant 15-point road victory in Miami to go up 2-1 in the Finals. The lethal duo combined for 66 points, 31 rebounds and 20 assists in what Nuggets coach Mike Malone deemed \u201ctheir greatest performance as a duo in their seven years together.\u201d\n\nThe pair ran pick and roll after pick and roll, which the Heat couldn\u2019t seem to stop all game. Try to go over the screen? Murray simply beats Jimmy Butler with speed and it becomes him and Jokic vs. Bam Adebayo. Switch on the pick? Jokic simply calls for the ball in the post and makes easy work of Butler. Go under the screen? Murray gets all the space he needs to drill a shot. Denver quickly found the obvious out; if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\n\nFor Miami, it simply couldn\u2019t make a basket on Wednesday. The Heat shot 37% from the field \u2013 the worst they\u2019ve shot this entire playoffs. Denver didn\u2019t just take advantage of Miami\u2019s shooting struggles, but the Nuggets also utilized their size advantage to dominate in the paint. The Nuggets outscored the Heat 60-34 in paint points and outrebounded them 58-33.\n\nGoing forward in the series, the Heat honestly have a lot to worry about. They are outsized. They are getting beaten on effort. Butler isn\u2019t as athletic since his ankle injury, and it\u2019s showing on defense. A possible Tyler Herro return could help spark some new life in Miami, but we have to assume he\u2019ll be unavailable for the remainder of the series.\n\nSo, what now for the Miami Heat? At this point, it\u2019s become really hard to find ways they can beat the Nuggets in a seven-game series, but the Heat are no strangers to defying the odds. It\u2019s easy to say the Heat simply need to hustle more on defense and just hit their shots, but there\u2019s more to it.\n\nAlthough we can expect better shooting and more effort on Friday, here are the more specific adjustments Miami should focus on making:\n\nHelp out on defense and use more two big man sets\n\nThe Nuggets didn\u2019t just use their size as an advantage, but rather abused it to manhandle the Heat in the paint on both ends of the floor. Multiple times throughout the game you\u2019d have Jokic, Aaron Gordon or Jeff Green put their heads down and barrel their way to the hoop, easily getting through Miami defenders in isolation and making layups or drawing fouls. The Heat won\u2019t stand a chance if they don\u2019t send more help defense on these isolations. Whether it be from the center or wing defenders, they simply can\u2019t keep having their small defenders outmuscled.\n\nIf I\u2019m Miami, I\u2019ll let Denver beat us from the 3-point arc, especially considering they made only five threes on 27% shooting on Wednesday. Aside from bringing more help in the paint on isolation drives, the Heat should consider having more help in the paint at all times by having two big men on the floor more often. As talented as Adebayo is as a defender, Jokic is simply too large and offensively crafty to be contained by an individual defender. More minutes for Kevin Love and Cody Zeller along with Adebayo would cause more traffic in the paint, limiting Jokic\u2019s post scoring and passing towards backdoor cutters, and pressuring Denver to focus more on their guard and wing play. Going into Friday\u2019s game, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see more zone defense with two bigs.\n\nLet Denver\u2019s role players beat you and have your own generate a spark\n\nAs dominant as they are, Jokic and Murray can\u2019t win a game by themselves. The game stayed close in the first half as the duo were dominating, but it finally began to break open in the third quarter, when Gordon and Christian Braun stepped up offensively. As the Heat, you can live with second-half outbursts by Gordon and Braun, but you can\u2019t let up another pair of dominant performances from Murray and Jokic. Nuggets starters that aren\u2019t named Jokic or Murray combined for only six points in the first half and, yet again, Michael Porter Jr. and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope struggled with only one made field goal each all game.\n\nSimilarly from my previous piece of advice, the Heat might as well put more bodies on Jokic and Murray and let Denver\u2019s other pieces be the factors. Put the spotlight on the role players and test them. On the other side of the ball, the Heat need people to step up. Butler and Adebayo are going to get their 20+ points, but the Heat have zero chance of winning if they don\u2019t get a spark off the bench or another starter. We\u2019ve seen short scoring outbursts from Max Strus, Caleb Martin and Duncan Robinson, but one of the three needs to be hitting shots all game for this Heat team to win. I surely hope watching Christian Braun explode for 15 points on 7-for-8 shooting is the right motivation needed for these Heat snipers.\n\nBam must turn into the Hulk on offense\n\nThis one is simple and to the point. Bam Adebayo, stop shooting jump shots and get physical at the rim. As good as Jokic is, too often he fouls Adebayo when he\u2019s trying to block him at the hoop. Luckily for the Serbian, Adebayo doesn\u2019t use his combination of size and speed nearly enough to drive to the basket and go up with it. Adebayo has to turn on attack mode and go at Jokic\u2019s chest much more frequently. Trust your physicality and athletic ability to make layups, and if not, get Jokic into foul trouble. Basically, go beast mode.\n\nThe Nuggets are already in really great shape after making the right adjustments following the Game 2 loss. However, there are still a couple small adjustments that Denver needs to implement to make sure they don\u2019t fumble this series away.\n\nShoot more threes but actually make them\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Nuggets only made five threes out of 18 in Game 2. To be honest, the fact the Nuggets won after that performance from three is pretty shocking. Shocking enough that it probably won\u2019t happen again if they repeat it. Porter Jr. and Caldwell-Pope need to regain their shooting strokes back to carry the load off of Jokic and Murray. The team as a whole also needs to be prepared to shoot and make more threes. The Heat will start to find an answer for their interior defense that will more than likely leave more shooters open, and the Nuggets have to be ready to capitalize.\n\nMake smart decisions on both ends of the floor\n\nThe Nuggets also managed to come away with a win despite turning the ball over ten more times than the Heat, losing the turnover battle 14 to four. The Nuggets obviously must be smarter with the ball, but that doesn\u2019t just mean making smart passes and handling the ball well. It also means being smarter on defense and knowing when to make the extra leap, the extra effort or the extra swipe at the ball to generate a turnover. Letting the Heat get away with four turnovers is not acceptable for a team who wants to win a championship. The Nuggets must be smart and aggressive at the same time if they want the edge on Friday.\n\nConsider rotation changes\n\nThere was one point in Wednesday\u2019s game where 6-foot-10 Michael Porter Jr. lost a jump ball to Gabe Vincent. Vincent\u2019s height you may ask? 6-foot-3. It was at that point that I knew I had to say something about Porter Jr. The talent is there, but the effort is simply not. Both Porter Jr. and Caldwell-Pope are struggling heavily this series, while Green and Braun have shown flashes of promise on both ends of the floor, but more importantly, in how much they want to win. I\u2019m not suggesting that Porter Jr. and Caldwell-Pope should be benched, because I do believe they will find their rhythm once again, but I do think Mike Malone should consider lowering their minutes and giving more time to Braun and Green. It\u2019s also a simple eye test for me. Braun and Green just want it more.\n\nPrediction: Miami\u2019s bench shooters shine and interior defense improves greatly. Denver falls behind early, but receives much needed offense from Murray and Gordon in the second half. Denver wins 123-118 in OT.\n```"}

Times Festival of Books.\n\nJessica Kim with Keren Taylor, executive director of WriteGirl, at a WriteGirl event. (Photo courtesy of Alyssa Hunter Photography)\n\nBy Kimberly Aguirre\nJune 09, 2023 at 9:02 am PDT\n\n\u201cI actually did not practice any of my poems.\u201d It\u2019s a strange admission for someone about to close out the 2023 Los Angeles Times Festival of Books. But Jessica Kim is anything but ordinary. After her introduction and reading of her first poem, Kim admitted to her lack of practice to the not-entirely-full audience at the Poetry Stage, to whom she \u201ckind of apologize[d].\u201d She later admitted, in private, that she chose her poems less than an hour before her slotted performance time due to her redeye flight from the East Coast, where she was taking tours of Princeton, Yale and MIT, all colleges to which she was accepted.\n\nIn her work, the 18-year-old details personal experiences with family, cultural identity and her visual impairment. The youngest speaker at this year\u2019s Festival, Kim has complete confidence in her poems, even if they\u2019re unrehearsed and unedited. \u201cWhen I finish writing a first draft, I tell myself, \u2018It\u2019s done,\u2019\u201d Kim said. \u201cMany poets struggle with having to revise their poems, but in a way, I can\u2019t really relate to that.\u201d\n\nThough she exudes the confidence of a much more seasoned writer, Kim\u2019s just three years into her craft. At the beginning of the pandemic, in 2020, the then-high school freshman, who\u2019d just returned to the United States after seven years of living in South Korea and Singapore, began to put her pen to paper. \u201cI had so many emotions, and I wanted to really make them concrete,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI realized that by ... unraveling these emotions into a poem ... it was from a place that was difficult to navigate but [was] also enchanting.\u201d\n\nShe finds inspiration in many places: the news, other writers such as Ocean Vuong and Franny Choi, Twitter friends and just simple teenage woes. She refuses to box herself into one theme. When she reads about a rise in Asian American hate crimes, she writes a response as a Korean American. The next day, she\u2019s an Angeleno, writing a love letter to the city. Then, she offers an analysis of living with a visual impairment in a world built for the able-bodied.\n\nThis is all while being the editor-in-chief of two literary magazines \u2014 The Lumiere Review, which she also founded, and Polyphony Lit. While she grew up an avid reader, she never cared for writing, previously only using painting and music as creative outlets. As she began to truly explore writing, Kim sought assistance from WriteGirl, a writing mentorship program for girls, nonbinary and gender-expansive people between the ages of 13 and 19.\n\nKeren Taylor, the founder of WriteGirl, created the program to give young writers like Kim a space to grow their voice. \u201cTeen girls are a little bit of an invisible group. The world thinks that they\u2019re undeveloped and need to just grow up and don\u2019t really want to hear what they have to say,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat is a very frustrating thing. Women at a very young age start having very strong opinions and views and perspectives about the world and their voice is important for all of us to hear.\u201d\n\nTaylor sees Kim as a \u201cconduit\u201d for the unheard voices of teen girls, admiring the \u201cferocity\u201d in her work. Amanda Gorman, the 2021 Inaugural Poet, is also a graduate of the WriteGirl program. She was the first-ever Youth Poet Laureate of L.A., holding the title in 2014. Gorman\u2019s story inspired Kim to apply to the L.A. Youth Poet Laureate program.\n\nHeld in collaboration with the Los Angeles Public Library, the competition requires applicants to submit three poems and a resume. Candice Mack, the managing librarian of systemwide teen services at LAPL, said the resume is so the voters can get a more well-rounded look at the poet. She says the title is awarded for more than just a poet but for an active member of the community, with the judges putting emphasis on community service.\n\nMack has been with the program since its inception in 2014 and remembers seeing Gorman win the prize and following her journey afterward. \u201cEven when they win, and they\u2019ve blown you away, you also don\u2019t know what is going to happen next for them,\u201d Mack said. \u201cI hope there are lots more Amanda Gorman\u2019s or Jessica Kim\u2019s.\u201d\n\nConcurrently with her application for the Youth Poet Laureate title, Kim submitted her work to literary magazines and journals. In the process, she submitted to Animal Heart Press\u2019 chapbook competition in 2021. That was the first contest from the Australian publishing company, which created the competition to uplift feminist voices, according to managing editor Amanda McLeod.\n\nKim\u2019s work was up against more than 100 submissions from all over the world. The judges, McLeod, editor-in-chief Elisabeth Horan and managing editor and logistics manager Beth Gordon, read all submissions individually and each created a shortlist of possible winners. Kim\u2019s work made all three editors\u2019 lists.\n\nThe judges read the submissions blindly. According to McLeod, the trio was shocked when the authors were revealed and Kim\u2019s young age was made known. \u201cAt the time that she won that contest, she was really young and our jaws just all fell open because her writing sounds like the voice of someone with so many more years of life experience,\u201d McLeod said. \u201cShe\u2019s really considerate and so wise and insightful for her age.\u201d\n\nShe ended up as a dual runner-up in the competition. Originally, the prize for a runner-up was a copy of the winner\u2019s book plus a feature in the publisher\u2019s literary magazine, FERAL: A Journal of Art and Poetry. However, McLeod said Animal Heart Press loved her work so much that they decided to take her on as a client, publishing her poetry collection, \u201cL(eye)ght,\u201d in March 2022.\n\nOriginally, Kim planned to call the collection, \u201cTw(eye)light,\u201d which, as she made it very clear, is not at all related to the Stephenie Meyer\u2019s series of the same (homophonic) name. She says she chose this title because most of the poems are inspired by that time of day. She says twilight is inspiring because it is a sort of in-between of light and dark, just as she sees her vision. She says she also admired the ever-changing nature of that time of day.\n\n\u201cTwilight does not appear the same every day,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThat fluidity, but also that intimacy, drew me to that time of day, and I wrote maybe even kind of subconsciously toward that.\u201d\n\nDespite her literary success, Kim plans to major in computer science in college, or as she describes it, \u201cthe poetry of STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics.]\u201d According to Miye Sugino, one of Kim\u2019s closest friends and \u201cL(eye)ght\u201d's cover artist, Kim has always been STEM-oriented. Sugino, a freshman at Yale, is currently working to convince Kim to join her in the fall.\n\nAlthough she is two grades ahead of Kim, Sugino found herself in the same multivariable calculus and linear algebra class. She says one of her most \u201cvivid\u201d memories of Kim occurred while she was struggling to copy down the teacher\u2019s work as quickly as it was happening while Kim was not writing anything down. Once the teacher finally finished the proof, Kim raised her hand, corrected him and redid the entire problem for the class.\n\nWhile STEM may be her start at college, she still plans to continue writing, whether that be with a double major, minor or simply in her free time. According to McLeod, \u201cshe will be the Poet Laureate of the United States one day.\u201d\n\nWhile the literary world predicts a bright future for the young poet, for now, Kim just has one worry: What to wear to graduation in June.\n```"}

According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center, there are currently more than 400 active wildfires across Canada, over 200 of which are considered \u201cout of control\u201d and around 150 are in the region of Quebec, bordering the Northeast. A storm system off the coast of Nova Scotia coupled with an atmospheric swirl has sent much of the haze from those wildfires into the U.S., causing the air quality index (AQI) in many cities to rise. As of Tuesday evening, New York City had the worst rating in the world. According to AirNow.gov, New York City had an AQI score of 333 today. Values over 300 are considered hazardous.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to be outside. There is a distinct smell to it,\u201d Amalraj said. Recent graduate and fellow New Jersey resident Jason Lopez agreed. \u201cIt feels like someone\u2019s just burning, right next to you or something,\u201d Lopez said. AirNow.gov reports in other parts of the East Coast, Philadelphia had an AQI score of 269. Values over 200 are considered very unhealthy. Washington D.C. came in at 160. Values over 150 are labeled unhealthy.\n\nWhile everyone is at risk when there is poor air quality, children, the elderly and those with respiratory conditions are at the most risk. \u201cI have asthma, so I [would] rather not risk the chance,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cBut some of my family members went outside like my sister had to go to school today, and when she came back, she was like, \u2018It\u2019s a bit difficult to breathe in this sort of sense.\u2019 But for the little instances that I had been outside, I can definitely smell smoke.\u201d\n\nOver a dozen states have issued air quality alerts reaching all the way to the Carolinas. These alerts include warnings to stay indoors, keep windows closed and wear high-quality masks (such as KN95 or N95) if you have to travel outside. \u201cThey\u2019ve made it clear that even being outside for a little [bit] can be very dangerous, so I\u2019ve decided to hole up in my home,\u201d Amalraj said.\n\nThe smog blanketing much of the East Coast has caused other problems. Visibility has been reduced, causing the Federal Aviation Administration to slow flights at major airports in New York, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. There is no clear timetable on how long the smoke and air quality will last, with conditions expected to worsen over the next few days.\n```"}

The stage was set for the second leg of the Scotiabank CONCACAF Champions League Sunday. Le\u00f3n and its fans made their way to the City of Angels in hopes of proving a worthy representation for Mexican soccer. The 3252, LAFC\u2019s leading fanbase, was not going to make it easy for its rivals.\n\nIn an impeccable atmosphere, the Los Angeles fans felt they could be the twelfth player on the field needing just one goal to tie the aggregate score \u2013 a 2-1 lead secured by Le\u00f3n at home last Wednesday. Both teams played an enormous game, but in the end the Liga MX team scored once and would come out with an aggregate score of 3-1.\n\nWith this, the trophy returned to a Liga MX team only a year after MLS representative Seattle Sounders won the CONCACAF Champions League. Thirteen Liga MX teams have won the competition since its inception in 1962, while only three MLS representatives have secured the trophy during that time frame.\n\nThis, along with the recent results between these cross-national matchups, spices up the ongoing debate as to which league is performing better. CONCACAF recently launched a new method of measurement with a ranking system that awards points based on numbers of international games won. Currently the list has eight Liga MX teams in the top ten with Philadelphia Union and LAFC being the only MLS teams.\n\nWhile this does not validate the level of play among the two leagues, it does show the enormous head start Mexican teams had in this competition. Professional soccer in Mexico began its era in 1943, a whole 50 years prior to the debut of the MLS in December of 1993. By far it is a business of experience, but MLS has found great success in convincing big-name players to form part of the league.\n\nThe list is endless: from David Beckham to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, to more recently Xherdan Shaqiri. However, the debate will never end, since we will always have another matchup to disrupt the previous comparison.\n\nOne of the greatest opportunities to level things out will come this summer, when the two leagues will meet in a new format of the Leagues Cup. The format consists of fifteen groups of three teams with the two league champions waiting for rivals at the Round of 32 stage of the tournament. This will all take place starting in July, awarding the two leagues yet another battle to prove who is the current champion of the never-ending battle between Liga MX and MLS.\n```"}

What to look for as the Heat and Nuggets go to South Beach tied 1-1.\n\nMiami Heat forward Jimmy Butler (22) shoots a 3-point basket over Denver Nuggets guard Christian Braun (0) during the second half of Game 2 of basketball's NBA Finals, Sunday, June 4, 2023, in Denver. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nBy Mateo Gutierrez June 07, 2023 at 9:30 am PDT\n\nAfter many initially thought the No. 1-seeded Denver Nuggets would make easy work of the No. 8-seeded Miami Heat in the NBA Finals, the Heat managed to steal a game in high altitude, bringing a tied series back to Miami. Coming into Game 2 as 8-point underdogs, the Heat\u2019s road victory came as a surprise to many, especially when they were down by 15 at one point, and the Nuggets had yet to lose a home game since before the playoffs. Where does the credit go? Miami\u2019s undrafted players rising to the occasion and a collective masterclass from the 3-point arc.\n\nMiami shot an impressive 48.6% from three in Game 2, hitting 17 threes, with 11 of them coming from their undrafted players. Gabe Vincent once again showcased his confident shooting stroke with 23 points on 67% shooting, while Max Strus bounced back from a scoreless Game 1 with 14 points \u2014 12 of those points off four threes in the first quarter alone. Duncan Robinson also added two threes of his own, scoring all 10 of his points in the fourth quarter. Oh, did I mention these guys are undrafted?\n\nWhile Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo contributed their expected fair share of 21 points each, it was Nikola Jokic who led all scorers after exploding for 41 points on 16-for-28 shooting. However, Jokic also tallied a playoff-low four assists, and his scoring outburst continues a trend of three straight losses for Denver when he scores more than 40 points. Is there then something to be said about limiting Jokic\u2019s role as a playmaker and letting him be more of a scorer? Honestly, no, and Heat coach Erik Spolestra would agree.\n\nWhat the Heat managed to do differently, however, was utilize their zone defense to limit the Jokic-Jamal Murray two-man game that\u2019s been giving defenses problems all playoffs. By crowding the middle of the halfcourt and refusing Jokic to get the ball there, the Heat are forcing the Nuggets to go to their wing players to generate more offense. On Sunday, Miami got what it wanted, with the other three Nuggets starters combining for only 23 points on 8-for-19 shooting.\n\nGoing into South Beach on Wednesday night, here are what the Nuggets have to do differently to take a game back on the road: Michael Porter Jr. and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope must wake up. When Miami plays a zone defense to limit Jokic and Murray\u2019s offensive tandem, the other guys on the floor must step up. On Sunday, however, Porter scored only five points in 26 minutes, while Caldwell-Pope scored six points in 36 minutes. Furthermore, both starters had the lowest plus-minus on the Nuggets with Porter being -15 and Caldwell-Pope being -14. Even after terrible games by two of their starters, the Nuggets did only lose by three, so if Porter and Caldwell-Pope can get to their spots, shoot with confidence and hit their shots like usual on Wednesday, the Nuggets should be in good shape (Caldwell-Pope also fouled on two 3-point attempts allowing six free points, so he must be smarter on defense, too).\n\nCommunicate on pick and rolls. The Heat were able to tear apart the Nuggets all game on pick and rolls involving two shooters where the pick man would come set the screen and then slip to the corner often unguarded for an uncontested three. On one occasion in the fourth quarter, Vincent set a screen for Robinson to cut, then both Nuggets players followed Robinson to the paint, leaving Vincent open for a three he then drained. The following possession, they ran the same exact play, but the Nuggets miscommunicated on the switch again and left Robinson open on a cut to the basket, where he got the ball and laid it in. The Nuggets have to talk better amongst themselves and be tighter on switches if they don\u2019t want a repeat of Game 2 on Wednesday.\n\nOn the other hand, and aside from their zone defense limiting the Jokic-Murray two-man game, here are what the Heat will have to do to defend home court and go up in this series: Take care of the ball and get back on defense. The Heat fell behind by a considerable amount in the second quarter due to careless turnovers and poor shot selection, leading to a ton of transition points for the Nuggets. When it was all said and done, the Nuggets outscored the Heat on transition points by 18 to five. Miami needs to slow down their offense more and be smarter with the ball if it wants a chance at winning this series. As confident and as good as their shooters are, taking deep threes with 16 or more seconds on the shot clock won\u2019t cut it. And when Denver does go on the fastbreak, Miami fans better pray their players are giving it their all to run back on defense.\n\nHave Jimmy Butler stay aggressive on both ends of the court. Jimmy Butler is talented enough where everyone in the arena knows he is going to get his points regardless. However, his impact on defense may be more important going forward. The Heat turned to Butler to face-guard Murray throughout the game, which effectively impacted Murray\u2019s typical offensive output, as the guard scored only 18 points on 15 shots (with many of those points coming from fastbreaks). Using Butler\u2019s larger frame and tenacity on Murray is something the Heat have to continue to limit Denver\u2019s offense. On the other end of the ball, Butler must stay aggressive inside the -3-point line, getting to his mid-range spots and drawing more fouls. Butler didn\u2019t shoot a single free throw in Game 1 but made all five of his attempts in Game 2, so he has to keep putting his head down and get to the charity stripe.\n\nPrediction: Denver makes the correct adjustments and gets big games from its role players, wins 115-108.\n```"}

The Georgia Bureau of Investigations released a statement, stating they are charged with \u201cmoney laundering\u201d and \u201ccharity fraud.\u201d Despite the three arrestees being from Georgia, Governor Brian Kemp claims that the \u201cStop Cop City\u201d protestors have largely been \u201cmostly out-of-state activists,\u201d who have \u201cfacilitated and encouraged domestic terrorism.\u201d He has promised to \u201ctrack down every member of a criminal organization.\u201d Local activists consider this a \u201cmajor escalation.\u201d They are concerned the Solidarity Fund arrestees will face RICO charges \u2013 which are typically used for people engaged in \u201corganized crime.\u201d\n\nThe Atlanta Community Press Collective tweeted that \u201cCollective bail funds have existed since the dawn of the civil rights movement. When Dr. King was held in Birmingham Jail, churches and community groups including the NAACP came together to fund his $4000 bail - the equivalent of $39,000 today.\u201d The National Bail Fund has begun to organize support for the arrestees, and a demonstration is planned for tonight, outside of the Dekalb County Jail.\n\nContent Warning: Gun Violence, Death, Police Brutality\n\nOver the past 11 years, at least 1733 land defenders have been killed worldwide while fighting to protect the land. Berta C\u00e1ceres was shot in 2021 while protesting a hydroelectric dam project in Honduras. Jos\u00e9 Santos Isaac Ch\u00e1vez was tortured and murdered in Mexico while opposing a mine. Manuel Esteban Paez Ter\u00e1n (they/them) was shot at least 57 times by law enforcement while sitting in a tent with their hands in the air. They were protesting the expansion of police violence and environmental destruction at a protest encampment called \u201cStop Cop City,\u201d outside of Atlanta, Georgia. Ter\u00e1n was known to their friends and comrades as \u201cTortuguita.\u201d They were Venezuelan and non-binary.\n\nHuman rights groups say they are one of the first land defenders, in recent history, to be killed by the United States government. Their death marks a significant escalation in state violence against protestors. Since Ter\u00e1n\u2019s death during a police raid on January 18, 2023, tensions have escalated between \u201cStop Cop City\u2019' land defenders and the Atlanta government. The Atlanta Police Department has consistently avoided conversations about accountability regarding Ter\u00e1n\u2019s death, while releasing contradictory information. Atlanta police have slapped protestors with unprecedented domestic terrorism and racketeering charges, refusing to let many out of jail.\n\nMeanwhile, protestors have used direct action tactics to delay the construction of \u201cCop City\u201d a year behind schedule. As a result of these delays, Atlanta City Council is meeting to vote on increasing funding for the Cop City project sometime between May 15 and June 5 of this year. Activists believe this vote allows community members to oppose further construction.\n\nA press document released by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) immediately after Ter\u00e1n\u2019s murder stated, \u201cAs law enforcement was moving through the property, officers located a man inside a tent in the woods. Officers gave verbal commands to the man who did not comply and shot a Georgia State Patrol Trooper. Other law enforcement officers returned fire, hitting the man.\u201d Ter\u00e1n, who was non-binary, queer and used they/them pronouns, was pronounced dead on the scene.\n\nSuccessive releases from the state of Georgia claimed that the trooper\u2019s bullet wound matched a handgun found on the scene, allegedly wielded by Ter\u00e1n. The DeKalb Medical Examiner\u2019s Office conducted an independent autopsy weeks after the murder. And the information reported severely contradicted GBI\u2019s initial reports. According to the autopsy, the bullet trajectories, as determined by the fourteen bullet wounds on Tortuguita\u2019s body, revealed that Ter\u00e1n was most likely in a cross-legged seated position with \u201c[their] hands and arms up and in front of [their] body, with [their] palms facing towards [their] upper body.\u201d when being shot by the Georgia State Trooper officer.\n\nThe autopsy also revealed that the gunshot wounds \u201coriginated from armed individuals who were standing towards the front of [Tortuguita], and relatively close to [them].\u201d There is inconclusive evidence to determine whether or not Ter\u00e1n was holding a firearm at the time of their death. However, what is clear is the distinct lack of transparency on the GBI\u2019s end. Specifically, Georgia law enforcement was deeply reluctant to share evidence regarding the specifics of what happened during the fatal police raid.\n\nThe GBI initially stated that there was no live footage of the shooting due to state law protections. They argued these laws do not require the joint task force, composed of federal and state officers, to wear body cameras. However, the Georgia State Patrol released body camera footage on February 8. A conversation captured on the body cameras between officers from the Atlanta Police Department in the minutes following the death included officers stating that it sounded more like suppressed gunfire. \u201cIt sounded suppressed, like three rounds,\u201d an officer says. Another officer from the Atlanta PD remarked that the gunshots were more consistent with that of a police officer shooting one of their own. \u201cF\u2013ked your own officer up,\u201d the officer said.\n\nThe GBI dismissed these statements in an official press release, stating that the officer\u2019s remarks were speculative. \u201cSpeculation is not evidence,\u201d the release reads, \u201cour investigation does not support that statement.\u201d The GBI also refused to release any video evidence they had, citing a Georgia law that \u201cexempt[s] the public disclosure of videos in an active investigation.\u201d The GBI release stated that the rationale behind doing so is to prevent several outside factors, like viewing videos related to the incident, from interfering with a witness\u2019s statement during an interview.\n\nThe GBI also refused to meet with Ter\u00e1n\u2019s family to discuss the circumstances of their death \u2013 demonstrating a lack of transparency or meaningful redress for the killing. The GBI has increased sweeps and raids of the Stop Cop City occupation since Ter\u00e1n\u2019s death at the hands of police. A \u201cStop Cop City\u201d organizer stated that several activists were arrested and charged with domestic terrorism after the raids. They asked to remain anonymous to protect their safety.\n\n\u201cWe are facing incredible political oppression. There is immense rhetoric used against protestors to deter [activists],\u201d the organizer said. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that the broad application of domestic terrorism charges is not reflective of the severity of the actions, but rather to throw people in jail for months or years. Even though these charges are dropped, these charges are meant to intimidate.\u201d\n\nIn March 2023 alone, 42 forest defenders received domestic terrorism charges. While the press release from the Atlanta Police Department stated that those arrested were \u201cviolent agitators,\u201d activists said police arrested them during a music festival. \u201cThere were 1,000 people on the other side of the forest at a festival on March 5,\u201d the \u201cStop Cop City\u201d organizer said. \u201cPolice tried to grab as many people as they could at the festival because they just needed to arrest one to justify the raid. They filter out who is from Georgia and who isn\u2019t and arrest all the people that aren\u2019t from Georgia... They charged the people at the festival with solely domestic terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe organizer believes these arrests were meant to be punitive towards protestors \u201cas punishment for supporting the movement.\u201d After being cited as \u201ca threat to the community,\u201d eight arrested parties had their bond denied.\n\nIn an effort to understand the criminal charges against posed the environmental activists, Attorney Donald F. Samuel, the author of \u201cGeorgia Criminal Law Casefinder,\u201d explained the context of \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d accusations in Georgia. Samuel said there have yet to be any cases in Georgia that have carried out domestic terrorism charges in the past, due to the severity of the charge.\n\n\u201cThe statute was enacted to address what we may describe as traditional \u201cterrorism\u201d cases: that is, cases in which violent criminal conduct is employed to force governments to alter public policy,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cDomestic terrorism means any felony violation of, or attempt to commit a felony violation of the laws of this state which, as part of a single unlawful act or a series of unlawful acts which are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics, is intended to cause serious bodily harm, kill any individual or group of individuals, or disable or destroy critical infrastructure, a state or government facility, or a public transportation system when such disability or destruction results in major economic loss, and is intended to: (A) Intimidate the civilian population of this state or any of its political subdivisions; (B) Alter, change, or coerce the policy of the government of this state or any of its political subdivisions by intimidation or coercion; or (C) Affect the conduct of the government of this state or any of its political subdivisions by use of destructive devices, assassination, or kidnapping.\u201d\n\nThe organizer from \u201cStop Cop City\u201d also confirmed that the police raided a communal space serving as a medic hub for forest defenders. At 8 a.m. on March 11, 20 police officers raided the Lakewood Environment Arts Foundation with a search warrant for \u201csuspected domestic terrorism.\u201d \u201cPolice pointed their rifles at people, arresting 1 for a missed traffic ticket, meaning they were trying to throw as many people in jail as possible,\u201d the organizer said. \u201cThey tore up all the tents and toppled the medical supplies. It was a tactic to destroy camps rather than trying to seize any assets.\u201d\n\nCharges leveled against protestors escalated beyond just domestic terrorism. The \u201cStop Cop City\u201d organizer explained that local activist leaders, including in groups like the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, have had RICO charges considered against them. Although the Atlanta Solidarity Fund was solely providing legal support to protestors and not organizing any protests of their own, the organizer explained that in the wake of political oppression, \u201clegal counsel is a lifeline to solidarity.\u201d\n\nAttorney Don Samuel explained that RICO charges helped law enforcement prosecute those associated with organized crime. \u201cThe original purpose of RICO was to target organized crime and to facilitate seizures of money and property in these criminal cases,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cOver the past twenty years, RICO has been added to the prosecutors\u2019 arsenal in a wide assortment of cases, though usually in cases of some kind of organized criminal activity, including substantial drug, gang, and other [similar] cases.\u201d\n\nGiven Georgia\u2019s limited use of the domestic terrorism charges, and the fact that RICO charges apply only to illegal activities related to organized crime, Attorney Samuel said that he has not seen any prior protest cases that have invoked either charge, even during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThe \u201cStop Cop City\u201d organizer commented on how the measures enacted by the Atlanta Police Department have retaliated to the successful protests the forest defenders have organized and participated in. Because of the continued protests, the cop city project is reportedly a year behind schedule, and tensions are escalating beyond the scope of those within the forest.\n\n\u201cThe city of Atlanta continues to push policies that hurt different people and instead benefit the 1%, who are very upset that people are fighting back,\u201d the organizer said. \u201cMore and more people are joining and the city of Atlanta is creating a new task force because of political pressure that protests have applied. They\u2019re also attempting to shut down parts of the forest to demoralize forest defenders but people are all over the forests.\u201d\n\nOn the legal level, things might be coming to a close. The Atlanta Community Press Collective has uncovered documents stating that Atlanta City Council members have to vote on possibly spending up to $33.5 million in taxpayer dollars on the \u201cCop City\u201d facility, due to the successful forest defender protests. There is a likelihood that Georgia may abandon the \u201cCop City\u201d project, if the council votes against providing more funds on June 5th of this year. Atlanta residents can participate in both city council and subcommittee meetings during designated public comment periods on May 15 and June 5 to provide input and opinions on the construction of \u201cCop City.\u201d```"}

A combination of their experience, policies and demographics gave them each a big advantage over their fellow candidates.\n\nMembers of the Southside Bethel Baptist Church gathered Monday to call for the resignation of Nury Martinez from her role as LA City Council President. (Photo by Alexis Lara)\n\nBy Melisa Cabello Cuahutle May 29, 2023 at 8:49 am PDT\n\nFollowing the April 4 special election for Los Angeles City Council, District 6 residents now know that their choice in the June runoff is between Marisa Alcaraz and Imelda Padilla. These candidates, the only two that represent the majority of the district\u2019s population, are already working for the city and are tough on policing.\n\nWhile most of the crowded field of first-round candidates were activists or involved community members, Alcaraz and Padilla stand out for being the two candidates with direct political connections and a more formal understanding of the system. Alcaraz is the Deputy Chief of Staff for Councilman Curren Price, and Padilla has worked on several community projects with the council, including with Nury Martinez.\n\nWhile neither of them are elected officials, their resumes and connections differ significantly from those of the other candidates, such as Isaac Kim and Rose Grigoryan, who are both small business owners with no previous professional experience in politics. Alcaraz and Padilla also have more conservative views when it comes to the L.A. Police Department and public safety.\n\nIn the post-George Floyd climate across the country, governments and communities are asking for a more community-based approach to policing, and Los Angeles is no exception, having reduced its police budget in 2020 (although Mayor Karen Bass has now proposed to expand it). A survey, conducted by Loyola Marymount University in 2022, found that 52% of Los Angeles residents supported proposals to redirect money from the LAPD budget.\n\nBut those opinions are not necessarily shared by many District 6 residents. Panorama Neighborhood Council Executive Chair Lanira Murphy agrees that Padilla and Alcaraz\u2019s more conservative views on policing are one of the reasons why they were favored by the voters. Murphy believes that the result of the race is \u201cindicative\u201d of how District 6 thinks about policing.\n\n\u201cThe anti-police like \u2018get rid of the police,\u2019 that\u2019s not CD6 people they\u2019re like \u2018no, we need the police. We don\u2019t feel safe,\u2019\u201d Murphy said.\n\nAnd then there is candidate Marco Santana, who was favored to at least win a spot in the election runoff after receiving the endorsement of the Los Angeles Times. Although Santana received enough votes to put him in the third position overall, only the first two candidates went to the runoff.\n\nWhile not the most progressive candidate in the race, Santana still upheld some liberal ideas. When the L.A. Times endorsed him back in March, Santana had noted that he would consider taking resources from LAPD if no other funding was available. Santana also opposes Section 41.18, known as the anti-camping law which criminalizes sitting, sleeping or blocking a sidewalk.\n\nSantana was not the only candidate who publicly opposed the section, in fact, Alcaraz and Padilla were the only ones who publicly supported the controversial \u201csit-lie\u201d section. The Los Angeles Police Protective League (LAPPL) spent over $70,000 in mailing opposing Santana. They did not report any other expenses supporting or opposing any other candidates for this race.\n\n\u201cHe was the only one who was targeted with negative mail,\u201d said Fernando Guerra, professor of political science and director of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at the Loyola Marymount University. Guerra also serves as one of the authors of the previously mentioned Police and Community Relations Survey.\n\nAlthough other candidates had more direct plans to defund the police and establish alternative safety measures, Tom Saggau, from the LAPPL, says that they \u201cfelt it was important to highlight where his positions were being that he had more funding and on paper more support than some of the other candidates.\u201d\n\nThe LAPPL is the LAPD union. They have not endorsed anyone for this race, although they have reported expenditures in support of other candidates in the past.\n\n\u201cWe thought [it] was best to ensure that candidates that supported law enforcement, that supported the encampment ordinance, made it to a runoff,\u201d Saggau said.\n\nIn terms of crime rates, District 6 is placed in an average position compared to other districts in L.A., with their rates not being the highest nor the lowest. Crime rates differ drastically from neighborhood to neighborhood in the district, but some areas do have medium to high rates of crime, particularly in Lake Balboa, Panorama City and Sun Valley.\n\nIn regards to homelessness, District 6 does have a significant population of unhoused people, with the district having a little over 3,300 unhoused people, both sheltered and unsheltered, and over 2,100 unhoused households, which they describe as at least two members of a family group\u2013at least one adult and one minor.\n\nThe district with the largest number of unhoused people was District 14, which includes Downtown L.A., and has a total of 7,600 unhoused individuals and over 7,100 unhoused households.\n\nMultiple District 6 Neighborhood Council Presidents mentioned crime and homelessness as key issues for their voters. However, Sun Valley Neighborhood Council President Wendy Thum does not believe that views on policing had a great impact on the race.\n\nThe council, however, does have a strong relationship with LAPD, which Thum describes as \u201cexcellent.\u201d Instead, Thum accredits the success of Alcaraz and Padilla to them being part of the system and having connections.\n\n\u201cThey were both aware from their political connections early on that the race was going to happen and they had political structures in place, particularly with unions,\u201d Thum said.\n\nMurphy of the Panorama neighborhood council also agrees that because Padilla and Alcaraz are within the system, they have a big advantage.\n\n\u201cI do think that it was not an even playing field, which is like usually the political landscape,\u201d said Murphy.\n\nMurphy also believes that the race was \u201cill-timed,\u201d since candidates had to submit signatures by January 4 in order to be on the ballot, meaning they likely had to work on the campaign during the holidays.\n\nBy comparison, for the 2022 Los Angeles Mayoral race, candidates started filing signatures in February for the election in June.\n\nGuerra also agrees that having government experience was one of the main reasons Padilla and Alcaraz won the most votes.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, it was quite predictable that they would come in first or second place. Number one, they had the most money. Number two, they had the most endorsements. Number three, they already had government experience. And then number four, they fit the majority of the profile, meaning that they were Latinas,\u201d Guerra said.\n\nThe latter point was essential. Being Latinas helped Padilla and Alcaraz (and also Santana, to some degree) because the majority of the District 6 residents are also Latine, and voters tend to favor those with similar demographics.\n\n\u201cAs a Latino voter, you say someone with my same experience is most likely to pursue the policies that I\u2019m interested in, most likely to understand my experience, most like to understand what I want from [the] government, therefore, all things being equal, and [the] information I have, I\u2019m going to vote for a Latino,\u201d said Guerra, explaining the voter mentality.\n\nThe same thing happens with people from other ethnicities and races, voting for someone with your same demographic entails familiarity, which is particularly important in a small, local race where voters are not receiving a lot of information.\n\n\u201c[If] I have no other information other than the name on the ballot. I\u2019m going to assume someone\u2019s Latino because they have a Latino last name,\u201d said Guerra.\n\nBeing a woman also helped both Padilla and Alcaraz, as the majority of voters are women, according to Guerra. Women voting in larger percentages than men is a national trend, as women have voted at higher rates than men in all presidential elections in recent history, with this turnout gap growing in every presidential election, according to the Center for American Women And Politics at Rutgers University.\n\nGuerra also mentions how voters tend to assume that women are more responsive to certain issues such as family issues and education, they also assume that women are less combative and more collaborative, which favors them for elections like the one in District 6.\n\n\u201cThese, of course, are generalizations that don\u2019t always happen, but that\u2019s how voters make up their minds. And so the majority of voters are Latino and the majority of voters are [women],\u201d said Guerra.\n\n\u201cIt makes perfect sense that a Latina is going to be the number one choice.\u201d And number two choice, in this case.\n\nThe April 4 special election ended with Alcaraz getting 21% of the votes and Padilla leading with almost 26% of the votes. Because there was no candidate with 50% or more of the votes, Alcaraz and Padilla will move on to a runoff election on June 27.\n\nPadilla\u2019s percentage of the votes represented 3,400 votes, while Alcaraz received 2,800 votes. Only 11% of the eligible voters cast a ballot, representing about 13,500 people.\n\nThe low number of votes is not uncommon for the district, Nury Martinez, the previous District 6 City Councilmember, won her 2013 election with a little over 5,000 votes.\n\nThis is not the first time the District has seen a special election to elect a council member in recent history. In 2013, Nury Martinez won her council seat in a special election.\n\nThe circumstances, however, were very different as Martinez got her seat after her predecessor Tony Cardenas was elected to Congress. But this special election is happening due to protests and civil calls for Martinez\u2019s resignation, which occurred in October 2022.\n\nThe protests took place at City Hall and extended to the White House, with President Biden calling Martinez and the other councilmembers to resign. This was in response to a leaked audio that showed Martinez making racist comments towards Black people, indigenous Mexicans and Jewish people.\n\nThe original audio, its source still unknown, was posted on Reddit, although the story got traction after the Los Angeles Times broke the story.\n\nDistrict 6 comprises Sun Valley, Arleta, Panorama City, Lake Balboa, and Van Nuys. The district\u2019s residents are mostly Hispanic people, representing 72% of the population, Asian people represent 9%, while Black people are 3% of the population.\n\nThe median household income is a little over $40,000, and about 17% of the population live in poverty.\n\nSince the results of the primary elections were announced, Padilla has reported a larger amount of monetary contributions and expenditures than Alcaraz, as of May 13.\n\nPadilla also has reported more endorsements on her website than Alcaraz has reported on hers.\n\nWith Padilla already leading in votes from the election in April, she seemingly has a slight advantage over Alcaraz in the runoff election this June, but with a month left until the election, both candidates have time to leave a bigger mark on the race.\n\nMail-in ballots for the runoff election will begin to be distributed this week on May 30. Polls will close at 8 p.m. on June 27 to decide who the next Los Angeles City Councilmember representing District 6 will be.\n```"}

The phrase \u201cBama Rush\u201d gained traction on TikTok in the summer of 2021, as many women documented their experience of rushing to join sororities at Alabama. On the social media platform, the recruiting process appeared lighthearted and pleasurable. For those who aren\u2019t directly involved in Greek life, it seems that the rumors and misconceptions circulating its activities often overshadow the realities of fraternities and sororities. So I was eager to learn more about the inner workings of these social groups through this documentary to formulate a more well-informed opinion on Greek life. However, I was crestfallen with the film as it failed to provide any new groundbreaking revelations about this social phenomenon. It would be futile to discuss my thoughts about sororities when I didn\u2019t gain a sufficient understanding of it through the documentary. Instead, I\u2019d rather explore where the documentary fell short.\n\nOverall, the film focused more on the individual struggles that the girls at Alabama were dealing with, rather than a comprehensive exploration of the rushing process. There were some intriguing and novel insights such as how the origins of the sororities began as a way to foster solidarity among college women and to challenge the notion that women can\u2019t succeed in academia. The documentary also provided shocking information about the powerful influence of \u201cthe Machine \u2018\u2019 and how it offered preferential treatment to those in Greek life. However, just as the story was starting to become more captivating, it fell flat. It failed to dive deeper into these interesting subject matters, leaving the viewers unsatisfyingly wanting more.\n\nThe last 20 minutes of the documentary was particularly disappointing. The focus started to stray off to the threats that the filmmakers of the documentary faced rather than the core subject of the rush process itself. And to offer her own personal anecdote of what she dealt with during the creation of this film, director Rachel Fleit often broke the fourth wall, which was highly unusual and unsettling as a viewer. This detracted from the overall story of Alabama\u2019s rush.\n\nIt is worth noting that Fleit successfully humanized the often misunderstood sorority process by including the struggles and underlying attachment issues that these girls face. It gave viewers a better idea as to what spurs these girls to join sororities. But ultimately, there was a lack of structure to the film. It simply felt like sound bites were thrown together for this documentary, which made the overall story very disjointed. Fleit could\u2019ve done more to probe the sorority rush to give viewers more insight into the process. This was a film that was highly anticipated, but unfortunately it didn\u2019t live up to its expectations.\n```"}

Botox, a drug made from a toxin that causes food poisoning, has been used to paralyze the muscles under wrinkles, smoothing the skin, for decades\u2014 usually among older women. Lisa Pecot-H\u00e9bert, Director of the Journalism Master of Science Program at USC, whose specialty and research focus is gender, body image, and the media said, \u201cback in the day, it was for people that had money. You couldn\u2019t go literally to your dermatologist, or you know, whatever on the corner. You couldn\u2019t go on your lunch hour and hit the Botox special because it didn\u2019t exist. It was less attainable.\u201d\n\nBut in recent years, the muscle-paralyzing injection has gained traction among people who are barely out of their teens in a new trend called \u201cbaby Botox.\u201d In fact, a recent study of USC students found that 65% of respondents who participated would plan on getting Botox between 20 and 30 years old \u2013 and 58% of which said they\u2019d actually considered getting it. Most college students aren\u2019t even 23.\n\nKarina Sanchez, a junior studying Business Administration at USC, conducted the study as part of a marketing assignment for her class. The assignment was to market a product to an audience that is not typically targeted\u2014Sanchez chose to promote Botox to girls in their twenties. This procedure has become increasingly popular as it offers a more natural-looking reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Traditional Botox injections involve injecting 20 to 30 units of botulinum toxin into one area, typically targeting brow furrows or deep forehead lines. With baby Botox, only 20 units are injected throughout the entire face. This is particularly appealing to younger individuals in their early twenties who want to refresh their appearance without losing facial mobility.\n\nPecot-H\u00e9bert identifies that the trend has led girls to believe that \u201cI won\u2019t wrinkle because if I do Botox, before I have to do Botox, then I will always keep the same youthful look.\u201d This disturbing trend of getting botox before wrinkles highlights the pressure that young girls face to maintain a youthful appearance \u2013 and even a specific look. The idea that Botox is \u201cnecessary\u201d can be traced back to various factors, with one major one being the prevalence of it on social media.\n\nAlix Earle, a well-known influencer and student at the University of Miami, has shown herself getting Botox and various other cosmetic injections on her TikTok. At only 22 years old, her fanbase is comprised of many young girls who have yet to even graduate high school. The popularity of Botox has been driven by social media, which has made it easier for people to learn about cosmetic procedures and has helped to destigmatize Botox. However, social media has also created unrealistic beauty standards through the normalization of filters that alter nose shape, face structure, and erase wrinkles. This can lead to increased pressure on young people to undergo cosmetic procedures like Botox, even if they are not necessary.\n\nProfessor Pecot-H\u00e9bert explains that Botox has \u201cbecome less stigmatized, which means it sort of becomes part of people\u2019s beauty regimen almost like a night cream.\u201d While Botox may improve self-esteem and confidence by removing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, it is important to recognize that it is not necessary to have it, or any other cosmetic procedure.\n\nDespite any possible benefits of Botox at a young age, Pecot-H\u00e9bert identifies that \u201cthe downside, of course, is you\u2019re putting all of your happiness into superficiality, of how you look.\u201d Women tend to feel more pressure than men to maintain a youthful appearance due to societal and media messaging that prioritizes physical perfection and emphasizes young women as the ideal beauty standard. On the flip side, men tend to be perceived as more attractive when they age due to societal ideals of masculinity, which prioritize traits such as maturity, wisdom, and experience. This is often referred to as the \u201csilver fox\u201d phenomenon, something that women experience the complete opposite of.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2018 there has been a 28% increase in Botox injections among people aged 20-29. There is a cultural obsession with youthfulness which has grown stronger in recent years. Young people now feel more pressured than ever to conform to societal expectations of what is considered attractive and youthful, leading to a spike in Botox. Young college-aged girls who feel pressured to conform to these societal standards will often get Botox under the guise of preventative Botox, when in reality it is to keep up youthful appearances.\n\nIt is possible to become dependent on Botox injections, even at a preventative level, and to feel insecure when access to them is not available. While Botox is generally safe, there are potential risks and side effects. Bruising at the injection site is the most common side effect, and it usually resolves on its own, but it can be more severe in some cases. Headaches, flu-like symptoms, and temporary eyelid drooping are also common side effects. Less common but more serious side effects include allergic reactions, difficulty breathing, muscle weakness, and nerve damage.\n```"}

(Photo by Julia Zara)\n\nBy Chris Bibona May 21, 2023 at 5:50 pm PDT\n\nContent warning: This opinion story references sexual abuse and misconduct that may be disturbing to some readers.\n\nEarly Friday afternoon, I saw former USC athletic director Mike Bohn\u2019s resignation statement on Twitter. It was such shocking news, only for my heart to sink even further as I read that he was leaving in order to be closer with his family as he addresses \u201congoing health challenges.\u201d It was unfortunate to hear that Bohn, who ushered USC Athletics through the COVID-19 pandemic and later navigated the school\u2019s move to the Big Ten Conference, would no longer be a part of the department\u2019s efforts. I felt terrible for him.\n\nBut as the news media and internet were running wild with the breaking news, USC President Carol Folt\u2019s statement on the matter stopped me in my tracks minutes later. \u201c...effective today.\u201d \u201c...thorough review of the athletics department, including its operations, culture and strategy.\u201d \u201c...time for a new direction.\u201d From that point on it was clear something was missing from the story. This didn\u2019t sound like Mike Bohn stepped down \u2014 this sounded like he was told out.\n\nAs if right on queue, the Los Angeles Times released their initial report that same afternoon, mentioning \u201cinternal criticism of [Bohn\u2019s] management of the athletic department.\u201d I must have read three or four different versions of the same LA Times story, it was being updated so often. Periodically, there would be a new quote or on-background account of some type of misconduct allegedly performed by Bohn. All of the sources pertaining to Bohn\u2019s behavior at USC were anonymous sources, fearing retaliation for their speaking out. They detailed inappropriate comments made by Bohn about female colleagues and their dress, hair or weight. Three sources at USC said Bohn was confronted several times about his comments, but they continued, according to The Times.\n\nI continued reading how USC had hired an attorney to review the athletic department earlier this year, and how she specialized in institutional response to sexual and gender-based harassment, violence and other forms of discrimination. The accounts from Bohn\u2019s previous stint at Cincinnati were far more jarring. Former Cincinnati head athletic trainer Robb Williams went on the record with accusations that Bohn made unwanted physical contact with women on several occasions, touching their shoulders and backs in ways that made them uncomfortable. One woman told The Times that she went to a Title IX officer to discuss what she believed to be inequitable treatment from Bohn. She was one of five women at Cincinnati who told The Times that he created a toxic work environment for women.\n\nIf these former co-workers of Bohn were so willing to speak to The Times about his misconduct, what excuse does USC have for not identifying and addressing this behavior during Bohn\u2019s hiring process? Surely there had to be some sort of background check or screening that USC made before hiring Bohn in 2019, but even now when the word is out, it\u2019s crickets from the administration.\n\nThe writing was on the wall months ago, and yet no officials at USC are willing to read it \u2014 even after The Times put it in print for all to see. It is the passivity by USC leadership that bothers me the most. Bohn, who was just recognized in 2022 as the athletic director of the year by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics, \u201cresigns\u201d on a Friday afternoon while spring sports are still in action, and we are just supposed to believe it was a mutual parting? Only for The LA Times to publish minutes later over a dozen accounts of alleged misconduct by Bohn? What an embarrassing turn of events. Not to mention, a huge slap in the face to women at USC \u2014 especially to those who might have had an uncomfortable experience with Bohn in the workplace.\n\nIt\u2019s shameful that USC administrators feel no obligation to immediately address the allegations, or share in detail the findings from the investigation that apparently were enough to part ways with Bohn. Instead, they let the LA Times expose the darker side of the story yet again. I would think after paying $1.1 billion in sexual abuse settlements two years ago that USC would act more definitively with issues of that nature, but I stand corrected. But of course, it was USC\u2019s tendency toward secrecy that allowed George Tyndall to knowingly prey on women for nearly 30 years at the school\u2019s student health clinic. It is that same tendency that allows Bohn to depart from USC with no shame for his actions.\n\nIt\u2019s clear to me that USC prioritizes whatever sort of reputation it thinks it\u2019s preserving by staying quiet over the health, safety and security of the women within the institution. There is a systemic quirk at USC that influences leadership to remain unassertive on matters of sexual harassment and abuse that allows those very issues to persist. If university heads are not willing to address the misconduct of staff in a direct and transparent manner, then the institution cannot even begin to break down its pattern of abuse and harassment.\n```"}

Like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame or Pro Football Hall of Fame, the organization honors individuals who have made an impact in their respective industries.\n\nThe event was held at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles and included a red carpet event and a live concert with Queen Nation, a tribute band to Queen. Among this year's nominees are K-pop artist Lisa from Blackpink, actors Ram Charan and Gemma Chan, California attorney general Rob Bonta and Nintendo as their first corporate nominee. This includes several posthumous nominations including ones for Freddie Mercury and Ryuichi Sakamoto.\n\nThe mission of Asian Hall of Fame is to \u201cpromote Asian artistic excellence and cross-cultural narratives.\u201d President and CEO Maki Hsieh explains the vision behind their festivities for this year in particular. \u201cWe do honor great people, amazing people like Blackpink\u2019s Lisa and Steve Aoki and his father, Rocky Aoki, but [it] really is to come together as a unified voice in order to overcome the bias against Asians,\u201d Hsieh says. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re seeing escalating rhetoric. Asians are being accused of being communist, anti-American and deceitful, and we\u2019re just here to show that Asians are not the enemy and we\u2019re here to contribute.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hsieh, the event previously inducted just four to six individuals, but this year they chose to announce thirty nominees. Out of the thirty, twelve will be officially inducted in a ceremony in October.\n\nAsian Hall of Fame was founded 19 years ago by philanthropist Karen Wong and her Seattle-based organization the Robert Chinn Foundation. Wong spoke about the importance of recognizing individuals from a wide range of professional backgrounds. \u201c[Asian Hall of Fame] honors everybody in all different fields, from the entertainment industry to sports to engineers and technology,\u201d said Wong. \u201cWe wanted to make everyone aware of their accomplishments not just in our own community, but also the broader community of everyone.\u201d\n\nThis work is especially valuable given how Asian representation in media continues to be a pressing issue in the United States. Asian Hall of Fame is just one of the organizations looking to move the conversation forward by spotlighting individuals that can inspire others.\n\nMiss Universe Japan 2021 Juri Watanabe attended the event to present a few of the nominees. After a career in tech, she is now pursuing acting in Los Angeles. She reflects on her own experiences, discussing the desperate need for Asian visibility. \u201cI think at least [for] me growing up as an immigrant child, I had a lot of difficulty with my identity,\u201d she said. \u201cI would look at TV and I wouldn\u2019t see that many Asian people in media and I would think like my problems are not well represented or I don\u2019t see myself represented on screen. So you feel belittled sometimes, right? And I feel that\u2019s why Asian representation is so important. I made it my mission to have that be my platform.\u201d\n\nThat is apparent in spaces like the entertainment industry where better representation is still an ongoing process. Actress Ren Hanami (\u201cStar Trek: Picard,\u201d \u201cRaya and the Last Dragon,\u201d \u201cCriminal Minds\u201d) was inducted in 2021 and continues to support the Asian Hall of Fame through their charity work. She says that despite progress from the recognition of actors like Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan at the latest Academy Awards, the road ahead is long.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still not a level playing field,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we\u2019re seeing more of an influx in the entertainment industry, at least films and TV programs, from Asia which is exciting. However, in America, Asian Americans are in a weird position of we\u2019re not like Asians from Asia, but we\u2019re not seen as Americans because of what we look like.\u201d\n\nBut Hanami is optimistic, and she feels that supporting organizations like Asian Hall of Fame and their related philanthropy is a step in the right direction. \u201cThe things that they\u2019re working on are things that I\u2019m passionate about,\u201d she said. \u201cHappy that I\u2019m part of the solution now, and Asian Hall of Fame is giving me that opportunity.\u201d\n\nBeyond external perceptions and opportunities, however, Watanabe hopes that people within the Asian community can be proud of their culture through their work in various industries. \u201cIt took a bit of time for me to really appreciate my heritage and my culture, and once I realized that that\u2019s such an important part of [my] development, I actually was able to gain so much confidence,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I started to connect with my Japanese and Korean side and be proud of that heritage that I have, my confidence \u2013 not in an arrogant way \u2013 changed and it opened up so many more opportunities.\u201d\n\nIn making known Asian excellence, the organization encourages those within the community to use their background as a strength. To the global community, it pushes for the expansion of opportunity and recognition of trailblazers, visionaries and icons across all industries.\n\nThe official Asian Hall of Fame induction ceremony will be held on October 21 where 12 of the 30 nominees will be selected.\n```"}

Barbara Lee faces fundraising titans in the race for CA Senate seat\n\nThough her decades-long career makes Rep. Lee qualified for the U.S. Senate seat, will her competitors\u2019 fundraising efforts be enough to overtake her for a top-two ballot slot?\n\nU.S. Congresswoman Barbara Lee speaking with attendees at the 2019 California Democratic Party State Convention at the George R. Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco, California. (Photo courtesy of Gage Skidmore)\n\nBy Hannah Joy May 17, 2023 at 9:54 am PDT\n\nRep. Barbara Lee will have to raise more money for her U.S. Senate campaign than she\u2019s ever needed in her decades-long career, as she\u2019s up against two fundraising juggernauts. The key question ahead of next year\u2019s all-party primary becomes: Can Lee raise enough money to compete, or at least to make the top-two ballot in November 2024?\n\nGolden State Senate races historically cost on average more than $9.3 million and this race in particular promises to be the most expensive and intensive in history. California is the most populous state and boasts more than 20 million voters. Its varied, individual media markets are among the most expensive in the nation for the sort of television advertising that becomes necessary given the state\u2019s expansive geography. By comparison, other statewide races could cost as little as a few million dollars.\n\nKatie Porter and Adam Schiff have proven they can raise large sums. The most Lee has ever raised is $2 million, and that was for the congressional seat in the East Bay Area that she\u2019s held for 25 years.\n\n\u201cFrom a comparative standpoint, Barbara Lee doesn\u2019t really have any money starting out with and because her seat has been a safe Democratic seat for as long as she\u2019s held it, she\u2019s never really had to raise the kind of funds that certainly a Katie Porter, who sits in a very competitive seat or even an Adam Schiff, who once upon a time was in a more competitive seat, has had to raise,\u201d said Jacob Rubashkin, an analyst with Inside Elections in Washington.\n\nAccording to the Federal Election Commission, Lee has raised $1.1 million, spent $101,000 and had $1.2 million in cash on hand as of March 31. Porter had raised $4.5 million, and Schiff had raised $6.5 million by the same date. These numbers give a glimpse of what lies ahead and perhaps indicate who has the financial strength to reach voters in the California election cycle.\n\nLee has a total of 1,163 donors. The three states that Lee received the highest contributions from are California (939), New York (61), and Colorado (30). Nearly 400 of these donors donated between the amounts of $1,000 to $4,000 to Lee\u2019s campaign. They are mostly not employed, retired, or self-employed.\n\nOn the other hand, 29 contributors are employed by universities, two contributors are doctors in Illinois and California, and 16 contributors are lawyers in California, New York or Florida. Lee received contributions from civic leaders including state Sen. Nancy Skinner, Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland, and Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. She also received contributions from Bishop Bob Jackson of Acts Full Gospel Church in California and Pastor Grainger Browning of Ebenezer AME church in Maryland.\n\nOn Monday, May 8 Lee announced the endorsement of former Georgia General Assembly House Minority Leader and Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. She has also been endorsed by Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, Attorney General Rob Bonta, Treasurer Fiona Ma, Controller Malia Cohen, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, Congressman Ro Khanna; just to name a few.\n\nPorter had 9,102 contributors and Schiff had 7,945. Even supporters recognize Lee is at a disadvantage when it comes to dollars, and analysts looking at the race have identified what she needs to do.\n\n\u201cBarbara Lee knows she can\u2019t run the Senate race like she ran the House race. And I don\u2019t think she plans to. In years past, candidates have found a way to solve the money problem, which is by tapping into this nationwide donor base that has really become activated in Democratic circles from 2018 onward. That\u2019s what Lee needs to do, develop that kind of nationwide fundraising base,\u201d said Rubashkin.\n\nThe California Senate race is unique because at least three prominent Democrats are campaigning to raise enough money to land in the top-two primary. Once the candidate makes it to the top-two primary they will then work to secure votes in the general election for a seat that hasn\u2019t been open since retiring Sen. Dianne Feinstein first won in 1992. This means that with California having a top-two primary system and the nature of voter leaning in the state, the two candidates on the ballot will likely be Democrats in the general election.\n\nThe top-two primary system puts candidates from any party on a single ballot and the two top candidates regardless of party advance to duel in the November general election. All the candidates in the race represent different parts of California. Lee, 76, represents the East Bay area which has become one of the most liberal regions in the country. Porter, 49, represents a community in Orange County that is politically divided. Schiff, 62, represents Hollywood and Burbank which is where he lives, but the district also runs north of Los Angeles.\n\nThis geographic element shapes the outcome of voter support especially when there\u2019s a looming question of if voters will feel a geographic loyalty to an L.A. or East Bay area candidate. When Lee announced her candidacy via Twitter on February 21, she proclaimed she has \u201cnever backed down from doing what\u2019s right. And I never will.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalifornians deserve a strong, progressive leader who has delivered real change .#BarbaraLeeSpeaksForMe ,\u201d she continued, in a tweet that received 943,800 engagements.\n\nLee is the highest-ranking Black woman appointed to House Democratic leadership, serving as co-chair of the Policy and Steering Committee. She has said she believes that real change in California is needed in areas such as representation, inflation, the high costs of child care, among other issues.\n\nDemocratic Party voters have proven that they value representation. Both Schiff and Porter are white. But, if elected in 2024, Lee would make history joining an institution, which currently has no Black women senators.\n\n\u201cWhat Barbara Lee brings is that she is the only Black woman in the race. There are no Black women in the Senate. And Democratic voters in recent years have shown that that\u2019s something that they really care about. They care about representation,\u201d Rubashkin said.\n\n\u201cThis is not acceptable that in a body of 100, there are none. I think that\u2019s going to be a compelling argument for her, not just in terms of voter persuasion, but in terms of building up a donor network.\u201d\n\nWhile trying to build her network, Lee\u2019s campaign is aware of her financial disadvantage. Lee\u2019s campaign said in a statement she may not have the fundraising prowess of her competitors but that she is capable of raising enough money to place in the top two and move on to the general election.\n\n\u201cThe Congresswoman has always said she doesn\u2019t need as much money as her opponents. She just needs enough money to get through the top-two primary. The other candidates in this race can\u2019t buy a decades-long record of progressive accomplishment like Barbara Lee\u2019s. She has the record that her opponents wish they had and Democratic voters want to vote for,\u201d Lee\u2019s campaign reiterated in a statement.\n\nThe Lee, Porter and Schiff campaigns did not respond to 12 phone and email requests for comment.\n\nEven though money can be a determining factor in this election, Rubashkin believes that in order to win the California race the candidate must be the full package. The candidate should be able to fundraise, connect with people, and secure votes.\n\n\u201cYou want to have it all because you can have the best voting record, you can have the deepest ties, you can have the most kind of consistency or the most kind of calibrated ideological position relative to the electorate. But if people don\u2019t know who you are, if people don\u2019t know all those things about you, it\u2019s tough to get them to vote for you,\u201d Rubashkin said.\n\n\u201cShe does have that longevity, because she does have that voting record, and that history in the state. \u201cAnd so even though she doesn\u2019t have the money, she\u2019s still a force to be reckoned with,\u201d Rubashkin said.\n\nDe\u2019Shawn Woolridge, who is the former Pittsburg Unified School District president and member of the Democratic Club, believes that money is not everything because Lee still has her name that carries weight in the House and the community.\n\n\u201cShe may not have the pocketbook for this election. But she does have a name. She\u2019s been in the game for a long period of time with a clue as to people\u2019s knowledge, their stories, and the group she\u2019s targeting,\u201d Woolridge said.\n\nThe main reason Woolridge gives as to why Lee has not raised that kind of money for the Senate race is that \u201cshe\u2019s been out there in the trenches doing the work.\u201d\n\nTim Vincent, the President of Brothers of the Desert, which is a nonprofit organization that provides support for Black gay men and allies in the Coachella Valley, agrees with Woolridge on how money is a disadvantage in this race but said it does not count Lee out of the race.\n\n\u201cI think that puts people at a deficit, but I don\u2019t think it puts them out. How much money she has or how much money she\u2019s raising. I mean, that matters for her. But it doesn\u2019t matter to me in terms of my allegiance or my interest in supporting her,\u201d Vincent said.\n\nVincent supports Lee because of the way she can appeal to the average voter through her personal life story. In her campaign launch video, Lee described herself as \u201cthe girl they didn\u2019t allow in who couldn\u2019t drink from the water fountain, who had an abortion in a back alley when they all were illegal.\u201d She said she \u201cescaped a violent marriage and became a single mom, a homeless mom, a mom who couldn\u2019t afford childcare and brought her kids to class with her.\u201d\n\nWoolridge noted how a lot of campaigns are not always won by who has the most money, but by who can tell the best story about who they are, what they can do, who has a vision of what their state should look like, and who sees the needs of everyday folks.\n\n\u201cAnd I think Barbara recounts that because not only does she have it, she lived it. So she understands we can go to our office and say, I\u2019m homeless. She understands when you come to her office and say, I\u2019m struggling. And that\u2019s something money could never buy,\u201d Wooldridge said.\n\nEver since Lee was first elected to the House in 1998, many have viewed her as a fighter for social justice, more so in 2001 when she was the only member of Congress to vote against the Afghanistan war resolution.\n\nDue to Lee\u2019s longevity in the House, she has built connections in the political realm but it has given voters the time to doubt her capabilities because of her age.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been around for longer than both Katie Porter and Adam Schiff and for some that is a weakness,\u201d said Rubashkin.\n\n\u201cI think certainly her age has already kind of come into play with how some people are talking about this race but also the fact that she has such a wealth of political relationships to draw upon as opposed to Katie Porter who is relatively new on the scene.\u201d\n\nPerhaps trying to address people who have made comments about Lee\u2019s tenure and age, she said in a three-minute campaign kick-off video, \u201cFor those who say my time has passed, well, when does making change go out of style? I don\u2019t quit. I don\u2019t give up. Come on. That\u2019s not in my DNA.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s election would change the Democratic Party because, in prior years, there have only been two Black women holding seats in the Senate: Kamala Harris, who represented California before being elected as vice president, and Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois.\n\nLooking back at last year\u2019s cycle, two Black candidates had the opportunity to change the numbers: Cheri Beasley of North Carolina and Val Demings of Florida. Both Democratic candidates competed in Republican-leaning states that favored their opponents, even though they surpassed them in fundraising.\n\nAccording to FEC records, Demings raised more than $70 million for her Senate bid as of mid-October, while her opponent, Sen. Marco Rubio, raised slightly more than half of that. In North Carolina, Beasley raised $34 million while her Republican rival Rep. Ted Budd brought in about a third of that.\n\nDemings and Beasley have shown how Black women candidates represent more than just working hard to secure votes and funds in trending red states; these women have become the party\u2019s strongest.\n\nDemings lost in November by 16.4% in Florida and Beasley lost by 3.2% in North Carolina.\n\nVoters will have the first opportunity to weigh in during the primary election on March 5, 2024. Californians will make their final decision during the general election on November 5, 2024.\n```"}

Even as television shows and movies are supposed to be manifestations of the human experience, there exist so few stories about breathing polluted air, experiencing life-changing hurricanes and droughts, or several other disasters that are increasingly becoming normal. That makes one wonder: is Hollywood the greatest climate denier of all major institutions?\n\nScott Z. Burns and Dorothy Fortenberry are trying to change that narrative with their new show Extrapolations, piloting the future of climate storytelling within Hollywood. An Apple TV+ special, Extrapolations consists of eight episodes that tell several international, intergenerational, and interconnected climate stories set between 2037 to 2070. The audience starts their journey in the middle of a dystopian future, where world leaders at COP42 (a futuristic version of the annual U.N. climate conference) are saddled with making difficult decisions as the consequences of the climate crisis ramp up. In this world, not a single species on the planet is safe, especially not humans.\n\nAlong the way we meet the last blue whale on earth (who is voiced by actress Meryl Streep), a stepmother and stepson duo that take drastic taboo measures to combat rising temperatures, a powerful billionaire who believes capitalism will save the planet, and many more characters with equally compelling narratives. Each episode highlights a specific and unique climate story that gives us a peek into what our future may look like if meaningful action is not taken today.\n\nWhile I have always had concern for the future inhabitants of our planet, Extrapolations has managed to emotionally connect me with them, even if they may not exist yet. I can finally visualize the faces of the future generations our planet will be passed down to.\n\nDuring a conversation with Burns (who is the creator of the show) and Fortenberry (executive producer and writer), it was clear that their aim was to shift the focus from facts to concern about humanity, about real people.\n\nAG: What sort of climate story were you trying to tell with Extrapolations? What did you want people to get out of it?\n\nBurns: \u201cExtrapolations is storytelling to help people reconsider the world around them. And I guess my belief is that stories do shape people if you get them to metabolize them. And that\u2019s why I did this.\u201d\n\nFortenberry: \u201cI think for people who have been paying attention to the climate crisis there\u2019s a sense of reality. Even though the show is actually making things up, we\u2019re extrapolating a future. Extrapolations feels like it\u2019s connected to all of the real world problems that we are actually facing. And then I think for people who are less aware of climate change, I think the show has a chance to open up that process.\u201d\n\nAG: I read that your goal for the Extrapolations team was to make sure that people sit down for an hour to watch your show, that you aim to entertain them. Where is that line between entertainment and science?\n\nBurns: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to imagine the future, you need it to be informed by science. And so that\u2019s where we\u2019d start. What are the things that are likely to happen in the next 50 years? We actually laid them out after talking to experts. And then, my really strong belief was, okay, put that in your mind but now think about stories that you love. Think about love stories, think about arguments with parents, think about what it\u2019s like to grow up in the world and pick a point on that timeline, and put that story there. Go write the climate change version of Midnight Run, Fail Safe, or Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf.\u201d\n\nFortenberry: \u201cWe always wanted to focus on having characters who had emotional things going on in their lives... and to really focus always on the question of intimate human relationships. We tried really hard to understand all the science, but it\u2019s not a PowerPoint. You know, if someone wants to see a PowerPoint about climate change, you should see a PowerPoint. This is a bad substitute for watching a PowerPoint. This isn\u2019t a description of what will necessarily happen. These are extrapolations.\u201d\n\nAG: How did you come to the decisions about what environmental stances would be taken?\n\nBurns: \u201cMy answer to your question is going to be really simple, which is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my job to answer a question. I think my job is to ask questions. And if they\u2019re artfully asked, I think they land inside of the audience. And they follow you around for a little while, keep tapping on the shoulder going, \u2018What\u2019s the right thing?\u2019\u201d\n\nFortenberry: \u201cI think the first thing we\u2019re trying to communicate is: wouldn\u2019t it be great if we didn\u2019t have to make these very difficult decisions? Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we didn\u2019t have to wrestle between either losing whales forever or having them live in a DNA vault somewhere, you know, to end up in a zoo, or AI or something else? That\u2019s a question I wish we didn\u2019t have to answer. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if the various institutions that we have entrusted to solve this problem \u2013\u2013 whether it\u2019s the UN or the United States government, or corporations \u2013\u2013 were able to fix this?\u201d\n\nAG: So, what is the future for climate stories and what advice do you have for their storytellers?\n\nFortenberry: \u201cThere are infinite ways of tackling the climate story. Extrapolations is eight versions... and look how different they are from each other! If someone else wants to go out and make another climate show that is in a totally different genre, or they love the thriller parts and they hate the romance parts, great. Then they should make a climate thriller! If someone looks at all of this and goes, \u2018Oh, my God, I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t do a teen comedy genre! Why isn\u2019t this climate Clueless?\u2019, that\u2019s amazing. They should go write that movie. Extrapolations being able to have so many different tones and stories is partly an invitation to anybody who\u2019s interested in making climate storytelling to say there are no genre limits. A climate story does not have to have a natural disaster to be a climate story.\u201d\n\nBurns: \u201cIt\u2019s no longer the storyteller\u2019s job to convince the audience that climate change is happening... Now, we move into a different space, which is convincing the audience that every day before this kills you, you live with it, and you live with it with the agency of making decisions that will keep it from killing you if you choose.\u201d\n\nStream the limited eight-episode series on Apple TV+.```"}

(Michael Chow/USC).\n\nBy Micah Chow, Katherine Chen, Colin Maclay, Mike Ananny, Nell Kerndt, and Lingaire Ofosuhene\n\nMay 16, 2023, at 9:00 pm PDT\n\nThis semester, our USC Annenberg class titled \u201cClimate Stories\u201d has been taking a tour of different ways to see and narrate issues surrounding the climate crisis. We\u2019ve looked at the emotions fueling climate anxiety and action, how scientists and journalists see the crisis and opportunities for change, how online platforms shape climate conversations, and what it might take to create a fossil fuel-free Los Angeles. We\u2019ve read, watched, listened to, and prototyped new, playful ways to tell climate stories \u2013\u2013 everything from short-form documentaries, photo essays, zines, and speculative fiction screenplays to performance art installations, poetry, first-person memoir, and interactive technologies. And we\u2019ve been learning to see climate stories everywhere \u2013 including on the USC campus.\n\nHere we want to share with you different ways to see climate stories on campus. These short stories, presented to you in different media and genres, are meant to be quick, bite-sized peeks into how the concepts of climate and sustainability appear at USC. Rather than being complete pictures or full accounts, these \u201cstory stubs\u201d are short prompts and provocations intended to give you new ways to see and talk about the climate crisis.\n\nTake a look at how we\u2019ve been seeing campus from a climate lens, and add your own stories to Instagram under #campusClimateStories!\n\nSTORIES\n\nMichael Chow: \u201cWhat if we surveyed campus climate feelings?\u201d\n\nKatherine Chen: \u201cPlastic feels at home in your body\u201d\n\nColin Maclay and Mike Ananny: How could biking at USC be better?\n\nNell Kerndt: \u201cSunny Southern California turns soggy: USC campus flooded by rain\u201d\n\nLingaire Ofosuhene: \u201cHow might we imagine a different USC?\u201d\n\nWhat if we surveyed campus climate feelings? by Michael Chow\n\nLast September, I had my first real brush with climate anxiety. As I sat in the Annenberg Media Center trying to seek relief from one of the worst heat waves in Californian history, one of the journalists in the media center exclaimed that a rare hurricane warning was announced in Southern California. Sure enough, the heavens soon opened and dumped rain all over Los Angeles. That week, we saw both rain and heat records simultaneously broken in Southern California. I have been confronted with news of glaciers collapsing, polar bears suffering, and oil rigs bursting, but watching the weather completely change in a blink of an eye was a uniquely disorientating feeling that I had never experienced firsthand until now.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t know what to do with that feeling \u2013\u2013 or where to go for guidance or who else might share the feeling or what could be done about it. That experience helped me ask: how do USC students feel about climate change? Where can we go for help with those feelings? How might those feelings spur action? So, I decided to offer a survey (coming soon!) to USC students, as a way to understand and act on campus feelings about climate change.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick peek at the questions:\n\nA prototype of the climate feelings survey soon to be offered by USC Annenberg. (Michael Chow/USC).\n\nPlastic feels at home in your body by Katherine Chen\n\nA graphic representing the plastics in our bodies. (Katherine Chen/USC).\n\nI am everywhere, in your food, in your water, in your everyday life. I am plastic. Unlike you, my form of travel is unwanted. I go through your body when you take a sip from your drink at Dulce just before your 9:00 am class. I, too, enjoy making matcha lattes my personality. But you, a human being, force me to change my personality into an enemy of your body.\n\nAs I spend time in your body, I take notice of the black decorations on your lungs from all those years of breathing smoggy air. Black stripes were pretty on trend in the early 2000\u2032s; perhaps it\u2019s coming back as a fashion trend? The sun is beaming down and the sky is clear, yet you shiver and take short breaths as you struggle to walk from Dulce to Wallis Annenberg Hall, your heart beating intensely.\n\nOn your way, you make a stop at the USC Bookstore. There you stare at your options of snacks, from granola bars to chocolate bars, from makeshift charcuterie boards to tiny cups of almonds and cheese, and then from gummy bears to random cups of cereal. I judge you silently as you take one extra look at the Lucky Charms cereal bowl and then settle on the Twix chocolate bars. Nevertheless, I always enjoy meeting more plastics like me.\n\nYou put the chocolate bar in your newly purchased environmentally friendly backpack. They say it\u2019s made out of 10% recycled plastic water bottles, it was a costly purchase; it\u2019s alright though, they donate 0.25% of their revenue to save the Amazon forest. You take a deep breath as you walk into Wallis Annenberg Hall as your senses pick up a new source of energy. Coffee. Ah, yes. We all enjoy a freshly brewed cup of Italian coffee made with beans that travel thousands of miles, coffee that you end up chugging as you attempt to increase your cortisol levels.\n\nI was disappointed that you ignored your chocolate bar, but was warmed as you made your way towards Cafe Annenberg and you ordered... a fruit cup! I am just as delighted as you are for making the executive decision for some natural earthly nutrition. Soon, my friends from the country of plastic cups and our sister country of plastic forks are about to have a party right in your body.\n\nYou scramble to shove fruits down your throat as you wait for the elevator up to the second floor. As you settle into your class that seems less than interesting, I network with my newfound friends. We talked about their journey: being born in a factory, traveling through the ocean, being in trucks, ships, planes, and arriving at the coffee shop. We may not need to breathe, but surely we create more carbon emissions through our travels every year than you do by taking short, ragged breaths (For reference, you create 839.5 pounds of carbon dioxide a year by breathing; we create 440 million metric tons by just going from one place to another).\n\nMy goodness, when I have finally settled into your warm body, you force me to leave. I travel through the toilet and end up at the ocean. It is beautiful here. Lots of creatures, plants, rocks, and other things I can\u2019t name. There are much more like me here. The demographic must be intensely disproportionate! It\u2019s okay, I value diversity. I\u2019ve met a few others. Sodium hypochlorite, petroleum distillates, phenol and cresol, ammonia and formaldehyde, they\u2019ve become my new best friends. I learnt that there are more of me in the oceans than fish! Isn\u2019t that awesome? I love to live somewhere I feel accepted.\n\nHow could biking at USC be better? by Colin Maclay and Mike Ananny\n\nWhile Los Angeles weather and the USC campus can feel like they\u2019re made for biking, the reality doesn\u2019t match the promise. The freedom to escape traffic and the joy of zipping around at just the right speed to appreciate the world sound very appealing, all while supporting USC\u2019s commitment to carbon neutrality.\n\nOur experience, though, is more complicated. From pedaling around campus and navigating all the rules about where you can and can\u2019t cycle to creatively connecting to bike racks and keeping seats dry, biking is a way of life at USC. But how could it be better, what could change, and how might we reimagine biking at USC?\n\nDuring one of our many rain storms this semester, we took a walk around campus looking for the \u201cinfrastructure\u201d that supports biking at USC. We tried to experience campus as cyclists do and ask how stories of campus cycling are also stories of campus climate. We took dozens of photos and made countless observations, but we offer here three ways to see campus climate through cycling \u2013\u2013 as mobility, security, and maintenance.\n\nAnd we invite you to answer the question: what\u2019s your biking experience like at USC, and how do you think it could be better?\n\nBike lanes in campus blocked by vehicles and people. (Colin Maclay and Mike Ananny/USC).\n\nMobility: Staying in my Lane, if I can find it!\n\nWhether it\u2019s walking, biking, skateboarding, scooting, or wheeling on campus, there\u2019s no shortage of ways that people get around. But we saw Department of Public Safety cars parked in bike lanes, facilities trucks blocking cycle paths, students fighting with cars for bike lane access, and walkers and scooters straying into the paths that are marked as just for bikes. Without protected and respected paths, cycling at USC can be stressful, dangerous, and not an appealing option.\n\nHow could moving around campus on a bike be different? What could change today, and what larger vision of campus mobility could we work toward?\n\nBike racks, while available, are not well-designed on the USC campus. (Colin Maclay and Mike Ananny/USC).\n\nSecurity: Hacking bike rack life\n\nPeople try so many creative ways to \u201chack\u201d campus bike racks, showing that securing your bike at USC is hard work! Some struggle with bike racks that are not designed to lock the front tire to the frame; others have to lock bikes to fences because there are no racks. Several other issues exist, from fighting with scooters to abandoned bike frames and dead locks for rack space \u2013\u2013 it can be hard to walk away from your bike and feel like it\u2019s safe.\n\nWe counted at least 4 types of bike racks around campus \u2013\u2013 which come with no instructions \u2013\u2013 and countless plastic bags that try to keep seats dry. How could \u201crack life\u201d improve? What could be changed today about securing your bike at USC, and what bigger changes could come if we better valued the campus cycling experience?\n\nFew resources exist on the USC campus to fix bikes. (Colin Maclay and Mike Ananny/USC).\n\nMaintenance: Sustaining bikes & bike life\n\nAt some point, all cyclists get a flat tire, a bent wheel, or a broken seat. Bike maintenance and repair is a fact of life for a biker. Yet we saw only one dilapidated and poorly marked bike repair station, a mobility hub that happened to be closed when we visited. Other than that, there was an enterprising local fixer offering bike repairs from their truck. So little resources for so many bikes.\n\nWhile these are all well-intentioned and good steps to a better campus bike life, how could bike maintenance and repair at USC be better? Do you know where to go to fix your bike? Can you afford to get it fixed? And if not, do you know how to do it yourself? What could change, what could be better, and what is an ambitious vision of campus bike maintenance that could keep people rolling along as well as encourage new cyclists to give it a try?\n\nSunny Southern California turns soggy: USC campus flooded by rains by Nell Kerndt\n\nPhotographs of the USC campus during the rains. (Nell Kerndt/USC).\n\nOur region\u2019s nickname \u2018sunny Southern California\u2019 is not quite living up to expectations this year. This season, LA has already recorded more rain days than Seattle, making it the wettest winter in 18 years. This rain has brought with it visions of a flooded and awfully sleepy campus.\n\nI never noticed that most campus rain gutters let out onto concrete, instead of drains, on the ground or some rainwater capture and storage area. Soon, campus was dotted with not-so-tiny lakes, and skateboarding to class became impossible. The USC campus is beautifully curated to appease the eye but the infrastructure is simply not designed for the rain, especially not the kind of rain we have been experiencing this year.\n\nWhen rains happen, gutters clog, planters flood, and students hibernate. So where is all the water on campus going? With the heavy paving in South Central, it is becoming increasingly difficult for rainwater to infiltrate soil and recharge our groundwater. And so, stormwater runs off into our oceans \u2013\u2013 picking up debris, litter, road chemicals and more on its way \u2013\u2013 and causes harmful pollution to our sea.\n\nEven though LA is still in extreme drought, only a fifth of this extraordinary rain will be captured. Intense storm seasons like the one we witnessed this season are only expected to get worse and more common. So maybe with these increasing weather events, it is time USC rethinks its drainage infrastructure. Our climate is changing and so must our priorities.\n\nTo take a look at more photos of our city in the rain, click here!\n\nHow might we imagine a different USC? by Lingaire Ofosuhene\n\nHow might people on USC\u2019s campus imagine a Los Angeles outside of the realms of reality? How might people perceive and envision a city beyond its current form? I want to encourage people to use their creativity and imagination to explore the endless possibilities of what Los Angeles could be, to push the boundaries of the possible and open entirely new futures that we could work together to realize.\n\nUsing some photos of nature from the Huntington Gardens, I present contrasts between the city\u2019s artificial and natural environments. I want to challenge people to preserve natural habitats in urban spaces and highlight the benefits of incorporating nature into our daily lives.\n\nBy encouraging people to think beyond the constraints of reality, we can inspire new ideas and approaches to designing and developing urban environments that are sustainable and are inspired by nature.\n\nTake a look at this video and ask yourself \u2013 what could LA and USC be like if we challenged our imaginations?\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n\nBy Lyla Bhalla-Ladd May 15, 2023 at 7:42 pm PDT\n\nThe Met Gala is the most coveted invite in fashion. Hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, with the carpet on the iconic steps and a no-photos policy inside the exhibit, the Met Gala exudes an exclusive air, and has maintained it for all of Wintour\u2019s tenure. However, when Dixie D\u2019Amelio and Addison Rae took the carpet last May, some critics claimed that air was dissipating. The influencer presence at the 2022 Met Gala, and now at F1 races and fashion weeks, peaks a budding conversation about influencer culture and modern trend cycles muddying the pure waters of \u2018real\u2019 fashion.\n\nWhether it be the bastardization of runway shows, or the guest list at the Met Gala, it seems like everyone has a problem with the shift that\u2019s occurred in the past twenty years. The shift is that of the digital age catching up to celebrity culture. As the microtrend cycle shortens from twenty years to ten, the revolving door of influential people picks up pace, too. With that rise of the influencer\u2019s presence in fashion (and high fashion), critics have started to mislabel the concept of expanded access to fashion as diminished quality.\n\nThere is a hesitancy to accept the lowering gates of entry in fear of the \u2018riff raff\u2019 getting it, but there is another large theme at play. \u201cFashion in general has gotten away from that sort of stodgy, seasonal [norm],\u201d said Melissa Magsaysay, a fashion journalist who has worked for the LA Times. \u201cExclusivity has definitely been taken out.\u201d\n\nInfluencers have become a more modern term for what used to be just \u201cit-girls.\u201d There have always been it-girls and there have always been influential people whom designers dress and gain exposure with. But now, with the rise of social media and the age of the internet, influencer is an entire profession. No longer are it-girls just nepotism babies who have befriended designers and served as muses. Now, anyone can become an influencer. And with that, anyone can sit in the front row at fashion week.\n\nIt is a new age for fashion, but the same tricks are at play. While modern developments diversify and expand access, there can be a counterpoint based on a fear of diluted quality. Some may perceive this as a loss of gilded fashion culture. While it is true that influencers that seep into celebrity status change the way fashion marketing is done, this is not because those people are changing fashion. Rather, fashion has changed itself.\n\nBooth Moore, executive editor of Women\u2019s Wear Daily explains that influencers are merely a marketing example of how fashion has broadened to become more about lifestyle than it used to be when it was just about clothing. \u201cFashion has changed itself to become much more of a multimedia endeavor and also much more of a lifestyle,\u201d Moore said. \u201cCreative directors are expected to have their fingers on the pulse of music and arts and be able to have a cool group of friends and have a huge social media following and create a lifestyle or almost a club that people want to be a part of.\u201d\n\nMoore highlights this important shift that 21st Century arts are experiencing. The internet has caused all of the arts to merge and combine. The rise of social media coupled with the cultural pattern of identity politics has produced a system that rewards a diversified resume for winning the game of attention. In other words, anyone in the arts must check all different kinds of boxes to be considered an asset. Specialists are rare, and perhaps even less valued.\n\nIt is not enough anymore to simply be a model, or an actress or a designer. Now, the pressure is on how much one can capitalize off of their influence in many different fields. Fashion creative directors are musicians (see Pharell Williams) and directors (see Tom Ford). Every influencer we know is starting a makeup line or a fragrance, and some are even trying acting.\n\nThe opposition to this changing playing field is often championed by the \u201cslippery slope\u201d argument \u2013 that if influencers like Emma Chamberlain can host the Met Gala carpet, what\u2019s stopping anyone with the ability to go viral from being artistic and cultural leaders? The most important thing to parse in that statement is the concept of \u201canyone.\u201d The expansion of the industry has led to incredible access. It is good news that \u201canyone\u201d can make it now. You don\u2019t have to be the son of a seamstress in Italy to become the next McQueen. Now, anyone can go make it, because anyone can go viral.\n\nThe internet algorithms operate on an attention economy. An idea is as good as it is popular. While virality is not rare, it is also not all that it takes. Magsaysay said, \u201cThere [are] definitely still the tenets of what\u2019s expected to be a designer, like your point of view, some commercial viability, consistency, craftsmanship.\u201d It\u2019s important to remember that more accessibility does not inherently lower the bar, it lowers the gateway to entry. High fashion hopefuls still have to bring something worthy to the table to achieve real career success.\n\nWhat is more common than unique talent is unchecked 15-minutes-of-famers, who capitalize off of their virality. But the fears that those characters will dilute what is special at the pinnacle of the fashion industry has not proved true. Most influencers stay (and thrive) in the marketing sector. Their businesses are successful, but not world-building. We must stop blaming (and giving credit) to influencers for a dynamic industry that is bound to change with the times. Influencers are not a slippery slope, but rather tools that happen to be especially marketed towards young consumers on the platforms we use most. They are one aspect of a larger movement of leveraging celebrity culture to expand brand awareness. Brands have always had ambassadors and event presences, now they are simply evolving as the internet does.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/05/15/sc-unplugged-singer-songwriters-sofia-silvestri-and-meghan-chen-discuss-their-recent-song-fomo/", "response": "```\nSC Unplugged: Singer-songwriters Sofia Silvestri and Meghan Chen discuss their recent song \u201cFOMO\u201d\n\nSofia Silvestri and Meghan Chen are freshmen studying songwriting in the USC Thornton School of Music. Both artists grew up singing and playing music from the early ages of 6 and 5. Now at university, their pop single \u201cFOMO\u201d discusses the social pressure and layers of emotions behind the term \u2018fear of missing out.\u2019 Silvestri posted their original recording session to TikTok which caught the attention of over 1 million viewers. With collaboration from commenters, the songwriting duo released the song within a few months. The pair discuss the connection with their listeners and self-vulnerability that comes from their song-writing processes. Annenberg Media spoke with Silvestri and Chen to learn more about their collaboration, creative processes and release of \u201cFOMO.\u201d\n\nSilvestri: Hi, this is Sofia Silvestri. I\u2019m from the suburbs of Washington, D.C.. My major is songwriting, which is a pop performance emphasis, and I\u2019m a freshman. Chen: Hi, my name is Meghan Chen. I\u2019m a songwriting major as well. And I am a freshman and I\u2019m from Indiana.\n\nSilvestri: So for me, I would say my style is definitely a little bit of everything. As a songwriter, we\u2019re kind of trained to partake in a little bit of every single genre. But I would say my niche is kind of found in like ballads. I\u2019m very kind of inspired by Billy Joel and that kind of like piano-based songwriting. And so for me, as a songwriter, my role can be anywhere from creating the lyrics, creating the melody, creating the bass line, creating the top line. So it\u2019s a little bit of everything. Chen: Yeah. So for me, it\u2019s pretty similar. Again, to echo everything that Sofia said about songwriting, it\u2019s about kind of creating the arrangement behind the song, but also working with the melody and the lyrics and really focusing on like that narrative arc, so to speak. I would say my style. I also kind of dabble in a lot of different things, so I\u2019m trying to find sort of my niche right now, but I\u2019ve definitely done a lot of - I\u2019ve kind of dabbled in a little bit of like grunge, but I\u2019m also leaning towards that indie side of things with a little bit of a modern Asian influence. So I don\u2019t know if you know Ryuichi Sakamoto, but he has one of my favorite pieces of all time. And sometimes I take a little bit from those harmonies that [is] traditional to more like contemporary Asian music. And I use that in my style.\n\nSilvestri: When I was six years old, I had my first piano lesson. I\u2019ve told the story so many times I feel like it\u2019s written on the back of my hand. My first piano teacher, she was in a band like she was literally in a rock band and she was a songwriter. And so like one week I\u2019d be learning Mozart, and then the next week I\u2019d be writing like pop charts. And from a very young age, I learned the basic structure of a pop song, like verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus. And from there I just kind of started writing in shows, encouraging me forward no matter how like elementary my writing was. Because, like, I look back, like I have all the songs say it, and they were really funny. Like they were really simple, but she was always there, kind of like cheering me on. And I think that\u2019s kind of where I grew from. Chen: Yeah, I\u2019d say similarly, I started when I was five years old. I had my first piano lesson and for a long time I was just learning classical piano. But when I was around nine years old, I think I started beginning composing like piano pieces. And so from there, my piano teacher and my family really encouraged me to go on the composition track. So I took a lot of classical composition lessons. But I was always songwriting during that time period, and I always leaned more towards the songwriting side of things, but I was always within my training doing more classical things like classical piano, classical viola, and then classical composition were all things that I explored. But now I\u2019m obviously on the more pop side of things and I\u2019m grateful that all of the lessons I\u2019ve had, they\u2019ve allowed me to explore that side of me.\n\nSilvestri: So for me, like I mentioned before, my biggest music influence is definitely Billy Joel. I respect his writing so much and he actually, his big influences, are all classical composers. And in that same vibe, I\u2019m also very classically trained and classically inspired. So like a lot of my songs like Debussy and Ravel, Stravinsky, Rachmaninoff, like I take a lot of their pieces and analyze them and then write songs over those chords, you know? So it\u2019s definitely mainstream, wise Billy Joel, Adele, Sarah Bareilles and I love Lauv as well. So he\u2019s a big influence for me. To find inspiration for my music, it\u2019s anywhere between like my own personal experiences and also the experiences of others. I usually write a lot of songs that I don\u2019t exactly particularly resonate specifically with, but I feel like it\u2019s something that people can resonate with. And so even if I have a specific, you know, experience that I\u2019m writing from and I always try to make it more universal, so that people can resonate with it. Because I think those are the most impactful songs are when you write from a place of emotion and other people can resonate with that. Chen: Yeah, I\u2019d say for me, my biggest influences, I listened to a lot of Adele growing up, so that big like piano ballad really digging into like the emotional delivery. I think I took a lot from that musically. I also became a really big Phoebe Bridgers fan very recently, so I really like to pull inspiration from her lyrics and I like the kind of abstract way that she writes. And then overall, musically, I listened to a lot of video game and film soundtracks growing up, and I think that was an influence that really affected the way my melodies would come out. So I look back into some of the video games that I played when I was really young. I loved a lot of the Zelda games and I would hear those soundtracks over and over again and a lot of the melodies I come up with - it takes me back to some of those games that I would play when I was younger.\n\nChen: I don\u2019t say that I\u2019ve necessarily changed from that musical theater style of me because it\u2019s still in there and I still write for musical theater, but I just don\u2019t release a single from that without any context. I think I have a better understanding of what people want to listen to as a single. So for example, I just released a song that\u2019s called \u201cDamn Good Life,\u201d and it\u2019s more of like a pop rock single, and it\u2019s something that you can listen [to] as stand alone. And I think it\u2019s just that understanding of what really can be released and what can be promoted and what should probably stay under wraps. Silvestri: \u2018What should stay under wraps.\u2019 I love that. It\u2019s like every song is valid, but some of it just should Chen: Some of it shouldn\u2019t be out there, yeah. Silvestri: For me, I would say since like my first release, I\u2019ve definitely gone - like taken a deep dive into the realm of pop and R&B. It\u2019s funny because a lot of the songs that I write for me and a lot of the songs that people have heard me play in like classes are all like ballads and slow songs. But for some reason, every single song that I\u2019ve released since then are all like pop, R&B, like BPM\u2019s through the roof. But I think with that, you can experiment with different instrumentation and different instruments themselves. So I\u2019ve seen a lot of growth, particularly with like drum arrangements, because in pop songs like drums go hard, like there\u2019s so many drum tracks you don\u2019t want to know. But I think that\u2019s honestly, like the biggest place that I\u2019ve been able to develop in my own personal arrangement. Chen: Yeah no, I agree. I think part of the reason that we release so much more upbeat stuff, too, is because when we came here, we\u2019re now working with producers and when you release ballads, there\u2019s really less they can do with it. Silvestri: Yeah. Chen: And I think when you want to work with a producer and make something that\u2019s really produced, it\u2019s so much easier to work with the upbeat stuff in my opinion. So I think that\u2019s part of it, yeah.\n\nSilvestri: For me growing up, songwriting and music was always a part of my life. Like from elementary school I was always that girl that would play an original song at the talent show, like I was that person. But it was always an extracurricular activity. I was always very involved in school and very studious and like very type-A personality in terms of getting my work done and always being on the ball. So I think I always kind of envisioned myself doing a more like quote unquote marketable career in terms of - like I was hellbent on doing economics, like at an Ivy League school or something. And then actually it was my dad that pulled me aside and was like, \u2018I don\u2019t think you should do this. I think you should give music a shot.\u2019 I had some mentors that actually lived out in California that were vouching for this school. And I think when I had three different people telling me, like, \u2018We believe in you and you should do this.\u2019 I was like, \u2018All right, maybe I\u2019ll give it a shot.\u2019 And then I\u2019m ending up here. So I\u2019m glad I did it, too. I think I\u2019m finding that it\u2019s really a viable career and it\u2019s something that you can go in so many different directions with it. And it\u2019s not just like you have to be a pop star, you know. You go in so many different directions with that, which I think is really neat. Chen: I think I was really lucky to know what I wanted to do at such a young age. I think, well, I had a lot of voices in my ear. One of them was my piano teacher, and I\u2019m grateful that she pushed me in this direction. And my mom also was really instrumental in that. When I started writing music, they pushed me to continue to explore higher education in music. So when I was like ten or 11 years old, I knew which music colleges were out there to study this further. So I knew this was something that I wanted to do from a really young age. And I think I continue to want to do it as I\u2019m going through college. When I get out of college, I\u2019m going to still be doing music. I could see myself doing other things, but I just know that I\u2019d always come back to this. And even if I was focusing on something else full time, I\u2019d still want to come back to music even after that was over. So yeah, I\u2019ve had family who\u2019ve been like, \u2018Maybe you should be like a doctor.\u2019 Mostly the Asian side of my family has really been pushing like the doctor. Silvestri: I hate it when family members do that. Chen: I know they really like to do that. Silvestri: They\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, a songwriting major?\u2019 Yes! A songwriting major. Chen: It\u2019s been a lot of like, \u2018what if you just, like, did that on the side?\u2019 Silvestri: Right. Chen: Like, \u2018you can always just have that as a hobby,\u2019 which is, again, like a valid thing. But I think this path is also really great as well. We\u2019ll see. Silvestri: Just wait! Chen: We\u2019ll see how it works out.\n\nSilvestri: So yesterday we were in class and it was all the songwriters in my year. We have this one class that we share, which is like singing songwriting. So we do a class with Jeffrey Allen, who\u2019s like the best vocal teacher. Like, he works at the school and he\u2019s great. And so he had me sing and play a song. And so I like didn\u2019t prepare one. No one needs to know the fact that I didn\u2019t prepare, but I was going through the chord charts that I had saved on my phone. And I was like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll play the song that I wrote for my mom.\u2019 And essentially it was a reverse lullaby that I wrote for my mom. And everybody in the room was crying. And I think at that moment I was like, \u2018Yeah, this is what I do it for.\u2019 It\u2019s like resonating with other people and letting them feel stuff that they didn\u2019t even know that they could feel. You know? So I think that was a big like, \u2018Aha, you\u2019re doing the right thing\u2019 moment. Chen: Yeah, I love it when people cry. It\u2019s like it\u2019s really validating. I remember I went to this summer camp and I - I went to this summer camp. It was a songwriting summer camp and I was in a room with this one girl. And we\u2019d both had a really rough day, and we just needed to like, sit down and cry. And she showed me one of her songs and it was absolutely like one of the most touching things. And then I also played her one of my songs and she knew the context behind it. There was this one person at the camp that I was like, \u2018I really had a lot of feelings for. \u2018And she knew. Silvestri: Camp crush! Chen: Yeah, yeah, so and I played it for her and I looked up and she was like sobbing. And in that moment I knew songwriting - it was really eye opening because songwriting didn\u2019t seem to be just this, like, stand alone thing. Like once you know the story and you\u2019re able to tell the story behind it and people connect with you and people have that empathy and put themselves in your shoes, it\u2019s really like this otherworldly form of connection. I always think about that night because it just reminds me how much this is about communication and it\u2019s about reaching that place that no one else can reach. So that\u2019s a really great memory for me, as well.\n\nSilvestri: For me, I would say my biggest challenge is not overworking myself and allowing myself the space to take time to practice and to grow. I think that since getting here, it\u2019s been kind of this like inner pressure that I put on myself to like write a song a day, release like 20 songs this year, sign to a label, get my name out there, do do do. And I think I kind of fell into that trap like first semester and just like that comparison game that you can play because like people in Thornton, they\u2019re not only talented, they\u2019re ambitious and passionate and dedicated and hard working. And so it\u2019s so easy to get into that mind trap of comparing yourself and being like, \u2018I\u2019m not doing enough, I need to do more.\u2019 But I think that\u2019s definitely the biggest challenge that I face. Also because of my personality, I just want to do the best, so yeah. Chen: I just want to like, steal the answer like that is so, so relatable, especially coming from where we come from. Usually I would say I\u2019d echo most of the people in our major that where they come from, they\u2019re the only people doing what they do. Silvestri: They\u2019re the best at what they do. Chen: Yeah, they\u2019re the best in the room when they come in here and suddenly everyone is working just as hard as them. And you compare yourself a lot. You really do. And it\u2019s hard to just keep yourself on your own path. So yeah, I think I would completely agree with that. I\u2019d also say for me, I think I\u2019m in this transition right now from doing music because I\u2019m doing the things that I feel like doing in the moment that I feel like doing them to transitioning to more of this like scheduled, I don\u2019t want to say factory-like, but, you know, being able to manufacture something when you need to, especially in the songwriting world. I\u2019m transitioning from writing in my room whenever I get an idea to writing in a session which is scheduled and with other people expecting you to have these ideas at a certain time period. So I think it\u2019s that transition from hobby to professional that\u2019s really a struggle for me right now, but something that I\u2019m really trying to work on.\n\nSilvestri: So essentially, me and Meghan, I reached out to Meghan. I was like, \u2018Hey, we should write.\u2019 And she was like, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s do it.\u2019 And so we got together and we essentially wrote the song in Gateway in I think under two hours together. And I videotaped the entire thing because I had just started my TikTok page. And essentially what I was doing was recording all of my songwriting sessions and editing them down to like a minute long video and then posting that and showing people the behind the scenes of a songwriting process. So I edited it down and I sent it to her and she was like, \u2018This is so cool.\u2019 And then I finally posted it, and from there I would say it just kind of took off. It\u2019s crazy how much traction we got and like, virality really picked it up. So then what was it like a week later? We had like a million views on it. It was crazy. Chen: Really mind blowing for me. Well, I mean, you\u2019ve been making stuff already that had been getting a lot of traction, so. But for me, I hadn\u2019t even started a TikTok. And then she posted that and I was like, \u2018Oh, I should probably make one now.\u2019 So I made one on the spot. There was nothing on it, but it was really mind blowing because you don\u2019t conceptualize that very easily. So that was interesting. But then after that TikTok happened, we decided we wanted to record the song. So we started reaching out and we reached out to one of our friends who\u2019s a producer here named Gabe, and he was super diligent about getting us. working out into his schedule and getting this song put together, so. Silvestri: Shout out to Gabe Yaron. Chen: Yeah, shout out to Gabe Yaron. He was so real for that and he did a fantastic job. And I\u2019d say the whole timeline of writing to getting the song out was like two months, maybe. Silvestri: Oh, my god. It felt like a week. Like it felt like boom, boom, boom get it out. Chen: It felt so fast, yeah. Silvestri: \u2018Cause with virality, you have to ride that wave. And it\u2019s so stressful because it\u2019s people in the comments every day like, \u2018when\u2019s the song coming out? When\u2019s the song coming out?\u2019 Chen: Yeah. Silvestri: And like, it\u2019s really inspiring because the feedback we received is like, \u2018We love the song. I totally relate to this. This is awesome. Like, I love the jazzy feel.\u2019 But then it\u2019s also the pressure"}

LA Zine Fest invites zine enthusiasts and newcomers alike to find their next read.\n\nFinding plantable poems, collections of life advice and comics on protesters\u2019 rights in the same place might seem like a tall order. But at the Los Angeles Zine Fest, you can get all three and more. For a decade, hundreds of readers and creators have gathered at the annual event to share the unique publications known as zines. On May 28, they\u2019ll be back for their first in-person event since 2019, with tables lining the Long Beach Expo Arts Center for attendees to explore.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a difference that you can\u2019t get from seeing something online...nuances that can\u2019t be translated,\u201d zine creator Lorenzo Diggins Jr. said. \u201cThat\u2019s the opportunity [these events] create, the opportunity to actually connect with the people.\u201d\n\nZines, short for magazines or fanzines, are independent or self-made publications often centered around a specific topic and made by a single person. If that definition seems broad, that\u2019s because it\u2019s meant to be. The most common form zines take is paper that\u2019s folded, stapled or bound together into a booklet, but zines aren\u2019t limited to just that format.\n\nCJ Miller, creator of the zine LipsTik, explained that as long as something presents information around a perspective, a single qualifier of what makes a zine would be hard to define. \u201cYou can literally put out like a single piece of paper, or not even a piece of paper, maybe a zine that\u2019s on a piece of cloth,\u201dMiller said. \u201cI\u2019m making a zine right now that\u2019s a dress...for people to read while the dress wearer is out in a space.\u201d\n\nEunsoo Jeong, creator of the zine Koreangry explained that this flexibility is a major drawing point for zine creators. Because there\u2019s no set expectation for what they should contain, zines can be filled with everything from poetry and short stories to illustrations and stickers. \u201cI really wanted to do what I wanted to do,\u201d Jeong said. \u201c[Zines let] me be free and more playful and goes back to the spirit of...DIY, where it can be any shape, any topic, any size.\u201d\n\nBecause zines can be as simple as a single piece of paper, they\u2019re known for being accessible. Most zines are copied for sale using photocopiers, which according to Tristan Espinoza, one of the founders of Tiny Tech Zines, has an impact on who creates them. \u201cZines historically have come from marginalized populations...because you don\u2019t have to have a lot of money to make one,\u201d Espinoza said. \u201cI could just pop over to Kinkos or FedEx right now and whip something up in an hour. The access point is present and the barrier to entry is really low.\u201d\n\nThe origin of zines is debatable, with  Cornell University\u2019s Library  claiming that Martin Luther\u2019s 95 Theses in 1517 could technically be considered the first major zine. Others like  ZineWiki , an independent zine encyclopedia, argue that fanzines of the 1920s and 1930s, made by science fiction fans in tight-knit communities, can generally be considered the origin of the term.\n\nBy the 1970s, with punk culture on the rise and copy shops making creation more accessible, some bands started using zines to promote their music. Miller recalled being first exposed to zines from records from UK and American anarcho-punk bands that included accompanying zines expressing their politics. \u201cIt just was an avenue for me to, like, discover new ideas, and that I think that was really exciting for me as a young person in middle school... to have my mind expanded in that way,\u201d Miller said. \u201cZines afforded an opportunity to access information around world politics.\u201d\n\nZines would continue to be a way to express political beliefs. The 1990s\u2019 Riot Grrrl, a feminist punk movement, would heavily utilize zines to share feminist ideas and experiences dealing with sexism. According to an article by the  New York Public Library , these zines coined the slogan \u201cgirl power.\u201d\n\nToday, zines continue to be used to express ideas surrounding politics and identity. Miller\u2019s zine LipsTik began as personal poetry about her experience as an intersex transfeminine person, which they edited together to create the final hand-screened and hand-bound zine. \u201cI was writing these poems as a sort of diary process, keeping a diary that was not constrained as much to rigid systems of grammar,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThere was information there in my experience that...seemed to resonate with people, so it felt like worth putting into a more proper zine format.\u201d\n\nJeong\u2019s zine Koreangry also explores personal identity. It was created after the 2016 election as a way to address current issues and share Jeong\u2019s experiences as a Korean American immigrant with humor, personal stories and educational information about activism. \u201cIn the beginning I was really angry about the... very xenophobic things that I\u2019ve experienced,\u201d Jeong said. \u201cAs I grew older and I researched more, I realized the anger was ultimately within myself, the fact that I wasn\u2019t unable to speak up but I didn\u2019t know how to.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tristian Esponiza and Rachel Simanjuntak, connecting at events like zine fests is an important part of building community. They and another friend met at a zine event that inspired them to create Tiny Tech Zines, where they now host their own fairs. Esponiza explained that Tiny Tech Zines is centered on \u201ctech zines\u201d, which combine zines with themes of technology, its impacts and people\u2019s relationships with it. \u201cTech has some biases to it. Tech is not usually made with a lot of community input. It\u2019s kind of just prescribed from these big corporate entities,\u201d Espinoza said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is prioritize people who historically have not had a chance to develop a relationship with technology or to develop technologies of their own in the first place.\u201d\n\nThrough their collaborations with designers, artists and writers around the world, Tiny Tech Zines has been able to raise money for various causes as well as create their own innovative projects. One of these is emer.jent, a zine created with plantable seed paper. \u201cDuring the heavy L.A. rains, the zine was in [a reader\u2019s] house and a leak sprung in their roof and happened to fall only on the zine,\u201d Simanjuntak said. \u201cIt washed away the ink that was on the paper...and when she opened the zine, the seeds had started to sprout.\u201d\n\nFinding new types of stories and zine creations is part of the draw of zine fests for Simanjuntak, who has found zines that range in topics from cyberpunk to healing and care. \u201cZines have been a way to share knowledge, sometimes life-saving knowledge,\u201d Simanjuntak said. \u201cI would not be the person that I am without zines that helped me recognize things I was experiencing.\u201d\n\nThe community built around zines can also be a place of support. Lorenzo Diggins Jr., creator of colour bloc creative is awarding a first-time zine maker award to a local BIPOC creator, and he will be helping them develop and publish a zine to then sell at LA Zine Fest. \u201cInstead of being bitter and mad about how challenging my experience has been, my thing is about paying it forward,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cSo how can I leave a trail for the next generation that can help them get to where I\u2019m at quicker? I don\u2019t have a lot, but at the very least I have knowledge and I have experience.\u201d\n\nThis year will be the first time Diggins attends LA Zine Fest as a vendor. He first visited the event in 2013, before he went on to create his first zine Simple Things in 2015. \u201cI was exposed to this beautiful art form 10 years ago with no inclination of where it would lead me. I just knew that I left feeling so fulfilled and so optimistic about the future,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cJust to see a space, a concentrated or dedicated space to all these different creatives, it piqued my interest in a way that I wouldn\u2019t even prepare for.\u201d\n\nMany of the zine creators had common advice to those considering visiting LA Zine Fest for the first time: Expect to be a bit overwhelmed, but be excited for and open to the possibilities, fun and creativity zines can offer. \u201cGo in with an open mind,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cI\u2019m almost certain that you will find that thing that already piques your interest...but then you may discover something new. Spaces like this, especially centered around art and creation, [are] a great catalyst to further exploration. \"\n\nAccording to Jeong, one of the things that sets LA Zine Fest apart is its diversity in creators and how it\u2019s not solely focused on commercialized vendors whose highest priority is profit. It\u2019s a spirit that is reflected in the common practice of trading zines at zine fests, where some creators will trade their zines for others. \u201cIt\u2019s not about a monetary translation,\u201d Jeong said. \u201cIt\u2019s, \u2018This is something I did, my zine, my personality, my voice, and I would love to learn about your zine and voice.\u2019\u201d\n```"}

(Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nBy Ethan Huang May 11, 2023 at 1:58 pm PDT\n\nA\u6587\n\nBy day, the University of Southern California\u2019s Taper Hall echoes with the sounds of students rushing to class. But at night, the sound of music, specifically worship songs emerge from the lecture halls. Various religious and spiritual groups meet regularly in classrooms at night to worship together. One such group is USC\u2019s Kristos Campus Missions, which meets weekly with the intention of helping students follow their Christian faith in college.\n\nWith a guest pastor, bonding activities, and even a worship team complete with guitars, keyboard and drum set, KCM draws hundreds of students looking to share in community and engage with their spiritual faith. \u201cIt was comfortable and the people were also welcoming,\u201d says Nicole Park, a USC and KCM alumnus. \u201cMost of the people in the freshman class \u2013 had really tight relationships, even though they just met in KCM, and I wanted that for myself.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t call them a \u201cchurch\u201d. Rather, they prefer to call themselves a \u201cparachurch\u201d ministry that spans multiple colleges because of their work on sending students on missions while also connecting them to local churches. However, KCM\u2019s faith-based activities compete with the growing trend of college students leaving spirituality behind. Now independent, students have no obligation to pursue their faith while questioning how religion or God fits into their worldview.\n\nWith Christianity in particular, young adults struggle to see its relevance in light of issues like divided politics, war or violence, according to KCM\u2019s liaison pastor. \u201cI think a lot of that has to do with them not understanding the answers Christianity has for a secular world,\u201d Yuma Takei says, the assistant pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church. \u201cI think the world is trying to find answers to the brokenness that we see, the sense of hopelessness that there is.\u201d\n\nFor those who keep their spirituality, KCM is one of the spaces for students to spend time with their peers and their faith. \u201cWe\u2019re a place where we can really just be a place for unbelievers and also believers to gather together, to really build up a community, but not as a church, but as a parachurch ministry,\u201d says Juel Park, the president of USC KCM.\n\nKCM\u2019s general meetings include a worship and prayer session along with a message from a guest pastor. But throughout the week, they also have other activities such as small group meetings for freshmen and even outreach events like giving out free matcha at the Village crosswalk. It is one of over 80 different religious groups at USC, but the reality is that the experience of faith for a large percentage of students is constantly shifting.\n\nAccording to a study by Lifeway, about two-thirds of American young adults who attended a Protestant church regularly for at least a year as a teenager also dropped out for at least a year between the ages of 18 and 22. \u201cI know a lot of friends that grew up at church with me, but once they get to college, it\u2019s your own faith,\u201d says Juel Park. \u201cAt that point, your parents don\u2019t force you to come to church because you don\u2019t live with them anymore.\u201d\n\nThis is furthered by both historic and persisting abuses among various religious institutions that leave young people disillusioned with spirituality. According to Takei, many of the criticisms towards Christian churches are actually valid, but to him, it is a problem that does not need to affect the personal pursuit of faith. \u201cThe reality is all of us are imperfect, all of us are weak and have mistakes, and that\u2019s also reflected in the church often,\u201d Takei says. \u201cYeah, the people who critique the church, their critiques are often correct... [but] I think that we have something outside of us that gives us answers that we\u2019re seeking.\u201d\n\nWithin a generation of skepticism, it seems unlikely that major religious movements could arise spontaneously. But anomalies do exist, even on university campuses. In February, Asbury University in Wilmore, Kentucky, saw students refuse to leave a chapel after a regular event, sparking an unplanned, nonstop service full of worship, prayer and preaching that lasted for 13 days. Dubbed a \u201crevival\u201d by some, it was compared to the Jesus People Movement in the 1960s, which saw a sudden rise in young people, hippies, unhoused and other marginalized community members joining church in a time where a cultural shift saw many fall away from faith.\n\nWhile this event paints Christian revival as a large-scale religious movement, this perspective is not the same across the board. With secular schools like USC, something like the \u201cAsbury Revival\u201d would be even more improbable. Because of that, KCM\u2019s perspective on revival is rather different. Instead, they emphasize something that is more personal and intimate to one\u2019s faith. \u201cI think the type of revival that we\u2019re praying for is that [students] that have hardened their hearts to the love of God and instead they pursue worldly means of finding fulfillment in life, that they would realize that God loves them so much,\u201d says Rachel Yoo, a visual arts and media core member of KCM.\n\nStill, the final decision to connect with Christianity and their spirituality is left up to the individual and their personal motivation. Nicole Park reflects on what drove her to continue her faith in college after moving to L.A. from Seattle. \u201cIn terms of my faith, I was at a point where I knew that moving to L.A., I still wanted to find a church. In my adolescence I really struggled with identity and where I wanted God in my life and how much I wanted him to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nThis sense of faith is something that informs students\u2019 community and the choices they make throughout college life. Although KCM provided a supportive environment to Nicole Park, she says that branching out to others beyond her spiritual circle actually improved her faith. \u201cYou\u2019re surrounded by people who say they believe in the same beliefs, but when they act differently, especially in college, then you start to be more judgmental of others,\u201d says Park. \u201cI really wanted to pursue relationships with people outside of the Christian bubble, so when I did my work study, I really tried to make as many friends as possible and in my dorm as well.\u201d\n\nCollege, beyond academics, is a place where ambition, heritage and faith become increasingly defined by the student\u2019s experiences and point of view. When it comes to spirituality, some students seek out groups like KCM to connect with their peers and with their faith. \u201cRevival\u201d continues to be a subjective word and ultimately brings to light the complex issue of college students navigating faith. Whether they find their identity in community or God, it is their faith that brings about a personal, spiritual experience unique to them. \u201cI realized I went through a really hard time in high school and God was my only comfort,\u201d Nicole Park said. \u201cHe continued to not only be my comfort, but like a hope for me and [he] gave me a purpose in life, and I thought that I just wanted to continue pursuing that.\u201d\n\nRevival from the lens of the Korean American church\n\nCompared to other Christian ministries at the University of Southern California, Kristos Campus Missions has something that sets them apart: their demographic. KCM was originally founded as Korean American Campus Missions with the intention to serve Korean American Christians at universities. Their location at USC places them in close proximity to Los Angeles\u2019s Koreatown, home to one of the most widespread churchgoing communities with statistics citing 115 Korean churches in its 2.7 square mile perimeter.\n\nWith growing discussion of spiritual and religious revival following the so-called \u201cAsbury Revival\u201d in February, there is the question of how cultural background influences the perspective on faith. According to KCM liaison pastor Yuma Takei, Korean American culture has a profound impact on their practice of spirituality. \u201cEven with stuff like revivals and Korean culture, revivals are very normal,\u201d he says Takei. \u201cThey happen all the time and they seek after it, and so that informs the way you view revivals and whatnot and even your own individual faith.\u201d\n\nAt least for KCM alumna Nicole Park, Korea\u2019s history with Christianity is something she can personally relate to. \u201cThere was a movement in Korea to really push sending missionaries out, and so being missional and sending out missionaries to different countries played a huge part in its theological foundation,\u201d says Park, \u201cAnd that really struck a chord with me.\u201d\n\nHowever, KCM changed their name in order to remove the sense of exclusivity that came with an ethnic label. Although they maintain a predominantly Korean American following, they look to reach out to people of all backgrounds. \u201cThere\u2019s a very complex thing behind Korean churches, especially in Southern California \u2013 everyone is really closely knit and there\u2019s like a very specific culture in Korean churches,\u201d says Rachel Yoo, a visual arts and media core member of KCM. \u201cThat means we would only be able to reach out to Korean people, and obviously that\u2019s not our goal as Christians \u2013 our [goal] as Christians is to love everybody.\u201d```"}

The film she both wrote and starred in, \u201cBleed, Don\u2019t Die,\u201d made its world premiere at Fantaspoa-Fantastic Film Fest this April.\n\nVasconcellos spoke with USC Annenberg Media about her creative process and what it has been like to break into the world of film and the festival circuit.\n\nAM: On top of creating films, you have also spent time acting. What has that experience been like for you?\n\nVV: I\u2019m working on a solo show at the Stella Adler Conservatory for Acting, which is a professional acting conservatory for two years and a half. And it\u2019s very intense, the days are from 6 [a.m.] to 10:30 [p.m] every day. So it\u2019s very good to get this formal training...but to get this industry training as well. Doing that and having a career in film was definitely very demanding and time-consuming, but, in a way, one thing immediately supports the other. With the way my brain works, [filmmaking and acting] are able to dialogue. The students have also been very diverse\u2014there are people from all over the world. It\u2019s very enriching to be in this environment where I\u2019m not the only foreigner, the only Latin American representation.\n\nAM: What was the production process like for \u201cBleed, Don\u2019t Die?\u201d\n\nVV: It all started as a really small project that was just going to be shooting something in the woods, and now the project has really grown. The Toronto International Film Festival has a diverse talent development lab where they choose 20 emerging filmmakers\u201410 inside Canada, 10 from outside Canada\u2014and I was one of the people who was selected. I was able to bring a project with me, which was \u201cBleed, Don\u2019t Die.\u201d And, during the lab, we also won the Share Her Journey Canada Goose Fellowship [and] we won a grant from Freestyle Cinema. So now it\u2019s a legitimate production [and] its a production with a lot of women involved.\n\nAM: What is \u201cBleed, Don\u2019t Die\u201d about?\n\nVV: The story is all about manhood and healing. It\u2019s a modern retelling of the Holy Grail. But with two sisters as opposed to white old men.\n\nAM: You also starred in another short film of yours, \u201cPathei Mathos.\u201d What was that film experience like?\n\nVV: The whole short film started based on an experience had and my own trauma. I needed to say something about it, and not try to explain it, but to create a visual portrayal of what trauma feels like because words were never enough. The language I find most compelling is cinema. There was definitely an element of fear and anxiety. As with all short films, if you\u2019re not terrified, I think there\u2019s something wrong with you. But \u201cPathei Mathos\u201d was a healing process for me, more so than...reliving my trauma. I was putting myself in that present again and putting that on film. The story was very different than my own experience, but I thought about what was universal about trauma. I hope anyone can look at this movie and say, \u201cThis is not exactly how I felt, but this is something similar.\u201d I got a lot of emails and messages from people telling me how [the film] helped them understand someone with PTSD and that\u2019s the most amazing experience for me. It was really beneficial to my life and art to understand that the bad things that happen to us can be re-appropriated and reshaped. It\u2019s a great thing in my life now, it\u2019s no longer a sad story and something upsetting. That story didn\u2019t end there.\n\nAM: What advice do you have for filmmakers at USC applying to fellowships and festivals?\n\nVV: The biggest lesson I learned is to never stop. You have to continuously apply. I see something\u2014I applied. And, most of the time, they got rejected, but sometimes they don\u2019t. If you wait until you\u2019re ready to apply to something, you are going to be waiting your whole life. I constantly applied for things I\u2019m technically not really qualified for. But it sometimes works out because we tend to undersell ourselves as artists. Don\u2019t self-sabotage in that way.\n\nAM: Is there anything current students who are interested in film should do while at school?\n\nVV: The best advice from every filmmaker I\u2019ve met is to grab a camera and make a movie. Don\u2019t think too much about it. And I feel really lucky that I was in the cinema program, because so many classes were so pivotal and gave me an entirely different perspective on film and reading scripts. Don\u2019t go through college allowing your advisor to let you go with the flow. Write your own journey, be the narrator of your college history.\n```"}

{"key": "/2023/05/07/nfl-draft-review-ranking-the-top-teams-draft-classes/", "response": "```\nNFL Draft review: Ranking the top teams\u2019 draft classes\n\nWith the draft over and rookie mini-camps starting up, which teams should feel the most optimistic about their rookie classes?\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts had one of the best draft classes this year, highlighted by taking Florida quarterback Anthony Richardson with the fourth overall pick.\n\nOne week removed from the draft, and the dust has mostly settled. Lamar Jackson has officially re-signed with the Baltimore Ravens, Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles was cut by the Indianapolis Colts and the Miami Dolphins\u2019 Tyreek Hill has dressed up as an Alpine pit crew member. Now that the excitement has cooled, overreactions are less likely and rookie camps have started up, here\u2019s a look at the top 12 draft classes in 2023.\n\nTier One Drafts\n\nArizona Cardinals\nThe Cardinals are in a tough position. Quarterback Kyler Murray is not expected to return until at least late in the 2023 season. The team\u2019s new front office did not draft or re-sign Murray. There is a high chance they choose to move on to a new quarterback next year. For now, the roster is barren and Colt McCoy looks set to start. With that in mind, the Cardinals did the best they could. First-year general manager Monti Ossenfort started his first draft by trading down with the Houston Texans, dropping from third overall to 12th. The team picked up multiple future picks, including the Texans\u2019 first-round pick next year. They then moved back up to pick No. 6 and took offensive tackle Paris Johnson Jr. out of Ohio State, a common choice for the top tackle in the class. After starting out strong, the team picked up LSU edge rusher BJ Ojulari \u2014 an athletic, bendy pass rusher with a solid arsenal of moves for this point in his career in the second round \u2013 Syracuse cornerback Garrett Williams, an oft-injured but very talented player \u2013 and Stanford wide receiver Michael Wilson \u2014 one of a short list of wide receivers in this class who play to their large size. Day 3 picks like Auburn linebacker Owen Pappoe and Louisville cornerback Kei\u2019Trel Clark offer intriguing potential as well.\n\nIndianapolis Colts\nI have long been a fan of Florida quarterback Anthony Richardson. He\u2019s an unbelievable athlete and is a far more ready passer than he has received credit for being. While his selection and his fit in new head coach Shane Steichen\u2019s offense immediately excite me, it\u2019s hardly the only positive in the Colts\u2019 class. General manager Chris Ballard has shown a penchant for taking the most athletic prospects in a given draft class. He did not disappoint in that regard this year. Relative Athletic Score is a metric which aggregates combine results into a single overall athleticism grade on a 0-10 scale. This year, North Carolina wide receiver Josh Downs was Indianapolis\u2019 only pick in the first five rounds with an RAS of below 9. HIs score was 8.99, significantly dropped due to his small size. These players aren\u2019t just athletes, either. Downs offers speed and separation underneath, as well as very impressive receiving skills. His skillset is not really something that existed on the Colts\u2019 roster. Fellow Day 2 draftee, TCU cornerback Julius Brents, is a hyper-athletic, big cover corner with a lot of success in college and who fits Gus Bradley\u2019s defensive system very well. Northwestern defensive lineman Adetomiwa Adebawore is an electric lineman who isn\u2019t particularly polished right now but is already a struggle to handle due to his sheer quickness and ferocity. He was expected by most to be off the board by the mid-second round. The Colts picked him up in the fourth. South Carolina cornerback Darius Rush has quick feet and good ball skills, although he hasn\u2019t played the position for all that long. There\u2019s room for him to grow but like the other players in this class, his ceiling is extremely high and his floor is as a solid special teams player. BYU offensive lineman Blake Freeland might just be an athlete right now but is an enticing developmental prospect who won\u2019t have to start immediately. This class offers tons of potential and should be effective out of the gate as well. The Cardinals got more future value through their trades down, but this is one of my favorite classes when solely looking at the players.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\nSpeaking of classes that just took great players, Omar Khan had a fantastic debut. Each of his first four picks saw first-round hype at some point in the offseason. Georgia offensive tackle Broderick Jones has work to do with his hand placement, but he\u2019s put promising plays on tape and is one of the best athletes at the position in the class. In a weak tackle class and with the Steelers\u2019 current offensive line, Jones fills a need and should be a very solid player in the near future. Penn State cornerback Joey Porter Jr. felt like an inevitable pick. The son of the all-time great Steelers linebacker is a gifted corner in press man coverage. He\u2019s not the most versatile player, but in the right system, he could be the best corner in this class. Wisconsin defensive lineman Keeanu Benton is a very enticing prospect. He\u2019s a gifted pass rusher despite often playing from nose tackle, which is normally a very difficult spot from which to generate pressure. Interior pressure is incredibly valuable, as it puts opposing quarterbacks in very difficult positions. With T.J. Watt and fourth-round pick Nick Herbig likely to rush from wide alignments (when Herbig doesn\u2019t play off-ball) and Alex Highsmith coming off a productive season, their jobs will be made easier by Benton pushing quarterbacks back from their marks and into the Steelers\u2019 pass rushers\u2019 paths. Georgia tight end Darnell Washington was one of my favorite prospects in the draft class. He\u2019s a dominant blocker with one of the most ridiculous athletic profiles in NFL history. He\u2019s raw as a receiver but offers immediate value up the seams and after the catch and will have time to develop behind current starter Pat Freiermuth. He dropped due to knee issues but is reportedly expected to be able to have a long career. Purdue cornerback Cory Trice is a player I wasn\u2019t particularly familiar with before this week. He\u2019s a tall, athletic corner with very good movement skills. I cannot comprehend how he was available so late \u2014 I thought he\u2019d be off the board by Day 2 but if healthy should easily outperform his seventh-round selection.\n\nTier Two Drafts\n\nCincinnati Bengals\nCincinnati didn\u2019t come into the draft with the most picks in the class or have early picks in any round, but they made fantastic use of what they had. Clemson edge rusher Myles Murphy was consistently in EDGE3 conversations \u2014 they took him 29th overall. He projects as a solid rotational edge behind Sam Hubbard and Trey Hendrickson in his rookie year but could allow the team to save $15 million after this year by cutting or trading Hendrickson. Michigan cornerback DJ Turner is a lightning quick corner with good coverage skills who will instantly improve the team\u2019s secondary. Alabama safety Jordan Battle is a proven, competent prospect who offers more hope at a shaky position group. Purdue wide receiver Charlie Jones and Illinois running back Chase Brown offer an opportunity to offload more expensive players at their positions in the near future, with Tyler Boyd on the last year of his deal and Joe Mixon an enticing post-June 1 cap casualty. The Bengals\u2019 draft added considerable talent while preempting future positions of need. It\u2019s not as star-studded as the drafts in tier one, but the team managed its weekend very wisely.\n\nSeattle Seahawks\nMuch of the Seahawks\u2019 draft success came on Day 1, but it\u2019s such a strong first round that they\u2019re high on the rankings anyway. Illinois cornerback Devon Witherspoon is a departure from the Seahawks\u2019 traditional mold at cornerback, being only 5 foot 11, but he\u2019s a tenacious tackler with remarkable coverage skills. He will get immediate playing time, whether that comes opposite Tariq Woolen or in the slot. Ohio State wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba was the top wide receiver in this draft class and while it was a weak draft for the position, Smith-Njigba is still an enticing prospect. His lack of top-end speed means he will likely never be a particularly productive deep threat, but his route running and hands are so strong that it\u2019s hard to imagine a world in which Smith-Njigba doesn\u2019t succeed. Smith-Njigba will slot in behind Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf and could contend for a 1,000-yard season right away with those two pulling coverage away from him. Auburn edge rusher Derick Hall and Michigan defensive lineman Mike Morris both fill positions of need. I don\u2019t think Hall was the best edge rusher on the board when Seattle picked him, but he\u2019s a solid player against both the run and the pass and the Seahawks need help sooner rather than later. Morris should be a decent contributor in year one due to the Seahawks\u2019 lack of players available at his size to help stop the run. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with the Seahawks taking a running back in the second round for consecutive years, but UCLA\u2019s Zach Charbonnet should be a very fun player alongside last year\u2019s second rounder, Kenneth Walker II. After Rashaad Penny and Travis Homer left in free agency, adding bodies at running back was a must.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders\nAfter years of bad drafts, the Raiders seem to have finally succeeded. It\u2019s rare to get a value pick at seventh overall, but with late whispers that Texas Tech edge rusher Tyree Wilson could go in the top three, the Raiders seem to have managed it. Wilson is slow to react to the snap and doesn\u2019t have much polish right now, but he\u2019s extremely athletic and has a ridiculous wingspan. He\u2019ll be competent but limited out of the gate. With development, Wilson can be one of the best edge rushers in the league. He\u2019ll have good mentors with Maxx Crosby and Chandler Jones starting ahead of him. Michael Mayer was the most popular pick for TE1. Somehow, he was the third tight end off the board. He\u2019s a good-but-not-great athlete, a brilliant route runner and a competent blocker. He may have the best hands out of every player in the draft. The team traded Darren Waller in the offseason, but Mayer will provide Jimmy Garoppolo with a strong safety net. Alabama defensive tackle Byron Young should start early, as the Raiders lack talent at three-technique defensive tackle. Maryland cornerback Jakorian Bennett is a fantastic athlete and is decent in coverage. He should compete for playing time outside in a weak secondary. Georgia safety Christopher Smith was worth the late pick they spent on him, as he was very effective in college but tested worse than his tape would have suggested. He\u2019s light and not the best against the run but could be a solid addition in three-safety looks.\n\nChicago Bears\nThe first move Ryan Poles made after being hired was signing defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi. The signing fell through after Ogunjobi failed his physical, but it clearly showed the Bears\u2019 priorities. Head coach Matt Eberflus\u2019 defense was strongest in Indianapolis when he had both Grover Stewart and DeForest Buckner on the interior. The team clearly wants to recreate that success. After a sorry showing last year, the Bears put a clear priority on improving their interior defensive line in the draft, taking Florida nose tackle Gervon Dexter and South Carolina defensive tackle Zacch Pickens in the second and third rounds, respectively. Both will likely earn early playing time for last year\u2019s second worst run defense in the league. First-round pick Tennessee offensive tackle Darnell Wright is a slightly tougher projection to the NFL than most prospects due to the offense the team ran \u2014 quarterback Hendon Hooker rarely took full dropbacks and rarely scrambled unless he already planned to do so \u2014 but has shown pass blocking prowess and strong run blocking. He\u2019s a valuable addition to last year\u2019s subpar offensive line and should help Justin Fields develop further. Miami cornerback Tyrique Stevenson is a solid addition following then-rookie Kyler Gordon\u2019s struggles last year. If both look good this year, Chicago could let Jaylon Johnson walk in free agency. If only one looks good, the defense will still be significantly improved. Texas running back Roschon Johnson was electric when on the field, he just sat behind eighth overall pick Bijan Robinson. Johnson and Khalil Herbert should be an exciting duo in the backfield. Cincinnati wide receiver Tyler Scott is a very fast deep threat with potential as a route runner. I was shocked he dropped to the late fourth. Scott offers an immediate injection of speed as a rotational receiver and, if he develops well, could allow the team to move on from Darnell Mooney at the end of his rookie contract. Oregon Linebacker Noah Sewell is an athletic marvel without much polish at the linebacker position yet. I trust Matt Eberflus with linebackers, as he has a storied history coaching the position. If he develops Sewell well, he could be part of a very fun trio alongside Jack Sanborn and Tremaine Edmunds.\n\nTier Three Drafts\n\nMiami Dolphins\nMiami had just four picks in this year\u2019s draft due to both trades and punishments handed down by the league. In those four picks, they got impressive value, however. South Carolina cornerback Cam Smith is a talented corner who dropped in the draft process but was initially regarded as a probable first-round pick and as possibly the first corner off the board. He\u2019s athletic and has good length which allows him to play outside. The Dolphins added Jalen Ramsey to a secondary which already had Xavien Howard, but Howard has started to fall off and, with how Ramsey was used in Los Angeles, I would not be surprised to see him playing primarily in the slot, leaving Smith to start outside as a rookie. Texas A&M running back Devon Achane is one of my favorite fits in this draft. The blazing-fast back \u2014 Achane ran a 4.26 40-yard dash at the combine \u2014 is a big-play threat every time he touches the ball and Mike McDaniel is more than capable of getting him into space. There are very few receivers in this draft class who play to their large frames. Stanford\u2019s Elijah Higgins \u2014 6 foot 3, 235 pounds \u2014 is one of them. He\u2019s hardly polished, but he\u2019ll have plenty of room to work with when he gets on the field due to how much attention Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle attract. The Dolphins\u2019 final pick, Ryan Hayes, is unlikely to start, but three contributors in four picks is very impressive value.\n\nDenver Broncos\nLike the Dolphins, the Broncos had very few picks to work with. Also like the Dolphins, they made the most of what they had. Oklahoma wide receiver Marvin Mims Jr. is a solid receiver prospect with good route running ability who could allow the team to move on from one of their many highly paid players at the position. Arkansas linebacker Drew Sanders provides further versatility to a confusing linebacking/pass rushing corps. Nik Bonitto was an interesting but very light edge rusher prospect last year who has played more off-ball due to his weight. Baron Browning seems to be transitioning to the edge, where he has been incredibly effective, but the team has tried playing him off-ball too. Sanders is a more experienced player off-ball than either Browning or Bonitto and has the pass rush chops to move to the edge when needed. Riley Moss could start this year, with fellow former Iowa cornerback Michael Ojemudia now on the Bears. Both Boise State\u2019s JL Skinner and Oregon\u2019s Alex Forsyth are likely to only be depth players. Managing to find three probable starters in five picks is impressive value, but I can\u2019t justify putting the Broncos higher because of the lack of high-potential players and the lack of total players in the class.\n\nDallas Cowboys\nI was surprised to see how many people disliked the Cowboys\u2019 draft. It did what it needed to do and added quite a few talented players. Michigan defensive tackle Mazi Smith is a stout run defender, which will be important if the Cowboys want to beat the Eagles in the division next year. He also shows potential in the pass game despite playing nose tackle. Michigan tight end Luke Schoonmaker is older than most prospects in the class but a gifted athlete and decent route runner. He will at least be an early contributor and may start as a rookie, following the departure of Dalton Schultz. Texas linebacker DeMarvion Overshown is a flawed prospect who misses far too many tackles, but he has good instincts, is a very rangy player and can cover better than most linebackers in the class. He will push for immediate playing time. Kansas State running back Deuce Vaughn is a heartwarming selection \u2014 Vaughn\u2019s father made the phone call informing him he was a Cowboy \u2014 but he\u2019s also a talented back with good vision and receiving ability. He\u2019s tiny, but tiny backs have had success before, as the Cowboys know all too well from their encounters with Darren Sproles.\n\nHouston Texans\nThis may be low for many, but I can\u2019t condone the draft capital given up by the Texans to draft Alabama edge rusher Will Anderson Jr. He\u2019s a fantastic player, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that next year\u2019s first rounder, the 34th overall pick this year and a third rounder would\u2019ve been better used filling out the roster instead of finding one top-end guy. That said, the Texans picked some fantastic players. Ohio State\u2019s C.J. Stroud is a remarkably accurate quarterback who could easily become a fringe top-10 player at the position within two years. Anderson is the best edge prospect in the class whose only consistent knock was that he probably won\u2019t wind up being a top-10 player all-time at the position. Houston wide receiver Tank Dell scares me, as he\u2019s listed at 5 foot 8, 165 pounds, but he\u2019s one of the shiftiest players in this draft class and can create separation in the blink of an eye. If he can stay healthy, Dell should be a very exciting weapon alongside last year\u2019s picks, Nico Collins and John Metchie III. Iowa State wide receiver Xavier Hutchinson, who I did not expect to be available in the sixth round, should also contribute. Alabama\u2019s Henry To\u2019oTo\u2019o is an intriguing linebacker prospect whose instincts I didn\u2019t love but was easily worth a fifth-round dart throw. I like him more than I liked his teammate Christian Harris, who the Texans took in the third round last year.\n\nNew England Patriots\nYes, I know. They took a kicker in the third round. I don\u2019t like that either, but much of the rest of their draft was strong. The Patriots traded down from 14th overall, yet still managed to pick up the draft\u2019s top corner prospect, Oregon\u2019s Christian Gonzalez. Gonzalez has already shown impressive development, is one of the best athletes at the position and is an incredibly sticky player in coverage. Taking him in the teens is impressive value; trading down and accumulating picks before doing so is even more impressive. Georgia Tech\u2019s Keion White is an older prospect than ideal for a developmental edge rusher, but he can play both inside and outside and is a brilliant athlete. At the very least, he should be a solid contributor. The selection of linebacker Marte Mapu has been denigrated, especially by Patriots fans. It shouldn\u2019t be. Mapu is a rangy player with good instincts and coverage ability who should see the field early. If he went to a higher profile school than Sacramento State, this would\u2019ve been a more popular pick.

(AP Photo/Gregory Payan)\n\nBy Terence Holton May 06, 2023 at 9:14 pm PDT\n\nThe heir to King James\u2019 throne is staying home in Los Angeles to continue his basketball career. Bronny James will join No. 1 overall recruit guard Isaiah Collier and four-star forward Arrinten Page in a loaded USC men\u2019s basketball 2023 recruiting class.\n\nAfter being one of the best-kept secrets in recruiting history, with not much being known about James\u2019 recruitment until the past few months, Bronny James has committed to USC. James chose the Trojans over Oregon and Ohio State. He is the No. 21 overall recruit in the Class of 2023, according to the 247Sports composite rankings, and should have an instant impact for the Trojans.\n\nJames\u2019 has an incredibly pro-style game for an 18-year-old. His best basketball ability by far, though, is his unselfishness. James moves fluidly without the ball and is a phenomenal off-ball player. James can go toe-to-toe with some of the best shooters in the country, as his catch-and-shoot ability is praised by NBA scouts. In the McDonald\u2019s All-American game, he went 5-for-8 from three.\n\nIf you watch the film, you can just tell that James will be a great shooting option on this Trojan team that at times could not get the lid off the basket from three. Don\u2019t get it twisted, though, he\u2019s still the son of LeBron James. He is a strong finisher around the rim and has incredibly quick downhill speed. James is not as tall as his dad, standing at around 6-foot-3, but his athleticism is easily on par with anyone in the country.\n\nJames is a projected top-10 pick in the 2024 NBA draft by ESPN, and my pro comparison for him is Jrue Holiday: a great on-ball defender, phenomenal off-ball player and second or third option on a championship-level team.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget when watching him play at the Les Schwab Invitational this past December. James had a chase down block where he seemingly came out of nowhere and floated above the rim to practically throw the ball into the crowd. It was absolutely ridiculous, and I imagine we will get a few vintage Bronny James chase-down blocks at Galen Center next year.\n\nJames will truly be a perfect fit for the Trojans for the upcoming season. After losing a trio of players to the transfer portal, USC needed to add some guard depth. With the addition of five-stars of Collier and James to go along with returning senior Boogie Ellis, this Trojan backcourt is looking incredibly promising.\n\nCollier is described as the best shot creator in the Class of 2023, so James\u2019 fantastic off-ball scoring ability and unselfishness will make these two a fantastic tandem. Then add in Ellis, the All-Pac-12 guard who averaged 17.7 points last season, and it is not unfair of me to say this Trojan backcourt may be the best in the nation.\n\nI truly don\u2019t think there is a backcourt with as much depth as USC\u2019s. James\u2019 commitment could have one more ripple effect on the Trojans. The No. 2 overall recruit in the Class of 2023, Ron Holland, recently decommitted from Texas. I believe USC to be a dark horse in Holland\u2019s recruitment, as the Trojans are in need of one more great wing for their roster.\n\nI just know that Collier and James are most certainly trying to recruit Holland to come play for the Trojans next year. I\u2019m not saying Holland will come to USC; however, watch for the Trojans in his recruitment, as the deadline for National Signing Day is May 17.\n\nJames will bring a crowd like no other college basketball player next year, so a word of advice for my fellow Trojan students when going to USC basketball games: get there at least one to two hours in advance to get decent seats \u2014 Galen Center is not huge.\n\nThis USC roster is loaded with talent, and I truly cannot wait for next year\u2019s college basketball season.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/05/06/photos-why-has-the-writers-guild-gone-on-strike/", "response": "```\nThe Writers Guild of America (WGA) went on strike Tuesday after the Writers Guild of America East (WGAE), Writers Guild of America West (WGAW) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) failed to resolve labor contract negotiations Monday night. This is the first time the WGA has picketed since 2008 \u2014 but this time around, they are supported by solidarity from at least six other film and television unions.\n\nOn Wednesday, a meeting at the Shrine Auditorium saw unprecedented support, with attendance including the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), Teamsters, the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America (LIUNA), Directors Guild of America (DGA) and the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA). The supporting guilds spoke to WGA members, according to Michele Mulroney, the vice president of the WGAW, to encourage and inspire the packed room of people interwoven through the industry.\n\n\u201cLast night you felt this really incredible feeling of interunion solidarity and a recognition of the moment that we\u2019re in and how things must change,\u201d Mulroney said.\n\nThe Writers Guild\u2019s main asks are to codify and protect the writers room; ensure there are pathways for writers to grow in their careers and maintain the integrity of their creative work; and financially guarantee that writers are able to make a living in their profession.\n\nDuring this meeting it was discussed how the WGA approached negotiations and how the WGA attempted to reach a deal. Bill Wolkoff, a writer, producer and member of the Writers Guild, took away from the meeting at the Shrine that \u201c[AMPTP] did not bargain in good faith. The WGA\u2019s leadership is very transparent and  released the term sheet  in the negotiations, all of our proposals and all of their responses. Anybody who looks at that can see that they never intended to make a deal with us. All of our cornerstone proposals, they never once countered for all of the months that they were in negotiation. They never once countered.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf [AMPTP] insists on not engaging with us, they\u2019re going to find, fairly soon, that there won\u2019t be any writers left, because writers can\u2019t afford to do this,\u201d said Michael Schur, a WGA member who is a part of the Negotiating Committee.\n\n\u201cWriters are facing an existential crisis,\u201d said Wolkoff. \u201cThrough the streaming model, [companies] have found loopholes in which they pay writers less and diminish the writer\u2019s presence in the production process to the point where it\u2019s hard to have a career as a writer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWriter pay and working conditions have been suppressed and eroded to an unacceptable level,\u201d says Mulroney.  \u201cIt makes it almost impossible for [writers] to afford to live in the cities where they need to work \u2014 Los Angeles and New York.\u201d\n\nIn the streaming era, television seasons have shrunk from approximately 22 episodes a season to about eight or ten, causing a reduction in overall pay. Furthermore, studios have made it more difficult for writers to get paid for time spent on-set. This puts more of a burden on showrunners, and also makes it difficult for writers to gain the production experience necessary to advance in their careers. These changes are just two of many \u201cerosions\u201d the writers have seen over the past decade and a half.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a death by a thousand cuts situation,\u201d said Kristina Woo, a WGA captain from Friday\u2019s Paramount picket line.\n\nThe 2007-2008 strike lasted for 14 weeks. Current protesters anticipate and are preparing for a long strike that may include other unions on the picket line. SAG and DGA contracts are set to expire on June 30 of this year and IATSE contracts begin negotiation early next year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this fight until it\u2019s over. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to be. That is up to the studios and the companies,\u201d Wolkoff said.\n\nAcross the 10 West Coast locations, some protests were better attended than others. Sam Richardson, an actor, screenwriter and television writer of both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA guilds, attended the CBS TV City picket line Thursday: \u201cOn Instagram, you see everybody in swarms. And ... I didn\u2019t see anybody here. So I was like, let me come and represent this [location],\u201d he said.\n\nThe film industry workers\u2019 unions are some of the largest in the country. Some supporters believe this strike could make a nation-wide impact. Andria Wilson-Mirza came out with Women in Film LA to the Paramount picket line and explained, \u201cSince the 2007-2008 strike, so many people have come to understand the power of their own voice and their collective action. It really feels like this could be that watershed moment for our generation.\u201d\n\nA primary concern with this strike is whether or not momentum can carry through potentially drawn-out negotiations. But the consequences of not carrying it out are severe, explains John Cochran, a television writer at CBS. \u201cEven though it\u2019s very disruptive to the industry now to be having this sort of strike, it\u2019s going to be way more disruptive to the industry if these changes aren\u2019t made now in the future,\u201d Cochran said.\n\nThe picket lines will be running from Monday to Friday during working hours, in front of the major  television and film studios . Sara Werner, a freelance director and supporter of the strike, explains that the atmosphere of the picket lines are positive. \u201cEveryone\u2019s on the same page,\u201d she said. \u201cI think everyone\u2019s in it for the long haul and supporting one another and coming in shifts, coming in between work, coming in between, well, survival jobs.\u201d\n\nVice President of WGAW, Michele Mulroney, stands with protesters at the CBS TV City location. It is one of 10 strike locations on the West Coast, one of 22 locations for demonstrations across the U.S. and is the same picket line that Mulroney walked for 100 days back in 2007 when the last strike occurred over the writer's role in the emergence of internet content.\n```"}

It feels like air in the lungs. \n\n\"My identities are messy and ambiguous; they don\u2019t add up to 100% or fit into a brownie pan squarely.\" (Artwork by Qiuya Chen) \n\nBy Matt Chen May 05, 2023 at 1:42 pm PDT\n\nAccording to my roommate\u2019s candid assessment, I\u2019m whitewashed. The assessment is unsavory but fair, not far from the truth. I used to call myself \u2018Wasian,\u2019 short for white & Asian, putting the capital \u2018W\u2019 right at the front of my identity. The term left little doubt as to the pecking order of my identities, confirming that whiteness was the first ingredient baked into me. Following this recipe, whitewashed went down with ease. Then I started to relish the ambiguity of \u201cmixed.\u201d Now, whitewashed smacks of regret. It\u2019s not an airy morsel that dishes up confirmation of me prioritizing white before Asian. Because I\u2019m mixed, \u201cwhitewashed\u201d feels like a failure to live up to what my exterior denotes. The allegation presupposes an incomplete relationship to Chinese culture. If I\u2019m whitewashed, then there\u2019s a gaping void where Chinese culture should stand.\n\nSince I no longer subordinate \u201cAsian\u201d to the capital \u2018W,\u2019 I have a hunger to relate to my Chinese heritage. Most often, being whitewashed is characterized as a battle between ethnicity and nationality, not competing ethnicities. Andrea Bian, a writer at Northwestern University, captures this dynamic in her opinion piece, \u201cMy fight against \u2018whitewashed.\u2019\u201d For her, being a first-generation American leads to a perceived lack of authenticity among other Asian Americans. They deem her \u201cwhitewashed.\u201d This pejorative is flung about even though it carries the weight of loss, the surrender of Chinese culture to American culture. If Chinese culture is delicate enough to be overrun with such ease, is there any way it would survive in a mixed somebody like me?\n\nContemporary mixed race literature answers me. Yes, it says, my Chinese roots await their harvest. In her memoir Crying in H Mart, Michelle Zauner nourishes her Korean identity through food. She once took her Koreanness for granted, then fears losing connection to it after her mom dies. Zauner finds herself stranded without a cultural anchor, so she starts to cook Korean recipes her mom made for her while growing up. A byproduct of these childhood recipes is that they bolster her claim to Korean identity and culture. The Korean taste belongs to her by birthright.\n\nZauner\u2019s message is agreeable to my palate, but my childhood diet consisted of American foods as much as Chinese foods. And my grimace at my family\u2019s Chinese New Year banquet belies discomfort with traditional Chinese food. My childhood relationship with Chinese food is worlds apart from Zauner\u2019s to Korean food. Consuming Chinese food will not make me more Chinese. Even so, Crying in H Mart comforts me because it shows that connection to my Chinese heritage is within reach if I put in the effort. But my resolution will look different. My resolution will be peace with being unprecedented, suppressing the urge to be perceived as \u201cmade in China.\u201d\n\nThe scary part of resolving toward ambiguity is that authenticity is off the menu. Without the burden of measuring up to an impossible standard of authenticity, I hope the allegation of \u201cwhitewashed\u201d will lose some of its teeth. Uncertainty of my Chinese heritage will feel like less of an unforgivable mistake, and accepting this ambiguity means the chance to connect to my ethnicities and those who share them. For now, learning Mandarin threads the needle between being whitewashed and my Chinese ancestry\u2014taking some of the bite out of the whitewashed allegations. The language is a refreshing change of pace from German, by now an old friend after seven years of study, and the familiar feeling that is prioritizing my whiteness.\n\nWriting my name \u5747\u660e (j\u016bnm\u00edng \u2014 \u2018all bright\u2019) injects me with a burst of buoyancy. It feels like air in the lungs. I inherit grief from that name too, for it was my late great-grandmother who named me. I have no memories of her. I do have one photo of her holding me as a newborn. Her frame embraces me with tenderness. Her face seems to tilt upwards, lifted with mirth. She exudes brightness, her skin a mirror to the camera\u2019s flash.\n\nI\u2019ve gleaned tidbits about her past. She emigrated from Guangdong\u2014a province in southern China\u2014to New York City in 1938. The slow boat took a month, and she landed in Canada before taking the Amtrak to Ellis Island. She was able to come despite the Chinese Exclusion Act since her husband was already in the States. She ended up outliving him by 40+ years, dying after becoming a great-grandmother to me and my older sibling.\n\nRemembering so little of her, I like to think about the future she saw for me. \u5747\u660e, All Bright. Armed with Papaw\u2019s prophecy, incomplete knowledge of my Chinese heritage feels like less of an insurmountable hurdle. Instead, I feel a complexity of longing and pride. I must also credit my Chinese professor for cultivating this quiet pride within me. On my first quiz, I couldn\u2019t remember how to write my name, let alone any of the vocabulary. I scored a 4.5 out of 10. The abject failure stunned me, but my professor remained unconcerned. She took offense only to \u201cName: Junming\u201d in hastily scrawled felt-tip ink.\n\nIn response, she wrote: \u201cChinese?\u201d I hadn\u2019t bothered to learn the characters, and she rejected my flippant imposition of English conventions onto something as sacred as my name. After class, she explained that I have an auspicious name\u2014especially m\u00edng, which contains the radicals for sun (\u65e5) and moon (\u6708). You should really learn it, she said, it\u2019s a good name. The new feeling of pride permeated my being. Even now, my professor\u2019s words persist. I trace my name into the steam of the shower door. One time I carved it into brick. And on quizzes, I write it with a glitter pen, embodying brightness right down to the ink.\n\nArmed with Papaw\u2019s prophecy, incomplete knowledge of my Chinese heritage feels like less of an insurmountable hurdle. Instead, I feel a complexity of longing and pride. The lesson I won\u2019t soon forget is that incompetency ended in connection to my Chinese heritage. To develop that connection, I first had to accept myself as an outsider with imprecise linguistic abilities. Will embracing this position end in the cultural connection that I seek? Perhaps. But it may be more apt to say I\u2019m a juvenile, not an outsider. One of my housemates would agree. She\u2019s a graduate student from China, and we bonded when I reached out for help on an oral exam. I was struggling to pronounce the simple sounds \u201cci, chi,\u201d and \u201czi, zhi.\u201d I could hardly distinguish between the four, despite her claims that she was pronouncing them all.\n\nThe breakthrough came after an hour of painstaking work. Once my cheeks hurt from the persistent drilling, my pronunciation of \u2018zi\u2019 sounded fluent. I did it five more times with ease, egged on by her growing excitement. I felt gratitude that she was so patient with my bumbling. She went on to explain that this is how she learned to speak Mandarin. The patience and generosity that astounded me was her simply passing along the favor. She learned these simple sounds as a child. So, at 20, I\u2019m a child again\u2014greedily absorbing new sounds and sights so that I can recreate them. I am not an outsider, and I must resist the urge to think of myself as one.\n\nAn uncomfortable truth is that my whiteness reveals itself when I speak Mandarin. When I speak, I want people to be shocked. This desire is born out of seeing white people speak Mandarin and having their proficiency heralded as miraculous. Because this demographic was my reality growing up, I desire the same applause they receive. It\u2019s bizarre. I failed to consider that speaking Mandarin might seem run-of-the-mill because I don\u2019t look like them. The assumption could be that it\u2019s my first language\u2014I\u2019d learned it at home. As such, my rich tones and hearty sentences may be standard fare to my audience, not a delicacy worthy of applause.\n\nIf I gorge myself on the thrill of others\u2019 astonishment whenever I speak Mandarin, then I\u2019m leaving little room for a substantial connection to Chinese culture. I would be whitewashing myself by treating Mandarin in my mouth as exotic. Subconsciously, it\u2019s the notability bestowed upon white speakers of Mandarin that I crave. I must resist this craving. My language abilities should not be the source of rave reviews. The point of learning Mandarin is to feel connected to Chinese culture. Indeed it adds an important ingredient to my heritage that was missing when I grew up. Yet, linguistic capabilities can only take me so far.\n\nI must continue to grapple with the conflict that arises out of competing ethnicities and being whitewashed. My overarching dilemma is one of making identities\u2014often pitted as rivals\u2014square with each other. In my case, it\u2019s my Chinese identity with being white and whitewashed. It\u2019s a real fear of mine that this competition between identities might end in alienation. My mom already told me that exploring my Chinese identity equates to rejecting her. If she\u2019s right, is there any way to refute \u201cwhitewashed\u201d without sacrificing that which is white, including her? I\u2019m optimistic. I refuse to believe my identities amount to a zero-sum game. My identities are messy and ambiguous; they don\u2019t add up to 100% or fit into a brownie pan squarely.\n\nUp until recently, whenever someone asked if my hair is permed, I was confused. No, it\u2019s natural, I got it from my momma, I would say. I was confused because I didn\u2019t see the underlying logic: You\u2019re Asian, so hair like yours only comes from the salon. The most recent time, a class friend asked while we were out to lunch. Later I realized that I hadn\u2019t told her I\u2019m mixed, so underpinning her question must have been the perception of me as East Asian. In that light, I appreciate her question. But my previous confusion points out that being authentically, wholly Chinese is not who I am. My mom figures as a vital part of me. That\u2019s why this question is confusing rather than affirming.\n\nSo, I stake my claim in the shifting ground of ambiguity. I won\u2019t carve myself into half-Chinese-half-white-sized pieces; I\u2019m much more than just one or the other, and am left unsatisfied when I limit myself to digestible bites of identity.\n```"}

My grandfather loved to tell stories about Haiti to anyone who would listen; the black sand; his beach house; taking his boat from one side of the island to the other; the sharks. My grandfather stood tall at 6\u20321\u2032\u2032 with a lean build and a clean-shaven head. His skin was the color of  chokola , straight from the cocoa bean, and his face was long, nose wide. His eyes were dark and piercing. He had a strong jaw and a stern tone, but not with me. With me, his voice was softer and always accompanied by a wide smile and a belly laugh. My grandmother was 5\u20323\u2032\u2032 and as quiet as she was short. Her clothes were always covered in floral prints, and she kept her long black hair in one braid that went down her back \u2014 almost reaching her waist. Her skin was the color of  mamba , smooth and creamy as if it were made straight out of the peanut shells. She had light grey eyes and a tiny mole on the curve of her upper right eye. Her smile was different, smaller, more polite, and it started in her eyes. On Thursday nights, when I closed my eyes, Haiti is where my grandfather and I would sit outside looking out at the ocean from the porch of a two-story cream-colored beach home. We sat comfortably in dark wooden chairs, eating our  kenep  straight off the tree while my grandmother made fried fish with wild rice in the kitchen. The air was fresh, and the palm trees gave us privacy from our neighbors. Then my grandfather, never too far from his radio, would start dancing as he turned the volume up. A melodic Kompa tune blasts from the same dusty old radio he\u2019s had since the 80s. Suddenly, he is standing in front of me, swaying his hips, barefoot in the sand, laughing at me and telling me I can\u2019t dance. I just roll my eyes and eat my fruit. I hear my grandmother laughing from the kitchen window as she\u2019s cleaning the fish, scrapping at its scales with her knife. She starts to sing along, and her voice is soft, like always. Those memories are real, even if I wasn\u2019t awake. If I close my eyes I can remember it all as if it is happening right now. I can hear my grandfather\u2019s music and taste my grandmother\u2019s food. I can feel a breeze on my skin brushing me softly just like the fan ceiling above my grandparent\u2019s bed. I can smell my grandmother\u2019s skin as I nuzzle myself into her neck when she engulfs me in a hug and pats my back. I\u2019ve never been to Haiti because my grandfather never allowed me to go. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous,\u201d he would say, but when I thought about Haiti I never thought of danger. To me, Haiti was never what is described on the news. It wasn\u2019t the poverty-stricken island that never met its full potential after becoming the first Black population to free themselves from slavery. It wasn\u2019t a land in constant recovery from earthquakes, hurricanes and the lingering effects of colonialism. It wasn\u2019t battling dictatorship and political warfare and the not-so-secret interference from the American and French governments. It wasn\u2019t where Presidents get assassinated and gangs ruled the island. It wasn\u2019t full of rejected refugees who attempted to find a better life in the Dominican Republic or the United States of America but were sent back for not being the \u201cright\u201d type of immigrant. It wasn\u2019t an island where illness ran amok and the people were constantly battling a cholera outbreak. It wasn\u2019t a land full of wealth disparity where the rich are viewed as a threat if they aren\u2019t in support of the dictatorship. It wasn\u2019t an island where children were taught to only speak their native tongue at home and to use French in public so they\u2019re not viewed as uneducated and lesser. It\u2019s not the island where its other half despises it for its darker complexion and kinkier hair. Haiti was my grandfather dancing around the living room while he told the rest of us that we were all bad dancers compared to him. We\u2019re too American. Haiti was the smell of my grandmother\u2019s cooking; the salty fish, the seasoned rice, and the chewy boi. Haiti was the floral curtains my grandmother placed at every window and the singular braid she wore in her hair. Haiti was my grandmother\u2014a Haitian-Dominican-Taino woman born into poverty. When I was a child, and before I knew how inappropriate the term was, she was my real-life Pocahontas. Not in a derogatory way. At six and seven years old, it was the only way I could articulate how beautiful she was to me. She was a real Disney princess. Haiti was my grandfather\u2013A dark-skinned man who grew up with the wealth of a military man on an island full of the poor. A man fluent in Kreyol, French, English, and Spanish and attended boarding school in Cuba before joining the Haitian army. But, On April 9th, 2017, my grandmother died. On November 7th, 2022, my grandfather died. Now, Haiti is where my grandmother refused to return after being on the bitter end of the colorism and nationality divide that plagued the island of Hispaniola. Feelings of being unwanted led to feelings of isolation.

Pizza dough slathered in olive oil and pesto sauce\u2013a steamy bite to share with shivering passengers who wouldn\u2019t depart anytime soon. A freshly blended smoothie made out of banana, spinach, and coconut milk\u2013drinking too much made me feel queasy, so I had to rush to the only open bathroom on the second floor. We all ate to pass the time. The food felt like concrete at the pit of our stomach. All we could do was sit. We slept in downtrodden cafes to alleviate the hours. Each second hung in the air-a frozen fractal.\n\nDecember 19, 1 AM\nMy mother and I just reached our terminal when the announcement came on: \u201cAll Icelandair flights are canceled.\u201d The small Keflavik airport went into disarray. Parents grabbed their children\u2019s hands and dragged them through the bustling crowds to stand in line for the service desks. Young students made frantic phone calls to their parents to inform them that they wouldn\u2019t be coming back on time. Security guards tried to console a panicking family who needed to attend a wedding the next morning. Mothers soothed their crying babies while trying to figure out what to do next. There was nowhere to go. There was nothing we could do but wait.\n\nDecember 19, 7 PM\nI ached for my family. It had been three years since I saw any of them. Instead of running into my cousin\u2019s arms and relishing in my grandmother\u2019s hot noodle soups, we were frozen in time at our layover, stranded with strangers who longed for something just as terribly. The Netherlands felt like lightyears away\u2013our paths appeared to come to a dead end in Iceland. At least we made friends with two young women who were each traveling alone: Anita and Skyler \u2013\u2013 the college students from Maryland I wasn\u2019t expecting to meet over winter break. When the flights were shut down, we all clung onto each other and decided to form a pact. We made every decision together.\n\nRight now, we decided to sit next to an Irish woman who saw us standing alone in the corner. \u201cCome sit with us,\u201d she beckoned us over. Her daughter curled up next to her, as she shivered in swaths of scarves and jackets. Her blue eyes were wide with fear. The woman\u2019s voice had a hint of sweet sunshine, but the long days in the airport took its toll. She reached into a paper bag for some food, only to find out she completely ran out. Sighing, she crumpled it up and threw it away. \u201cHere,\u201d Anita shuffled through her backpack and took out an unopened bag of pretzels. \u201cEat this.\u201d The woman hesitated before taking it gratefully, \u201cThank you.\u201d She tore it open and gave them to her daughter.\n\nWe talked to her for a long time \u2013\u2013 I don\u2019t really know how long. She told us about the rolling green valleys at her home in Ireland. She spoke wistfully about the lambs she tended to and how she worried about being away from them for too long. She then mentioned that her daughter knew five different languages; they traveled around a lot. We never got her name, but her vivid stories of her peaceful life in the lush rural landscape made the ice outside appear a little warmer.\n\nI remember falling asleep on the bench squished in between people I once hardly knew.\n\nDecember 19, 10 PM\nBlades of ice dug underneath my skin, and it felt like I was dissolving into tiny glass shards that would fall into the endless heaps of snow. My hands grew numb to the pain, as they transformed into a disgusting purple. There was supposedly a hotel within eyesight. People were telling us to try and book a room at the Aurora hotel \u2013\u2013 it was only a 5 minute walk. Traversing through the winter landscape would bring us to a warm, welcoming shelter that would give us hot water and a fresh bed to sleep in. It would be worth it. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there,\u201d Anita screamed. Her shouts sounded like a distant whisper. \u201cLet\u2019s keep going.\u201d I physically could not move. My suitcase wouldn\u2019t budge from the thick pile of snow. My shoes had no grip\u2013if I fidgeted, I would slip. I watched three people in front of me drag the dead weight of their luggage through the wintry abyss. I watched the same three people fail to get beyond the first street: Anita, Skyler, and my mother. \u201cWe\u2019re turning back,\u201d Mom shouted. We were only a few meters from the automatic doors of the airport, but they stretched on for miles. I was longing to return to the gray-tainted first floor, where sludge covered the floors and people slept on airport scales. At least there, I knew we\u2019d be safe.\n\nWe cursed our way back to the front door. I relished in the warmer air that welcomed us, but was soon disillusioned by the melancholy scene. People stared at us in disbelief before turning away towards their corner. We probably looked reckless walking out in the cold like that. We were all either too tired to move or too desperate to weigh options logically. Blankets sprawled over benches and half-opened bags of dry crackers spilt onto the ground. Everyone tried to pass the seconds by trying to sleep.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe we did that,\u201d Skyler\u2019s eyes were petrified. She collapsed into a chair. She draped her jacket over her face, but from the uneven breathing, I could tell she was crying. \u201cThis is the only place where we can stay,\u201d my mother said matter-of-factly. \u201cAt least we have each other.\u201d\n\nDecember 20, 7 AM\nIt was my mother\u2019s birthday. The family was planning a day of surprises and sushi, but she was eating dry crackers and using her suitcase as a seat. This would\u2019ve been the first birthday she spent in the Netherlands in twenty years. At least she had Anita and Skyler to celebrate with. They wearily wished her a happy birthday. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to celebrate so hard when you get to Holland,\u201d Anita said.\n\nA security guard walked past us. He nodded sympathetically and asked softly if there was anything we needed. 10 minutes later, the security guard returned with a croissant drizzled with chocolate. \u201cHappy birthday!\u201d He exclaimed kindly. His eyes crinkled in the corners. \u201cOh my gosh, no way.\u201d My mother laughed, \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were actually going to come back.\u201d The security guard put his pointer finger over his mouth, \u201cShh, it\u2019s fresh from our secret oven.\u201d An older woman tapped his shoulder to ask for a water bottle. He nodded at us before turning away.\n\nMy mother unwrapped the parchment paper. She split the croissant in four to give us each a taste. Chocolate filled the inside and had a perfect, thick consistency that oozed out of the center. I closed my eyes and sank my teeth into the flaky, dense crust. Safe to say that was the best chocolate croissant I ever tasted. My mom chewed slowly and sighed peacefully, \u201cI needed this.\u201d Anita and Skyler didn\u2019t say a word. They relished in the melted filling and held their portion close to their chests. The simple croissant renewed our battery. We were now running on sweet chocolate and even sweeter gestures. No matter how frustrating our situation was, there always appeared to be a silver lining that reminded me just how kind people could be. We really were all in this together.\n\nDecember 21, 4 AM\nNo one could sleep. We sat for hours cramped in the corner of a Joe & the Juice. Any lingering aroma of coffee vanished into the sterile air. There was a thick silence that clogged my ears. A man walked past us. He was carrying a warm cup of coffee and a plastic-wrapped sandwich. My mother and I sat up. \u201cIf you need food, one of the stores is open,\u201d he whispered. \u201cJust go down and take a right.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d we said gratefully. \u201cWait here,\u201d my mother said. \u201cI\u2019ll go get stuff.\u201d She came back with two small boxes of store-bought sushi, cartons of chocolate and soy milk, Biscoff cookies, and pretzels. Skyler and Anita woke up with their stomachs rumbling. We cleared a small circular table and set up our breakfast (or dinner, whatever it was). We accidentally woke up a lightly sleeping couple next to us. They wearily looked at our food and fumbled through their backpacks to take out their own bags of stale chips and dried fruits. Without saying a word, we scooted over to make room for them and offered them some cookies. Like an invitation, our little banquet became another meeting spot to exchange stories. We shared snacks and talked about where we all would\u2019ve been right now. We laughed over crumbly Oreo bites and tomato basil pretzels. The couple was planning a trip to London to check it off their bucket list. They had been saving up to go on a tour around the world. They were only supposed to stay in London for a few days before moving on \u2013\u2013 now, their planned itinerary had to be thrown away.\n\nAs silence fell upon us again, I sunk back down into the uncomfortable armchair and let myself completely space out. My head hurt and my body felt stiff, but a subtle warmth made my heart glow ever so slightly. Everyone I met exhibited such small yet powerful displays of kindness\u2013from the stories they performed to get our mind off of the endless night to the willingness to share a crowded bench with a complete stranger, these nameless faces reminded me of the good in people. My eyes began to close again, and I could still taste hints of the chocolate croissant and envision the landscapes of Ireland. Everyone had something beautiful to share.\n\nDecember 22, 7 AM\nThe airport finally saw the day. Passengers began to stream into the once-empty terminals. I even saw a plane take off. Maybe the Irish woman or the young couple were on it. My mother and I walked Anita to her gate after we said goodbye to Skyler. We had spent the last night laughing hysterically over the rapid series of traumatic events. \u201cHave fun in Paris,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd send me pictures!\u201d \u201cWill do,\u201d she promised. \u201cSame to you in Holland!\u201d We hugged each other. I watched Anita arrive at her gate. I wondered if I was ever going to see her again, or if I would just watch her blossom from a distance through her social media posts. Stories of her life would become a memory, all nestled within the grooves and crevices of the Keflavik airport.\n\nIt was bittersweet watching the planes take off. They were filled with passengers who became fragments of our memorable story in Iceland. What a wondrous hub an airport can be \u2013\u2013 it\u2019s the intersection of an infinite amount of life histories, yet we are often moving too quickly to embrace it. It\u2019s not every day when you have nowhere to go at an airport. I thought about the kind security guard who went out of his way to make my mother\u2019s day a little more special. I remember how he squatted down to meet us at eye level and listen to our tales of our family in Holland. I never saw him after that one night. We were all nameless, anonymous strangers who found a new community on the first floor of the Keflavik airport. The stories we told, the sugary snacks that fueled us at 3 AM and the jackets we shared as blankets provided the warmth that we physically lacked. Laughter, a spontaneous sprinkle of kindness, and a secret birthday croissant really does cure the soul \u2013\u2013 they make everything slightly easier to digest.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/05/05/wilson-house/", "response": "```\nThe feathers, the pom-poms, the sequins \u2013\u2013 all typical staples of that closet in the basement. Forgotten, outgrown, overpriced pieces from two seasons ago, and two decades ago. I go fishing in that closet everytime I go to visit. Diving into the past, combing through the pieces I remember from last time, and discovering a new chest of drawers beneath five white kurtas. My grandmother\u2019s house can only be described as full. The garden in the front, the figerie in the back, the garage, the fridge, the pantry, every drawer \u2013\u2013 it is all full. That burgeoning house. Nanima\u2019s house was where I learned of ornateness, and where my desire to be forever-adorned and surrounded by beauty was born. Each summer, one of her children travels to her, and each summer, the fullness has multiplied. They come to give her structure, to help her see the method that can be found in her messes. They try to organize and label and contain and shelve Nanima. Her daughter empties every kitchen cabinet, wipes it down and restocks them all according to type, use and proximity to the sink. She pastes Post-Its on each cabinet, to guide Nanima until she knows the contents by her own memory. But by each autumn, she has overcorrected, flowing back in her same paths, dismantling any resemblance of their systems. Nanima never repeats an outfit. Each time I pour over her old clothes, shoes, and jewelry, I wonder how she ever managed to collect so much, move it across 11 homes, and invest so intently in a piece I can call my favorite twenty years after she bought it and still wear it fifty years younger than she is. I wonder who gave her that eye for value, for style, for legacy. Nanima taught me too much jewelry was the perfect amount, that a vest needs feathers, fur, or leather and the meditation of tending to a garden. Meeting Nanima, you would hardly believe she ever meditated. You would hardly believe she has ever sat still. Nanima walks through her gardens, each day, noting each blossom, weed, and empty plot. She claws through her fridge, the ingredients at the front are all she can gather to use. She wanders through town, picking up what is already in the back of her fridge. Nanima\u2019s house, her mind, is overflowing. Each object has a legacy, each thought has wisdom. The fruit of the day is seasonal, and every piece is an heirloom. I, the youngest of her daughter\u2019s girls, watching all that she does, absorbing all that she is. I marvel at her. And I wonder where it all came from. At high tide the ocean was in the garden , Nanima recalls. It is that mirage of a homecoming that strikes deepest. The distant, fading, illusion of what we once had, of what once housed us. The walls that used to surround us, and the sky we used to play under. Nanima was born Vrinda Dutt, the daughter of the Port Master of Bombay (now, Mumbai), the youngest of two girls, and set to marry a friend of another prominent family in the area. Her mother endowed her with all of her independence. Vrinda did not fit in at Irish Catholic school. The nuns hated her, and she resented them. Vrinda showed up to her first day in her little frock with ruffled sleeves and open back (Bombay gets quite hot in the summer). Her mother said, \u201cone look at your dress and they aren\u2019t even going to let you in the door.\u201d The Port Master\u2019s House, Wilson House, was a grand, three story house for six families of mariners. The house was a gift of the British Navy, to the people of their own land.  The British built it for themselves, so it was the best.  Vrinda\u2019s father was the first Indian to be Harbor Master since the British left. Along with cooks, maids, and servants for the children, all the families lived in luxury on the West coast of India. The Dutts lived on the bottom floor, which gave them the garden. They threw parties every night. Wilson House was like something out of The Great Gatsby \u2013\u2013 extravagance, grandeur, and unbelievable beauty. Shining silver plates of food and sparking saris on every lovely girl.  Everybody knew that house.  All of the girls would get married in that garden. During the days, Vrinda would sit out on her veranda, making batik saris. There was enough room for a small stove to melt the wax, and for the six yards of sari fabric to lay out. At high tide, the ocean waves would roll in and wash over the garden. She woke up every morning to that sound, and it played all day. We never took any pictures.  Wilson House was supposed to be there forever.  Vrinda was supposed to get married, move to Boston with her husband, spend some time in America, and come back every year to visit. Ravi and Vrinda Bhalla, in the Wilson House garden. (Photograph provided by Lyla Bhalla-Ladd)  Nanima last saw the Port Master\u2019s house in 2004, when she visited for the last time. In the carnage of the aftermath of Partition, the British destroyed that Bombay. That oasis on the coast, that garden, all lost to memory. It was like a dream, you\u2019re lucky if you remember anything of it. Wilson House stays alive through the memories shared and passed on. Nanima lives through the house now. I see glimpses of it in her new garden. I see her view over the San Francisco Bay, and imagine the Indian Ocean. I see her replanting and harvesting, studying to know everything she can. I wish I could have seen Wilson House, but the bones of that building may not have meant as much to me as Nanima\u2019s words do. More than I wonder what kind of house it was, what the parties looked like, or how the ocean breeze felt in the Indian heat, I wonder who that girl on the veranda was. The youngest daughter, whirling around those fantastic parties, giggling with her cousins. That young girl, in her ruffled frock, stared down by Irish nuns. Who she was in that house, who she was in that old Bombay. If we lose who we were there, when it is gone. She wouldn\u2019t live anywhere in the states but California.  I had to have palm trees.  When she landed at LAX, and saw the lines of palm trees surrounding the pick-up lanes, she decided she could stay. Her home had to pay tribute to old Bombay, nothing less could feel right. All that home is, all that it was, and all that we were in it. It is a mirage of a homecoming to some. An old memory, a demolished house, an India no longer there. What becomes of a memory so far gone?  Now I make up for it. I take three hundred photos of everything.  The fondness of home keeps it alive. The memories shared and the cherished moments help dull the pain of loss. All that home is. When home is gone, when we did not get to say goodbye. All that it was. Chai with the boy who used to live next door, and phone calls with him even today. All that we were in it. The youngest daughter, feisty as her mother, looking out west over the water.\n```"}

According to Statista\u2019s global 2022 report, nearly 60% of LinkedIn users are between the ages of 25-34. The 18 to 24 age group makes up only 20.4% of the network\u2019s user base. This age imbalance is evident from the nature of posts on the platform. While Gen Z-dominated sites reflect either a sarcastic or self-deprecatory tone, Linkedin is known to exhibit toxic positivity and promotes a capitalistic notion of success.\n\nAs a Digital Social Media student (yes, it is an actual degree), we have heavily discussed how pretentious all these networking apps can be. But why is only LinkedIn met with such an \u2018ick\u2019? I believe the reason is manifested in the foundation of these networking platforms. Platforms like Instagram and Facebook work to let you be whatever you want to be. You can blatantly hide behind the armor of filters, phony usernames, fan accounts, and \u2018finstas\u2019 to express your chosen self. On the other hand, our LinkedIn profiles are verified accounts that need to accurately display our personal details like age, gender, date of birth, tenure of our last job, years taken to complete the degree, and so on, which box our life journeys into achievements or shame. It also puts these labels on public display so that others may determine whether we are fit to run the corporate machine \u2014 a verdict that has consequences on our livelihood.\n\n\"When compared to its dystopian counterpart, also known as Twitter, LinkedIn feels like an antithetical response.\" (Artwork by Jasmine Kwok)\n\nWhen compared to its dystopian counterpart, also known as Twitter, LinkedIn feels like an antithetical response. Everyone on LinkedIn is constantly \u2018elated.\u2019 Scores of posts begin with \u201cI\u2019m delighted/excited/happy/thrilled to announce,\u201d phrases that seem to only exist on the platform. The site has little to no opposing views, and the world is a sea filled with opportunities. When there are \u2018opposing\u2019 views, they are curated to yes-man an ulterior Foucauldian invisible corporate power structure. LinkedIn becomes the simulacrum of everything wrong with capitalist hustle culture.\n\nDo you really want me to reward you for giving a woman a maternity leave (something mandated by law), or a pat on the back for not screaming at the intern who messed up at job, or giving food to a homeless man on your way to a meeting? Each of these acts are commonly discussed on the platform and boasted about. The site has almost devolved into a race to reach the bare minimum benchmark.\n\nYet, are we shooting the messenger? Especially when the real culprit is capitalism? Well, no. Not when the messenger is an enabler! What excited people about the emergence of social media was its subverting of old structures and the redistribution of voice. What angers youth is the flourishing existence of a platform that not only mirrors but celebrates toxic traditions like hustling, overworking, and brown-nosing. The generational gap in thought around these notions becomes very evident on this network. The worldview around work culture and capitalism has changed over the years but LinkedIn has unfortunately not been able to keep up with this evolution.\n\nDo you really want me to reward you for giving a woman a maternity leave, or a pat on the back for not screaming at the intern who messed up at job, or giving food to a homeless man on your way to a meeting?

Companies like to stay away from candidates wrapped in red tape. On top of that, when recruiters view my Linkedin profile to put a name on my face, I know they may easily put a race to my face. My name sounds brown, and my profile screams it. There\u2019s a reason why putting your photo on your CV in the US is inadvisable. It exposes apprehensions regarding implicit biases, and Linkedin conveniently surpasses all these courtesies.\n\nIt was interesting how the tone changed when I spoke about this with people over 25. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we boast our achievements after all?\u201d exclaimed Richie (28), an LA-based marketer who found her current job through LinkedIn. \u201cMore than boasting, LinkedIn is about showcasing our achievements and leveraging those to make new connections. It helped me interact with recruiters who are usually hard to find!\u201d Stuti (25), a research student at USC, spoke about how after the changing ownership and drama that unfolded on Musk\u2019s Twitter, LinkedIn became the place for academics to find like-minded people and have an intellectual discourse. She says she keeps her personal opinions aside when networking with these connections as they could be her future employers or guides.\n\nWhile the defenses seem justified, they don\u2019t outweigh LinkedIn\u2019s many flaws, one of which was discussed profusely after the George Floyd case in the US. Many Black Americans expressed how the platform stifled their posts calling out racism and white supremacy in workplaces. \u201cLinkedIn has shadowbanned me at least once. They never admit this, so it\u2019s a type of gaslighting,\u201d shared S. Anne Marrie, an HR consultant, on social media. \u201cThey allow a lot of racists to run rampant in the comments here, but when people of color, especially black women, comment about racism, they are swift to slap the virtual handcuffs and gags on.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, New York Times Magazine highlighted more of these instances in an article about LinkedIn\u2019s racial and algorithmic bias against Black people. \u201cThe social network\u2019s tone has long reflected corporate America: staid, monolithic, white.\u201d\n\nThe company responded to this article by apologizing for its oversight and reassuring users that all voices matter. #Metoo and #BLM were two movements that brought considerable change to workplaces, by exposing the innate misogyny and white domination. The effect has now trickled down to LinkedIn, wherein now people have started using their voices to bring such injustices to light.\n\nNot all devils need advocates. Some need to be summoned by the Gen Z shade. There is no current alternative to the platform, so I will keep using thesaurus versions of hardworking to describe myself and my friends. I will control my chuckle when my friends\u2019 \u2018happy announcements\u2019 about companies that took 5 months, 4 interview rounds, and his 3 mental breakdowns to get back to them, pop up. Workplaces are still battling their infestations like race domination, patriarchy, and nepotism. All we can do is hope that LinkedIn as a platform echoes this change.\n```"}

(Photos by Alan Mittelstaedt)\n\nBy Philip Salata May 03, 2023 at 7:48 pm PDT\n\nTwo USC Annenberg students and reporters for The Talk of Troy, a student-led multiplatform sports podcast, have mounted a legal defense after facing accusations of stealing three jerseys at the NFL Draft in Kansas City. The students were two of five credentialed Annenberg Media journalists who had official identification.\n\nCourt documents allege they were \u201ctrespassing,\u201d when they entered the \u201cTalent Waiting Room\u201d and the \u201cNike Room.\u201d Eric Lambkins II and Jude Oca\u00f1as were returning to Los Angeles Friday after completing Annenberg Media\u2019s first-ever live coverage of the draft, when Kansas City Police boarded the airplane, arrested and detained them. They were charged with second-degree theft and first-degree trespassing. They each posted $2,500 bail Saturday and have returned to campus.\n\nDefense attorney David Bell, who represents both students, issued the following statement: \u201cOut of respect for our system of justice, we are not going to comment on the evidence outside of the courtroom. We are confident that the unique set of circumstances in this case, combined with the extraordinary reputations of Mr. Lambkins and Mr. Oca\u00f1as, will result in a fair and equitable resolution to all parties involved.\u201d\n\nThey were charged with the theft of three NFL draft jerseys marked with the number 1 for first-draft picks. The first-round draft took place Thursday night, meaning the jerseys in question were no longer to be used for the event.\n\nLambkins is a journalism graduate student at Annenberg, a U.S. Army veteran and a rising sports journalist and documentary filmmaker. He is also a prominent advocate for Black journalists at USC and a managing editor at Annenberg Media, a student-led newsroom supported by the Journalism School. Lambkins is one of the founding members and visionaries of The Talk of Troy, and had spent the year sculpting the relationships that could provide a team of students the opportunity to cover the NFL Draft. He and his team produced hours of coverage and livestreaming content for all platforms of Annenberg Media, including television, radio, social and digital.\n\nOca\u00f1as is a freshman journalism major with aspirations to become an NFL analyst. He joined The Talk of Troy NFL draft broadcasting team and exhibited outstanding knowledge of the league. Among other awards, he received a USC Deans Scholarship and the Jacki and Gilbert Wells Cisneros Endowed Scholarship awarded to a new student of Latin American descent with outstanding academic performance.\n\nThe trip, as with all Annenberg Media travel, was funded by the Journalism School. The Talk of Troy team regularly broadcasts sports coverage throughout the year on Annenberg Media. Earlier this year Lambkins organized a team to cover the East/West Shrine Bowl in Las Vegas, a game that showcases the talents of college football players in front of top NFL team representatives.\n\nWhen asked for comment, USC\u2019s public relations team issued a one-sentence statement: \u201cWhile limited by student privacy laws in what we can share, we are cooperating with the authorities in this matter and will follow our internal processes with respect to any allegations of misconduct.\u201d\n\nA USC representative would not say whether the university reached out to the students before crafting the statement or if the students had been asked to waive any privacy rules. Both Lambkins and Oca\u00f1as are currently back on campus completing their finals. After winning Annenberg\u2019s Jack Langguth First Amendment Award last month, Lambkins is also preparing for graduation next week.\n\nDefense attorney Bell filed a motion Wednesday to postpone the arraignment for both students for approximately 45 days to later in June. \u201cThe parties believe that the requested continuance will provide sufficient time to share discovery, and further, to minimize the number of in-person court appearances to resolve the case,\u201d the motion reads.\n```"}

The USC Men\u2019s Mental Health Initiative aims to destigmatize men\u2019s mental health in a campus setting by facilitating conversation through discussions and activities.\n\n\u201cSome of my friends, who are male, have said comments to me regarding mental health that building into the stigma. Statements such as \u2018I feel weak, right now,\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk\u2019 or \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be feeling this,\u2019 \u2018I should be stronger,\u2019 \u2018I should be manly,\u2019\u201d said Sam Stack, founder and president of USC MMHI.\n\nStack, a sophomore communications major, said hearing those kinds of comments from those close to him led him to want to create a place where people can talk things out and break the stigma around men\u2019s mental health, especially in college-aged men. USC MMHI acts as a peer-to-peer support group to facilitate these discussions.\n\n\u201cIf someone\u2019s kind of feeling down, they can come and use this as a safe place where they can choose to share or just choose to listen and see that they\u2019re not alone,\u201d Stack said.\n\nContrary to the name, meetings are open to anyone, not just men. The meetings begin with a presentation and lecture about a specific topic within mental illness, including common ones within college and the symptoms and signs of these illnesses. The lecture is then followed by a discussion session facilitated with questions and then opens to anything, including how to help break the stigma.\n\n\u201cI think for us, it\u2019s kind of just about strengthening the bonds of our existing community and making our community more vulnerable and more open to these kinds of conversations so that nobody ever feels like they can\u2019t speak up about this,\u201d said Yoav Gillath, vice president of the club.\n\n\u201cJust like you say, \u2018Oh, you have a cold right now?\u2019\u201d Gillath said. \u201cSorry, you\u2019re dealing with the sniffles.\u201d Within the club, it is made clear that everything said is confidential. People can come and share what they\u2019ve experienced and what they\u2019re feeling, or they can choose to just listen.\n\nMen\u2019s mental health is discussed far less than women\u2019s mental health. Because of this, there is a more prevalent stigma when it comes to men\u2019s mental health. The frequently used term \u201ctoxic masculinity,\u201d and the pressure to act \u201cmanly,\u201d position men to seek help much less than women. Because of this, men often suffer in silence.\n\n\u201cThere are gender differences in terms of health seeking, so it\u2019s kind of well known that women are more likely to reach out to get help for depression and anxiety,\u201d said Elyn Saks, a mental health law professor at Gould School of Law. \u201cOne question is why is that? It may partly be the stereotypical strong independent man who doesn\u2019t need help, but we don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d she said.\n\nMental health is being more commonly talked about now more than ever before, and it is becoming less taboo, but there is still work to be done.\n\n\u201cI think connecting with each other is just a really great thing to do,\u201d Saks said. \u201cThe stigma is getting better. I think connecting with each other is just a really great thing to do. People are willing to accept help more, and people are willing to provide more help. It\u2019s going in the right direction.\u201d\n\nWhile women experience higher rates of mental health issues, men are more likely to die from suicide. \u201cMen commit suicide at much higher frequencies, and they receive treatment at much lower frequencies for anxiety for depression,\u201d Gillath said.\n\nBreaking the walls people often put up is a main goal of the club. The most frequent answer to the thoughtless question of \u201chow are you?\u201d is \u201cgood.\u201d But the person answering the question might not actually be good. Taking a deeper dive into these conversations and expanding the dialogue to get people to feel more comfortable asking for help is another aim of the club.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons people don\u2019t talk is because they feel so alone and feel so isolated,\u201d Stack said. \u201cBut once you get into these groups, once you get into these peer-to-peer settings where you realize that other people are going through similar things that you\u2019re feeling and similar emotions, you are way more inclined to open up and kind of dissect why you\u2019re feeling the way you are, rather than keeping it in and having a build up over time.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to get caught up going through the motions in college, it is important to remember to check in on yourself and your loved ones. The smallest things can make the biggest impacts.\n\n\u201cJust don\u2019t keep it in, just know that there are so many resources and so many people around you willing to talk to you whether you know that or not,\u201d Stack said. \u201cKnow that you are not alone in what you\u2019re feeling.\u201d He added that college students are \u201call going through these times together.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though you may feel isolated, or kind of in that dark, lonely place, many other people are going through the same emotions you\u2019re feeling,\u201d Stack said. \u201cAnd all it takes is just one talk. Checking in on friends and just opening that conversation. The main thing that we can do is just talk about it.\u201d\n\nAlong with reaching out and seeking help, it\u2019s important to take time to step away on a daily basis whether it\u2019s to get some fresh air, reading, taking a deep breath or unplugging from technology.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just being comfortable and asking questions that make you uncomfortable as well,\u201d Stack said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to do that. When someone asks, be honest, be truthful.\u201d\n\nIn the future, club officials said they hope to bring in professionals in the mental health and psychology fields. To find out about upcoming meetings and events, students can follow the club on Instagram. Meetings are held on Mondays from 7-8 p.m. and free pizza is provided at the meetings.\n```"}

The Trojans played 36 holes on the first day and finished the first two rounds with a combined team score of 10 over par. After the second day, USC was in 11th place at 18 over par as a team. Freshman Mahanth Chirravuri shot a 69 to make him even through his first 54 holes of the tournament. On the final day, the Trojans were able to move up one spot on the leaderboard to 10th place, with Stanford winning the tournament by 13 strokes. Chirravuri tied for 20th place individually (69-72-69-70).\n\n\u201cIt was kind of a disappointing end,\u201d head coach J.T. Higgins said. \u201cWe were playing better golf this spring, and I really hoped that we would go in and compete and maybe put ourselves in a position to have a strong finish at the Pac-12 Championship, but we just never could get anything going.\u201d Higgins explained that the course was set up really fairly with opportunities to score well, but the team was unable to take advantage of it. \u201cI think the number one obstacle was that off the tee, we didn\u2019t do a very good job of taking care of the ball, and we weren\u2019t sharp with drivers or our tee shots,\u201d he said.\n\nChirravuri\u2019s performance was a bright spot in an otherwise underwhelming showing for the Trojans. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of Mahanth for his play, and I\u2019m fairly certain he\u2019s going to be on the Pac-12 All-Freshman team,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cHe had a nice finish and played really solid golf all three days, so that was the highlight.\u201d Higgins highlighted seniors Jack Boulger, who tied for 39th place (74-70\u201371-70), and Parker Sisk, who tied for 53rd (74-70-74-73). \u201cJack\u2019s final round was an even-par 70, so that was great to see, and Parker got his best round in this tournament, so they both had some flashes of really nice play,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cIt was nice to see them play some good golf, and we\u2019re going to miss them and wish them both the best.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future, sophomore Jackson Rivera and freshman Chirravuri will compete in the NCAA Regional Championships as individual entries at the Institute Golf Course in Morgan Hill, California. Higgins knows there is room for his team to improve come next season. \u201cEveryone else is going to go work on their games over the summer, playing amateur golf,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some good players coming in next fall, and we\u2019re hoping to be a lot better next year.\u201d \n```"}

(Photo by Aayush Khator)\n\nBy Crash \"CrashLit\" Collier May 03, 2023 at  2:35 pm PDT\n\nEver since she made the decision to move out west, Skylar Fields has been living up to her namesake: she\u2019s flying nonstop. But it\u2019s not just airplane trips \u2014 when she rises up above the net at Galen Center to get to the ball, she\u2019s flying.\n\n\u201cSkylar is a national team type of player in terms of athletic ability,\u201d USC head coach Brad Keller said. \u201cShe\u2019s jumping up around 11 feet, she\u2019s got a really good arm, she\u2019s been one of the top athletes at every stage of her life. She\u2019s a difference maker.\u201d\n\nFields\u2019 first season in Cardinal and Gold was nothing short of impressive. The graduate transfer outside hitter picked up right where she left off at Texas by improving and expanding on all aspects of her game to take it to another level. Fields quickly became the go-to option for the Trojans\u2019 offense and is a consistent threat at the net. Most importantly, she serves as a crucial team leader in Keller\u2019s quest to take USC all the way to a national championship.\n\nAs the middle child of three siblings, Fields grew up in a very athletic family in Missouri City, Texas. Her younger brother, Jackson, just finished up his freshman season on the men\u2019s basketball team at Troy, while her older sister, Sydnye, played volleyball at North Carolina from 2015 to 2017 before finishing her collegiate career at Texas A&M in 2018. Her family\u2019s athletic ambition gave Fields a natural competitiveness, a drive to improve that she brings to the court.\n\nDespite the distance, Skylar is still incredibly close to her entire family. \u201cWe\u2019re really close. I love that, cause I know that it\u2019s not the case for everybody, so I really take advantage of everything that my family does,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been close. I can\u2019t remember a time I wasn\u2019t close with my family.\u201d\n\nAs a kid, Fields tried playing a variety of different sports before settling on volleyball at age 13 after watching her older sister play. She credits her 13\u2032s coach Lauren Rhodes as being a major influence on her. Rhodes told Fields that she could be really good if she took the sport seriously throughout middle and high school. The work paid off, as Fields committed to and joined the women\u2019s volleyball team at the University of Texas.\n\nFields enjoyed every moment at Texas and was named the Big XII Freshman of the Year in 2019 and as well as a three-time AVCA All-Southwest Region selection and a three-time Big XII All-Conference first-team choice. Despite those accolades, she made the difficult decision to enter the transfer portal after three years with the Longhorns.\n\nDue to her aspirations to play for the Senior U.S. Women\u2019s National Team, Fields wanted to improve her back row game as an outside hitter. Her coaches at Texas routinely substituted her out of the match when she rotated to the back row, so she decided that it was time to find a new home.\n\n\u201cI need someone who wants to help me take it to the next level without me having to ask every single day, like, \u2018Hey, you said we were going to do this? We haven\u2019t done it yet,\u2019\u201d Fields said. \u201cI gotta put myself first, I can\u2019t keep letting people lie to my face. I wanna get better.\u201d\n\nAfter consulting with USC junior setter and future roommate Mia Tuaniga, whom she had played with on the U21 U.S. National Team, and head coach Brad Keller, Fields was sold on becoming a Trojan. Tuaniga told her about how much she loved the coaching staff and her experience with USC. In addition, Keller was willing to take a chance on allowing her to play back row.\n\nKeller was a college coach in men\u2019s volleyball for over 10 years, where teams only have six substitutions per set compared to 15 on the women\u2019s side. He is much more accustomed to developing players that he sees as difference makers to play all six rotations.\n\n\u201cIt was the best decision I could have made,\u201d Fields said. \u201cNot only because I\u2019ve been able to grow and expand my game, but also because I really found who I was.\u201d\n\nThe move paid off, as Fields led the Pac-12 in total kills, kills per set and points per set while ranking in the top five nationally in all three of those categories in 2022. She was named to both the 2022 AVCA All-America First Team and the 2022 Pac-12 All Conference Team.\n\nIn addition to becoming a major contributor for the Trojans, Fields has also become a team leader. Fields shows her vertical while spiking the ball during a game against Cal November 12, 2022. Head coach Brad Keller called her a \"national team player in terms of athletic ability.\" (Photo by Drake Lee)\n\nBoth Keller and Tuaniga attested that she holds everyone, including herself, accountable, but in a way that is positive and brings people up, not pushes them down.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always gonna tell you how it is,\u201d Tuaniga said. \u201cYou always know what you\u2019re gonna get when you go talk to Skylar.\u201d\n\nFields\u2019 favorite moments last season were the Trojans\u2019 two victories over crosstown rival UCLA, first in Westwood before beating the Bruins again on senior night at the Galen Center. Fields said those matches were special not just because of the heated rivalry the two schools have, but also because of the personal ties between the two teams. Graduate libero Kelli Berry transferred in from UCLA for her final season of eligibility, while Keller worked at UCLA for seven years and served as the associate head coach for the Bruins for one year prior to being hired as USC\u2019s head coach in 2020.\n\nGoing into the offseason, Keller said that Fields needs to improve her blocking, passing and landing on two feet after taking a swing at the net. The latter is what he said has led to ankle injuries throughout her career. As she works her way back to 100% on the sidelines, she is still being a leader in every way possible.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s goal is to win a national championship. But I think one of our main goals is to push our limits and see how far we can really go,\u201d Fields said. \u201cWe have potential, we can win the Pac-12, we can make a deep run in the tournament, upset some teams and win a national championship.\u201d\n\nOutside of volleyball, Fields enjoys reading, listening to music and going to the beach with her teammates after practice. Another interesting passion Fields has is that she likes to make music. While more of a hobby for her, it speaks to who she is creatively and how there are endless dimensions to her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the studio a couple times and just played around,\u201d Skylar said. \u201cI can see how artists want to be artists and get to make music, it\u2019s really fun in the studio. It\u2019s dope.\u201d\n\nTuaniga mentioned that Skylar is always up to find something to do with her teammates, whether it be finding new restaurants in LA or doing something fun like watching the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 2022 Super Bowl Parade.\n\nSkylar also misses going home on weekends, something that she did frequently while at Texas to get to see her parents.\n\n\u201cBeing away from home has been different,\u201d Fields said. \u201cDuring the season I was really distracted, not really thinking about being away from home, but this spring I\u2019ve had a couple moments where I was like \u2018Dang, I wish I could go home for the weekend.\u2019 I miss being around my family.\u201d\n\nUpon graduating in December 2023 with a degree in Communications, Fields hopes to play for the Senior U.S. National Team with a goal of competing in the 2028 Olympics. But that\u2019s not all \u2014 she hopes to be a celebrity stylist too. She has other career goals as well.\n\n\u201cI kind of want to work in the operations of a professional sports team, so whether it\u2019s being a director of opps or behind the scenes,\u201d Fields said. \u201cAlso, I would like to do social media for a professional sports team.\u201d\n\nBoth Keller and Tuaniga see endless potential in Fields.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited to see what she does and where she goes. Not even the sky\u2019s the limit. There\u2019s no limit for her,\u201d Tuaniga said. \u201cAnything she puts her mind to, she\u2019s gonna go out there, conquer it, and say \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019 I\u2019m just super excited to just be her setter.\u201d\n\nFields is preparing for her final season with the Trojans next fall, when they begin their 2023 campaign. Keller knows the end of her time at USC will be just the beginning for her.\n\n\u201cI still think today that one day that she is going to be a CEO of a company or she is gonna be the president of the United States,\u201d Keller said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things about Skylar that are fantastic. And I don\u2019t say special often, I do think that she\u2019s a special individual. Charisma is a word you could use, but magnetic is the term I would use. She draws a lot of people towards her and makes a lot of people feel better. Not a lot of people have that ability.\u201d\n```"}

In a dugout usually occupied by the Los Angeles Angels, Stankiewicz gathered every member of the Trojans\u2019 roster and coaching staff into a huddle for a meeting that would last several minutes following an 8-4 defeat to Long Beach State.\n\n\u201cThe message was that we\u2019ve got to be more consistent,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cWe\u2019re good in spurts, but this game is not going to reward you being good for one at bat and going away for three, or having one good inning on the mound and not being to repeat it the second time out there. The only way this program is going to become great again is if we get consistent effort and concentration out of nine guys. We lost a little of that.\u201d\n\nThe lack of consistency from USC was clear from the start, both on the mound and in the batter\u2019s box. Tuesday night\u2019s contest between the Trojans and Long Beach State was no ordinary midweek game in the college baseball season. The two teams did battle at Angel Stadium in Anaheim, USC\u2019s first game there in two decades. The game also promised to be a high scoring affair, given the starting pitching matchup. Junior right-hander Jaden Agassi was making his first start for USC since April 4th, while junior right-hander Jake Rons started just his third game of the season for the Dirtbags with an ERA above ten.\n\nBoth starters pitched scoreless first innings, but while Ross continued to pitch well throughout the night, Agassi lost his command in the second. Aided by a leadoff hit batsman and a subsequent four-pitch walk, Long Beach State loaded the bases. Agassi then buckled down, recording two huge outs to get a path out of the inning. However, junior right fielder Jashia Morrissey-Jakel did the most damage he could with two outs, hitting a grand slam just inside the right-field foul pole to give the Dirtbags an early four-run lead.\n\nThe grand slam was just the most damaging example of a consistent theme for Long Beach State: doing its offensive damage with two outs. Junior shortstop Nick Marinconz had another key two-out knock in the top of the third, driving in two runs on a base hit to center field. Overall, the Dirtbags hit a staggering .529 with two outs in the game, scoring seven of their eight runs in that fashion. The only run scored by Long Beach State without two outs came in the first at-bat of the seventh inning, on a solo homer to left center by junior catcher Connor Burns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make the right pitch to finish [innings],\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got three outs, not two. We can\u2019t be good for one or two batters and then let it slip away on the third, because these are big, strong young men. That\u2019s part of our lack of consistency.\u201d\n\nThroughout the evening, the USC offense had a great deal of trouble against Rons, who pitched his best game of 2023. Rons went six full innings on the hill, his longest outing of his career, while striking out a career-high nine batters and allowing just one run. The Trojans had 10 base hits on the night, only two fewer than the Dirtbags, but the timing of the hits made all the difference. USC stranded 12 runners while striking out 12 times as a team.\n\n\u201cWe have to be better with two strikes and see the ball better,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cThis is a pitching staff that\u2019s good, they know what they\u2019re doing. They were expanding with two strikes, and we were swinging at balls. It\u2019s hard to be a good hitting team if you\u2019re not swinging at strikes. We had too many strikeouts out of the zone.\u201d\n\nThe lone offensive bright spot for the Trojans was freshman catcher Jacob Galloway. Galloway, making just the seventh start of his career, was 3-for-4 at the plate with a triple and three runs scored. After falling behind by six runs in the first three innings of the game, the Trojans struggled to catch up all night. In each of the last two innings, they brought the tying run on deck trailing by four runs, but redshirt freshman second baseman Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek and senior pinch hitter Adrian Colon-Rosado grounded out to short each time to stifle the potential rally.\n\nThe loss drops USC to 25-18-1 on the season. The most noticeable split for this team in 2023 has been its record at and away from Dedeaux Field; USC is 20-5 at home and 5-13-1 in road and neutral site games.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can [explain the difference between home and away records],\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of our development, too. It shouldn\u2019t matter where we\u2019re playing, it\u2019s baseball. It\u2019s the same diamond, everything\u2019s the same.... We have to control our environment better and be concerned not with where we are, but how we play when we\u2019re there.\n\nThe Trojans will not have much time to lick their wounds, as they will take on Cal State Fullerton on Wednesday night in a road makeup game, before returning home for a three-game weekend set against the Oregon Ducks.\n```"}

(Photo by Sam Bitman).\n\nBy Terence Holton May 02, 2023 at 9:30 pm PDT\n\nAfter a first-round exit for both USC men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball, I am already looking forward to the future and what type of talent coaches Andy Enfield and Lindsey Gottlieb are bringing in.\n\nFive-Star Point Guard Isaiah Collier\n\nUSC men\u2019s basketball\u2019s shining star in this year\u2019s recruiting cycle, Collier, may elevate this USC team to a whole new level next year. Collier is the No. 1 overall recruit in this year\u2019s high school class and he will have fans at Galen Center on their feet all of next year. Collier is 6 foot 3 and 180 pounds of pure, raw athleticism. Collier is a shifty guard who can get up and down in a matter of seconds and throw it down on a defender. Collier is described as one of the best passers in the class of 2023 and is always looking to make his teammates better.\n\nThis past year, Collier led Wheeler High School to a 27-7 record and a Georgia state championship, averaging 20.2 points, 5.1 rebounds and 6.8 assists per game. Collier racked up awards after that, including a Nike Hoop Summit invitation, McDonald\u2019s All American game invitation, McDonald\u2019s All American game MVP and was named Naismith Boys Basketball Player of the Year.\n\nThe backcourt of Collier and Boogie Ellis will arguably be one of the best in the nation and will have Galen Center rocking all year.\n\nFour-Star Forward Arrinten Page\n\nCollier\u2019s main partner in crime will be his high school teammate Arrinten Page. Page is a 6-foot-9, 220-pound forward who, like I said, played for Wheeler High School alongside Collier. Page was ranked the No. 55 overall recruit in the country and is going way under the radar as far as highly touted recruits go.\n\nPage can stretch the floor well for a traditional big man with his ball handling and 3-point ability affecting the game a lot more than most big men. But don\u2019t get me wrong, he is still a lob threat underneath and can dunk on anyone.\n\nIn the State Champions Invitational semifinal round \u2014 a tournament comprising some of the best state championship winning teams in the country \u2014 Page exploded for 24 points and three blocks in a win versus one of the best teams in the country, Roselle Catholic.\n\nWhile he may not be the highest ranked player in USC\u2019s class, you just have to watch the film because Page moves like a younger Evan Mobley. Just don\u2019t be surprised if Page is a key contributor to this Trojans squad off the bench. Down the road, just know I told you so if he becomes a force to be reckoned with.\n\nOn the women\u2019s side, the recruiting talent is just as good, if not better.\n\nFive-Star Guard Juju Watkins\n\nWatkins is what we in the recruiting world would call a program-changing recruit. Watkins, the No. 1 overall recruit, won the Naismith Girls Basketball Player of the Year Award along with countless other awards. Watkins will be a starter from day one and will take over as point guard on this Trojans squad.\n\nWatkins is an all-around scorer and even dropped 60 points on her senior night. That outburst of scoring had people, including LeBron James, reposting her highlights and calling her \u201cHermothy.\u201d Watkins will provide a huge boost of scoring to a USC team that, at times, struggled to put the ball in the basket.\n\nWatkins also is a phenomenal rebounder and will fit right in with this USC team defensively as she is described as an elite defender. During her senior year, Watkins averaged 24.5 points and 10.3 rebounds.\n\nFour-Star Guard Malia Samuels\n\nAnother great guard edition to the Trojan backcourt is Malia Samuels. Samuels is smaller, at 5 foot 6, but is extremely quick and a fantastic passer that has been praised for her one-on-one fast break ability. Once again, she is a great addition to this stifling Trojan defense as Samuels is a great defender and uses her speed to get in front of opponents.\n\nSamuels tore her ACL before the beginning of her senior year, so she will be eager to get back on the court and contribute for the Trojans.\n\nWith all these recruits, the future for Trojan basketball is bright.\n```"}

Now, he\u2019s sharing it with the world.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Moncell Durden.\n\nBy Gabriella Medina May 02, 2023 at 8:49 pm PDT\n\nMoncell Durden slumped into his office chair after teaching for over six hours. Soon, he was gushing over his newest project, Intangible Roots, with a new kind of energy. As he spoke, he stared across his office at one of the many paintings adorning the space, most of which belonged to his former students. Surprisingly, Durden is not an art professor. In fact, Durden hated all things school growing up, earning nothing but Cs and Ds in high school. Unlike the dancers he teaches at the USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance today, Durden never got a college degree. Dance wasn\u2019t so much a profession as it was a lifestyle.\n\n\u201cMy parents were social dancers, so my mother says I had no choice,\u201d Durden laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve been dancing with my feet or roller skates since the \u201870s.\u201d Durden is now the founder of Intangible Roots pedagogical school, a \u201cdynamic, polymathic experience\u201d designed to provide professional development, certification, and accreditation programs to preserve the music, movement, history and heritage of Black folkloric expression. This summer, Intangible Roots will host a two-day intensive at USC Kaufman and then begin its four-year certification program via Zoom, making Durden\u2019s teachings more accessible than ever.\n\nAmy O\u2019Neal is Durden\u2019s colleague both at Kaufman and Intangible Roots. She believes the name tells you exactly what you get out of the program. \u201cWe show you the fundamentals of Black social dance and what the actual technique is. Yes, it has technique,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll also encourage you to juxtapose this movement and this ideology against your own lived experience, to see the similarities and the differences and for you to ask questions like \u2018what are my common practices in terms of how I gesturally communicate?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the \u201880s, Durden toured with the Electric Boogaloos (the creators of the popping dance style) and befriended members of Rocksteady crew, a collective the New York Times called, \u201cthe foremost breakdancing group in the world today.\u201d While Durden finished touring with Rennie Harris\u2019 hip-hop theater collective in the \u201890s, he was forced to lead newer members\u2019 practice giving him his first-ever teaching experience. From there, his students recommended him as a hip-hop professor at Drexel University where he taught for seven years before moving to USC Kaufman.\n\nToday, Durden teaches Kaufman majors and minors both movement and lecture courses on the dances born of the African diaspora: jazz and hip hop. In a world where the mainstream\u2019s idea of hip-hop culture and dance is heavily diluted by corporate America and everyday TikTok appropriators, Durden\u2019s commitment to relaying authentic information is the perfect antidote. Thanks to Intangible Roots, these lessons are no longer limited to just USC students.\n\nDurden\u2019s Gen Z students understand his expertise and the privilege that it is to work with him. Junior dance major Diego Lopez has taken locking, house and jazz with him. \u201cI feel like his class is so rich in information and culture and just joy, overall. I had a great time learning from him\u2014he\u2019s a legend,\u201d he said.\n\nAs an educator with no college degree, Durden wanted to expand his teachings beyond the dance studios at Kaufman to help fellow prospective hip-hop educators. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a degree for this!\u201d he said. \u201cYou need practice. You need lived experience. And so what I want my certification to do for those people is to give them a seat at the table.\u201d\n\nLike most passion projects turned into businesses, Intangible Roots was born during the pandemic. Durden offered Instagram live sessions lecturing on dance simply because he wanted to\u2014and because his followers were begging for it. \u201cI decided I would go live every week for an hour for ten weeks. And then I did the first one and was like, \u2018What did I just commit myself to?\u2019 My whole goal was just to help to offer anything during the pandemic, you know, I\u2019m just doing some dance. It turns out that was basically free advertising and I actually did it for 12 weeks,\u201d Durden said.\n\nNot only did Durden lecture for two weeks longer than expected, but he also unintentionally grew his following from 1200 to 7000 in just 12 weeks. However, the one-way communication design of Instagram live wasn\u2019t fulfilling enough for Durden\u2019s professor heart. \u201cIt was really weird because I\u2019m the one talking and I can see people commenting or whatever, but I\u2019m not in conversation with them. So I was like, you know what I wanna do? A class on Zoom.\u201d\n\nThe Covid-era Zoom classes amassed 300 people weekly from all over the world. The lectures covered topics like jazz, New Orleans second-line dance and even minstrelsy and racism. After the sessions ended, people still begged for more.\n\nDuring Durden\u2019s brief time away from the sessions, he realized that the name Intangible Roots finally belonged to something. He came up with the name 13 years ago but didn\u2019t know what to do with it. \u201cIn doing sessions I was like, \u2018This is one intensely rooted educational platform to teach people about the historical things that they don\u2019t get.\u2019 It was perfect,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Durden is modest about his career and successes, dancers who are aware of his past know him and regard him as an icon. Durden\u2019s efforts in expanding his first-hand information to the masses have always been at the forefront of his work. In 2021, he released a documentary film he directed and produced, \u201cEverything Remains Raw,\u201d which follows the lineage of artists responsible for inventing hip-hop dance. Durden sat down with legends like the inventor of locking, Don Campbell, and interviewed them about their work in the moments when history was made.\n\nFor Durden, it was a way to celebrate his peers. \u201cYeah, those were just my friends and my teachers. I just wanted to archive it,\u201d he said. Durden began filming in 2003 and stopped editing in 2021\u2014but he says he still plans to make more edits. Over the years, Durden struggled to find funding to push the movie further, so the hour-long film is on Youtube for everyone\u2019s viewing pleasure.\n\n\u201cI really kind of messed up twice,\u201d Durden said with his head in his hand. \u201cThe last two times I was with Questlove I should\u2019ve said something but I didn\u2019t.\u201d With Questlove\u2019s help, Durden says he could get music clearances easily and the attention he feels the film deserves. Currently, Questlove is executive producing a new Broadway show about Soul Train, \u201cThe Hippest Trip,\u201d and Durden just joined the team as a consultant.\n\n\u201cNext time I see him I\u2019ll sit him down and make him watch it. The amount of information already in the film doesn\u2019t come close to the amount of information I want to put in the film,\u201d Durden said. \u201cBut I need that support.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Durden continues to share mini-lessons via the Intangle Roots Instagram page and promote this summer\u2019s intensive and certification program. \u201cA lot of these dance classes are just all about movement,\u201d Durden said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no context and we need context to understand why we\u2019re moving the way we are. And that\u2019s what \u2018Roots\u2019 is to me.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Ethan Huang)\n\nBy Ethan Huang May 01, 2023 at 2:55 pm PDT\n\n\u201cAs a student and an aspiring media professional, I believe that the University of Southern California (USC) is the perfect place for me to grow both personally and professionally. USC\u2019s commitment to diversity, innovation, and academic excellence aligns perfectly with my own values and goals.\u201d Reportedly, a college admissions officer can spend only 15 minutes reading an entire application. If the hook is not eye-catching enough, the application is passed over for the next. If you were reading that text, would you take the time to read over that student\u2019s essay? But what if I said that that text was written by a machine \u2013 a high school college applicant who goes by the name ChatGPT?\n\nChatGPT, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI. The algorithm pulls from various sources on the internet such as Wikipedia or Reddit and uses them to provide a plausible \u201cnext word\u201d in a sequence, creating a more or less accurate piece of text responding to the user\u2019s prompt. It has recently gained both popularity and notoriety among students given their use in everything from essays for their classes to even cover letters for job applications. The result is a crackdown by some professors to prevent cheating to the point that popular anti-plagiarism software Turnitin added AI writing and ChatGPT detection into their platform.\n\nOn the other hand, some are open to the rise of this technology, with the International Baccalaureate allowing the use of ChatGPT in student essays. However, within academia, one side of this that has not been addressed extensively is its use in college applications. With today being National Decision Day, hundreds of thousands of high school seniors will be announcing their future colleges across social media. While this round of admissions has passed by, the next cycle is already ramping up, and A.I. may have a role to play in the experience of student applicants.\n\nWhile officers are stated to review students \u201cholistically\u201d, meaning the entire package (resume and all) are taken into consideration, the essay is an invaluable and time-consuming part of these applications. It is also where A.I. could make its mark. After all, if A.I.-generated cover letters and academic papers are on the rise, what is to stop students from using it in their college applications?\n\nThe big question for this issue is how well a chatbot can write a college essay. As conversational as the generations read, it may be more difficult that one may expect to perfectly replicate the human cadence. \u201cA longtime challenge to try to convince a human whether or not something is human in our minds is a classic Turing test in one form or another,\u201d said Jonathan May, a professor of computer science at USC Viterbi. \u201cI\u2019m sure I could be fooled in the right circumstance... if you look at the essay, you spend a few minutes looking at the essay and you don\u2019t really think about what the essay is trying to say, but it contains the right words more or less, and it seems to contain a surface understanding.\u201d\n\nThat said, it does not mean that the product will be appealing to the reviewing schools. According to Daniel Lee, a co-founder of college counseling business Solomon Admissions Consulting, A.I. technology lacks the sense of authenticity that schools expect from these essays. \u201cReally compelling college essays have a very specific tonality, and that tonality is personal to that student, and it\u2019s very hard for a computer program to simulate that,\u201d he said. \u201cStanford University likes essays that are very quirky and show intellectual vitality. ChatGPT isn\u2019t going to know that, and so they would probably write an essay for Stanford, but it\u2019s not going to be what Stanford\u2019s looking for.\u201d\n\nTo A.I. and college experts alike, that is the main caveat of trying to use ChatGPT in these situations: it is simply too boring. \u201cIt tends to be a little boring, it tends to be a little obvious for people who have experience that it\u2019s machine generated. So, I would not recommend it as a way to get in,\u201d said Jonathan Gratch, a professor of computer science and psychology at USC. Mainly, it is because these machines generate an essay based on a resume fed into the program, and do its best to construct something incorporating those components without much consideration to creativity.\n\nAll of this is said without mentioning the ethical issue that arises with its use. The reason why ChatGPT has become such a hot topic in recent months is because of its use to stain academic integrity. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between having to write your essay versus just hiring someone else to write your essay and submitting it as your own. So, I mean, it\u2019s also a plagiarism, honor code issue,\u201d said Lee.\n\nSo far, colleges have not extensively announced plans to respond to this, mainly because they are waiting to see how far it goes, according to Lee. That said, Gratch believes they may use A.I. detection software to catch perpetrators, much like in the classroom. \u201cThere are a number of tools to detect that that has been done in that way,\u201d he said. \u201cJust seeing it can get a sense, okay, this is probably from ChatGPT; a colleague of mine, a professor at UCLA, actually caught a bunch of his students and he used tools to detect they were using it for their essays.\u201d\n\nThat is not to say that it should be completely barred from students, as some actually find it helpful beyond its use as a tool for plagiarism. Jude Hijleh, a senior at Ayala High School in Chino Hills, CA deciding between UCLA and USC, says that she enjoys using ChatGPT casually. \u201cOften my friends and I have actually used it to ask questions about our lives, about educational resources,\u201d she said. \u201cJust yesterday, I asked it to plan a trip, so I use it like a part of my school\u201d\n\nThis extends even into the world of applications, especially essays. According to David Yang, a senior at San Mateo High School in San Mateo, CA committing to UC Berkeley, says that there are better ways to use the platform. \u201cI think that you need more creative uses of it than just writing the essay for you,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously the cute way of grammar checking, but sometimes they could evaluate the cohesiveness of your response.\u201d\n\nBoth May and Gratch express similar sentiments. They both mentioned how for their colleagues and students whose native language is not English, A.I. can actually be useful to ensure that they can express themselves clearly in writing. In the case of May, he says that rather than use ChatGPT for plagiarism, it can be a good starting point, especially with essays. \u201cI find it very fun to play with and I also find it can help me overcome writer\u2019s block and maybe even workshop new ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cLike if I have some new idea for something or I maybe want to try a fictional scene or come up with some explanation of how ChatGPT works or something like that.\u201d\n\nA.I. remains a rapidly evolving topic, so it is difficult to piece together what is the future of this technology in the university space. Yang is interested to see its potential growth. \u201cI think GPT in general is just going to get more and more advanced because now we\u2019re throwing so much money at it, it\u2019s kind of got to get better,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe if like maybe in one or two years we\u2019re going to come back and we\u2019re going to see that GPT models have this newfound ability to not only spit out text that\u2019s good, but maybe solve problems.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it will become just another part of a student\u2019s digital toolkit, but its potential infringement on academic dishonesty is made clear. Hijleh reflects on how she feels on how universities may respond. \u201cI think universities should address it in a way that welcomes this evolving world, but also places limits on students,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously, this isn\u2019t the first time a university has had to deal with a tool that allows students to cheat, but maybe addressing the issue with open arms almost and embracing it rather than just rejecting it because students are going to be attracted to it and use it regardless.\u201d\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, \u201cOverall, the use of A.I. in college admissions has the potential to make the process more efficient, fair, and effective. However, it\u2019s important to ensure that these algorithms are transparent and unbiased, and that they do not reinforce existing inequalities in the education system.\u201d Again, a bit dry and \u201cboring\u201d as experts say, but there is always potential for development, whether it be as a force of dishonesty or inspiration. It remains unclear how much of an effect it will have on college admissions, but only the coming application cycles can tell. In the meantime, students may fare better using the words of a real human as opposed to an artificial one.\n```"}

A senior producer at Therapy for Black Girls (TBG), a groundbreaking company focusing on mental health and wellness for Black women. Through its directory, podcast, and blog, TBG aims to be a resource for Black girls to learn how to care for their mental health.\n\nEllis, a USC graduate, started her journey as a Journalism major in Annenberg and obtained her bachelor\u2019s in the spring of 2020, during the beginning of the pandemic. While some may have let that obstacle deter them from charging after their career goals, Ellis did not. She used the Trojan network to connect with other USC graduates. Eventually, she landed a part-time job working for a non-profit as a content manager. But with a background in podcasting, she learned tools like Audition during her courses at USC. Then, with her networking skills, she landed the job of Senior Producer at the Therapy for Black Girls podcast.\n\nIn its third season, the Therapy for Black Girls podcast is hosted by Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed psychologist who incorporates pop culture into personal development and mental health conversations. Knowing that USC students are gearing up for finals, Ellis curated a list of Therapy for Black Girls podcast episodes she produced that could help students get through the next couple of weeks and beyond. These are her picks:\n\nSession 222: How Horror Films Help Us Process Life\n\u201cI recommend that one because USC is a film school, and I think if you\u2019re into film and especially the horror genre, that\u2019s definitely a really cool one to unpack,\u201d said Ellis.\n\nSession 291: Getting Good with Money\n\u201cCollege is a great time to really start understanding your financial patterns and how to save better. It\u2019s something I wish I did better,\u201d said Ellis.\u201d\n\nSession 277: Cultivating Friends in Adulthood\n\u201cMy friendships went through a lot of ebbs and flows in college, and I wish I was more attuned or more aware that would happen,\u201d said Ellis. \u201cYou always hear that relationships change and friendships change, but very particularly in college. It\u2019s very heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nAnd lastly, for my Black Trojans, Session 272: Navigating Academia as a Black Woman\n\u201cIt\u2019s about navigating academia as a Black woman. It\u2019s more about people who are on a tenure track, but I think it\u2019s really great to listen to as a student because USC is a really prestigious academic institution, and I do think there are a lot of challenges that are unique to Black women in academic spaces.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Therapy for Black Girls, you can visit their website, therapyforblackgirls.com, and their podcast at therapyforblackgirls.com/podcast or on Spotify, Apple Podcast, Google Podcast, and Stitcher.

This year, 6 of the 19 films that will premiere at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival were directed by women \u2014 a historic number \u2014 but still far fewer than the number of films directed by men. To continue this progress and strive for gender equity in filmmaking, we have to celebrate the perspectives and artistic voices of women and their strengths and visions to create powerful films in spite of hostile conditions.\n\nAccording to a 2020 research study from USC\u2019s own Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, an analysis of the 1,300 top-grossing films from 13 years (2007-2019) revealed that only 57 were directed by women. Of these 57, only 11 were women of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.\n\nAlthough consumers can feel powerless to enact change in the industry beyond complaining and demanding more opportunities for women, we can still come to recognize the great films women have been able to make despite the challenges of an inhospitable industry and society. Here are 20 great films by women of different time periods, different races and ethnicities, and each with strong feminist themes that we can learn from.\n\nThe Watermelon Woman (1996) - dir. Cheryl Dunye\nCheryl Dunye made history as the first Black lesbian to make a feature film, writing, directing, editing, and starring in this 1996 rom-com/drama. This landmark film in New Queer Cinema tells the story of a young Black lesbian (played by Dunye herself) who works in a video store in Philadelphia, navigating her personal relationships as she researches and desperately attempts to learn the history of \u201cthe watermelon woman,\u201d an uncredited and unidentifiable Black woman performing the mammy stereotype in 1930s Hollywood. Available to stream on Paramount + and Showtime\n\nSaint Omer (2022) - dir. Alice Diop\nAlice Diop\u2019s first feature film is a perfect antidote to the exploitative nature of true crime. Inspired by her experience as a documentarian attending the 2016 trial of Fabienne Kabou, this French slow-burn legal drama deciphers why a young woman committed infanticide. It\u2019s a poignant meditation on race, immigration, womanhood, motherhood, gender roles, mental illness, class, isolation, childhood trauma, and death. Available to rent from $5.99 on Apple TV, Redbox, and Amazon Prime\n\nWorking Girls (1986) - dir. Lizzie Borden\nLizzie Borden\u2019s indie drama from the 1980s depicts the boredom and mundanity of prostitution rather than sensationalizing it. This depiction of sex work was so groundbreaking because it humanizes the workers and destigmatizes the work they do, challenging the dominant narratives of sex workers as victims, criminals, or accessories. The film\u2019s documentary feel and honest, genuine tone construct a vivid, sad, funny, and all-too-intimate look at the gritty world where women eke out a living catering to the indulgences of disgusting men. Available to stream on HBO Max and the Criterion Channel\n\nA Girl Walks Home Alone At Night (2014) - dir. Ana Lily Amirpour\nAna Lily Amirpour\u2019s moody black and white Iranian vampire horror Western subverts gender roles and expectations of female as prey, or damsel in distress, instead reclaiming the dangerous lonely streets at night with female agency, power, and violence. Available to stream on The Criterion Channel, Tubi, and Pluto TV\n\nThe Trouble With Angels (1966) - dir.

They reduced the guidelines to receive money from 26 pages to four, hoping that would encourage more organizations to apply. \u201cThere was just way too much information that confused people and we believe it disincentivized people from applying,\u201d said Woodworth.\n\nAlong with shortening the guidelines, USG also made them more user-friendly. \u201cWe created a flowchart. We made the process very, very easy to navigate. We think that had a direct impact,\u201d said Woodworth.\n\nThese efforts were successful and consequently resulted in many more RSOs applying this year compared to last. According to Woodworth, while 378 organizations applied for funding, USG could only fund 166.\n\nWoodworth also wanted to prioritize new organizations getting USG funding. \u201cWe wanted the budget to be able to serve the orgs that historically have not gone represented in USG because the USG should not just be serving the same organizations year after year,\u201d said Woodworth.\n\nThis year the undergraduate student government spent 98% of its almost $350,000 budget for RSOs, whereas it only spent 64% of last year\u2019s $371,000. \u201cWe have over a thousand RSOs at USC and we only have over $300,000 to give to RSOs. No way that we can fund everyone. And that\u2019s just the unfortunate truth of the budget,\u201d said Woodworth.\n\nEven though USG spent over a quarter more of their budget this year in relation to last year, many organizations felt they were neglected and didn\u2019t receive funding at the fault of USG. \u201cHistorically, our club has always gotten the full expense paid,\u201d said latin fusion dance group Break On 2\u2019s president Jessica Stacey, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, in a statement to Annenberg Media.\n\nUSG gave some organizations which previously received full or partial funding nothing or very little compared to past years. \u201cUSG funding is never guaranteed. That\u2019s not something to be heavily relied on,\u201d said Ryan Stowe, CFO of USG.\n\nBreak On 2 had its funding cut completely this year, from $5000, the previous spring. They typically hold their showcase in Bovard Auditorium, which requires a $4500 deposit. Three weeks before their deposit was due, USG informed them they would not receive funding. \u201cWe were left scrambling as a result of USG\u2019s lack of communication,\u201d said Stacey.\n\nWoodworth expressed that the increase in funding caused the process to take longer than they would have liked. \u201cWe were processing so many applications that we got backed up, we had to close it for a week in the spring to give us time to catch up,\u201d said Woodworth.\n\nThe manager of Breakthrough Hip-Hop, Sabrina Goldfeder, a senior majoring in sociology, told Annenberg Media USG had funded their showcase for all three semesters she has been manager. This year after turning in their application, USG told the Hip-Hop group they would not receive funding from USG. \u201cWe spoke to a Korean soda company to maybe get funding from them, but that didn\u2019t work out. We\u2019re just trying to find other ways to pay for Bovard without having to lose our money,\u201d said Goldfeder.\n\nBreakthrough Hip-Hop ended up getting half of their Bovard payment from Visions and Voices, a university-wide arts and humanities initiative. For the other half, they had to fundraise and reach out to members\u2019 parents for donations.\n\n\u201cWhat the director or assistant directors do is go over the application to see if it\u2019s fundable and if the timeline works. And then if they tick both those boxes and there\u2019s money left it will be approved,\u201d said Jake Stemmons, the director of social, recreation, and startup funds for USG.\n\nStemmons added that the funding department hoped to use up all the funds this year, as in years past there had been a significant amount of the budget left over. \u201cThe consequence of that is that we ran out of funds earlier,\u201d said Stemmons.\n\nNancy Shao, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering, who is on the executive board for the Associated Students of Biomedical Engineering, (ASBME), planned to apply for about $3000 for members to get CPR certification. In previous years, ASBME had gotten upwards of $4000 for other events. Shao went through the entire application process and then found out the funding application was closed. It closed on March 7, two weeks before the original application deadline. USG did not communicate this change to the RSOs.\n\nWoodworth explained that this was also due to the increase in applications causing a back up. While USG has made the application process more straightforward than in years past, it still requires effort from the organization\u2019s leaders. The RSOs must prepare a PowerPoint presentation detailing the event they are seeking funding for, a detailed spreadsheet of the funding, quotes given from any outside sources USG will be paying and a Google form on top of that.\n\nGrace Zhang, a third year majoring in American studies and ethnicity, who is on the core team of USC Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation (SCALE), applied for funding in the first half of this semester. They hoped to get food catered to an event they were hosting with a guest speaker. \u201cWe did the PowerPoint, we filled out a Google form, and then we got a reply back saying they hit the funding capacity for the spring semester,\u201d said Zhang.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/04/28/latines-in-the-film-industry-deserve-better/", "response": "```\nLatines in the Film Industry Deserve Better\n\nThough Latines have been a part of the film industry since it began, there is still a long road ahead for good representation.\n\nBy Tyler Reese April 28, 2023 at 9:55 pm PDT\n\nWhile making up nearly half of the population of Los Angeles, Latines have gotten the short end of the stick when it comes to landing jobs in Hollywood. USC Annenberg\u2019s Inclusion Initiative finds that Latine characters have only comprised roughly 5% of speaking roles from around one thousand films during a 12-year period, despite the U.S. having a population that is almost 19% Latine. This percentage is not one to be satisfied with. It is a number that doesn\u2019t treat Latine communities with the respect and dignity they have earned.\n\nMany of the roles given still perpetuate the stereotypes Latines have been fighting against since this country came to them, stereotypes that bleed off the screen into other aspects of American life. So why does this number exist? And how do we make it better represent the people of the United States?\n\nThe study, \u201cHispanic and Latino Representation in Film: Erasure On Screen & Behind the Camera Across 1,300 Popular Movies\u201d was co-authored by Ariana Case, along with her colleagues: Zoily Mercado and Karla Hernandez. They first set out in 2019 to analyze the majority of roles that Latines were playing in the modern film industry, motivated to combat the increasing discrimination within the country.\n\n\u201cThe first one, which was released back in 2019, if you remember back to that time, was a time in our country where racist rhetoric and violent hatred towards Latinos was rampant in this country... from the top down, across the media and our political figures,\u201d said Ms. Case.\n\nAccording to her findings, this environment made it easy to further dehumanize Latines, to entrench us in the characters we had been playing since the beginning of the film industry: drug traffickers, illegal immigrants, low-income jobholders, and non-English speakers. The data of the study prove this; 37.2% of Latino characters in film did not speak English, while 40% of the top-billed Latino actors played characters who were violent criminals.\n\nAnd there are still concerns about how feminine Latines are often typecast in the film industry. The study also exposes how actresses like Cameron D\u00edaz and Jennifer Lopez have been given the most lead roles above other Latine actors, which may be influenced by their status as sex symbols. While it\u2019s not to say that they\u2019re being given these roles only because of their erotic image, American culture has a habit of fetishizing \u201cforeign\u201d women and feminine people, framing them as desirable; they are an example of how Hollywood only selects a few handpicked women and ignores the boundless talent that the greater Latine community has to offer.\n\nIf it\u2019s so rare to see a Latine on the silver screen, it\u2019s hard to fight against the misrepresentation. The images of Latines as \u201cthe other\u201d, whether they be dangerous or sexy, become burned into the memories of Americans. Latines have never asked for these labels, but they persist.\n\nThere needs to be an intentional effort to put more Latines, authentic, real Latines, into the film industry. And we cannot settle with putting a Latine actor into a film and call it a day; they can\u2019t be there to check off a diversity requirement for an executive, and we don\u2019t want to put the weight of representing an entire family of cultures under a single person.\n\n\u201cEach film will have around 40 characters or so, just from what we found. There\u2019s a lot of room to grow,\u201d said Ariana Case. \u201cIn 2019, 43% of the films we analyzed had only one Hispanic and Latino actor.\u201d\n\nEven having a second Latine join the cast of a film would be instrumental in combating the stereotypes put upon the community. This is a region that comprises 20 countries and 656 million people, not to mention the countless cultural groups and the Latines who have called the U.S. home for centuries. No one should expect a single Latine to represent that large and diverse of an identity group.\n\nThe community has so much to offer that Hollywood should be struggling to find room for their stories, rather than the other way around.\n\n\u201cIt does start with people behind the scenes who want to tell those stories. By giving people opportunities to have their voice out there, it just inherently will increase representation as well,\u201d Ms. Case said.\n```"}

Although some student organizations received less funding than in years prior, more organizations received funding from USG as a whole.\n\nUSG presidential candidates debated about important campus topics like DPS, the surrounding Los Angeles community and reopening plans. (Photo by Yannick Peterhans).\n\nBy Charlotte Shook, Thomas Johnson, Dominic Varela, and Matthew Dutrisac\nApril 28, 2023 at 3:22 pm PDT\n\nUSG President Hannah Woodworth delivered her final address as president on April 18. Her speech covered many different topics, but it was how USG used much more of its allotted budget this school year that came as a surprise. Woodworth said that the funding department of USG used 98% of its allocated budget over this past school year. The funding department used just 64% of its allocated budget the year prior.\n\nUSG cut the budget of the funding department this school year from $371,000 to $349,000 in the course of a year to ensure that the department would spend all of its money. A bulk of USG\u2019s discretionary budget already went to RSOs, or registered student organizations, but the outgoing Chief Programming Officer Jillian Fallon says that most of the cuts to the funding department was to help RSOs, which fall under the programing department of USG.\n\n\u201cA lot of that came from funding outreach from the chief financial officer creating a more streamlined process for RSOs to get funding,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cI think they changed the funding guidelines from 29 pages to about four pages and really making sure it was easy for groups to understand just how to get funding through USG.\u201d\n\nThe programming department had about a $1.4 million budget allocation this school year, a little over half of the total $2.5 million USG budget. The International Student Assembly (ISA) is one of the RSOs who fall under the programming department, receiving $67,400 this year from USG.\n\n\u201cSome of the assemblies have a much bigger budget than others just cause of the scale of events or the number of students it caters to,\u201d said Piya Garg, the co-executive director for ISA. \u201c[ISA] got the same amount this year as we did last year, and I think part of that is because we didn\u2019t spend all of our money last year.\u201d\n\nISA was one of only six RSOs under USG who received the same amount of money in 2022 and 2023. There were two new RSOs in 2023, and 12 other clubs received different funding from year to year.\n\nAfter RSOs apply for funding, it is up to the USG cabinet to decide the budget. The newly-sworn cabinet for 2024 is already preparing to make next year\u2019s budget. \u201cThat will entail the outcoming directors and incoming directors [of the RSOs] presenting on how they spent their money this previous year and how they expect to spend their money next year,\u201d Fallon said.\n\nOnce those presentations are over, the programming budget goes into the hands of the allocation committee, which consists of the USG president, vice president, the cabinet, all USG chiefs and the speaker of the Senate. \u201cThey will figure out how all of these requests, and balance all of the interests of the administration and each group, to figure out where that money will be allocated to,\u201d Fallon said.\n\nUSG added two new RSOs this year, which makes the process a little more difficult. The Middle Eastern North African Student Assembly (MENASA) and the Joint Assembly for Military-Associated Students (JAMS), the new RSOs, only received $5,000 this year as it was their first year under USG. They are now eligible to request much more funding like other RSOs.\n\nAll of USG\u2019s $2.5 million yearly budget came from a $64 student programming fee, which is a part of tuition. USG put an emphasis on spending as much of that budget as possible because if they did not, they might have lost access to that money.\n\n\u201cIt goes into this rollover fund, which we really don\u2019t have access to unless we have some sort of project that is going to impact students more broadly,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a project of that scale that\u2019s going to benefit all students, we don\u2019t get access to that funding.\u201d\n\nFor this school year, USG was able to use that rollover funding to start the SCUP shuttle, which transported students from campus to the LAX airport during busy travel periods during the school year, like winter or spring break.\n\nFallon emphasized that, since they would practically lose the money if they did not spend it, USG spent its budget the right way this past school year. \u201cUsing this money doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re just throwing away money,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cIt means that we\u2019re utilizing all of the funding that we have properly and reaching an even broader group of students than last year.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The headline and subheadline of this story have been edited to more accurately reflect its content.\n```"}

This was supposed to be a routine trip back to Los Angeles after Easter weekend, a rideshare I had taken several times before. \u201cThe chances of you being in the car with a clinically insane person in Los Angeles are slim,\u201d the driver said. I nervously picked at the skin around my nails. That\u2019s exactly what a teenage girl taking a Lyft alone from LAX doesn\u2019t want to hear.\n\nWas it paranoia or the thick scent of Black Ice car freshener that clouded my ability to think? I locked eyes with the driver in the rearview mirror, his pupils tracing the silk ribbon that lined the white lace shirt I wore that morning. My silence said it all. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be afraid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need gas. You don\u2019t want to stop in the middle of the freeway, do you? I mean, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d He made my skin crawl.\n\nI was at war with myself, questioning the instincts that warned me I was in a dangerous situation. Why did he pick me up when he was low on fuel? Is he allowed to make a stop without my consent? Am I projecting implicit biases onto this man? \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bad men in this world, but I\u2019m not one of them,\u201d he continued. God, I prayed, should I trust the stranger behind the steering wheel?\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not comfortable with that,\u201d I said. \u201cHow many miles do you have left?\u201d But he already ended the route navigation, changing course to a 76 Gas Station. We were en route to a different location, driving down streets I had never seen before. Suddenly, every Trojans Respect Consent module I had ever sat through, every horror movie murder I had ever screamed at, every combat strategy I had ever practiced at my all-girls\u2019 high school resurfaced in my mind. Each recollection presented the same daunting question: Was I prepared to fight for my life?\n\nWhen the driver asked me if I was familiar with the area, I said yes. When he called me Julia Roberts from \u201cPretty Woman,\u201d I laughed so as not to offend him. When he questioned what I studied, I said I was a journalism student who reported on the Los Angeles Police Department. When he said he could feel my fear, I lied: I wasn\u2019t afraid, I told him, but my shaking hands suggested otherwise.\n\nClick. He rolled up the windows and locked me inside his car, closing the door as he disappeared into the gas station market. I was stuck, trapped in a stranger\u2019s vehicle without the key. I wished I had hugged my brother for a second longer before I left that morning. My brain racked for a way out, mentally crossing off names as I shared my location with as many people as I could. I sent descriptions of my driver to my roommates, scanning the area for women and children \u2013 families I could somehow signal to. But it was Easter Sunday, and the streets were empty. I felt powerless.\n\nShould I use my elbow to break through the window? Crawl through the back seat and kick my way out of the trunk? Call 911? Request a new Lyft? Say my prayers now? Then my phone vibrated with a Smart Trip Check-In from Lyft: \u201cJust checking in. It looks like this ride is taking longer than usual. Do you need help?\u201d My fingers hovered over the notification. I don\u2019t know, did I? I was stuck in fear, my breathing suffocated by the seat belt strapped across my chest.\n\nI decided not to call Lyft, because after all, he hadn\u2019t hurt me, hadn\u2019t touched me. What would they do? Nearly 10 minutes later, he emerged from the market and began pumping gas. Before we left, he opened his route navigation and asked if we were headed to where I lived. I said nothing, but he pressed: \u201cFor a young girl I get why you would be scared. But we need to get to your destination, right?\u201d I told him we were going to school, and the wheels began turning.\n\nAfter an hour-long trip from LAX, which should have taken 25 minutes or less, I immediately got out of the car when it came to a stop at the USC Village. Shutting the door behind me, I nervously looked over my shoulder, terrified that the driver might note where I lived. That\u2019s when I broke. Crying alone as I rode the elevator up to my apartment, I imagined a million different outcomes in that instant, caught between what happened and what could\u2019ve happened. Was I nearly abducted, or am I overthinking? There were so many questions that I didn\u2019t have the answers to.\n\nIn the days that followed, I spoke with experts about what to do if faced with a potential threat. Nelson Nio, the founder and owner of SHIELD Women\u2019s Self Defense System \u2013 a self defense program in Marina Del Rey \u2013 said that even when the danger is only a perceived threat, he advises students to always follow their guts. \u201cYour instinct has a way of knowing what your intellect can\u2019t comprehend,\u201d Nio said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the car, and you feel something\u2019s not right, get out right away. Say, \u2018Hold on,\u2019 then open the door and cancel [the ride].\u201d\n\nDavid Carlisle, the assistant chief of the USC Department of Public Safety, reiterated these measures, alongside not walking alone and checking the license plate before entering cars. He added that DPS offers a free rape, aggression and defense training program for students at the beginning of each semester, and he also encouraged students to get the LiveSafe mobile app. This enables them to share their real time location with DPS, anonymously send tips and share images or videos of a driver.\n\nSonia Savur, a junior majoring in quantitative biology, said that these safety measures are a universal code of behavior for women, one instilled by habit and advised to girls time and time again. \u201cWe know that already. But I also think there has to be a lot of unspoken communication,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the drivers are making comments, if we see drinks on the dashboard, there\u2019s eye contact or texting each other in the back row.\u201d\n\nAmanda Perez, a senior communication major, agreed, adding that with the university\u2019s return to \u201cshryft,\u201d or shared Lyft program (where students are paired with random passengers going to the same location on free Lyft rides within a 1.5 mile radius around campus), she\u2019s extra attentive to sharing her trip details with others. Perez said that in some instances, she has considered playing TikTok videos with the hashtag #safetycall, which are clips of male users simulating fake phone calls with passengers. \u201cI\u2019m always like, \u2018Should I pull this video out now, or am I making it a bigger deal than it really is?\u2019 It\u2019s sad that I need the voice of another man to make me seem protected,\u201d Perez said.\n\nBut when faced with danger, sometimes she can\u2019t decipher between fear and instinct. \u201cI like to think I\u2019d know what to do if faced with a potentially dangerous situation, but I don\u2019t think anyone really knows until it happens to you.\u201d She added, \u201cA car ride home shouldn\u2019t be a fight for survival, but it is.\u201d\n\nAnnalisa Enrile, a professor of social work at the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and an anti-sex trafficking advocate, said that while physical vigilance is important, the hardest battle is also on the psychological front. \u201cActions speak louder than words. For instance, it is common for perpetrators to say things like in your example, \u2018I\u2019m not a bad guy.\u2019 But if their actions don\u2019t match it, you should watch out for that,\u201d Enrile said. She added that common intimidation tactics among perpetrators include \u201cusing condescending language\u201d and \u201cassertion of their agenda versus what you are comfortable with or what has been agreed to.\u201d\n\nCarlisle said that since the university\u2019s partnership with Lyft in 2016, only a handful of safety incidents have been reported to DPS from students: \u201cI believe when I researched this a few months ago, out of those millions of rides, I can only recall maybe four problems caused by a Lyft driver. So I guess you could do the math to talk about the number of complaints we\u2019ve received for misconduct by a driver.\u201d\n\nAccording to Michelle Garcia, the senior associate director of USC Transportation and head of the school\u2019s Lyft partnership, the university meets every two weeks with representatives from Lyft. She said to utilize the reporting feature embedded in the Lyft app should something occur on the road. The reports are anonymously sent to drivers after being reviewed by 24/7 response lines, who ensure that riders and reported drivers don\u2019t get paired again.\n\nFor my report, I chatted with a team member about being taken off route and made to feel unsafe, and a $5 Lyft credit was my compensation. Lyft press did not respond to requests for comment on the process of determining the compensation for reported rides, nor to questions about whether or not passengers have access to driver behavior reports.\n\nAccording to 2021 community safety reports, which were published following a 2018 CNN investigation into sexual assault incidents in rideshares, Uber and Lyft found that there were over 10,000 reports of sexual assault on rides over a three year period. Lyft recorded 4,158 incidents of sexual assault, while Uber acknowledged a total of 5,981 reports from 2017-2018 and an additional 3,824 incidents from 2019-2020. Lyft and Uber press did not respond to questions from Annenberg Media as to why community safety reports haven\u2019t been published since their initial studies in 2021.\n\nUltimately, the rideshare business is integral to campus culture at USC. Garcia confirmed that each school year, USC averages nearly 1 million rides using the shryft and fryft models. This semester alone, the university sits at about 30,000 requested shryfts a week. With that many students taking Lyfts, Perez said it\u2019s easy for students to become desensitized to the reality of rideshares: \u201cWe use Lyfts so often that people forget you\u2019re literally in a car with a stranger.\u201d\n\nAs I sat with my emotions following my Lyft scare, wiping tears from my face under the string lights of my living room, a voice in my head told me that I was being dramatic, and that I should\u2019ve been smarter than to stay in the car. But the outside voices, from family and friends texting to check in on me, to experts like Enrile showing me empathy, told me that I wasn\u2019t. \u201cIt is a good thing to be vigilant and not have a false sense of security, but women should not confuse that with thinking it was their fault if violence happens,\u201d Enrile said. \u201cIt is not our job to predict the violent behavior of someone else.\u201d\n\nI want to acknowledge that I\u2019m now hyper aware whenever I enter a rideshare. But when I unbuckle my seatbelt, and the strap comes off my chest, I also want to release the fear that kept me in the car that day. I\u2019m just trying to get home.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/04/28/photos-yaeji-transcends-all-at-the-novo/", "response": "```\nKorean-American musician Yaeji performed in LA last Thursday on her \u201cWith a Hammer Tour.\u201d \n\nYaeji begins her performance with \u201cFor Granted,\u201d the first track released from \u201cWith A Hammer.\u201d She sets the tone for the night with an upbeat energy coupled with mellow vocals, dancing among flashing pink and purple lights as the spunky beats of the track play.\n\nSince quitting her graphic design job in 2017 to become a full-time musician, DJ and producer Yaeji has never looked back on creating her signature fluid, introspective tracks. Having moved frequently between New York City, Seoul and Atlanta as a young girl, she touches on themes of temporality and disconnection in her music, blending Korean and English to instill the same feelings of self-exploration in listeners beyond the blurred, rhythmic sound of her songs. She initially gained traction with upbeat house songs and continues to explore electronic styles such as the dance music consistent in her first album \u201cWith a Hammer,\u201d released earlier this month.\n\nYaeji began her tour of the same name the day before \u201cWith a Hammer\u201d dropped. Her concert in Los Angeles was highly anticipated, as her original tour list indicated both weekends of Coachella as her only Southern California stops. When Yaeji announced her additional show at The Novo, fans knew they were in for a night of good vibes and letting it all out on the dance floor.\n\nA backup dancer wheels Yaeji out onto the stage. The singer commanded the venue with a relaxed confidence, and her performance incorporated strong choreography that accentuated the climaxes and plateaus of her songs.\n\nYaeji and her backup dancers perform \u201cWaking Up Down\u201d from her 2020 mixtape WHAT WE DREW \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uadf8\ub824\uc654\ub358. The atmospheric beats of the song were intensified in the live version, and the performers\u2019 fluid movements amplified the ephemeral mood of the track. In the past, Yaeji used Korean to conceal the meaning of her lyrics, but in her recent releases, she emphasizes the textures of the language and cultural solidarity.\n\nYaeji continues her set with \u201cFever,\u201d also from \u201cWith A Hammer.\u201d In an interview with the music publication Pitchfork, she described the process of creating the album as being fueled by fury as she began to unpack repressed childhood memories in the midst of ongoing racism towards Asian Americans at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The album contains themes of resistance against the societal norms that limit Asian Americans and features Yaeji\u2019s most bold, introspective work yet.\n\nYaeji twirls on stage. The concert featured dazzling visual displays and fast-paced flashes of light that appeared to slow down her movements, potentially harkening to her early days being immersed in the New York DJ scene. She mentions going to shows nightly and taking in all details of the experiences, from the lighting design to the structure of the DJ sets themselves.\n\nYaeji smiles as she performs. Her introduction to music came during childhood, when she discovered it on online communities. Later, she studied conceptual art and painting at Carnegie Mellon University and learned to DJ during her time as an undergraduate. It is clear that Yaeji brings an interdisciplinary eye to her creative direction beyond music and dance, including producing animations for her visualizers.\n\nYaeji ends her performance with \u201cRaingurl\u201d and \u201cDrink I\u2019m Sipping On,\u201d two songs that propelled her to recognition at the beginning of her career. The crowd cheered upon hearing \u201cRaingurl\u2019s\u201d characteristic warped introduction and swayed as Yaeji and her dancers finished the set.\n\nBefore Yaeji left the stage, she thanked the L.A. crowd for re-energizing her as she continues her longest tour yet. She mentioned that L.A. had some of the best energy of the cities she has performed in and made a heart with her arms as she said goodbye to fans. Yaeji exited to the continuous cheers of the audience, marking the end of a moving and healing night of music.\n```"}

It is rich in history but you don\u2019t have to be to experience its beauty. This is the ultimate guide of free activities you can do to get fully immersed in Los Angeles culture without breaking the bank.\n\nMuseums\nIf you are a museum buff, there are several famous museums in L.A. with no entry fee. The Getty Center encompasses a vast collection of European art as well as an outdoor modern art collection that is scattered throughout the garden of the museum. You can also get a glimpse of one of the clearest views of the Pacific Ocean here. On the second Tuesday of every month, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is free to all visitors who want to witness the largest art museum in the Western U.S., presenting over 150,000 works. Additionally, the famous urban lights at LACMA are a staple for photos that are always free to interact with. While the Hollywood Forever Cemetery is not explicitly a museum of art, it is a museum of some of the most intricate and bold mausoleums and headstones in the history of Hollywood. Placed in the heart of L.A., this cemetery houses Golden Age legends such as Judy Garland, Dee Dee and Johnny Ramone, Douglas Fairbanks and countless others.\n\nHikes\nWith Southern California having such a vast and diverse landscape, there are a multitude of hikes mapping out the city of L.A. Runyon Canyon is 160 acres of land in the Santa Monica Mountains. The hike offers levels of intensity that compliments all hikers with level one being a casual incline trail, level two utilizing built in stairs on an incline, and level three aka \u201cthe goon\u201d being a bit more vigorous and steep. All of which have a stellar view waiting to greet you at the top. What is a more exemplary symbol of L.A than the Hollywood sign? You can see it up close and personal if you take on the trek of the Mt. Hollywood Trail. The entirety of the hike is about four miles round trip and is accommodating to avid hikers, beginners and children. For added value on a hike, if you take the Escondido Falls hiking trail in Malibu, you will come across multiple waterfalls. The four-mile trail starts on a flat path that travels through pastures of flowers and mini creeks. There is a bit of incline but overall a moderate hike that has an upper and lower level waterfall for a break.\n\nOutdoor Strips\nThere are no outdoor strips like the ones that live in L.A. These streets have made appearances in Blockbuster movies for centuries and have been walked by the greats of L.A. Not to mention the shopping opportunities they provide. Abbot Kinney Boulevard is the hidden gem of Venice. It is a mile long strip lined with small business, name brand shops, cafes and mini art galleries. If you resonate with a beachy bohemian vibe, this is the place for you to grab a coffee and browse. Live music is typical for the ambiance to be complete. A trip to L.A. would not be complete without a visit to Hollywood Boulevard. This street is most notable for its Hollywood Walk of Fame, more than 2,700 stars embedded in the sidewalk honoring Hollywood entertainers and personalities. If you are to lift your head from the stars, you may also see the TCL Chinese Theatre which is the home of many movie premiers and the largest IMAX theater in the world. In the concrete leading up to the theater is an array of cemented hand and footprints dating back to the 1920\u2032s including Shirley Temple, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jackson and Tim Burton. If you thoroughly enjoy thrift shopping, Melrose is a must visit. The district is painted in colors as murals and graffiti art can be seen on just about every other building on the street, great for a photo op. Without spending a dime, the famous thrift stores such as American Superior Vintage, Wasteland and Jet Rag are fun to browse and see the recycled L.A. fashion. Take a trip to the 90210 and stroll down Rodeo Drive to see what is known to be one of the most expensive streets in the world. It is absolutely not necessary to buy anything on this street to feel like a million bucks. Architecturally, this street has elegant historical buildings, all different from each other, displaying designer brands such as Gucci, Versace and Cartier.\n\nL.A. Landmarks\nThe essence of L.A. can be felt just by driving or walking through a landmark destination. You can depend on these next few suggestions to be on a L.A. postcard as the city would not be the same without them. The Griffith Observatory located on the slope of a mountain in Griffith Park offers the opportunity for you to see a view of the whole city below and above, in the stars. It is completely free to go around the observatory as well as enter it. Aside from being an aesthetically pleasing building, you can look through telescopes, enjoy the exhibits, and experience its live planetarium shows. One of the most famous piers to exist is the Santa Monica Pier. The pier was created in 1909 making it the first concrete pier on the West Coast. You can take a long walk down the pier with the ability to take in a view of the Pacific Coast Highway one way and Catalina Island the other way. To add the cherry on top, Pacific Park resides on the pier offering various rides and amusement park fun in the middle of the ocean. If you are looking for a nostalgic drive to enjoy with some music playing in the car, head down the Sunset Strip. Located in West Hollywood, the 1.6 mile stretch is home to the biggest movie and television billboards constellate the buildings, anything on a billboard on Sunset is a big deal. This strip\u2019s history truly lies in the famous rock and nightclubs that were the rage of the 80s and 90s such as the Viper Room, Whiskey a Go Go and the Rainbow Bar and Grill.\n\nThere is so much more to be seen in the city of L.A., but this financial friendly guide can give you a head start on your California adventure rich in history and memories, not in money.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/04/28/analysis-of-every-pick-from-day-1-of-the-nfl-draft/", "response": "```\nAnalysis of every pick from Day 1 of the NFL Draft\n\nThe first round offered fans draft-day trades, surprises and fireable offenses by multiple GMs.\n\nIllinois cornerback Devon Witherspoon was a surprise selection when he was taken by the Seattle Seahawks at pick No. 5. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson April 28, 2023 at 11:29 am PDT\n\nCommissioner Roger Goodell has now read the first 31 names of the 2023 NFL Draft. There were some surprises and questionable decisions by GMs around the league. Here\u2019s a recap of the first round of the draft and a look at which teams made the right call.\n\n1. Carolina Panthers select QB Bryce Young\n\nThis was the right pick for the Panthers. After bringing in head coach Frank Reich, G Bradley Bozeman, WR Adam Thielen and WR DJ Chark, the Panthers are a lot closer to playoff contention than people might expect. They finished last season 7-10 with middling quarterback play and they needed to draft an NFL-ready signal caller in this draft. People will knock him for his size, but Bryce Young is a proven winner. The one-time USC commit threw for 79 touchdowns in two seasons as the starter at Alabama, winning a Heisman Trophy in the process. The Panthers have the O-line to protect Young and Young has the proven talent to win a weak NFC South as early as this year.\n\n2. Houston Texans select QB C.J. Stroud\n\nAnother selection, another smart choice for the Texans. Stroud is a two-time Heisman finalist and threw for 85 touchdowns in two years as the starter at Ohio State. Standing at 6 foot 3, Stroud has the size that Young does not. The only knock on Stroud is his lack of strong play in big moments. Two of Stroud\u2019s biggest games in his college career came against rival Michigan. In his career as a starter, Stroud had better than a 7:1 touchdown to interception ratio. In those two games against Michigan, which were both losses, that ratio dropped to 2:1. To Stroud\u2019s credit, two of his best games came in a 48-45 Rose Bowl victory over Utah in 2022 and a 42-41 loss in the CFP to eventual-champion Georgia this past season. Other than those worries, Stroud will be a great NFL quarterback. The only reason I question this pick is because the Texans are not ready to win like the Panthers. The Texans are coming off a 3-13-1 season and their team has more problems than just the quarterback position. With the Jaguars and Titans expected to contend for the AFC South, the Texans may finish in the cellar again. They could have focused on the defense and waited a year to pick Caleb Williams, the projected No. 1 overall pick in next year\u2019s draft.\n\n3. Houston Texans select OLB Will Anderson Jr.\n\nWith that being said, the Texans did fill a need with Will Anderson Jr. But in doing so, they had to trade the No. 12 and No. 33 overall picks in this year\u2019s draft, along with a first and third rounder in next year\u2019s draft. While I certainly expect Stroud and Anderson, who finished his college career with 34.5 sacks, to significantly improve this Texans team, I still think they will finish in the bottom half of the NFL this year. Next year\u2019s first round pick is almost a lock to be in the top 20 picks, with a solid chance to be in the top 10. The Texans could have drafted Anderson at second overall, kept the No. 12 pick and then drafted Williams next year. The Texans are clearly very high on these two players, but I\u2019m not sure their decision making will look good down the line.\n\n4. Indianapolis Colts select QB Anthony Richardson\n\nAnyone who has talked to me about the draft knows I am very low on Richardson. He was only the starter at Florida for one season, going 6-7 with 17 touchdowns and a whopping 9 interceptions. The NFL combine showed how freakishly athletic he was and people are building him up to be the next Cam Newton. But those same people forget Newton won a Heisman Trophy in college. Richardson is a project and if any team were to take him, the Colts were the right team. Coming off a 4-12-1 season, Indianapolis is likely in rebuild mode for the next couple of years. Richardson has a lot to work on, but he has the highest ceiling of any quarterback in this draft, coupled with the lowest floor.\n\n5. Seattle Seahawks select CB Devon Witherspoon\n\nAs a Seahawks fan myself, I was shocked at this pick. I thought Seattle was either going defensive line or quarterback, but they decided to go with Witherspoon to pair him up with Tariq Woolen, a 2022 NFL Rookie of the Year finalist. Head coach Pete Carroll loves speedy corners like Witherspoon, so he should fit in well on the Seahawk defense. This is likely a reach as the Seahawks have bigger holes in the front seven than they do in the secondary, but ESPN had Witherspoon as the top rated cornerback and the Seahawks avoided the mistake of drafting Will Levis with this pick. Overall, this was a solid pick.\n\n6. Arizona Cardinals select OT Paris Johnson Jr.\n\nThe Cardinals dropped out of the top 10 with their trade with the Texans, but then traded up with the Detroit Lions to select Paris Johnson Jr. Cardinals quarterbacks were sacked 46 times last season, which was bottom 10 in the league, so this fills a large hole for the Cardinals. It was smart for Arizona to trade back into the top 10 as two other offensive tackles were taken before pick No. 12, where the Cardinals would have drafted if not for making the trade. ESPN rated the tackle from Ohio State as the second best offensive tackle in the draft, so this is likely a reach. The Cardinals could have afforded to let the Lions pick here and trade back into the top 10 with a different team.\n\n7. Las Vegas Raiders select EDGE Tyree Wilson\n\nThe Raiders only had 27 sacks last season, third worst in the league. In comes Wilson, who had seven sacks in each of the last two seasons at Texas Tech. Wilson now pairs with Maxx Crosby for a formidable pass rush duo. There are many other holes on the Raiders roster, but ESPN rated Wilson as the No. 4 overall prospect and he was by far the best available on the board at the time. This is arguably the best value pick of the first round.\n\n8. Atlanta Falcons select RB Bijan Robinson\n\nThis pick baffles me. Robinson is going to be a great running back in the NFL. But the Falcons already have Tyler Allgeier, who rushed for 1,035 yards last season as a rookie. Robinson is certainly an upgrade over Allgeier, but there were many other prospects on the board who could have filled bigger needs for the Falcons. Atlanta now boasts Kyle Pitts, Drake London and Robinson on offense, but they really could have used the player whom the Eagles selected with the next pick.\n\n9. Philadelphia Eagles select DT Jalen Carter\n\nCarter is a great player who will pair well with former Georgia teammate Jordan Davis on the defensive line. There were not many holes on a team who went to the Super Bowl just this past season, but Brandon Graham is 35 and Fletcher Cox is 32. Those two are not done playing yet, but there needs to be some younger impact players for the Eagles as they look to make it back to and win the Super Bowl. He only had three sacks last season, but forced two fumbles on a team that won the national championship.\n\n10. Chicago Bears select OT Darnell Wright\n\nThis one was a head scratcher. Wright was projected to be in the top 20, but was rated as the No. 4 offensive tackle in this class. With only one offensive tackle taken prior, it begs the question what the Bears saw in him that others didn\u2019t.\n\n11. Tennessee Titans select OT Peter Skoronski\n\nSkoronski is who the Bears should have selected with their pick. He was rated as the No. 1 offensive tackle but might become a guard in the NFL, which may have dissuaded the Bears from taking him. Skoronski was one of few bright spots on a bad Northwestern team last year and will run-block well for Derrick Henry.\n\n12. Detroit Lions select RB Jahmyr Gibbs\n\nMaybe it\u2019s my aversion to drafting running backs with top-20 picks, but this was another head scratcher. The Lions still have D\u2019Andre Swift and signed David Montgomery this offseason. Similarly to Robinson, Gibbs will be a great player in the NFL. I just don\u2019t understand what the Lions were doing here with holes on the defensive line. The Lions will likely compete for a Wild Card spot, maybe even the division with the Vikings, but they needed to have a home-run draft to truly be in the running. This was not a great start.\n\n13. Green Bay Packers select DE Lukas Van Ness\n\nVan Ness recorded 13.5 sacks across the past two seasons for a very good Iowa defense. But if Jordan Love is going to start at quarterback for the Packers, he is going to need some help. The Packers still have Rashan Gary and Preston Smith to rush the passer, so this was not truly a need for Green Bay. It\u2019s especially so because Van Ness only earned Second-Team All-Big Ten honors this past season.\n\n14. Pittsburgh Steelers select OT Broderick Jones\n\nThis was a great pick as Jones will help protect second-year quarterback Kenny Pickett this upcoming season. Jones won two national championships with Georgia and will look to get Pittsburgh back to the playoffs. Pickett was sacked 27 times last year and got injured in the process. The Steelers were the only team to draft a quarterback in the first round of last year\u2019s draft and will look to keep their investment healthy this year.\n\n15. New York Jets select OLB Will McDonald IV\n\nThe Jets have their quarterback in Aaron Rodgers and turned to the defense with their first pick in the draft. This is likely a reach with Nolan Smith still on the board, but McDonald had 33 sacks across four seasons. He is on the older side, as he\u2019ll be 24 in the fall, but this was a good pick by the Jets as they look to compete for a playoff spot.\n\n16. Washington Commanders select CB Emmanuel Forbes\n\nForbes weighed in at 166 pounds at the NFL Combine. If you think that\u2019s low for an NFL player, that\u2019s because it is. For comparison, Denis Lynch, a kicker for the USC football team, stands at 5 foot 8 and is listed at 185 pounds. Forbes will need to put on some weight if he wants to produce at the NFL level but ran a blazing 4.35-second 40-yard dash. That was tied for fifth fastest at the combine and was tied for the third fastest cornerback time. It was an interesting choice to draft Forbes over Christian Gonzalez, who went to the Patriots with the next pick.\n\n17. New York Patriots select CB Christian Gonzalez\n\nESPN had Gonzalez as the No. 8 prospect in the entire draft, but he fell to the Patriots at pick No. 17. I have nothing more to say other than this was a good pickup by the Patriots, who were able to pick up a player who slipped down draft boards.\n\n18. Detroit Lions select ILB Jack Campbell\n\nAnother blunder by the Lions. Campbell was rated as the No. 58 prospect, but the Lions selected him at 18. If they were going to massively reach for a player, they should\u2019ve reached for a player on the defensive line. James Houston was great for the Lions last year and Malcolm Rodriguez is still young, so while middle linebacker was a need, having someone to go opposite Aidan Hutchinson was more important. Let\u2019s see if the Lions can recover in rounds 2-7.\n\n19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers select DT Calijah Kancey\n\nUnless Baker Mayfield has an incredible career resurgence, which is still possible, the Buccaneers might be in the thick of the Caleb Williams sweepstakes. I only mention this because this is not a pick that will turn the Tampa Bay franchise around this upcoming year. Kancey had the fastest 40-yard dash of any defensive tackle at the combine and has great pass-rusher abilities, recording 7.5 sacks as a defensive tackle last year. He will pair well with Vita Vea and will be a good player, but it will likely be up to Mayfield to help Tampa Bay have a good season.\n\n20. Seattle Seahawks select WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba\n\nThe fact the Seahawks selected Smith-Njigba here likely means one of DK Metcalf or Tyler Lockett is on their way out. The Ohio State product will be a great weapon for Geno Smith and Pete Carroll over the next couple years.\n\n21. Los Angeles Chargers select WR Quentin Johnston\n\nThat was only the start of the wide receiver run though. Johnston was only one win away from a national championship with TCU this past year and will look to help the Chargers get to the playoffs. Los Angeles already has Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, but that will likely put a third-choice coverage guy onto Johnston. This will bode well for the 6 foot 3 wideout.\n\n22. Baltimore Ravens select WR Zay Flowers\n\nGosh, another wide receiver? Lamar Jackson just inked a new contract with the Ravens but likely requested the team get him more receiver help. Odell Beckham Jr. is not enough to fulfill Jackson\u2019s wishes, so picking up Flowers was a smart move. He had over 1,000 receiving yards for Boston College last year.\n\n23. Minnesota Vikings select WR Jordan Addison\n\nFour in a row. Wow. USC fans already know about Addison. The former Biletnikoff Award winner will likely replace the role of Adam Thielen for the Vikings, as Thielen is now with the Panthers.\n\n24. New York Giants select CB Deonte Banks\n\nBanks will play opposite former Trojan Adoree\u2019 Jackson as the Giants try to improve on their divisional round appearance. The former Maryland Terrapin fills a need for the Giants. There were a lot of question marks about the cornerback position behind Jackson, so Banks will compete for a starting position immediately.\n\n25. Buffalo Bills select TE Dalton Kincaid\n\nKincaid is the third player in a row with a USC connection. Trojan fans will remember Kincaid\u2019s 234-yard performance against USC en route to a 43-42 Utah win. Kincaid is the first tight end off the board in this draft and joins Josh Allen and a potent Buffalo offense.\n\n26. Dallas Cowboys select DT Mazi Smith\n\nMight as well add in another USC connection here. Smith went to Michigan and was coached by current USC defensive line coach Shaun Nua. Smith is primarily a run-stuffer but will also pull attention away from Micah Parsons so Parsons can do some damage in the backfield.\n\n27. Jacksonville Jaguars select OT Anton Harrison\n\nThe string of solid picks ends there. It\u2019s like the Jaguars want to be mediocre. According to ESPN, Harrison is the seventh best offensive tackle in this class, yet he was the fifth taken off the board. There is not much difference between offensive tackles 5-8, but Harrison was rated as the 55th overall prospect. It fills a need for the Jaguars as Cam Robinson was just hit with a PED suspension. Since reports of the suspension were handed down on draft day, the Jaguars may have been rushed to find this pick.\n\n28. Cincinnati Bengals select DE Myles Murphy\n\nThere are no HUGE needs for the Bengals, which allows them to add Murphy to a position that was already a strength. Murphy will likely sit behind Trey Hendrickson and Sum Hubbard this year.\n\n29. New Orleans Saints select DT Bryan Bresee\n\nBresee dealt with injuries in his time at Clemson, but if he stays healthy in New Orleans, he can have a big impact on the defensive line.\n\n30. Philadelphia Eagles select OLB Nolan Smith\n\nThe Philadelphia Bulldogs \u2014 excuse me \u2014 the Philadelphia Eagles seem to want every single player from the University of Georgia. They have now drafted Jordan Davis, Nakobe Dean, Jalen Carter and Nolan Smith in the last two drafts from Georgia. If Smith had declared for the draft a year earlier, he likely would have been drafted even higher than pick 30, but he had a season-ending injury this past season. He will likely become an impact player at the next level.\n\n31. Kansas City Chiefs select DE Felix Anudike-Uzomah\n\nWhat a cool name to finish this off. The Chiefs lost Frank Clark this offseason, so Anudike-Uzomah will have a hand in replacing Clark\u2019s production for the defending Super Bowl champs.\n```"}

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)\n\nBy Prachi Singh April 28, 2023 at 11:13 am PDT\n\nKevin Feige, USC alum and the mastermind behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe, will deliver the keynote address at USC\u2019s 140th commencement ceremony. Feige, who graduated from USC School of Cinematic Arts in 1995 is the President of Marvel Studios that has produced some of the highest grossing movies, with \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d and \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d collecting over $2 billion each. With graduation right around the corner, Feige talked about his relationship with USC, SCA and his hopes with the university for the future. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nUSC Media Relations: Do you want to talk a little bit about what it was like for you to go to USC? And did you have any experiences that you want to highlight or moments?\n\nFeige: USC for me was like Star Wars, Back to the Future and Robert Zemeckis. And it was this dream to attain. I was a big nerd. And one of my strongest memories of this might have been the very first convention I ever went to, somebody was wearing a USC hat, which is a long winded way of talking about how enthusiastic I was about the school itself and the legend it was when it came to people\u2019s careers in filmmaking. I grew up in New Jersey, so we came all across the country and we went to the grocery store and got a few supplies. And then they dropped me off and drove away. And now I was on the other side of the country by myself. I had not yet been accepted to the film school and I used to longingly walk past the film school on my way around the campus and the George Lucas building at the time, hoping to one day get in. And eventually, after many attempts, I finally did get into the film school and that was the next step in sort of dreams coming true.\n\nDaily Trojan: If you could tell us more about the connections you\u2019ve made with students over the years.\n\nFeige: USC alumni group was made up of people that I admired and were the reasons I wanted to go to USC. Many of whom I now serve with on the USC School Cinematic Arts Board. And I still can\u2019t quite get over being either in the room or on zooms with these icons, who were the reason I wanted to go to USC in the first place. It\u2019s that shared experience of going to this place because you have a dream of going into a career in film. And there\u2019s no better place than \u2018SC to set you up for that, both when you\u2019re going there and after you\u2019ve left.\n\nAnnenberg Media: If you could talk about what it means to you to be speaking as the keynote speaker at the commencement at USC.\n\nFeige: It is an honor. I mean, I want to be self-deprecating and funny about it and say there must have been some mistake or somebody else wasn\u2019t available at the last minute. But they actually asked me a long time ago, so maybe it wasn\u2019t last minute. It is amazing. And it does make me think of my early days walking around that campus and right there between Boulevard and the library. I did have dreams of making movies. And I never had dreams or expectations of, you know, wearing an honorary doctorate outfit and speaking to however many people are going to be there. That is above and beyond anything I dreamed of when I first stepped through those gates. And now I just don\u2019t want to embarrass anybody or myself. I just want to be honest and straightforward. And my USC journey has been nothing but optimism and potential. And I want to be able to impart that to everybody.\n\nAM: During your speech, what is something that you want to particularly highlight or emphasize to the students?\n\nFeige: Dream big, which is generic but true. And the notion that if I could do it, anybody listening to that speech could do. I did not have a lot of contacts in the business. I didn\u2019t have a parent that ran a film studio. If you do, you can also do good work. But I didn\u2019t have any of that stuff. I was a kid from New Jersey who luckily got into the school and PA\u2019ed on student films and then worked on my own student films with my friends and then was an intern, a receptionist, a production assistant, an associate producer and really climbed the ladder and I\u2019m proud of every rung. I enjoyed every step along that climb up the ladder, because at every part of it I was participating in the industry I had always dreamed of being a part of.\n\nDT: What are your memories from your commencement ceremony and what was your experience like? And then any kind of impact on the way that you\u2019ll be approaching the keynote speech?\n\nFeige: This will be my first attendance at the giant graduation ceremony at USC. I did not attend the giant ceremony on the campus there. My parents, now, nearly 30 years after over 30 years since I graduated, are very excited to attend the commencement address with me so they can actually see me in a graduate outfit at USC for the first time.\n\nAM: If you were to look back and choose one thing from USC that you feel has had maybe a profound impact on the work you do now. What would that be?\n\nFeige: I was a production major undergrad at the film school. But I took a lot of critical studies courses. We watched a lot of movies and analyzed them and studied them and discussed them and the various ways to use the medium to tell stories or to evoke an emotion out of an audience. Those ended up being much more helpful as my career progressed. One of the reasons I try to make a point of bringing as many of our films as I can back on the week of opening and do a Q&A with students is that it really was insightful for me even before I had been accepted to the film school.\n\nMedia Relations: Your story lines at Marvel are full of heroes. Is there a hero in your past or that even still exists that really drove you into filmmaking? And focusing on these hero stories.\n\nFeige: I wasn\u2019t particularly a good student early on in my school career. I decided I wanted to go to USC and a very smart teacher said, \u201cWell, you know how you get into USC?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know... you apply, you send a letter, something.\u201d They go, \u201cYes, and they look at your grades.\u201d And then I buckled down and started getting good grades solely so I could get into USC. But she was one of the first teachers that I found quite inspiring who took an interest in my interest in being behind the camera. And she was very good at inspiring me and saying that that\u2019s something that one could actually do so she was a hero to me.\n\nAM: What are your hopes from USC and SCA for the future?\n\nFeige: Every time I come back to the USC film school campus, I can\u2019t believe how beautiful it is and nicer than many actual movie lots. I hope we continue to grow like that and continue to bring as many different types of kids from around the world as possible because we need the storytelling and we need those storytellers from everywhere. And I think USC is the best place that they can come and train and learn how to tell stories. I talked with Dean Daley about this a lot. Yes, it\u2019s about everybody imparting information to them. What I\u2019m particularly interested in is them getting that information and reinterpreting it and teaching us things. Lots of new technologies that we want new eyes and new minds to teach us how to utilize. And to me, the more people that go through those gates at \u2018SC and at the cinematic arts school in particular, the better. So they can come into our business and keep it as cutting edge as it is today.\n```"}

COP27 climate summit as a college student \u2013 Exposing the reality for youth activists stuck in the \u2018Green Zone\u2019\n\nThe 27th iteration of the United Nations Climate Conference took place in November 2022. (Photo by Michael Pincus)\n\nBy Michael Pincus April 28, 2023 at 9:14 am PDT\n\nI\u2019ll keep it a buck with you: the United Nations Climate Change Conference is not about Gen Z. One might think the leading global climate summit, known as the Conference of Parties, or colloquially as COP, would be all about the youth who are slated to most intimately deal with the consequences of the climate crisis. But it\u2019s not. I know because I was there.\n\nIn November 2022, I traveled to Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to attend the 27th iteration of the U.N. Climate Change Conference. I was part of a delegation of college-aged Jewish youth: half American and half Israeli. Our mission was to represent Jewish youth and young adults on the global climate stage. After all, Jewish people have a rich agricultural tradition, and Jewish religious law forbids the arbitrary destruction of natural resources. Plus, the theological concept of tikkun olam, Hebrew for \u201crepairing of the world,\u201d is often associated with environmental justice.\n\nIt\u2019s been about five months since COP27, and COP28 will begin in about seven months. Groups are beginning to plan their trips to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where the 28th conference will be hosted. Especially now, during Earth Month, institutions are reminded to mobilize for the climate, and COP28 conveniently promises both a University Task Force and an International Youth Climate Delegate Program. The students in these college-aged cohorts will prepare to learn, advocate, vocalize their perspectives and maximize their climate impacts. I did the same.\n\nAttending the U.N. climate talks would be the ultimate opportunity for me to make a difference. But as I approached the conference\u2019s \u2018Green Zone\u2019 in the Sinai desert last November, I quickly learned that these ambitions were the result of a mirage.\n\nTo explain my disillusionment, I first need to clarify what type of delegate I was at COP27. The problem with the Green Zone\n\nAll the action at COP happens in the Blue Zone: U.N.-managed space where the international climate negotiations take place. And only the attendees credited by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat can enter it. There was a (rather tokenizing) Children and Youth Pavillion in the Blue Zone, only available to the select youth who had managed to get their hands on Blue Zone badges. My peers and I had not made the cut as we were not affiliated with an accredited government official or a specific accredited organization. We only had access to the Green Zone, the public area managed by the Egyptian Government.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State website said the Green Zone would be \u201ca walking distance from the Blue Zone,\u201d but in my experience, this was not true. When I said goodbye to the prospect of entering the Blue Zone, I had to take a fifteen-minute bus ride to the Green Zone.\n\nThe atmosphere at the Green Zone was entirely different. It looked like Coachella. There\u2019s no other way to put it. Large art installations decorated the Green Zone at the 27th U.N. Climate Change Conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. (Photo by Michael Pincus)\n\nConsidering the cost of my flight from California to the Middle East, I had dropped around the same amount of money on the Green Zone as I could have spent to attend the Indio festival. Except there was no Bad Bunny in Sharm El-Sheikh. Massive art installations towered beside temporary structures in a desert oasis and the Green Zone boasted immersive activities, food vendors and a Coca-Cola sponsorship. (Coca-Cola, by the way, was named the world\u2019s leading polluter of plastics the year prior to COP 27).\n\nThis all was unsettling. I had journeyed across the world in hopes of taking part in global youth action. Instead, I was sidelined at a wasteful, flashy entertainment zone \u2014 a distraction. There were many \u2014 too many \u2014 photo ops. Instagram-worthy backdrops were located in every direction, never out of sight, never too far away to hop in front of while in a hurry.\n\nIn one memorable instance, a businessman approached my cohort and asked us to take a photo of him in front of a \u201c#COP27\u2032\u2032 sign. He then thanked us for helping him \u201cprove that [he] was there.\u201d Many businesspeople took similar photos in front of the same sign.\n\nGreen Zone attendees in business professional attire pose in front of a photo backdrop at the 27th U.N. Climate Change Conference in Egypt. (Photo by Michael Pincus)\n\nIt did not take long for me to understand the truth of my surroundings. Because of my status as a paltry youth activist, I was stuck on the front porch, the checkpoint for corporate delegates to collect their content for greenwashed social media posts before heading to the Blue Zone. I was trapped in the designated PlayPlace for members of the public, a bus ride away from the world leaders and their negotiation meetings in the Blue Zone.\n\nA poisonous presence\n\nThen, there were the airplanes. At all hours of the day, planes flew directly overhead the Green Zone. Several of these were private jets carrying government officials. I felt guilty about my own contribution to aircraft carbon dioxide emissions. Was this conference worth all the harmful air travel? (Hint: my conclusion to that question is not so sanguine).\n\nAt COP26 in Glasgow, thousands of protesters swarmed the streets near the conference in a series of youth-led marches. This is what I had anticipated being part of at COP27. I wanted to be a voice in a sea of angry youth. But when I got to Egypt, I was informed that participating in these sorts of protests could get me into serious trouble with the Egyptian government.\n\nAfter such stunning youth organizing in Glasgow, placing the following two conferences in authoritarian countries where freedoms of assembly are heavily restricted feels intentional. This reality further provoked my guilty conscience. I had come all this way to participate in a hoax. I could not protest. I could not agitate the people in charge. All I could do was gawk at the smoke and mirrors of it all.\n\nAn airplane flies over a temporary structure constructed for the 27th U.N. Climate Change Conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. (Photo by Michael Pincus)\n\nAs if the irony couldn\u2019t be more in-your-face, the water dispensers stationed throughout the conference were clearly labeled as Nestl\u00e9 Pure Life, a product of BlueTriton Brands (formerly Nestl\u00e9). The same BlueTriton Brands received a cease-and-desist letter from California state officials in 2021 for its excessive diversion of water from forests in the San Bernardino area during worsening water shortages. The company also extracts up to 288 gallons of groundwater per minute in Michigan (and at one point registered to raise that capacity to 400 gallons per minute), all while Flint still deals with the fallout from its lead-poisoned water crisis.\n\nI vividly remember one of my peers in the cohort \u2014 a college student from Michigan \u2014 seeing one of these water dispensers and remarking, \u201cThey\u2019re poisoning my state,\u201d a solemn statement, a moment of defeat. From this point forward, it was clear to me that the Green Zone was a place that welcomed greenwashing.\n\nA water refill station labeled with the Nestl\u00e9 Pure Life logo stands beside a temporary structure at the 27th U.N. Climate Change Conference in Egypt. (Photo by Michael Pincus)\n\nGreat expectations\n\nI share all this because I believe in transparency. Whenever I tell someone that I attended COP27, I\u2019m told something along the lines of: \u201cThat must have been the opportunity of a lifetime.\u201d And each time, I robotically respond, \u201cIt was.\u201d But I am done being dishonest. The U.N. Climate Change Conference was a sham.\n\nI am extraordinarily grateful to Adamah and its Jewish Youth Climate Movement, the organization responsible for sending me to the conference. Likewise, I am indebted to Alon Tal, an Israeli environmental politician who helped arrange the delegation. They did everything in their power to provide an empowering and meaningful experience on the ground despite the disappointing circumstances that were out of their control.\n\nSince I returned home, the Adamah team continues to provide countless follow-up resources and closely support my climate activism. But I caution any college-aged student or youth planning to attend COP28 in Dubai: lower your expectations. Governments fail us. This includes the United Nations.\n\nI want to end on an optimistic note. I want to write some mushy sentiment about the bright horizon ahead. While I can\u2019t quite deliver that, here\u2019s what I can say: While it may be difficult to apply pressure on the ground in Dubai, we have the power to mobilize beforehand. We can impact what our representatives plan to say and do during negotiations before they journey across the world. And we need to act fast; we only have seven months to spare.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/04/27/the-chefs-2023-nfl-mock-draft-special/", "response": "```\nThe NFL draft is upon us, and the time of the year has arrived for all 32 fanbases to put their differences aside and unite to chide NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell at the NFL draft Thursday night. While booing the commissioner is a tradition that will forever live on, what brings people to the draft is to see the next batch of college stars find their new homes in the NFL. But before the madness begins later today, It\u2019s time to present my official mock draft.\n\nWhen I sat down this year, I looked at a few things to make my evaluations. First and foremost, I examined a team\u2019s needs, especially where a position or unit struggled and needed to be addressed during free agency or trades. Additionally, one must assess a player\u2019s scheme fit that the team runs. Finally, I put on my general manager hat and looked from the perspective of a front office when assessing a draft class. But at the end of the day, I based my picks on, \u201cWhich player gives this team the best chance to win the Super Bowl?\u201d Because when it is all said and done, calling yourself a \u201cSuper Bowl Champ,\u201d is what every team in the league is gunning for every season.\n\nSo, here is how this year\u2019s 1st round of the 2023 NFL Draft should go.\n\n#1 Pick, Carolina Panthers - Anthony Richardson, QB, Florida\nSuperhuman. You get that with Anthony Richardson standing at 6\u20324 and 231 lbs. He has explosiveness on the ground with a cannon as an arm, which with some polishing potential, makes him a nightmare for opposing defenses on Sunday. However, despite rightful concerns about his accuracy - with only completing 53.5% of his passes this season, his superman athleticism and effortless arm power aren\u2019t things Panthers head coach Frank Reich can teach.\n\n#2 Pick, Houston Texans - Bryce Young, QB, Alabama\nByrce Young will not fall lower than two. Rumblings in recent weeks about Houston not selecting a quarterback have shaken Young\u2019s perspectives, but I call them nonsense. Young totaled 80 touchdowns and threw for 8,356 yards over his three years at Alabama, bringing home the Heisman after a dominant 2021 campaign. You will only go far in this league if you have a franchise piece at quarterback.\n\n#3 Pick, Arizona Cardinals - Will Anderson, OLB, Alabama\nThis is where we could see our first movement. While the Cardinals will be open ears to offers, there won\u2019t be anything that blows away the front office. By staying at three, the pick for Will Anderson is essential to re-constructing the front seven of the Cardinals after losing JJ Watt, Zach Allen, and Markus Golden this offseason. Anderson brings speed to the outside with the strength to take on double teams in the run game the Cardinals are missing. Anderson had a highly productive season this year at Alabama, tallying 10 sacks and 59 quarterback pressures to be named all-SEC defensive player of the year twice in a row.\n\n#4 Pick, Indianapolis Colts - C.J. Stroud, QB, Ohio State\nIn the last few seasons, the Colts have tried fixing their quarterback problem by signing aging veterans, including Philip Rivers, Carson Wentz, and Matt Ryan. Unfortunately, all of these experiments have failed, and now the Colts have a golden opportunity at four to get their franchise guy. CJ Stroud is a day-one must for the Colts, with the potential to start week one. Out of the quarterback bunch, Stroud is a more traditional pocket passer with excellent pocket awareness and zip on the football. And for the questions about his mobility, this year\u2019s College Football Semifinal game versus Georgia showcased his ability to get outside the pocket and create plays on the run. Stroud threw for 348 yards and 4 touchdowns against the best defense in college football.\n\n#5 Pick, Seattle Seahawks - Jalen Carter, DL, Georgia\nThe Seahawks had significant problems stopping the run last year, allowing 150 yards per game (the third worst, only behind Chicago and Houston). Therefore, improving the front seven is a must for the Seahawks in the first round. Jalen Carter is the perfect fit for a struggling front-line. Carter not only can play every position along the line but dominate too.\n\n#6 Pick, Detroit Lions - Tyree Wilson, EDGE, Texas Tech\nDan Campbell will love Tyree Wilson the minute he walks into the building. The Lions ranked 32nd in total defense last year, leaving lots to be desired from the young group.\n\n#7 Pick, Las Vegas Raiders - Christian Gonzalez, CB, Oregon\nThe Raiders could go any position in the first round, and it would fill a need for the team. Gonzalez is a piece that can help revamp a defense that has struggled to find any identity in the secondary in recent years.\n\n#8 Pick, Atlanta Falcons - Luke Van Ness, EDGE, Iowa\nThe Falcons allow second-year quarterback Desmond Ridder to be the week one play caller. With that in mind, the Falcons will pick up an athletic edge in Van Ness, who possesses violent hands for creating significant leverage.\n\n#9 Pick, Chicago Bears - Peter Skoroski, OT, Northwestern\nJustin Fields was sacked 55 times this year. 55 times! The Bears must draft the best offensive lineman in this year\u2019s class.\n\n#10 Pick, Philadelphia Eagles - Myles Murphy, EDGE, Clemson\nThe Eagles are easily one of the most talented rosters in the NFL, so how can they get better? Brandon Graham recently turned 35 and is entering his career\u2019s twilight years. However, with a high upside in defending against the run, Murphy makes a possible transition from Eagle great Brandon Graham in the next few years significantly smoother.\n\n#11 Pick, Tennessee Titans - Paris Johnson, OT, Ohio State\nTitans released long-tenured star tackle Taylor Lewan, earlier this off-season, leaving the position in critical need of help. Johnson can bring power and ferocity to a Titans offensive line that ranked dead last this season by PFF.\n\n#12 Pick, Houston Texans - Nolan Smith, EDGE, Georgia\nAfter taking Young at two, new Head Coach DeMeco Ryans drafts a player maker on the defensive side of the ball. Nolan Smith is explosive on the outside with great flexibility, allowing him to dip under the reach of offensive linemen and cause havoc for opposing quarterbacks.\n\n#13 Pick, Green Bay Packers - Quentin Johnston, WR, TCU\nThe Aaron Rodgers saga has finally ended in the Badger state, putting all eyes on third-year quarterback Jordan Love. This pick does not follow the typical track record of Packer\u2019s first-round selections in the past, but the only way to help boost a young quarterback\u2019s confidence is to surround him with weapons.\n\n#14 Pick, New England Patriots - Bijan Robinson, RB, University of Texas\nSince the departure of Brady, the Patriots\u2019 offense has struggled to find any real identity. While I\u2019m not a big fan of running backs going high because of how short the shelf life of the position has become. Yet, Robinson is simply the best player on the board, plus the pure talent and abused strength make this a no-brainer for New England.\n\n#15 Pick, New York Jets - Broderick Jones, OT, Georgia\nNow that Rodgers is officially a Jet, it\u2019s time for the Jets to protect their new crown jewel himself. The Jets seem to already found something with Mekhi Beckton at left tackle. Drafting Jones can help to solidify both tackle positions for next year.\n\n#16 Pick, Washington Commanders - Devon Witherspoon, CB, Illinois\nThe Commanders\u2019 secondary struggled to generate turnovers last year, ranking 26th in total turnovers (18) and 28th in interceptions (9). Witherspoon had a productive season at Illinois, excelling in man coverage with 14 pass breakups and allowing just a 24.6 QBR when targeted.\n\n#17 Pick, Pittsburgh Steelers - Deonte Banks, CB, Maryland\nBanks has quietly risen up the draft boards over the past few months, and rightfully so. The Maryland product turned heads at the combine showing quick speed and impressive jumping ability. In addition, banks has excellent eye discipline and is a disruptive corner in press coverage. Especially in a conference like the AFC, with its fair share of star receivers, getting reinforcements in the secondary never hurts.\n\n#18 Pick, Detroit Lions - Brian Branch, S, Alabama\nThe Lions grab another piece for their defense, this time in safety Brian Branch. Branch is not an instant week one starter, yet he has the traits and tools you look for in safety, like great length, ball skills, and active eyes that give him great awareness of the action on the field. In addition, his versatility at the safety position makes him a potential starter two or three years later.\n\n#19 Pick, Tampa Bay Buccaneers - O\u2019Cyrus Torrence, OG, Florida\nWhile the Buccaneers were one of the premier passing teams this season, they ranked dead last in rush offense, averaging 76.9 yards on the ground a game. O\u2019Cyrus Torrence\u2019s impact will be felt. Torrence is a dominant force in the run game with crazy raw strength and power, allowing him to fling opposing defenders aside.\n\n#20 Pick, Seattle Seahawks - Will Levis, QB, Kentucky\nGeno Smith is going nowhere for now, but Seattle seems set on staying in the first round with a quarterback. So grabbing Levis is excellent value for a potential starter in one or two years.\n\n#21 Pick, Los Angeles Chargers - Jackson Smith-Njigba, WR, Ohio State\nGrabbing one of the premier receivers in this class adds another weapon to the arsenal for Justin Herbert Veteran receiver Keenan Allen has dealt with his fair share of injuries over the past few years, providing plenty of opportunity to learn and step up.\n\n#22 Pick, Baltimore Ravens - Jordan Addison, WR, USC\nWhat do you do when your quarterback is upset? Get him weapons. Addison is a matchup nightmare in the slot for any corner, as he possesses quick feet and is a silky smooth route runner. With those tools, Addison can create lots of separation between the hub and him, providing any quarterback with an easy target.\n\n#23 Pick, Minnesota Vikings - Hendon Hooker, QB, Tennessee\nLet\u2019s be honest, how much longer will Kirk Cousins be the quarterback in Minnesota? Hooker is still progressing back from an ACL injury but showed lots of promise in his final year at Tennessee, throwing for 3,135 yards and 27 touchdowns.\n\n#24 Pick, Jacksonville Jaguars - John Michael Schmitz, C, Minnesota\nProtect your franchise quarterback at all costs. Jacksonville\u2019s offensive line was one of the worst units in the NFL, despite a playoff berth for the first time since 2016. In addition, this season, the Jaguars unit had a dreadful 49 percent team pass block win rate, ranking them 31st in the league.\n\n#25 Pick, New York Giants - Zay Flowers, WR, Boston College\nNow that Daniel Jones is locked up for the foreseeable future, it\u2019s time to surround your $40 million guy with some tools to make big plays down the field. Flowers is not the biggest guy standing at just 5\u203210, but his explosiveness in the open area creates havoc for the opposing defense.\n\n#26 Pick, Dallas Cowboys - Steve Avila, OG, TCU\nIt\u2019s not the sexy pick that Cowboys fans are going to go crazy for, but Steve Avila helps to solidify a position, left guard, that the Cowboys have struggled to get absolute consistency out of in the last few years.\n\n#27 Pick, Buffalo Bills - Calijah Kancey, DL, Pittsburgh\nEven for being undersized at the position, Kancey is a ferocious player and uses his slight frame as an advantage to shooting quickly into gaps, disrupting both the rush and passing game.\n\n#28 Pick, Cincinnati Bengals - Joey Porter Jr., CB, Penn State\nThe production from the secondary of the Bengals this season could have been more consistent. After the loss of star safety Jesse Bates to Atlanta, getting Joey Porter Jr. is a much-needed addition to a struggling unit.\n\n#29 Pick, New Orleans Saints - Dalton Kincaid, TE, Utah\nThe Saints will jump on Kincaid as the best player on the board while also addressing the need to find an actual number at the tight end position. Unfortunately, as USC fans, we know too much about this product out of Utah.\n\n#30 Pick, Philadelphia Eagles - Jahmyr Gibbs, RB, Alabama\nGibbs fits right in with the Eagles\u2019 playbook. A wildcard at the running back position also displays productivity in receiving the ball.\n\n#31 Pick, Kansas City Chiefs - Josh Downs, WR, North Carolina\nDoes getting your two-time MVP and Super Bowl champion quarterback more help ever hurt? Over the years of creating mock drafts, I found no true art. Every year, some pick or trade happens on day one of the currents that completely flips everything on its head. And on top of that, everybody has their own opinions and evaluations of players when creating mock drafts, making there no correct answers when creating one.\n```"}

He brought us to the battle of New York, when the Avengers defeated Loki and the Chitauri, Thanos\u2019 home planet at the Avengers\u2019 lowest point, and of course, to the futuristic nation of Wakanda. Marvel Studios is now the highest grossing film franchise in history, and it\u2019s not even close. The modern superhero movie Feige helped pioneer has become Hollywood\u2019s go-to blockbuster. And the ones Marvel makes are a creative force, to the tune of over 27 billion dollars in box office earnings.\n\nBut Feige\u2019s story doesn\u2019t start at Marvel. The chief creative officer of the studio was rejected from USC\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts a total of five times before getting in on his sixth try. When he got to USC, he majored in film and tv production, graduating in 1995. Since graduation, Feige has remained active at the university. He currently serves on the Board of Councilors at the School of Cinematic Arts and regularly speaks at student events.\n\nWe had the chance to sit down to chat with Feige to speak about his time at USC. He reflected on what drew him to the school.\n\nKevin Feige: USC for me was like \u201cStar Wars,\u201d was like \u201cBack to the Future\u201d and Robert Zemeckis. It was this dream to attain... and I had not yet been accepted to the film school and I used to longingly walk past the film school on my way around the campus and the George Lucas Building at the time, hoping to one day get in. And eventually, after many attempts, I finally did.\n\nHe also discussed how being a Trojan has impacted his current work in the industry.\n\nFeige: I would go to Norris and try to get into overflow for 466 or various screenings, and the notion of watching something and then hearing somebody at any level who\u2019d been a part of that discuss the process was really something that made me appreciate being at USC, being at a school that was right in the middle of the industry with such a cachet that people who were working in that business would would come in and speak.\n\nThis will actually be the first time Feige attends USC\u2019s commencement because during his graduation, he was busy working at the Warner Lot. Now, he looks to leave students with a message of ambition.\n\nFeige: Dream big, which is generic but true, and the notion that if I could do it, anybody listening to that speech could do it. I did not have a lot of contacts in the business. I didn\u2019t have a parent that ran a film studio. Not that not that if you do, you can\u2019t also do good work, but I didn\u2019t have any of that stuff. I was a kid from New Jersey who luckily got into the school and and PA\u2019d on student films and then worked on my own student films with my friends, and then was an intern, and then was a receptionist, and then was a production assistant, and then was an assistant, and then was an associate producer and really climbed the ladder, which I think I\u2019m proud of every rung.\n\nUSC\u2019s 140th commencement ceremony will be livestreamed on YouTube at 8:30 am Pacific Time on Friday, May 12th.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Ethan Huang.\n```"}

(Photo by Yannick Peterhans)\n\nBy Matthew Andrade and Adam Jasper\nApril 27, 2023 at 8:12 pm PDT\n\nThe time has come for the 2023 NFL Draft and a few Trojans are expected to hear their name called by the end of the three-day event. Follow along here for live updates on the USC players taken in this year\u2019s NFL Draft.\n\nDay 1\nMinnesota Vikings, Pick 23: Jordan Addison, WR\nWide receiver Jordan Addison led the Trojans in receiving yards with 875 in his lone season at USC. (Photo by Yannick Peterhans)\nAddison was an explosive wide receiver for two college programs, winning the Biletnikoff Award at Pitt during his sophomore season and making an immediate impact upon transferring to USC for his junior year. Addison battled injuries during his sole season with the Trojans but still managed to post 875 receiving yards and eight touchdowns through 11 games in a stacked wide receiver room. He brings elite route-running to a team that is desperate for a second option at receiver. Addison will play alongside one of the top receivers in the country, Justin Jefferson, and will try to fill Adam Thielen\u2019s shoes as the Vikings try to make a splash in the NFC North. With Addison\u2019s selection, USC continues its streak of having at least one player selected in every NFL Draft since 1939. It was also the fourth straight year where a Trojan was taken in the first round and the second year in a row that a USC wide receiver was taken in the first round.\n\nDay 2\nLos Angeles Chargers, Pick 54: Tuli Tuipulotu, EDGE\nDefensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu is staying in Los Angeles, as the Chargers selected him in the second round of the 2023 NFL Draft. (Photo by Sam Bitman)\nThe second Trojan off the board is staying home in Los Angeles. The Chargers selected Tuipulotu in the second round to beef up their front seven. The former-USC defensive lineman displayed tenacity on the line in his junior season. He registered 13.5 sacks, good for best in the nation, and 22 tackles for loss. Tuipulotu will team up with established pass rushers Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack. The Chargers look to sure up a defense that was largely to blame for their crushing playoff loss in the 2022 AFC Wild Card game. Because of his size, Tuipulotu may be moved to playing as an outside linebacker at the professional level. The Chargers made Tuipulotu the first USC defensive player selected in this year\u2019s draft. He is now the highest selected defensive Trojan since linebacker Uchenna Nwosu went at No. 48 in 2018.\n\nMinnesota Vikings, Pick 102: Mekhi Blackmon, CB\nCornerback Mekhi Blackmon celebrates after snagging an interception against Stanford on September 10, 2022. (Photo by Yannick Peterhans)\nWith the final pick in the third round, Mekhi Blackmon heard his name called. Blackmon was taken by the Minnesota Vikings who also picked up Jordan Addison yesterday, giving the team an all-Trojan draft class through the first three rounds. Blackmon led the Trojans in pass breakups last season with 12 and also grabbed three interceptions. The Vikings\u2019 defense could use some help and Blackmon fills a major need at the cornerback position. His smaller frame has some analysts uncertain of his impact at the next level, but he\u2019s sure to add a strong tackling ability to Minnesota\u2019s secondary.\n\nDay 3\nBaltimore Ravens, Pick 229: Andrew Vorhees, OG\nOffensive lineman Andrew Vorhees celebrates with running back Austin Jones during a game against Fresno State on September 17, 2022. (Photo by Colin Huang)\nAndrew Vorhees has his landing spot: The Baltimore Ravens took the offensive guard in the seventh round. He\u2019ll hope to protect quarterback Lamar Jackson who signed a massive contract extension on Thursday. Vorhees reportedly dropped in the draft due to an ACL tear and lateral meniscus tear he suffered during a shuttle drill at the NFL Combine last month. Vorhees\u2019 surgeon sent a letter yesterday addressed to all 32 NFL teams expressing that he expects Vorhees to make a full recovery. Even with the injury, Vorhees had the most reps on the bench press of any player at the combine.\n```"}

(Photo by Carly Rieger)\n\nBy Curran Rastogi April 27, 2023 at 7:21 pm PDT\n\n\u201cThe March Toward March\u201d is a column by Curran Rastogi about men\u2019s college basketball teams and their journeys to March Madness. After the No. 1 seed Milwaukee Bucks were eliminated from the 2023 NBA Playoffs, a distraught Giannis Antetokounmpo was asked if he considered this season a failure. As he kept his composure and attempted not to unleash his frustration at the reporter, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a failure, it\u2019s steps to success.\u201d\n\nThe entire idea is that we shouldn\u2019t look at each season with the expectation that our favorite team should win the championship and then declare the season a failure when they do not. Success can be found in more ways than just the results at the end of the season. But how does this translate to college basketball? Giannis has the ability to play for the Milwaukee Bucks as long as he wants to. For college basketball players, that is not the case. These college players are only at school for five or six years at most, with the best players leaving after one or two years. So it begs the question, what does success look like in college basketball? Has every team that didn\u2019t win a national championship or even their conference championship failed?\n\nCollege basketball is an incredibly difficult sport in which to define success by virtue of the unpredictability of its postseason tournament. Since the tournament expanded in 1985, only 40% of No. 1 seeds have even made it to the Final Four. While this seems like a relatively high percentage, remember that there are four No. 1 seeds each year, meaning that just one or two will even make the Final Four each year. These No. 1 seeds are meant to be the best teams in college basketball and with them not even making the Final Four, it demonstrates this unpredictability. It can therefore only be concluded that success can only be evaluated based on constantly shifting expectations.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at some interesting teams this year and attempt to determine whether or not they had truly successful seasons.\n\nUSC Trojans\n\nI would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the USC Trojans as a team to evaluate. Looking at the way the team played this season, it was pretty obvious that they were the third best team in the Pac-12. Arizona and UCLA were just in a class ahead of the Trojans from the start of the season to the end. Coming off a first-round exit to Miami in last year\u2019s NCAA tournament, the expectation was that a mostly similar roster might be able to improve and make it a little further. Well, that didn\u2019t happen and the Trojans were bounced in the first round of the NCAA tournament again. This wasn\u2019t a season where the Trojans over or underachieved. They may have fallen just short of preseason expectations, but this isn\u2019t the type of season that will see head coach Andy Enfield fired. However, next year, a similar season may see the Trojan head coach on the hot seat. A projected top-15 roster before the year means that the Trojans cannot have a similar season to this next year.\n\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels\n\nUNC\u2019s season was an unmitigated disaster. The team ranked No. 1 in the preseason after a wild March Madness run last year but completely missed this season\u2019s tournament. They definitely underachieved and head coach Hubert Davis is on the hot seat.  With mostly the same roster as their Final Four team, the Tar Heels were the first team in college basketball history to ever be the preseason favorite and miss the tournament entirely. They lost to Duke at both Cameron Indoor Arena and their home, the Dean Smith Center. It\u2019s obvious that things need to change quickly or else the blue blood reputation will be tarnished.\n\nPenn State Nittany Lions\n\nPenn State was a very interesting college basketball story this year. The Nittany Lions had pretty low NCAA tournament hopes until they went 8-2 to finish conference play, including a Cinderella run to the finals of the Big Ten Tournament. So was their season a success? Well, if you ask the Notre Dame athletic director, he would answer with a resounding yes. Penn State\u2019s head coach left the team after their season and moved to South Bend, taking over for long-time head coach Mike Brey. Penn State\u2019s season, despite ending in the second round of the NCAA tournament, was quite memorable and also marked their first tournament appearance in 10 years.\n\nTo recap, success for anyone, especially in sports, is mostly based on expectations. It\u2019s like Zendaya said in \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home,\u201d \u201cIf you expect disappointment, you won\u2019t ever be disappointed.\u201d Plenty of teams across the country had successful seasons, that at the very least their coach can build on. Maybe Giannis\u2019 statement does apply to college basketball too. \u201cThe March Toward March\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

Moving forward into the network of Trojan alumni brings about a mix of emotions. Nostalgic, excited or panicked, these seniors are feeling it all. We took to the streets to hear what seniors are thinking at the close of their last semester.\n\nAnaiancy Ramirez: I think I\u2019ve grown a lot. That was Anaiancy Ramirez. She is a doctorate pharmacy student.

But I feel like now I\u2019m really proud of how far I\u2019ve come. Honestly, I think it\u2019s just going to get into the mindset that I\u2019m no longer a student and I\u2019m a fully reliable, liable pharmacist...people are going to be asking me questions instead of me going and asking my teachers questions.\n\nEven with the burnout that comes around this time of year, these students are appreciating how much they\u2019ve learned. Negar Hariri is a Pharmaceutical Student here at USC. She is also feeling reflective.\n\nNegar Hariri: I learned a lot. I learned teamwork. Working with my peers, I learned how to focus. I had great mentors that I was able to able to learn from.\n\nAs exciting as graduation can be, the nerves still creep in for students who are experiencing their first time without such a set schedule. Bernifka Saint Jean is a business administration major. She recognizes the inevitable uncertainty.\n\nBernifka Saint Jean: I tend to be a very, like type A person, very scheduled. So I think having a lot of like, unscheduled time, as much as I want to have like, hobbies and everything like that, I think that\u2019s going to be a little bit stressful trying to figure that out.\n\nFor all the seniors listening to our show today, we couldn\u2019t be more excited for everything that lies in your future. Take your next steps with pride, the Trojan Family is watching in awe of the example your are setting for us all. As always, Fight On!\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Maisy White.\n```"}

It\u2019s not really the last, but that\u2019s the name of California\u2019s largest new and used bookstore, located in downtown LA. General Manager Joe Cascro expands on the irony of their name.\n\nJoe Cascro: Here\u2019s a joke behind the name, but I think everyone has their own little spin on it. Mine is always if you\u2019re going towards Skid Row, it\u2019s the last bookstore. But if you\u2019re coming back from Skid Row area, it\u2019s the first bookstore.\n\nWalking in, you\u2019re greeted by Richard Powell, security guard and book fanatic. He\u2019s worked here since 2015. He can tell you stories of floating books and mysterious sounds after closing that remain in this century-old refurbished bank. Books cover the walls like ivy, with shelves spanning the whole floor. The bank\u2019s original coffered ceilings hang above the first level, which houses some of the most approachable sections and genres, like Children\u2019s and Nutrition.\n\nAs you move upstairs, you\u2019ll be presented with the entrance to the labyrinth. Housing horror, crime, fiction, and sci-fi, walking through the spiral shelving and the fantastical displays, you can\u2019t help but feel compelled to pick up a book and get started.\n\nI asked the staff what they think makes the store so special. Head manager Adrian Prospero talks about what can be discovered throughout the store.\n\nAdrian Prospero: But if you want to wander around, wander around, sorry. And spend the time and look for little hidden gems and little things you would never read. That\u2019s what makes it special. It\u2019s like these little hidden books that are on the shelf that you don\u2019t know about or you haven\u2019t seen.\n\nBook clerk Matthew Corey points out the sheer collection of literature at the Last Bookstore.\n\nMatthew Corey: It\u2019s just so comprehensive. They have so many books. I mean, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the biggest store in the world, but it\u2019s definitely, at least nowadays is probably one of the most well known and most, you know, comprehensive. They just carry every section and every category, and they\u2019re amazing.\n\nFor their expert opinion, I asked the staff for their favorite books, for the one book that made them fall in love with reading, one they wish they could read for the first time again:\n\nLyla Bhalla-Ladd: Could you take me to a book that you wish you could read again for the first time?\n\nProspero starts off with a gripping and unsettling dystopia.\n\nProspero: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s out, but it\u2019s a book called \u201cThe Shimmering State.\u201d And it\u2019s just it\u2019s probably a year old by a writer in New York. It felt very unpredictable. It felt very modern and relevant today. It\u2019s basically about two people in a rehab center. But it\u2019s for a new drug that allows you to take other people\u2019s memories. And it\u2019s very, it\u2019s very relevant to the issues that\u2019s going on today. And it tells you two perspectives, two points of views. Yeah, I just I really enjoyed it. I always recommend it.\u201d\n\nProvonost talks about a story that reunites a failing salesman and a monarch.\n\nTim Provonost: One of my favorite modern books of all time is \u201cHologram for a King\u201d by Dave Eggers. And I wish I could read it again because it\u2019s a beautiful story about kind of being in a endless loop and trying to get out of an endless loop. And it\u2019s just so beautifully written that every time I reread it, I find new stuff. But man, just to reread it for the first time would be amazing.\n\nAnd Corey returns to childhood with a universal classic.\n\nCorey: Well, you know, when I was a little kid, I read \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d and that\u2019s probably--it\u2019s probably over here in the children\u2019s section. It\u2019s a real fantasy. I mean, probably you\u2019ve seen the film. It\u2019s just got all these kind of crazy characters. It also has, like, I don\u2019t know, just morals to it or something. It\u2019s got a beginning, middle and end, which takes you on a journey. And I like that idea of just the kind of the innocence of it, I guess, is what I like.\n\nWhether it be in the form of modern fiction, children\u2019s classics or dystopia, the staff embodies the essence of The Last Bookstore, a space where the imagination comes to life.\n\nFrom Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Lyla Bhalla-Ladd.\n```"}

Bautista: you definitely need internships because that will impress future employers for like full time opportunities. But internships don\u2019t like we get a much longer summer than in middle school and high school, so internships only take up, like, I would say like two thirds of your summer. So as long as you like, make the best use of your time, you could use the rest of those weeks to, like, enjoy it as you would in middle school.\n\nWhether you\u2019re staying in LA for the summer, traveling abroad or, yes, working an internship, we at Annenberg Media wish you a good summer.

Francisco Hernandez, known to everyone in the community as Paco and owner of the bakery, said the family business started long before, when his grandmother owned her own bakery in La Barca, Jalisco, in Mexico.\n\n\u201cMy father, who died already, learned there and when he moved here to work, he opened his own business,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Hernandez, who is mainly in charge of making cakes, said the bakery is a \u201csmall business and the customers are mainly Latino people from the neighborhood.\u201d He recalled feeling at ease and really good about owning his own bakery and being able to support his family for a very long time.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, people of \u201cHispanic or Latino\u201d origins represent about 49% of the Los Angeles County population. Being almost half the population of the county, their presence is an important part of the L.A. culture with the increase of diversity in restaurants and bakeries.\n\nMr. Hernandez\u2019s bread baker, Ram\u00f3n Dorantes from Mexico City, Mexico, makes all the bread by himself every morning. Mr. Hernandez said Dorantes has been working in the bakery since 1991, and he thinks that could be one of the reasons why people like it so much.\n\n\u201cMaybe people come because we haven\u2019t changed and the bread baker is the same,\u201d he said.\n\nBut not everything is warm and tasty like the bread they sell, the egg shortage in the country has affected the bakery significantly.\n\n\u201cWith the egg prices so high we can\u2019t support a business and help the clients with a more fair and comfortable price,\u201d Maria Hernandez, the wife of Mr. Hernandez, said.\n\nCalifornia experienced a massive egg shortage and higher prices at the beginning of the year causing egg prices to rise from $2.35 for a dozen large eggs to around $7.37 until mid-February, when the price of the eggs lowered to $5.74, according to the Department of Agriculture.\n\nThis was caused by different reasons including a bird flu outbreak that killed more than 50 million birds nationally and the implementation of Proposition 12 in different states including California, which requires hens to be cage-free since 2022.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Hernandez both said that it has been a challenge for the bakery. In order to survive the crisis, they needed to adjust the bread and cake costs by increasing the price a bit more because the eggs were too expensive for them to keep it the same.\n\n\u201cWe seek alternatives by looking for eggs at better prices and we needed to increase a little bit the costs to compensate for the high egg prices and shortage,\u201d Mrs. Hernandez said.\n\nMrs. Hernandez, whose favorite bread is the cuernitos, said the bakery is \u201ca goal accomplished.\u201d She helps with the cakes\u2019 designs and is in charge of the communication between the bakery and the clients who order cakes and bread for events.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m who makes the agreements with the clients and socializes a bit more,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a kind treatment and an act of service for them.\u201d\n\nLatine people move to the U.S. for different reasons. One of them is looking for a better quality of life to support their families, and a lot of times, they are not able to go back to their countries. Some of them said they feel happy when they can find places that conserve their culture.\n\nMr. Hernandez feels really good about providing this piece of home to people not just from Mexico but from all over Latino America who live in the community and look for familiar tastes to feel closer to their cultures.\n\n\u201cPeople who are used to eating bread will always want to eat bread,\u201d he said.\n\nHe adds there are people who even go every day to get their bread and coffee early in the morning before leaving for work.\n\nCustomers like Uriel Anguiano from Tuxpan, Jalisco, Mexico, who is a member of a mariachi in L.A., said he and his brother visit the bakery every time they work close to the area.\n\n\u201cNormally I would come in the weekends and sometimes in the middle of the week when we work close by,\u201d he said.\n\nAnguiano feels good to have a Latino bakery where he can get a sense of home.\n\n\u201cIn other places, it\u2019s not so common to find Mexican bread,\u201d he said.\n\nBlanca Valdivia, from Guadalajara, Jalisco, has six months working at the bakery. She said her favorite bread is the vanilla conchas and that she enjoys working at the bakery because it\u2019s satisfactory for her to work in a place that makes her feel closer to home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really helpful just because of the taste of the bread and being able to have it on hand,\u201d she said.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused thousands of restaurants to close and employees to lose their jobs because of the social distancing set in the country as a measure to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nMr. Hernandez said that because of the high inflation of the country and the price increase of the other food items after that, they needed to cut employees and work harder.\n\n\u201cThe solution was to work more and have fewer employees,\u201d he said.\n\nMrs. Hernandez recalled how the pandemic was another low point for the bakery but they are happy they were able to stand up.\n\n\u201cWe qualified for the small business aid and that helped us create a bit of support for the business, and trying to look everywhere for cheaper prices for the flour, milk and everything we need,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Hernandez hopes to expand the bakery and upgrade it since he thinks it is somewhat small and needs more space. He has not been successful so far.\n\n\u201cWe have everything reduced and I would like to make it bigger from the back in the future,\u201d he said.\n\nJuan Gutierrez, who has been Mr. Hernandez\u2019s friend for around 23 years, said he always goes to the bakery to help him and to provide for his company when there is no one else working at the bakery.\n\nGutierrez said that he feels really good about being around the bakery and he thinks it is necessary for Latinos in the community to have these food representations.\n\nHe invites people to visit and support the bakery and try all the different handmade bread they offer.\n\n\u201cI love all the bread but mainly the puerquitos, piedras and guayabas,\u201d Gutierrez said.\n\nThe sense of home is the recipe Mr. Hernandez hopes will keep his bakery going for more years to come.\n```"}

He will return as USC's quarterback next season. (Photo by Carly Rieger)\n\nBy Adam Bradford April 27, 2023 at 2:16 pm PDT\n\n\u201cNo Offseason\u201d is a column by Adam Bradford discussing college football developments during the winter and spring months. Well, this is it. Although the return of college football is still four months away, this marks the final edition of \u201cNo Offseason\u201d this year. Hence, I thought it would be fun to end things by giving a few of my bold predictions for the 2023 season. There is definitely a range as to the \u201cboldness\u201d of my predictions. Some are medium at best, others are scorching hot. These are just a few things that I think will happen this fall. Without further ado, here they are.\n\nArkansas bounces back\nAfter an impressive nine-win season in 2021, Arkansas entered 2022 with high expectations. However, the Razorbacks struggled to meet those expectations, as they fell to 7-6, including stunning losses versus Texas A&M and Liberty. The X-factor for Arkansas is redshirt senior quarterback KJ Jefferson. After a strong first season as the Razorbacks\u2019 starter in 2021, Jefferson struggled with injuries last year, a large factor in his team\u2019s decline. If Jefferson can stay healthy and take a step forward in his development, Arkansas could sneak up on Alabama and LSU in the SEC West.\n\nKansas wins eight games\nLast season, Kansas made a bowl game for the first time since 2008. After a remarkable 5-0 start, however, the Jayhawks struggled down the stretch and finished the year 6-7. Much of that struggle was due to quarterback Jalon Daniels missing time with an injury. While backup Jason Bean filled in admirably for Daniels, Kansas was clearly a different team without their starter. If Daniels stays healthy next season, the Jayhawks could legitimately win eight games \u2014 which would be truly remarkable given their poor football history.\n\nTexas fires Sark\nAfter an underwhelming first two years in Austin, Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian enters 2023 with the pressure to win. Despite signing top recruiting classes throughout his tenure with the Longhorns \u2014 including five-star quarterbacks Quinn Ewers and Arch Manning \u2014 Sarkisian holds just a 13-12 record at Texas. In eight full seasons as a head coach at Washington, USC and now Texas, Sarkisian has never finished a regular season better than 8-4. Given Texas\u2019 high expectations and impatient boosters, that isn\u2019t going to cut it on the Forty Acres. If the Longhorns don\u2019t take a step forward from last season, do not be stunned if they kick Sarkisian to the curb and start fresh.\n\nThe Pac-12 ends its playoff drought\nThe Pac-12 has not made the College Football Playoff since Washington did it back in 2016. And with the playoff set to expand in 2024, this is the conference\u2019s last chance to make it under the current format. Fortunately for the Pac-12, 2023 appears to be its best shot yet to end the drought, with four or five legitimate contenders all led by high-profile signal callers. USC enters year two of the Lincoln Riley era, adding numerous defensive transfers to an explosive offense led by Heisman-winning junior quarterback Caleb Williams. Washington and Oregon both won double-digit games last season, and they return redshirt senior quarterbacks Michael Penix Jr. and Bo Nix, respectively. Utah brings back senior quarterback Cam Rising, who has led the Utes to two consecutive conference titles. And Oregon State adds senior Clemson transfer quarterback DJ Uiagalelei to a team that quietly won 10 games last season. Of course, there is certainly the possibility that these teams all beat up on each other, leaving the conference with a bunch of very good teams and no true contenders. Given the Pac-12\u2032s depth and star power, however, there is a decent chance that one team emerges from the pack and finally ends the conference\u2019s playoff drought.\n\nAlabama reclaims the title\nIs it bold to predict that a program that has won six of the past 14 national championships will win it all this year? Not particularly. But ever since Georgia won its second consecutive title in January, the narrative has been that Kirby Smart and the Bulldogs have passed Alabama as college football\u2019s premier program. However, Nick Saban has never gone three consecutive seasons at Alabama without winning a national championship. And while the Crimson Tide must replace star quarterback Bryce Young, five of their six titles under Saban have been won by a quarterback who did not start the year prior. Come January, Alabama reasserts itself as the top program in college football and wins its seventh national championship in 15 seasons.\n\n\u201cNo Offseason\u201d runs every other Thursday.\n```"}

As she sketched a drawing of a mother hugging her daughter on a large notepad, she spoke about her process and left some advice to any young aspiring illustrators.\n\n\u201cThe most important part of being an illustrator, it\u2019s not just about how well you draw,\u201d Hwang Ruiz said. \u201cYou have to feel the story that you want to share. The most important point is that don\u2019t give up.

Organizations like USC SSC and USC SAGE hope to make space for survivors.\n\nThis year\u2019s \u201cDenim Day,\u201d an event meant to educate the public and provide support for sexual assault survivors, was held today at the University Religious Center, an indoor venue that its organizers saw as an unwelcome compromise. The event, hosted by the USC Survivor Support Community and Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, gave students the chance to create an art installation, using squares of denim material painted by students and survivors in honor of Denim Day. But as of today, their artwork is yet to have a home.\n\nThe installation spells out \u201c1 out of 3,\u201d a statement referring to the amount of undergraduate female students who have been sexually assaulted during their time at USC. According to a survey from the Association of American Universities in 2019, the national statistic is one in four, making USC an outlier.\n\n\u201cDenim Day is really important because every year it\u2019s a reminder that this is an ongoing and systemic issue that is still happening,\u201d said Kate McQuarrie, the president of the USC SSC and director of Take Back the Night for the USC SAGE. Denim Day is a campaign organized by the Peace Over Violence nonprofit organization since 1999 in honor of Sexual Violence Awareness Month to spread awareness on sexual violence issues and support people affected by it.\n\nThe campaign started in response to a case where the Italian Supreme Court overturned a rape conviction because the victim was wearing \u201ctight jeans,\u201d and the justices stated she must have helped the rapist remove them, which implies consent. The following day, women in the Italian Parliament wore jeans to work to show their support of the victim. For the past 24 years, wearing jeans on Denim Day has become a symbol of protest.\n\nIn 2016 USC became the first college to join Peace Over Violence in Denim Day activities. The USC campus club SSC was founded a little over a year ago, following the sexual assault allegations at a USC fraternity. SSC originally asked the university for an outdoor space, hoping that the event would be easily accessible and visible to the public. Though some programming was held at the USC Village lawn, SSC was not provided with an outdoor space nor with a place to display their installation.\n\n\u201cHaving them [the university] deny this artwork is really embarrassing,\u201d said Olivia Efird, a health promotion and disease prevention sophomore. \u201cI think that they could be doing so much more to support survivors and prevent sexual violence on campuses.\u201d Efird, who works as an intern for SAGE\u2019s Take Back the Night, said that the decision by the university is baffling.\n\n\u201cHaving a piece of artwork is not a big deal, it\u2019s not going to take up so much space, and it\u2019s doing the work that USC is not doing itself,\u201d Efird said. Annenberg Media obtained a statement from the university explaining why the art exhibit was not permitted.\n\n\u201cEvent spaces for the Festival of Books were reserved until the end of the day on Wednesday to allow enough time to finish breaking down and removing tents,\u201d said Adam Rosen, associate vice president for culture relations and university events. \u201cThey finished early in the space that the clubs requested but that couldn\u2019t be predicted ahead of time,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cOther event space was provided.\u201d\n\nThat was not sufficient for some student organizers. The university informed the SSC about the reasoning behind their decision, but the organizers felt that it was unreasonable. They pointed out that other events were still taking place.\n\n\u201cThe Farmers Market is happening today, so I\u2019m very angry with USC for that,\u201d McQuarrie said. Organizers of the event said the only thing they wanted was an outdoor public space to provide support to a vulnerable community.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised at all that it was so hard for them to try to secure a space for this event,\u201d said Yi-Ann Li, the founder of SSC and psychology and English literature junior student. \u201cIt\u2019s very out-of-touch for the administration to not consider how much work goes into planning an event like this, how much emotional effort, emotional dedication and how much physical effort it takes to carry it out, especially for such an important topic.\u201d\n\nSome students said that because of the recent survey results, USC should be providing more support. \u201cWe realized there are a lot of people on campus who most likely desperately needed a space to be able to not feel so alone,\u201d Li said. And given the statistics for Trojans, McQuarrie said she thinks \u201cUSC is one of the places that needs this the most.\u201d```"}

(Photo by Veronique Louis-Jacques)\n\nBy Veronique Louis-Jacques and Mia Thompson\nApril 26, 2023 at 7:27 pm PDT\n\nNestled comfortably in a secluded area of the University Religious Center lies a dimmed-room. When students enter, they aren\u2019t greeted by the loud chatter of students or overcrowded desks and chairs. Instead, the space is dedicated to something that most students don\u2019t get enough of: sleep.\n\nLast week, USG announced that they would be creating the new napping space. The space is the newest development from RestSC, a student-led initiative in USG\u2019s Senate that seeks to \u201cuplift the wellness of all students on campus and provide an additional space for commuter students to feel at home.\u201d\n\nUSG Senators Sanjana Sambhwani, Sam Habibi and MENASA Advocacy Liaison Eduard Ghazaryan led the program in collaboration with the University Religious Center.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to give a home to students on campus,\u201d Sambhwani said. Especially for commuter students who spend long days in traffic and on campus for classes and meetings, Sambhwani emphasized the importance of creating an accessible space to meet basic needs, including couches, a lounge space to work and even a working kitchen next door.\n\n\u201cWe try to give commuters and all students a place where they can come to rest and relax and get horizontal for a couple minutes or hours,\u201d Ghazaryan said.\n\nThe napping area is the newest addition to the space. When students enter, they are welcomed by the calming sounds of crashing waves and inviting black leather couches that take up much of the space. But perhaps the most anticipated feature is a series of brand-new Moon Pods.\n\nMoon Pods are \u201czero-gravity bean bag chairs\u201d that are meant to help individuals unwind. Only taking up four feet of space, the Moon Pods are easy to move around and their shapes are adjustable to cater to whether someone wants to sit, recline or rest.\n\nJohn Fiorentino, the founder of Moon Pod, designed the product to mimic floatation therapy, a technique that has been proven to reduce stress-levels and anxiety.\n\n\u201cWe really want this to combat the academic pressure and this busy life that we\u2019re all living,\u201d Sambhwani said.\n\nImplementing the napping space was a long process, but one that was worthwhile, according to Sambhwani.\n\n\u201cWe definitely had a lot of administrative barriers,\u201d she said. \u201cI think space is generally very hard to access on this campus in terms of how you go about taking a room on campus and converting it into something completely different. So we had to pitch this narrative and really plugged the need for this space to recharge and decompress.\u201d\n\nBut the team\u2019s efforts all came to a head on Tuesday, with the RestSC soft launch, an open-house style gathering where students were invited to come check out the space.\n\nR Rajkumar, a masters student studying electrical engineering, spent time lounging on one of the Moon Pods and said he appreciated the space.\n\n\u201c[Doesn\u2019t compare] to a full size bed, but it\u2019s much better than sofas and pillows,\u201d Rajkumar said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s the most logical decision that [RestSC] could\u2019ve come up with.\u201d\n\nVictoria Valenzuela, a master\u2019s student who received her English undergraduate degree at USC, said she wishes the university had implemented this sooner.\n\nAs a commuter student, Valenzuela lived 30 to 40 minutes away from campus. Unable to drive, she is forced to stay on campus, lunging around a heavy backpack with all of her materials.\n\n\u201cIt can get really exhausting. I get really tired and then I don\u2019t have anywhere to rest,\u201d Valenzuela said. \u201cWhereas my classmates who live on campus or who live about 10 minutes away in apartments, are able to just walk there and take a nap to rest [or] have a hot meal in between classes.\u201d\n\nHaving not yet visited the space, Valenzuela described what she hopes for in the new napping space.\n\n\u201cI just hope it\u2019s something that gives us enough space and a little privacy. I feel like that\u2019s something I kind of struggled with on campus,\u201d Valenzuela said. \u201cI\u2019d be around people all day in a crowded study hall or library, always around people. Ideally, it would be nice if this just gave you space to yourself so you can try to decompress.\u201d\n\nThe room does not yet provide the level of privacy that students like Valenzuela might hope for. Instead, the Moon Pods are scattered across the floor in an open space. But it won\u2019t look like this for long, according to Ghazaryan, who says that they will be expanding on the project during the fall semester.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of renovating the space,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have wall paintings and rugs. The pods are going to have pillows to make it more comfortable. So we wanted to get this going, but we\u2019re still going to be involved with this project. We\u2019re still looking to expand on this and scale it, so I\u2019m optimistic for the future.\u201d\n\nSambhwani and Ghazaryan plan to develop more napping locations across campus in order to increase accessibility.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in contact with the Library for International Public Affairs, which is under CPA, and we\u2019re still in contact with Leavey Library,\u201d Sambhwani said. \u201cSo we\u2019re hoping that we end up creating all of these rest zones on campus.\u201d\n\nThis space, which may be the first of many, is located in URC104, and is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. With study days and finals quickly approaching, students might find a nap here to be just what they need to unwind, decompress and get some shut-eye.\n```"}

These big names might be making it to the big leagues.\n\nJunior wide receiver Jordan Addison dives forward against Arizona State on Oct. 1. (Photo by Daphne Zhu)\n\nBy Samuel Spitz and Daniel Palmore\nApril 26, 2023 at 7:07 pm PDT\n\nIn the NFL, the letters \u201cU\u201d, \u201cS\u201d and \u201cC\u201d often imply one thing: greatness. With fourteen alumni in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the Trojans have produced more Hall of Famers than any other school in the country. So for USC football, tomorrow\u2019s NFL Draft is a big deal. With that, who from this past Trojans team is up for grabs in this year\u2019s draft?\n\nThe biggest star out of USC in the 2023 draft class is most definitely the former Fred Biletnikoff Award winner and All-American wide receiver Jordan Addison. Recently, USC has been successful in producing consistent NFL receiver talent, boasting alumni like JuJu Smith-Schuster, Michael Pittman, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Drake London. With this recent success, many students are excited to see what these Trojans can do in the NFL.\n\n\u201cI am excited to see where Addison will land,\u201d freshman economics major Christopher Higgins said. \u201cI have seen a lot of fluidity in wide receiver rankings this year, so his range of picks is wide, and he could end up on a contender with a great quarterback. That would be fun.\u201d\n\nSophomore business major Brandon McGowan believes Addison will be set up best to showcase his skills in the NFL. \u201cI would say Jordan Addison is on the best path right now,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cI think in the pre-season he\u2019s going to get a lot of reps, and he\u2019ll have a lot of chances to prove himself.\u201d\n\nAlso on the board are defensive tackle Tuli Tuipulotu and guard Andrew Vorhees, both 2022 All-Americans. Tuipulotu was arguably the brightest spot from an otherwise underwhelming defense. Though he is going into the draft with relatively mild expectations, he could be taken as early as the second round.\n\nSophomore biomedical engineering student Michael Lee believes Tuipulotu is an underrated prospect entering the draft. \u201cI would say people don\u2019t give Tuli Tuipulotu a lot of credit,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI think his upside is very significant based on the fact that he was USC\u2019s best defensive lineman and led the nation in sacks.\u201d\n\nVorhees, on the other hand, has not been nearly as lucky. At the NFL Draft Combine in March, Vorhees fell victim to a torn ACL, which has seemingly plummeted his draft stock. Before the injury at the combine, Vorhees seemed destined to be a day-two pick but with this setback, he will most likely be scooped up in the late rounds.\n\nTravis Dye, the Trojan\u2019s number-one running back in the 2022 season also had his draft stock affected by his late-season ACL injury.\n\nEven though the Trojans boast a relatively strong talent pool in this year\u2019s draft, the most talked about Trojan from this year involves someone who is not even draft-eligible yet. The 2022 All-American, Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year and Heisman Trophy winner, quarterback Caleb Williams, has been a major topic of discussion surrounding the draft. It is extremely likely that next season will be Williams\u2019 final season with USC, as he will be eligible to declare for the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nCaleb Williams\u2019 takeover of USC Football is nothing new to the student body. They expect this kind of hype. \u201cI think it will be a huge conversation, especially with a lot of the recent pickups we\u2019ve gotten. I mean, got the number one tight end in the country, a few great o-linemen and obviously our defense too,\u201d freshman economics major Andrew Maxwell said. \u201cI think all those factors could really impact his [draft] stock. And honestly, I see it only going up from here.\u201d\n\nSophomore Brandon McGowan believes Williams would easily be the first pick in this year\u2019s draft, but is also excited he will be returning for another season. \u201cI\u2019m really excited that USC has him for another year,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cHonestly, I wish we had him for another two seasons, so he could be here through my senior year.\u201d\n```"}

The video came after his visit to Auschwitz, where he came face-to-face with the horrors of the Holocaust, which started his journey to combat global hate.\n\nDuring a discussion moderated by CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash, Schwarzenegger spoke about the importance of using his platform to speak about critical issues and how to encourage change. \u201cI always feel like when you\u2019re a celebrity, you have the responsibility to use your power of influence in the world,\u201d Schwarzenegger said. As a son of a Nazi soldier, he spoke about seeing the \u201ctremendous atrocities\u201d committed by his ancestors firsthand and how important it is to prevent them. \u201cI know that I\u2019m just one voice, maybe a strong voice, but a voice, and that we need a lot of people to come together,\u201d Schwarzenegger said.\n\nWhen it comes to reaching people and getting them to listen, Schwarzenegger goes on saying how people should communicate rather than attacking those on the other side. He explains how people can do this through conversation. \u201cAsk them to join us and get out of this mode of hate,\u201d Schwarzenegger said. \u201cExplain to them that hate in their hands never pays off and all of the various organizations and governments that were known for hate became losers.\u201d\n\nAnother member of the panel, Chuck Leek, a former extremist and now a member of Life After Hate, a nonprofit that helps guide individuals away from violent far-right groups, reflected on the state of denial that many people live in. Leek pointed out where hatred can be found \u2014 according to him, it comes from within. \u201cI think that we\u2019re missing each other\u2019s humanity,\u201d Leek said. \u201cWhen I was involved with these things, when I wanted to commit genocide, the person I really hated was me and I couldn\u2019t cope with that.\u201d\n\nWhen Leek left the white supremacist movement, there were no groups like Life After Hate to help him through the process of de-radicalization. He was on his own. His journey eventually led him to meet Frank Meenik, a cofounder of Life After Hate. Leek has been with the group since 2011. As an \u201cexit strategist,\u201d Leek helps individuals navigate leaving hate groups. \u201cI\u2019ve been where you are. You can get out of it,\u201d Leek said. \u201cYou can change your life and society will accept you and you will be able to find a purpose and have a constructive life.\u201d\n\nAnother tool mentioned in breaking the cycle of extremism is storytelling. In Schwarzenegger\u2019s September 2022 visit to Auschwitz, he stood alongside Simon Bergsun, a son of Auschwitz survivors, showing the world that within one generation, hatred can be shifted. Senior Rabbi Sharon Brous, founder of IKAR, a Jewish community seeking to revive Jewish life, spoke about the importance of changing the narrative. \u201cI think what you [Schwarzenegger] just described in your relationship with Simon,\u201d Brous said, \u201cthe two of you finding a way to weep together in Auschwitz and not hold shame, but instead hold the grace to know that together you could tell a different story, that\u2019s the kind of narrative that we need.\u201d\n\nBrous also explains how democratization can be a beacon of social change. \u201cIt allows all other voices to rise to the surface that might not have had room before,\u201d Brous said. But film director Jon Turteltaub, who attended the talk, explained his perspective on how democratization can be seen as a double-edged sword. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned with who is expressing and telling the story,\u201d Turteltaub said. He was worried about giving equal time to \u201cthe horrible people, too.\u201d\n\nSixteen-year-old Luba Alkhalii, founder of the non-profit Act for Change, walked away from the discussion with inspiration for her own work. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to look at the view from two different groups,\u201d Alkhalii said. \u201cIf we can come in and really bring out both sides right away, we can attack that issue right from the start.\u201d```"}

The annual event took place this morning on the South Lawn steps at City Hall, where the founder, Patty Giggans, spoke.\n\nPATTI GIGGANS: Denim Day is now in its 24th year and has become an international vehicle for promoting sexual violence prevention. Prevention. Education. Supporting survivors across the world.\n\nThe conference was followed by additional speakers and healing and art activities. Denim Day was first established in 1999 by Peace Over Violence, an organization dedicated to combating sexual, domestic and interpersonal violence. Following an Italian Supreme Court decision that overturned a rape conviction, the justices ruled that the 18 year old who was raped by her driving instructor must have implied consent because her jeans were too tight to be taken off if she was struggling. The verdict was met with protest from female Italian parliament employees and others around the world who recognized the court\u2019s decision as victim blaming.\n\nWhen the movement reached Los Angeles, Gibbons, the chief executive officer of Peace Over Violence, founded Denim Day, which takes place on the last Wednesday of every April, which is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Each year last year, USC Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment organized the student walkout in honor of the day. This Denim Day Sage is teaming up with USC Student Support Community to hold an event on campus at 6 p.m.. Participants will be able to create a piece of art out of denim squares that are painted with sentiments from students and survivors, according to Sage\u2019s Instagram.\n\nAccording to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, one in five women in the U.S. experience rape or attempted rape in their lives. Denim Day is a reminder of such discrepancies and works to bring an awareness, an end to sexual violence. City Councilwoman Katie Yaroslavsky is one of the organizers of Denim Day in Los Angeles and gave perspective on the touchy issue.\n\nKATY YAROSLAVSKY: Since I started speaking, another American has been sexually assaulted. Sexual violence is so insidious that one in four American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime.\n\nMonica Rodriguez is another organizer at the event. She tailored the issue towards a community that is often overlooked when it comes to sexual violence.\n\nMONICA RODRIGUEZ: Unhoused women here in Los Angeles, we see the very populations that we\u2019re working to address that are living unhoused on the streets, because women that have experienced these traumas often are unprepared to be able to sustain their lifestyle outside of those environments and likely end up homeless.\n\nThe group of organizers wanted to make sure that even though the subject of sexual assault could be considered distressing to some, that the event is a celebration of strong women who have overcome any past sexual traumas.

Belafonte died Tuesday of congestive heart failure at his New York home. He was 96. (AP Photo/Victoria Will, file)\n\nBy Gabriella Medina April 26, 2023 at 5:57 pm PDT\n\nYesterday, an iconic reggae artist and civil rights activist, Harry Belafonte, died at 96. A long time spokesman of Belafonte, Ken Sunshine, confirmed he died of congestive heart failure in his New York City home on Tuesday.\n\nBelafonte was a true cultural icon whose impact on both music and civil rights can still be felt today. Born in Harlem in 1927, Belafonte grew up in poverty and struggled to find his place in the world. He moved back and forth between New York and Jamaica throughout his childhood before dropping out of high school and joining the U.S. Navy during World War II.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until he discovered the world of theater that Belafonte found his calling. He quickly became a rising star, performing in plays both on and off Broadway. His performance in John Murray Anderson\u2019s Almanac earned him a Tony, making him one of the first Black performers to get the award. And unsurprisingly, he\u2019s part of the EGOT club.\n\nBeyond the stage, it was Belafonte\u2019s music that truly set him apart. Belafonte\u2019s signature blend of Calypso, folk and pop music made him a hit with audiences around the world. His breakout hit, \u201cThe Banana Boat Song\u201d became an international sensation and is still recognized as one of the most iconic songs of the 20th century.\n\nBut Belafonte\u2019s influence extended far beyond the music industry. A good friend of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, he was also a prominent figure in the civil rights movement, using his platform to speak out against racism and injustice. He helped organize the 1963 March on Washington and even bailed MLK out of prison from time to time.\n\nBelafonte\u2019s activism didn\u2019t end with the civil rights movement, either. He continued to use his voice and influence to advocate for social justice throughout his life, from speaking out against apartheid in South Africa to supporting the fight against climate change.\n\nBelafonte\u2019s impact on both music and civil rights is immeasurable, and his legacy will continue to inspire future generations. As we say goodbye to this cultural icon, let us remember the words he once spoke: \u201cWe have to educate ourselves in the struggles of history. We have to realize that nothing worth having comes easy.\u201d\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Gabriella Medina.\n```"}

The problem? Not everyone will be done with exams at that time, setting up some students for late fees and charges. Most students with exemptions staying past May 10 will pay an extra $75 a night. However, Trojans without pre-approval will face steeper costs of $200.\n\nThe April 21 deadline to obtain an exemption is long gone, putting students like Osagie Anetor, a sophomore studying public relations and history, into a \u201creally frustrating\u201d bind. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the last day to move out is also the same day that people are having their finals,\u201d Anetor said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t really work especially if you\u2019re not from this side of the country.\u201d\n\nOn May 10, Anetor has a final exam from 2-4 p.m. One hour later, USC expects him to be fully moved out. In a statement to Annenberg Media, Christopher Pongsiglione, director of USC Housing, said exemptions are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. \u201cSituations out of the students\u2019 control are considered for exemption from the charges,\u201d Ponsiglione said. \u201cSituations that are for convenience and within the residents\u2019 control are subject to the appropriate charge for late move out.\u201d\n\nUSC Housing added that students with late exams or travel troubles won\u2019t be charged for \u201creasonable extensions.\u201d However, the looming move out deadline has left residents juggling to figure everything out. \u201cI think the whole process was a little bit convoluted, they could have just given us until the end of the week to leave. I think that would have resolved a lot of these headaches,\u201d sophomore animation and digital arts major Matt Sorgie said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they give me like a three day grace period so I can pack my things?\u201d\n\nOn move out day, Sorgie will also be taking a final from 2-4 p.m. He lives across the country in Connecticut, so he filed for an extension. But he\u2019s not happy with the university\u2019s policy. \u201cTo be expected to just have all of our stuff ready to go the same exact day an hour after my final is done, I think it\u2019s a little disrespectful,\u201d Sorgie said. \u201cIt speaks to this running theme of USC just viewing their students as money makers rather than students.\u201d\n\nNina Moothedath, a sophomore studying journalism, understands the university\u2019s rules but described the deadline as \u201cinconsiderate.\u201d \u201cI looked at that timeframe and I was like \u2014 it\u2019s not happening,\u201d Moothedath said. Like other students, Moothedath has a May 10 final between 2-4 p.m. She scrambled for an extension and, luckily, won\u2019t have to pay. Moothedath said she was worried about putting a \u201cburden\u201d on her parents to take time off work and move her back home to the Bay Area. \u201cIt was stressful to know there was nothing I could do to make that better, it was in the hands of [the university],\u201d Moothedath said. \u201cIt should be a little bit more on them to make sure that it works out.\u201d\n\nExempted students living in university housing must move out by May 13.\n```"}

As part of the former actor\u2019s campaign to quote: \u201cTerminate Hate\u201d Schwarzenegger and other distinguished figures in the USC community joined in conversation on how to address extremism in our society. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, USC Annenberg Dean Willow Bay, Dr. Erroll Southers and Dr. Robert Williams were all featured during the two-hour lecture held in the Annenberg Auditorium. The panel discussed the rise of hate crimes and anti-Semitism, and the increasingly polarizing political climate in America, and potential solutions to these issues.\n\nIn his lecture, Schwarzenegger emphasized the importance of communication in healing conflict, and praised USC Annenberg for its achievements in the discipline. Schwarzenegger:   I think the issue that we are dealing with has to do with prejudice and hate. A lot of it has to do with communication. This is why this [Annenberg] is the appropriate center to have this event here today, and that\u2019s why I know that Willow [Bay], you will be important in the future because I told you already, communication is the number one issue here. This is the perfect center and you are the perfect team for that, so you are going to help in the future in stopping some of those problems.\n\nCombating racial and political prejudices has been an integral part of Schwarzenegger\u2019s platform, dating back to his time as governor of California to now, where he advocates to millions of fans and followers through social media and global summits. Last summer, Schwarzenegger received the Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation Award for Fighting Hatred for his advocacy against anti-Semitism.

I\u2019m your host, Nia Cross. New Genesis is an audio series about the black woman, reporter and executive experience. On today\u2019s episode, our creator and host, Nia Cross, reflects on her experience in Los Angeles, California this spring semester and the future of New Genesis.\n\nWhat do you think your superpower is?\nCROSS: I really think my superpower is the ability to connect with people of all different walks of life. I like to say that I\u2019m affable and that has been used to my advantage. A lot of people would say that I am a great networker. They\u2019re like, how do you know this person and that person? I enjoy connecting with people and hearing their stories. I feel like everybody has a story that\u2019s worth telling. And someone\u2019s story helps feed my soul as much as I may do the same for them.\n\nWrite your dream job description. If you could do the same thing that you did with your major as with your career and create something; what would it be?\nCROSS: I feel like for my career, a dream job would be me being an entrepreneur. I like to create my own things and like to have a little bit of say in what I do and flexibility. My job would also have to be a mix of speaking engagements, entertainment, and service.\n\nWhat were your biggest takeaways from the Duke in L.A. experience?\nCROSS: The biggest takeaways that I\u2019ve learned from my Duke in L.A. experience thus far has really been knowing who I am and standing on that. I remember when I saw this quote that said, I will keep my soul. And that really resonated with me with my experience in L.A., because I feel like there are so many lost souls and everybody is just trying to figure out their way. A lot of people have a very selfish mentality, just trying to be out here to pursue their goals and dreams. Not caring about how the next person is and how their day is going. And I\u2019ve seen so many people go, go, go and break down. So I feel like just being my authentic self and sticking to my morals and values has helped me during this journey.\n\nLastly, how do you plan to build from what you\u2019ve learned at USC Annenberg and continue New Genesis in the future?\nCROSS: Well, I plan to take it all with me. It\u2019s crazy. I obviously can\u2019t take all the people that I\u2019ve been able to work with and learn from through this time. But I feel like now I have the foundation and the blueprint. That\u2019s what Annenberg has really given me. The skills to be able to try something and not be afraid to fail. I started with just an idea in my head, and now it\u2019s come to so much more. It\u2019s honestly mind blowing to me because I didn\u2019t think it would go this far so soon. I plan to surround myself with good people when I get back to Duke, who are going to push me like I\u2019ve been pushed here. The radio coaches, my professor, and my peers have pushed me here. And, I don\u2019t know if I will still be in the niche of black women reporters and executives. I may go into different angles, but I know that the foundation is there and that storytelling is most definitely alive.\n\nThat\u2019s a wrap for our final episode of New Genesis at USC Annenberg. Thank you for tuning in and for all of your support. I appreciate you all. For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Nia Cross.\n```"}

USC golf has a secret behind Dedeaux Field\n\nBetween the baseball diamond and tennis courts is something that Trojans might not notice unless they\u2019re looking for it.\n\nBehind Dedeaux Field, between the USC tennis courts lies a lonely but well-maintained secret. (Photo by Philip Salata)\n\nBy Justin White\nApril 26, 2023 at 5:34 pm PDT\n\nAt the northwesternmost point of the USC campus, tucked neatly in between the tennis courts and Dedeaux Field, is a lonesome \u2014 but well-maintained \u2014 putting green, along with rough grass for chipping and a sand trap. On the fence nearby is a banner that reads \u201cUSC Women\u2019s Golf 2019 Pac-12 Champions.\u201d While the green is clearly meant for the golf squads to use for practice, there are no clubs nearby. No piercings from golf shoes on the grass. The green has no divots. The nearby bunker is free of any evidence of frustrated swings. The hole in the middle of the green, hath no golf balls.\n\nThe green is for both the women\u2019s and men\u2019s golf teams when they are not at a golf course. The putting green is exclusive to the two teams, and outside use is not permitted. Along with other athletic teams, the varsity golf teams practice underground in Heritage Hall. But the green rests there, only disturbed by the grunts of nearby tennis players and a gentle wind that passes through the wire fence.\n\nStudents who enjoy tennis at the nearby tennis courts also know of the golf hole. They also don\u2019t really know why it\u2019s there. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the chipping green behind the baseball field ... I would love to play on it,\u201d senior cognitive science and applied analytics major Malachi Andrew Frye said. \u201cI have to drive down to Maggie [Hathaway Golf Course] to play a really bad par-3 course. If I could get on that chipping green sometime it would save me a couple of drives.\u201d\n\nDespite the lack of equipment nearby, USC women\u2019s golf coach Justin Silverstein says that both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams do use it as a short game practice area, using it about once a week on Mondays. But Silverstein said he doesn\u2019t know why exactly the green was placed there. \u201cI don\u2019t know why that was the designated area for the short game facility,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cI assume it was the only open space they had at the time but I wasn\u2019t around SC when it was built, so I don\u2019t why exactly that was chosen.\u201d\n\nGolf information director Paul Goldberg said that the green was positioned there out of a lack of space to put it anywhere else. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a unique and unusual set up,\u201d Goldberg said over email. \u201cGot to get creative on an urban campus with limited space. It\u2019s been around, I\u2019d say, going on close to two decades at least.\u201d\n\nThrough the wire fence, the lonely golf hole rests unbothered. (Photo by Justin White)\n\nThe hole is especially interesting, considering rumors of an underground golf facility that the golf team now uses instead. Wait, an underground golf facility? Eighteen holes of perfectly maintained Bermuda grass underneath the concrete of the USC campus. Vast lakes, trees and countless sand pits that are sure to test and improve the skills of USC\u2019s golf stars. That kind of underground golf facility? Not quite.\n\nGoldberg said the underground facility is not a sprawling 18-hole golf paradise but instead is an area near the golf offices, where \u201cthey have a pair of golf simulators as well as a putting area and a team area.\u201d Goldberg added that it has been there since Heritage Hall finished its $35 million renovation in 2014.\n\n\u201cIt houses three offices, one for myself, one for J.T. Higgins, our men\u2019s coach, and then a shared office for our assistant coaches,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a big lounge area, almost like a living room for both teams. Huge sectional couch, study area, big huge TV, tables to eat at. It has a little kitchenette that our dietitian stocks with food and drinks for our kids.\u201d\n\nBut Silverstein is still describing the practice facility, and not a luxury underground doomsday bunker. \u201cThe main attraction there is we have three Foresight Golf simulators that are available for use and then we have a PuttView putting green, which is like a raised platform putting green that has a bunch of tech on it as well,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a simulator for putting. But the green can move and give you different putts and then there\u2019s a projector that shines down on it to tell you where the putt breaks.\u201d\n\nThe green can move? \u201cIt\u2019s crazy and it\u2019s really expensive, but it\u2019s pretty sweet,\u201d Silverstein said laughing. \u201cSweet\u201d does come at a high price. Not including the price of Heritage Hall\u2019s renovation, the Foresight Golf simulators cheapest option goes for about $5,000, while their aptly named \u201cAlbatross Package\u201d goes for about $34,000. USC golf has three of them, so the school could have spent anywhere from $15,000 to $102,000 on just the simulators. Meanwhile, the \u201cMoving Green\u201d on PuttView\u2019s website is listed at nearly $19,000.\n\nBack aboveground, Goldberg says the green is maintained by a greenskeeper hired by the university named Gary Crocker, who keeps it maintained with help from USC Facilities and has a background in golf course maintenance. Crocker is also the father of former USC All-American Sean Crocker, who now plays on the European Tour. Crocker said that he doesn\u2019t actually maintain the green, but rather oversees its maintenance and guides the grounds crew on how to maintain it. He said that he goes there at least once a week to make sure the green is in pristine condition.\n\n\u201cThe green is a mix of bent and poa annua turf,\u201d Crocker said. \u201cCool season grasses ... They can withstand the temperatures that we experience in SoCal. Places like Las Vegas and Arizona will grow Bermuda turf but overseed in their winters with a cool season-type grass. This is because Bermuda goes dormant when the temperature drops.\u201d\n\nBy going dormant, Crocker means that Bermuda grass goes brown but it does not die, saying it goes to sleep for the winter, \u201clike a bear.\u201d He also says that the baseball and football fields overseed their fields for the same reason. The process of overseeding involves mowing, fertilizing and then overseeding with a walk seeder, and made it clear that the green behind Dedeaux does not require this.\n\nOff-campus is where the golf teams train other areas of their game. Silverstein says they practice five days a week and the other four days not spent on campus are spent at golf courses around the Greater Los Angeles Area. \u201cRolling Hills Country Club in Palos Verdes is our home course. All of our kids are members there,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cWe use Palos Verdes Golf Course down there on the peninsula as well, and then Trump National Palos Verdes ... And then we have playing access at other courses around L.A.\u201d\n\nAll these accommodations that USC makes for its athletes shows that they are dedicated to their success, and Silverstein says the department plays a massive role in helping their athletes be the best they can. \u201cSimilar to our Olympic sports, I think it shows that USC makes the biggest commitment possible to provide our student-athletes with the best experience possible athletically and academically,\u201d Silverstein said.\n\nSophia Ketterer contributed to this story.\n```"}

So, for instance, if they need a loan for something, we loan the money, whatever it is that they need, we do it,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people that work here have never stopped working here. They work here until they die.\u201d\n\nLoyalty and dedication run through the veins of Greg Dovell, who has served generations of Canter customers, in his 37 years at the deli. \u201cThe best illustration I can think of is when I first started here, people were bringing in their kids who were literally sitting in highchairs,\u201d he said. \u201cNow those kids are bringing in their kids who are sitting in highchairs.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic posed a grave challenge for Canter\u2019s, whose traditional dining room experience was traded for take-out and delivery only. \u201cIt was very odd to come in because the fluorescent lights in the dining room were turned off and it was very eerie to walk in and see the place in darkness,\u201d Dovell said. \u201cUsually, it\u2019s such a beehive of activity \u2014 but we got through it.\u201d\n\nCanter\u2019s endurance goes back to core principles: feeding the hungry and selling high-quality food at low prices. \u201cI remember coming here when I was a kid, I used to work behind the cash register stamping parking tickets when I was two years old,\u201d Canter said. \u201cI remember my grandparents very well and they were very hard workers.\u201d\n\nEvery day, Canter\u2019s feeds homeless people and donates leftovers to shelters. \u201cI do this because that\u2019s what my grandparents did. They taught me to feed people who [cannot] feed themselves,\u201d Canter said. \u201cThey were here during the Depression and the stock market crash when everybody lost all their money, so they saw hard times.\u201d\n\nThe deli\u2019s storied run goes back to 1924 in Jersey City. Seven years later, Canter\u2019s followed Jewish migrants West and opened a store in Boyle Heights. In the next decade, Canter\u2019s, along with the area\u2019s Jewish population, landed a permanent home in Fairfax. \u201cMy grandfather bought the building that we\u2019re sitting in, which was Kohn\u2019s Deli, then he got a parking lot in the corner. And then he got the bar, which we call the kibbutz, from which a lot of people have been discovered,\u201d Canter said.\n\nCanter\u2019s is more than just a deli; it\u2019s a community hub. Over the years, it has become a gathering place for musicians, writers, and artists. The deli has hosted performances by The Doors, Joni Mitchell and Guns N\u2019 Roses. It\u2019s not uncommon to see someone typing away on a computer or chatting up another customer, soaking up the creative energy of the space. \u201cThis is a city where everything changes overnight,\u201d Dovell said. \u201cAnd we stay the same, and people like that \u2014 they appreciate that. It gives them more of a sense of permanence and sense of stability.\u201d\n\nThe first-class treatment customers receive goes beyond the deli\u2019s dining room. Jacqueline Canter has even checked up on a customer currently in the hospital. \u201cI\u2019ve visited him three times already. I want to make sure he gets better,\u201d Canter said.\n\nTaking care of employees, Canter said, also means holding them accountable. On her first day as manager, Canter fired a dishwasher for drinking beer. \u201cI was a very mild-mannered person when I got here. And now I\u2019d say, you become kind of a ballbuster. Because people will take advantage of you if you\u2019re not careful,\u201d Canter said.\n\nSlowly, but surely, Canter\u2019s welcomed back more customers and rehired most of its staff. In the summer of 2020, another challenge came knocking on the deli\u2019s front door. Protestors flooded Fairfax \u2014 outraged over the murder of George Floyd. \u201cWhen I say other businesses, I mean four doors up from Canter\u2019s \u2013\u2013 [were] being looted. The hair salon was being looted; Diamond was being looted. The whole neighborhood was being looted,\u201d Canter said. \u201cOne lady came in here and needed first aid [because] her eyes were burning. I basically had to become a nurse that day.\u201d\n\nTensions boiled over between protestors and police. However, Canter\u2019s found a way to keep the rioters at bay. \u201cI was on the news that day because everybody was afraid to go out of their house and I was out there in the middle of the street, giving out salami, cheese and water,\u201d Canter said. \u201cThe fact that we were here giving them food and water \u2014 they did not loot us.\u201d\n\nIf pandemic-forced closures and violent riots weren\u2019t enough, Canter\u2019s has grappled with another threat: growing antisemitism. Greater Los Angeles counties reported 182 acts of antisemitism in 2021, the Anti-Defamation League said, a 217% increase from 2017. The \u201chatred\u201d towards Jewish people, Canter said, has hit the deli close to home. About five years ago, a person painted an antisemitic trope on the murals right outside the restaurant. \u201cWhoever\u2019s antisemitic \u2014 they don\u2019t have to come here. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say. I don\u2019t want them here,\u201d Canter asserted. \u201cYou don\u2019t like Jewish people \u2014 don\u2019t come to Canter\u2019s, because we\u2019re Jewish.\u201d\n\nHer message has resonated with customers like Logan Barth, 19, who\u2019s been coming to Canters for eight years. \u201cGrowing up in Sacramento, I didn\u2019t really have a Jewish community, and simply walking into Canter\u2019s for the first time, I felt the Jewish community I didn\u2019t have growing up,\u201d Barth said. The food, Barth said, is one of the last reasons why he frequents the deli so much. \u201cI come for the community that it gives me, simply being in the Fairfax District and being around people that are like me and have the same culture as me is just really special.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanter\u2019s truly is a staple of this community,\u201d Barth said.\n\nLooking ahead, Canter said she\u2019s determined to keep the deli\u2019s legacy alive. \u201cI think [my grandpa] would be very proud of myself for working seven days a week like he did and carrying on his legacy and his recipes,\u201d Canter said. \u201cYou can\u2019t control anything, but if I have it my way, it\u2019ll go on for another hundred years.\u201d\n\nIn 100 years though, the deli will need new leadership \u2014 a decision, Canter said, is \u201cto be determined.\u201d The 62-year-old co-owner and her brother, Marc, each have two kids. None have stepped up to the plate, yet. But right now, it\u2019s the hospitality, Canter said, that keeps regulars wanting more. \u201cWe provide a very unique thing with a lot of other delis going out of business,\u201d Canter said. \u201cCanter\u2019s is never, ever going to disappear. My brother and I work seven days a week. We have withstood riots. We have withstood earthquakes. And we will be here another 100 years.\u201d```"}

(Photo courtesy of Yennifer Fang)\n\nBy Kiara Timo April 26, 2023 at 3:01 pm PDT\n\nEntering the room in black heels, a fashionable dress and a large statement hat, Yennefer Fang struts across the grounds of the Cinematic Arts Building ready to discuss her newest film, \u201cMy Little Grandma.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came from a small town to Beijing, then to Indiana \u2014 Purdue University ... I feel like it\u2019s a very interesting journey because I came from such a small place, to the capital of China, Beijing, then I experience a new culture in Indiana and then finally end up here in the most diverse, biggest city in California.\u201d\n\nYennefer Fang is a storyteller. She weaves through her history and journey to USC.\n\n\u201cI feel like USC is very different,\u201d Fang said. \u201cIt\u2019s located in L.A., which is the capital of film. It has all the connections to the industry, and I really appreciate the diversity in USC.\u201d\n\nOn May 6, Fang and her classmates will showcase 15 five-minute films they worked on at the Norris Theatre this spring. Fang\u2019s film, \u201cMy Little Grandma\u201d was inspired by her relationship with her grandmother and Fang\u2019s experiences as a trans woman. The film makes the audience question what unconditional love really is.\n\n\u201cThis story is about international family. This grandmother immigrated to the U.S. very early, so she basically spent her entire life here and her family has all passed away, including her son and her daughter-in-law,\u201d Fang said. \u201cThis boy is all she has. And now her grandson is telling her, I want to be a girl. That\u2019s my story, basically.\u201d\n\nSusan Arnold, the producing professor for the film and the vice chair of Film and Television Production at USC, spoke about the significance of Fang\u2019s film.\n\n\u201cShe said she wanted to make a film about love, family and cultural difference, which I think she really succeeded in,\u201d Arnold said.\n\nFor Fang, cultural differences are a tool in her arsenal as she continues to work on becoming her best self.\n\n\u201cI think I see a lot of things very differently than normal people. I think a lot of people think it\u2019s impossible, like when my classmates say, \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t do this,\u2019 I think, \u2018If I can change my fucking sex, what else can I do? What can\u2019t I do?\u2019\u201d Fang said. \u201cI already made an impossible thing possible. I can make everything possible.\u201d\n\nWhile writing and producing her film, Fang was also dealing with a painful new normal here in the U.S. with the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes. The Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Crime Data Explorer report shows that there has been a significant increase in anti-Asian hate crimes between 2019 and the most recent report in 2021.\n\nUnable to keep her thoughts off of this new reality, Fang discussed how being near this wave of hate crimes has affected her and influenced her filmmaking process.\n\n\u201cThe increasing number of attack[s] and also the hatred towards [the] transgender and Asian communities came from the media. I feel like over the past few years\u2013with the influence of COVID, it added on to the hatred,\u201d Fang said.\n\nAs a filmmaker, Fang is most inspired by the circumstances surrounding her. Likewise, \u201cMy Little Grandma\u201d is inspired by her personal experiences.\n\nAfter finishing the post-production of her film and beginning to brainstorm her next project, she discussed the importance of representation.\n\n\u201cI feel like for the Asian hatred ... we\u2019re just people \u2014 people who live here. We are all the same. Once you realize this \u2014 you realize that we are all human beings living on the earth, living in this country \u2014 there\u2019s nothing different between you and me.\u201d Fang said.\n\nFang is dedicated to using her films to inspire a more positive future while acknowledging the complexities of existing in a world where cultural, religious, racial and societal expectations may cause internal conflict.\n\nHer excitement to learn and grow as a student and study all aspects of the human existence has impressed her professors, including the directing professor of \u201cMy Little Grandma,\u201d Jose Angel Santana, who called Fang a \u201cdelight\u201d to work with.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working with Yennefer throughout the spring semester, and she\u2019s a very smart, capable, and fearless filmmaker and collaborator,\u201d Santana said. \u201cShe\u2019s always asking questions about my approach to directing.\u201d\n\nArnold agrees. While watching Fang interact with her fellow students and pursue this heavy topic for her film, Arnold witnessed Fang embrace her own experience while pairing it with an uplifting message,\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very comfortable in her skin,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cShe made her movie about what it felt like to be transgender and have an Asian grandmother. I think it\u2019s very important to her that she speaks honestly and passionately about what she believes.\u201d\n\nDuring a follow-up interview, Fang appeared more relaxed as she sat down to discuss parts of her personality that she had not divulged before, showing of her sense of humor while engaging with students who passed through the halls.\n\nInspired by her surroundings, Fang\u2019s eyes brighten as she discusses her familial roots and her ancestral connection to the Qing Dynasty, her passion for Asian culture, her knowledge of the history of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander explorers, learning about different cultural and religious practices, and most of all, her love for voodoo.\n\nThe energy she brings to every interaction is the same energy she carries throughout the day.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a very cool woman\u201d, said Anlan Tao, Fang\u2019s classmate and friend. \u201cShe\u2019s very interesting to work with. I feel like the two of us talked a lot about our personal stories before we came to the U.S. We share a common emotional journey.\u201d\n\nAs she reaches the end of her first year at USC, Fang is excited to look ahead and see what inspires her next, but for now, Fang excitedly awaits the premiere of her film, \u201cMy Little Grandma.\u201d\n\nFang\u2019s film, \u201cMy Little Grandma,\u201d will premiere in the CTPR 546 Screening on May 6 at 7 p.m. at the Norris Theater.

{"key": "/2023/04/26/analyzing-californias-push-for-electric-vehicles/", "response": "```\nAnalyzing California\u2019s push for electric vehicles\n\n\u201cElectric cars are not as sustainable as they are made out to appear.\u201d\n\nA motorist charges his electric vehicle at a Tesla Supercharger station in Detroit, Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2022. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File)\n\nBy Elizabeth Folkin April 26, 2023 at 2:09 pm PDT\n\n\u201cOh my god, look! Another Tesla?!\u201d Whenever I have out-of-state guests, the number of electric cars in California often impresses them. As a proud Californian and avid car enthusiast, I love discussing cars, going to car-related events and appreciating unique vehicles. My parents even threw me a surprise birthday party at the Marconi Automotive Museum. So, naturally, I decided to analyze the situation with electric vehicles in my state, which has recently been placed into focus by several proposed legislative measures. This topic allows me to combine my enthusiasm for cars with another issue that I am invested in, sustainability.\n\nThe state of California is on the road to passing legislation mandating electric cars and it has stirred controversy among many citizens, not just car enthusiasts. A key point in this discussion is that electric cars are not as sustainable as they are made out to appear. There is no real urgency for drivers to make the switch from a gas-powered car to an electric vehicle, yet some politicians may be promoting these cars for unnecessary and false reasons as California is faced with an important choice regarding electric vehicles. Are they indeed an answer to our sustainable future? If so, then how close are modern electric cars to these ideal futuristic vehicles? Do their creators earnestly work with the state legislators to promote environmental ethics, or do their lobbying efforts create smoke and mirrors in order to hide real problems?\n\nHaving only recently become a staple on our roads, electric vehicles nonetheless have a long history. Invented in the late 1800s, they quickly became all the rage. Initially, electric cars gained popularity because they did not have many issues associated with steam or gasoline-powered engines. They were perfect for short trips around the city, and, as more people gained access to electricity in the early 20th century, it became easier to charge electric cars. However, the drop in popularity of electric vehicles was swifter than their rise, the reasons being mainly financial. By 1912, the cost of a gasoline car was almost three times less than that of an electric car. Later that year, Charles Kettering\u2019s electric starter eliminated the need for the hand crank, leading to even greater sales of gasoline-powered vehicles. When crude oil was discovered in Texas, the prices of gasoline decreased and gas stations began popping up across the country. Cheap gas and more affordable gasoline-powered automobiles spelled a disaster for the electric vehicle market \u2014 as well as for the ecology of the planet, although that \u201cside effect\u201d was hardly recognized back then. In the end, electric cars virtually disappeared by 1935, and their gasoline-powered competitors came to dominate the market.\n\nIt is fairly obvious that neither branch of the automobile industry \u2014 nor the consumers \u2014 were concerned with sustainability issues back in the day and neither can claim to have a spotless, eco-friendly, reputation. With rising concern for climate change in recent decades, electric vehicles have once again gained popularity, being presented as champions of sustainability. However, it\u2019s important to emphasize that, historically, electric vehicles have not been eco-friendly and this \u201cpass\u201d they have been given is based on an assumption, not fact.\n\nElectric cars made a major comeback in the early 2000s with the founding of Tesla, which quickly became a leading EV manufacturer. As of August 2022, the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y were the best-selling vehicles in California, according to Reuters. Perhaps one of the reasons why Teslas are so prevalent in \u201cThe Golden State\u201d is because the company was started here, in Silicon Valley. This \u201csupport your local business\u201d mentality has been intertwined with an apparent fascination with a cool product as well as the idea of pushing the sustainability envelope even further, an idea dear to the hearts of many Californians.\n\nThough I admire and support my state\u2019s continuing efforts of ecological preservation, I would like to take a closer look at electric vehicles through the prism of sustainability. William Throop, a specialist in environmental ethics and theories of sustainability and resilience, argues that our society is too focused on promoting the wrong virtues: abundance, control, conviction, competition and individualism. In his publication, \u201cFlourishing in the Age of Climate Change: Finding the Heart of Sustainability,\u201d Throop advocates for a shift away from these virtues and towards adopting the following principles: frugality, ability to adapt, humility, collaboration and system-building.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see Tesla cars as symbols of frugality or humility. According to Kristina Zucchi, an investment analyst and financial writer, owning a Tesla allows the consumer to associate with a \u201cperceived elite status.\u201d In fact, Tesla\u2019s own marketing plan states that the company targets wealthy individuals who currently drive gas-powered luxury cars. Giving credit where credit is due, Tesla\u2019s ability to position its brand is its strongest forte \u2014 but there, too, lies a concern for sustainability. Tesla is continuously updating their vehicle lineup, reconfiguring prices and features several times a year. In addition, Tesla already has the highest brand loyalty out of any automobile brand \u2014 64% of owners say they would buy a Tesla again. Tesla is feeding into the problem of \u201ccar obsession\u201d and the idea of buying the new shiny thing.\n\nIt\u2019s rather apparent that Tesla\u2019s marketing strategy is not contributing to the environmental sustainability movement. In fact, to a certain extent, sustainability of electric vehicles is a Potemkin village, a fa\u00e7ade meant to hide some serious problems. Advocates of the electric vehicle industry insist that electric vehicles are good for the environment since carbon dioxide emissions are largely responsible for the looming threat of global warming, and electric vehicles supposedly help reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nIn counterargument, Troy R. Hawkins, a senior scientist and group manager of the Fuel and Products Group, along with a group of researchers, published an analysis piece entitled \u201cComparative Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Conventional and Electric Vehicles.\u201d According to this analysis, the supposed advantages of electric vehicles regarding low CO2 emissions are overstated. \u201cWhen a new electric vehicle appears in the showroom, it has already caused 30,000 pounds of carbon-dioxide emission,\u201d the report reads. \u201cThe equivalent amount for manufacturing a conventional [gas-powered] car is 14,000 pounds.\u201d\n\nIt is evident that the emissions for the production of electric vehicles compare quite unfavorably with regard to the emissions that come from producing gas-powered cars. Because the impact of production is more significant for electric cars than gas-powered vehicles, Hawthorne\u2019s paper also compares vehicle lifetime emissions. About 50% of the lifetime CO2 emissions for an electric car are from the production process, especially in the mining and processing of raw materials for the battery, he found. Only 17% of a gas-powered car\u2019s lifetime CO2 emissions are accounted for by the manufacturer of that car.\n\nBjorn Lomborg, a visiting fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution and a best-selling author, criticizes electric cars by stating, \u201cThey still recharge using electricity overwhelmingly produced with fossil fuels.\u201d Due to the way our grids are powered, data shows that for every mile driven, the average electric car indirectly emits about six ounces of carbon dioxide. Although it is still a lot better than a gasoline-powered vehicle (which emits about 12 ounces per mile), the production of one electric car results in the equivalent of 80,000 miles of travel in the vehicle.\n\nIn addition, the batteries in electric cars fade over time. Data shows that Tesla battery depreciation begins after only 50,000 miles on the vehicle. In stark contrast, most gas-powered cars start showing issues around the 100,000-mile mark. So, unless that electric car is driven a lot in a short amount of time, it will never get ahead environmentally which disproves the argument that electric cars are better for the environment.\n\nOne of the biggest environmental dangers associated with electric cars lies in the lithium mining business that is still largely unsustainable and dirty. Making the lithium-extraction process cleaner is an urgent goal that the industry needs to achieve. Teague Egan, the CEO of Energy Exploration Technologies (EnergyX) who has over fifty patents for lithium-mining technologies, promises sustainable lithium mining in the foreseeable future. According to him, the LiTAS technology, developed by EnergyX is \u201c[c]apable of recovering 90% of a salt brine\u2019s lithium deposits in a matter of days while not needing any freshwater. For comparison\u2019s sake, current extraction methods take 18 months to retrieve 30% of a brine\u2019s lithium while expending 18,000 gallons of water per ton.\u201d\n\nIt is crucial that we do not blindly commit to promoting electric cars without accountability on the part of the industry currently employing unsustainable processes. Using the best elements of both electric and gas-powered vehicles, hybrid cars seem to offer a pathway forward. Having a smaller battery, hybrid vehicles do not rely on the lithium-mining industry as heavily as their electric counterparts. In addition, hybrid cars maximize fuel efficiency, thus producing substantially lower emissions than regular gas-powered automobiles do.\n\nMoreover, if somebody already has a functioning gas-powered vehicle, then there really is no need to purchase an electric car and contribute to the CO2 emissions created in the production process. This push comes from both the electric automobile industry\u2019s powerful lobby and from the state itself. Contributing significantly to the popularity of electric vehicles, California offers incentives to people who buy them. For example, the California Air Resources Board offers rebates for the purchase or lease of a new all-electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle through the Clean Fuel Reward Program. In addition, Clean Air Vehicles are allowed to use the HOV, or carpool, lane even if there is only one person in the car.\n\nIt is unsurprising that electric cars are a common presence in \u201cThe Golden State\u201d \u2014 but do they need to become the only presence in California? When Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk declares that \u201c[w]e will not stop until every car on the road is electric,\u201d it sounds more than just a competitive slogan \u2014 it dangerously resembles a monopolistic ambition. Passed in August 2022, the Light-Duty Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Sales Requirement states that \u201c[a]ll sales of new light-duty passenger vehicles in California must be ZEVs or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) by 2035.\u201d On the other hand, Proposition 30, which would impose a tax to support the purchase of electric vehicles, was overturned during the recent election \u2014 and so, the debate continues.\n\nModern vehicles are not ideal yet, but with commitment, transparency and accountability they might fulfill their potential. Hope lies in the continuous technological developments of sustainable lithium mining and in the spread of awareness on the topic. More time is needed to develop these technologies, though, making California\u2019s adoption of subsidies irresponsible. Perhaps, both the industry and the lawmakers should be listening to Throop and promote collaboration through hybrid vehicles instead of fueling competition. As a result, a more sustainable outcome will benefit us all.\n```"}

Only a select few players, however, from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are invited to the party. Thanks in part to the efforts of former NFL quarterbacks Doug Williams and James Harris, talented HBCU players are getting some extra exposure.\n\nThis past February, the two legends held the second annual HBCU Legacy Bowl at Tulane\u2019s Yulman Stadium, featuring top players from the SWAC, SIAC, MEAC and CIAA conferences. The Legacy Bowl is an immersive opportunity for eligible NFL Draft prospects from HBCUs all over to showcase their talent on a major platform. NFL scouts from all 32 teams traveled to explore top athletes. Players live out their dreams of making an NFL team.\n\nJust last year, four HBCU football players were drafted after their performances at the Legacy Bowl. These players hope to join the long legacy of former HBCU players such as Jerry Rice, Mel Blount, Walter Payton, Steve McNair and Willie Lanier, just to name a few, who made it to the NFL.\n\nWilliams, who was coached by the legendary Eddie Robinson at Grambling State University and was the first Black quarterback to win a Super Bowl when he played for Washington, believes that it really doesn\u2019t matter where you go to school if you have the talent to be successful. \u201cYou can get there from here, and when I say from here, I\u2019m talking about HBCUs,\u201d Williams said.\n\nDouglas McNeil III, wide receivers coach at Bowie State University, noted that, \u201cEvents like this will shed light on a lot of talented guys ... having league coaches and league staff is giving guys the experience to also let them know they have the confidence and they have the skill set to be able to perform at the next level.\u201d\n\nAt the Legacy Bowl, players have the chance to exhibit their skills on the field but also hope to impress scouts off the field. Keenan Isaac, a defensive back for Alabama State University, took advantage of the media coverage. \u201cAnother opportunity, so many cameras out here, everybody\u2019s watching, and the game is going to be on NFL Network,\u201d Issac said. \u201cSo that\u2019s definitely another opportunity for us to showcase our skills on a huge platform.\u201d\n\nNFL Network sideline reporter Sherree Burruss says, \u201cOne of the more important parts is the interview. These guys get to talk to the scouts, tell them who they are, what they represent, and show them their character just not on the field but off.\u201d\n\nLack of media coverage makes it difficult to gain exposure from mainstream networks. HBCUs have proven they\u2019ve always had the talent \u2014 they just need the chance to be seen.\n\nIn New Orleans, no one stood out more than Florida A&M wide receiver Xavier Smith, who won the Offensive Player of the Game award and is considered the top draft prospect out of HBCUs. From the start of the week, much of the buzz was about Smith who proved he\u2019s the real deal running the 40-yard dash in 4.4 seconds.\n\nRegarding his Offensive MVP award, Smith shared, \u201cIt just means a lot, just showing that my hard work paid off and you know, I work really hard, the guys behind me, I couldn\u2019t have done this without them so I just want to thank each and every of my teammates for helping me win this award.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s success at the Legacy Bowl clearly means a lot to his Florida A&M community. \u201cWe all know back in Tallahassee that this is nothing new to Zay Smith,\u201d teammate Chris Faddoul said. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing this ever since he\u2019s been at FAMU. ... It\u2019s nothing new for me to see and I\u2019m just really excited that other people also get to see what I\u2019ve been experiencing for the last five years. [He\u2019s a ] great guy.\u201d\n\nGoing into the NFL Draft, this year taking place in Kansas City, Missouri, from April 27 to April 29, Smith is projected to be taken in a later round. He has created buzz around his name but not enough to be an early target. If he doesn\u2019t happen to go off the board on draft night, it\u2019s very likely he will be a priority free agent with a chance to compete for a roster spot.\n\nOther impressive players included the Southern University duo of Jason Dumas and Cameron Peterson who left no questions regarding if there are defensive talents in HBCUs. Dumas finished the game with a game-leading three sacks and Defensive MVP hardware to take home while Peterson further contributed with six tackles, three of which were for a loss, and 1.5 sacks. He also forced a fumble and broke up a pass.\n\n\u201cThis is a tremendous feeling man. Last college game I get to go out on top ... I can\u2019t even describe it right now,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThis was a great way to close out my college career [and I am] just looking forward to the things coming ahead. ... It\u2019s extremely humbling to know that even though there\u2019s different circumstances everybody goes through, there\u2019s so many people who made it before us. It\u2019s inspiring.\u201d\n\nWhile Dumas\u2019 size of just under 5 foot 10 may be of concern to NFL scouts, his ability to make an impact on the field definitely won\u2019t be. Despite not walking away with a win, Bowie State defensive tackle Joshua Pryor is also likely to be on the radar of NFL scouts. Last season\u2019s CIAA Defensive Player of the Year had an impressive combine and helped his team with seven tackles, three of which were for a loss, and two sacks.\n\nPryor recognized the value of the event. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a blessing,\u201d Pryor said. \u201cI just want to give thanks to guys like Doug Williams and Shack Harris for even putting this together for us today. They crawled so we could walk so I definitely am appreciative of that.\u201d\n\nBroadcasted by the NFL Network, the HBCU Legacy Bowl offers an opportunity for HBCU football players to showcase their talent.\n\nRegarding the potential of spring professional football opportunities for HBCU talent, Williams, who played for two years in the USFL before he won the Super Bowl he is known for today, said, \u201cThey\u2019ve got three opportunities to land with somebody and this game and the combine give these guys an opportunity. The other day the USFL had their draft and ten players from Historically Black Colleges were drafted. Nine of those guys are playing in this game, which makes me feel good. I think we\u2019re doing what should be done, we got to do more, but they got to [use] this as a situation not only for the guys that are here, but they have to go back to their school and tell those guys what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nAlthough a few of his players made the trip to New Orleans, Deion Sanders was noticeably missing from the week\u2019s activities. Sanders, the man many credit with bringing more recognition to HBCU football in his two years as head coach of the Jackson State Jaguars, is now the head coach at Colorado. At JSU he led the team to two consecutive Celebration Bowl appearances, coached the team to their first undefeated regular season (11 wins) in JSU\u2019s football history and signed one of the country\u2019s top players in Travis Hunter.\n\nSanders showed the importance of how coverage can lead to opportunity. \u201cOne word ... Notoriety. That\u2019s what he did for HBCUs,\u201d Henry Miller, Southern University defensive coordinator said. \u201cHe gave us a stage and that\u2019s what we want. We just want the stage and we will do the rest.\u201d\n\nMedia coverage for HBCU football is slowly progressing but is still limited in comparison to PWI football. Increasing media opportunities help spread the awareness of talent at HBCUs. \u201cContent is king ... Everyone should have some form of representation of media from each university,\u201d Ken Clark of KC 1440 media for Jackson State said. \u201c... We got to make sure we make our guys visible.\u201d\n\nFans watch the Alabama State University Marching Hornets with their phones recording during halftime of the Legacy Bowl.\n\nReflecting on the significance of this game, players remembered that \u201cit\u2019s just football.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a doorway to the next level,\u201d E.J. Hicks, a wide receiver for North Carolina Central, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big opportunity. You have to seize the moment.\u201d\n\nSanders impacted not just JSU, but all HBCU football programs as a whole.  Damarcus Miller, Southern University\u2019s defensive line coach, said, \u201cThe attention he brought, the exposure he brought was priceless.\u201d\n\nThe Legacy Bowl sheds light on hidden gems that can be found at HBCUs.  Players at HBCUs deserve the exposure and opportunity to take their talents to the next level.  Ronnie Thomas, a linebacker for Mississippi Valley State University said, \u201cNot every school in the HBCU world gets national television broadcasts ... I think this will help us in the draft process and getting our names out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to keep that pipeline from HBCU to the NFL ... The HBCU Legacy Bowl is what we make it be,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe hope it continues to grow to the next level because our players deserve that same attention as some of the larger schools.\u201d\n\nClark also spoke on the impact Sanders had in changing the game for HBCU football. \u201cWhen he was at Jackson State he gave us a lot of new eyes,\u201d Clark said.\n\nEven though Sanders has moved on, his players are grateful for the lessons learned on and off the field. \u201c[New head] coach T.C. [Taylor] is doing a marvelous job of helping continue what Coach Prime left for him,\u201d Jackson State cornerback De\u2019Jahn Warren said. \u201cHe\u2019s taking everything that he learned from Coach Prime and he\u2019s using it in his own coaching way.\u201d\n\nDue to a disparate amount of resources and media coverage between PWIs and HBCUs, events like the Legacy Bowl are currently necessary, and even if the playing field is one day more even,  coaches, players and supporters of HBCU football hope the game continues for years and years to come . The culture at HBCUs have lacked the proper attention and acknowledgment.\n\nFormer NFL player Greg Coleman said, \u201cAll these kids need is an opportunity ... so we presented the Greg Coleman Golden Touch Award to encourage, expos, and provide opportunity ... because there\u2019s great talent at HBCUs.\u201d\n\nA father and a young fan look on as the next generation of HBCU talent prove their abilities on the field.\n\nTyler King of Edward Waters College said he\u2019s developed lifelong bonds. \u201cI definitely got a great relationship with a lot of these guys,\u201d King said. \u201cRespect goes a long way ... We all respect each other and we all want to see each other win and grow. ... We ain\u2019t just playing this game just to get to know each other for this week. This is a lifetime thing, and that\u2019s the greatest thing about it, it\u2019s priceless.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to what they\u2019ll take away from the week, the experience of coming together as teammates stands out greatly.  Sometimes, however, dreams get deferred. Not all of these players will hear their names called on April 27 and the ensuing days. For those players, the Legacy Bowl has added a career fair that includes many NFL teams and corporate companies.\n\nWith the help of the career fair, many of the HBCU Legacy Bowl players have already given thought to life after football. Jeremiah Holloman of Tennessee State shared his interest in computer technology as well as coaching while Ronnie Thomas discussed his desire to continue to be a part of HBCU athletics.\n\n\u201cI would like to be an athletic director at an HBCU,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThat\u2019s always been my dream because it starts at the top so that\u2019s always been the backup plan in case football doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nBoth CJ Bolar of Alcorn State University and Faddoul mentioned their interests in working in the healthcare field. \u201cI like working around children,\u201d Bolar said. \u201cMental health is also a big thing for me, so anything in those fields, those would probably be the best [for me].\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a biology background and right now I\u2019m currently working for a compounding pharmacy [on the] pharmaceutical sales side of things,\u201d Faddoul said. \u201c... I also have a little interest in commercial real estate so if all doesn\u2019t go well I think I\u2019m in good hands.\u201d\n\nWhile the NFL is the highest level to play professional football,  there are other professional options for players to continue to play the game they love, make money and prove themselves against worthy competitors .\n\nNFL Hall of Famer Mel Blount, a member of the Board of Trustees for the Black College Football Hall of Fame, had some advice for all the players. \u201cPursue your dreams, don\u2019t ever give up on them,\u201d Blount said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what this life is all about. You got to have dreams, you got to pursue them and when you fall down you got to get up.\u201d\n\nFormer NFL player Harold Jackson added, \u201cJames Harris and Doug Williams have done a heck of a job with this program ... I\u2019m going to be right here supporting them because this is what these young kids need.\u201d\n\nUplifting HBCU football excellence and creating professional opportunities are key factors of the Legacy Bowl. \u201cWhen you got an opportunity to uplift HBCU, all I\u2019m going to say, please do that,\u201d Williams said.\n```"}

The Apple TV+ series was adapted from Laura Dave\u2019s best-selling novel. Dave and Garner were featured in a conversation with L.A. Times television critic Lorraine Ali on the show\u2019s creation.\n\nGarner and Dave shared the challenges of adapting the book into a TV series, working and creating together and the process of writing the novel. Garner and Dave were challenged to describe the plot in two sentences during the conversation. \u201cWoman and her grumpy stepdaughter are faced with the heartbreak of a missing husband/father,\u201d Garner said. \u201cWho leaves in his wake only a mysterious note, \u2018protect her,\u2019 and no other instructions, and he is gone,\u201d Dave finished.\n\nDave was inspired by the Enron scandal and based on the reason for Hannah\u2019s husbands\u2019 disappearance off it. Garner described her love for the book and when the spot to play the lead role of Hannah opened up, her immediate action of emailing the heads of Apple TV+ to express her admiration for the story and desire for the role.\n\nFrom left to right, L.A.

She even recounts how she \u201cwent back to the book over and over and over again,\u201d as she filmed scenes and discovered her character. Being a fan of the book before landing the job, Garner said she felt joy from \u201cgetting to play out words that I was so enraptured with.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about her writing process, Dave described the 10-year journey she embarked on to create \u2018The Last Thing He Told Me.\u2019 She explained how she begins every project, book or chapter with a question. \u201cI started this book with the question of, \u2018Can we ever know the people we love?\u2019\u201d Dave said.\n\nDave also shared that she never knows where her books are heading, aside from the next 10 pages. \u201cI\u2019m surprised as I am going,\u201d Dave said. \u201cIf I outlined and I sort of knew the secret, I wouldn\u2019t be interested every day to sit down and keep going.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the main character of her book, Hannah, Dave described how she wanted to \u201clook at a woman who believes something but was not the victim of that belief, but rather the hero of that belief.\u201d Garner and Dave discussed the joys of working together and with other female storytellers in the industry to create the series.\n\n\u201cHannah was always going to be the hero of her life and we wanted a female gaze into that,\u201d Dave said. After a few questions from the audience and advice for aspiring writers and actors, Dave made an exciting announcement. \u201cI\u2019m working slowly on a sequel.\u201d\n\nBoth women were exuding pride and passion during the conversation as the project they had worked hard on was coming to fruition.

(Photo by Bryson Nihipali)\n\nBy Thomas Johnson\nApril 25, 2023 at 11:08 pm PDT\n\nIt was Stankiewicz vs. Stankiewicz Tuesday night at Dedeaux Field. Andy Stankiewicz, the head coach for USC, got the chance to exchange lineup cards with his son Dane, a volunteer assistant coach for UC San Diego. It was the more senior Stankiewicz who came away with the win, as the Trojans toppled the Tritons 4-3.\n\n\u201cThat was fun. That was cool by [UCSD head coach Eric] Newman to have Dane bring out the card and me go out there and share that moment with my son,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cSo that was cool to exchange cards with him for sure.\u201d\n\nBut the pleasantries were soon over for the father-son duo as the Trojans quickly shot out of the gate. Senior third baseman Johnny Olmstead, USC\u2019s cleanup hitter, came up to the plate in the bottom of the first inning with two runners on and hit a two-run single to kickstart the Trojan offense. Senior designated hitter Nick Lopez came up to the plate two batters later and knocked in Olmstead, who was standing on second base after advancing on a wild pitch, to give the Trojans a 3-0 lead.\n\nThe offense then came to a grinding halt, only amassing four hits and one run for the rest of the game. That was all the Trojans needed though, as the USC relieving corps pitched 4.2 innings without giving up an earned run. This was only the second time in the last nine games that every USC relief pitcher was clean in the earned run column.\n\n\u201cEveryone thought we were gonna put up more [runs] than we did after that first inning,\u201d redshirt senior pitcher Garrett Clarke said. \u201cThe \u2018pen did a great job of holding it down and picking up the offense tonight.\u201d\n\nSophomore pitcher Fisher Johnson was the first to come out of the bullpen for the Trojans, entering during the top of the fifth inning to pitch with the bases loaded and only one out. Johnson was able to strike out the first batter he faced, then forced a flyout to strand all three runners and keep the score at 4-2.\n\n\u201cTonight was about our relieving core, they all did a great job,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cFisher Johnson came in a big situation, got a strikeout and got us out of a jam ... We got to find wins when we\u2019re not really on it. And we weren\u2019t really on it here tonight offensively, but we\u2019re going to take it for sure.\u201d\n\nEven though seniors like Clarke, Lopez and Olmstead did much of the damage for the Trojans, five different true or redshirt freshmen were in the starting lineup and produced for USC. Freshman outfielder Austin Overn and redshirt freshman infielder Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek scored on Olmstead\u2019s RBI single.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really look at anybody on our roster as freshmen, and if we feel like they\u2019re ready to play, they\u2019re ready to play,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cI think those guys have worked hard, and they put themselves in a position to get on the field on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nUSC will likely lose many of its 12 seniors and redshirt seniors for next season, but the Trojans have multiple young players already producing at a high level. Overn leads the nation in triples, while Martin-Grudzielanek is tied for third for the team lead in doubles. The combination of veteran and freshman production helped the Trojans win their fourth straight midweek game.\n\nDespite starting the season 0-3 in midweek games, USC has now gotten into a rhythm, going 6-1 since.\n\n\u201cSometimes we get caught up in the opponent, and we just gotta play the game,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cThat\u2019s been the message on our midweeks is don\u2019t necessarily worry about the opponent, but just play good, fundamental baseball. And if we do that on a night-in, night-out basis, I feel like we\u2019re going to be in a good spot.\u201d\n\nThis win marks the 25th win of the season for USC, matching its win total from last year with 16 games still left on the regular-season schedule. The Trojans will have a break from midweek games as they travel up to Seattle to take on the Washington Huskies this weekend, looking to improve on their 11-7 conference record.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/04/25/class-of-2023-gets-ready-to-say-goodbye/", "response": "```\nUSC Class of 2023 gets ready to say goodbye\n\nSeniors share their favorite moments, challenges from their time at USC.\n\nBy Jack Waterman April 25, 2023 at 10:56 pm PDT\n\nWith the academic year coming to an end, USC prepares to say farewell to its newest graduating class. However, before they become alumni of the university, we took a look back on some of their journeys to get here today.\n\nBack in 2019, the incoming class of 2023 was the most competitive to date. With a record 66,000 applicants for the university to choose from, only a selective 3,168 or 11%, were admitted. Of the applicants, one in four had perfect grades in high school, with an average SAT and ACT score in the 96th percentile. Diversity was also at all-time highs, 27% of the class was made up of traditionally underrepresented groups, with Black people\u2019s representation increasing by 13% from the previous year. Moreso, 15% of the students were first-generation, with another 15% being international students, a 5% increase from the previous year.\n\nAll of this to say, after being admitted to USC as a class with endless potential, four years later, their time as Trojan students have come to a close. With that, we spoke with some of those graduating seniors to hear about their experiences, what they learned in their time at USC, and some of their best, and not-so-great memories.\n\nFor Felipe Morelli, a senior studying civil engineering, his favorite memory will always be his first football game at USC. Being under the huge lights, surrounded by thousands of football-crazy fans in the massive Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was a huge change for Morelli, who grew up in Colombia. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up around traditional American football, so I didn\u2019t really understand all the hype,\u201d Morelli said. \u201cThat first game was very different, but I fell in love with the environment right away.\u201d\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing. As is likely a theme for all USC students, graduating or not, procrastinating on an assignment and waiting till the last minute to do it is never fun. For Morelli, it was his PPD GIS project, making this his least favorite memory at USC. \u201cI put it off until the final day and was frantically trying to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought my world was over, but obviously, in retrospect, it was so insignificant.\u201d\n\nHailey Russell, a senior studying business administration major, agrees. Looking back on her time as a Trojan, she \u201calways learned to look at the big picture of things\u201d and that \u201cthe world is so much bigger than USC.\u201d For Russell, some of her best USC memories came from clubs at USC. Specifically with the Trojan Knights, USC\u2019s oldest service and tradition-based organization, which she joined in the spring 2022. \u201cMy favorite thing we do is called Tommy Watch,\u201d said Russell. Tommy Watch is when the Knights guard the Tommy Trojan statue during the week USC plays UCLA in football, also known as Conquest Week. \u201cWe would stay up all night and play things like kickball in Han Plaza.\u201d\n\nHowever, for some who are going to other places for their future careers, they will just miss L.A. \u201cMy favorite thing about USC has honestly been the weather,\u201d said John McDonald, a senior studying environmental sciences. \u201cI know it sounds silly, but it was always so nice to be able to go out in a shirt and shorts all year long.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, as graduation grows closer and closer, many seniors are realizing just how much they have grown since coming to USC. Joey Schifano, a senior studying human biology, had a less than ideal first day. \u201cI was crying at the gerontology building,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to go home on my first day of college.\u201d However, he has since learned that is perfectly normal and that he wasn\u2019t alone. \u201cNot everyone at USC has their stuff figured out, but everyone has a really cool backstory if you\u2019ll listen,\u201d Schifano said.\n\nThis year, USC\u2019s 140th commencement ceremony will take place on May 12 at 8:30 a.m. in Alumni Memorial Park.\n```"}

Today, with Biden officially announcing his bid for re-election, students are skeptical that the 80-year-old\u2019s best days are still ahead. According to a  poll  from NBC News, close to 70% of Americans oppose Biden\u2019s decision to run for the 2024 presidency, with almost half of the respondents citing his age as a major factor.\n\nFor sophomore Isabelle Lim, Biden\u2019s age wasn\u2019t her greatest concern, but she said she would much rather vote for a younger candidate who she could better identify with. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buzz that like, oh, like Biden\u2019s senile,\u201d Lim said, though she doesn\u2019t necessarily subscribe to it.\n\nBenkei Golden, a junior studying cinema media studies, said he felt a \u201cgenerational alienation with [Biden],\u201d making him seek out younger candidates. Much of Gen Z identifies with Bernie Sanders , despite being a year older than Biden, for example, student Jamie Mazur name-dropped Sanders when asked for his \u201cideal candidate.\u201d\n\nIn an unscientific online poll sent out by Annenberg Media, students gave their opinions on upcoming candidates. Many shared similar sentiments in support of Biden such as \u201cno better option and I would rather get him in office than another Republican\u201d and \u201cleast bad option; it\u2019s a shitshow no matter what.\u201d\n\nWhen approaching other students for their perspectives, many either claimed they lacked the specific knowledge to speak on the topic or stated the issue was \u201ctoo political.\u201d Those who shared their responses were generally ambivalent.\n\nAndrew Ngo, a business administration student, said a quality he seeks in a candidate is someone who can better understand bipartisan issues. \u201cI think the last few administrations have been a little bit rough on that end, and I think it\u2019s hurt overall progress,\u201d Ngo said.\n\nUSC students who were interviewed said there was a lack of better, and often younger, options. David Deiser, a film and television production major, said voting for other candidates, like Republican candidate Donald Trump, could lead America into \u201cdangerous territory.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think neo-liberal mediocrity is always going to be better than what can sort of lead up to fascism,\u201d Deiser said. \u201cI think it\u2019s fine that Biden is running again. I hope he wins based on the fact that people are probably going to vote for him because he\u2019s a moderate, but I would rather obviously, there be more far-left candidates.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with  CNN,  Biden expressed his hopefulness to continue to work on abortion rights and environmental issues. \u201cThe question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer\u201d Biden said. \u201cI know what I want the answer to be and I think you do too. This is not a time to be complacent. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for reelection.\u201d\n\nIn a three-minute video announcing his campaign, Biden took a jab at his opponent, Donald Trump, stating \u201cMAGA extremists are lining up to take on those bedrock freedoms,\u201d while displaying photos of the 2021 capitol riots.\n\nEntering the 2020 presidential election with a high profile image, as Biden served as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president previously (2009-2017), the race was tight as many Americans supported the then-current president, Donald Trump. Yet Biden received  81 million votes , the most any president has in U.S. history.\n\nThe 2024 election provides another intense matchup as both Biden and Trump are the projected candidates for their parties.\n```"}

The \u201cArmenian Genocide Commemerative Rally for Justice\u201d took place at the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue which run directly through the Little Armenia section of Los Angeles. It was organized by the Unified Young Armenians in collaboration with the USC and UCLA Armenian Student Assemblies.\n\nApril 24 marks Armenian Genocide Rememberance Day \u2014 a public holiday that annually commemorates the victims of the 1915 genocide. During World War I, the Armenian people were arrested and targeted by the Ottoman Empire, a systematic attack that resulted in the massacre and starvation of over 1.5 million people. To this day, the Turkish government refuses to acknowledge the events as genocide.\n\nAttendees of the rally saw it as a time to be with their families and acknowledge the devastation committed against their people. For others, like demonstrator Anna Darmenchyan, the event hit closer to home. \u201cMy great-grandparents came from Zeytun, Turkey,\u201d Darmenchyan said. \u201cThey survived, some of them lost their families, some of them didn\u2019t.\u201d She choked up reflecting on all those who had gathered for the rally. \u201cTogether we bring recognition \u2014 we don\u2019t give up,\u201d she said.\n\nTeenage sisters Elizabeth and Natalie Bislamyan said they felt proud to see other young people at the protest besides themselves. \u201cI know a lot of the older generations, they don\u2019t make it to see all their grandkids and kids helping their country still,\u201d Elizabeth Bislamyan said. Natalie Bislamyan said she wasn\u2019t just there to remember events past, but rather, to shed light on violence that is still being perpetuated against Armenians. \u201c[We\u2019re] not fighting for the recognition of the Armenian genocide, but for our survival,\u201d Bislamyan said.\n\nSince December 2022, the Republic of Azerbaijan has blockaded the Lachin Corridor roadway preventing Artsakh from receiving outside access to food, medicine and basic goods by Armenia. Bislamyan wasn\u2019t alone in her frustration over Azerbaijan\u2019s crimes \u2014 individuals at the rally also held up signs reading \u201copen the roads\u201d and \u201cstop the blockade.\u201d\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, who represents one of the largest Armenian American populations in the country, spoke in solidarity with the Armenian people at the rally. He called for sanctioning Azerbaijan for its continued aggression against Artsakh and Armenia as well as the recognition of Artsakh as an independent state. Rep. Schiff has been an outspoken advocate for the Armenian people for many years and led the push in Congress for the United States to formally recognize the Armenian genocide. His advocacy was successful when the Biden administration finally did so in 2021.\n\nShushan Krapetian, director of the USC Dornsife Institute of Armenian Studies, said April 24, 1915, was a significant day because of the large number of Armenian intellectuals and thought leaders killed. \u201c[It\u2019s a] day to warn the world that the genocide isn\u2019t over,\u201d Krapetian said. \u201cThe narratives of genocide have been recycled by both Azerbaijan and Turkish Republics.\u201d For Krapetian, it\u2019s imperative that the people of the U.S. pay attention to what is happening across the ocean, especially with the large Armenian population in the U.S.\n\nThe USC Dornsife Institute of Armenian Studies is doing its part to help these efforts with a project titled \u201cCalifornia History through the Armenian Experience.\u201d According to Krapetian, the project, funded by the California State Library, aims to capture the deep culture and history of the Armenian-American people by conducting interviews across the state.\n```"}

And today, USC hosted a resources and support fair at the Village lawn. Irene Kim has more on what the fair had to offer.\n\nWith the end of sexual assault awareness month coming up, USC hosted the annual Support and Resource Fair on campus. The events consists of trauma-informed yoga sessions, conversations with local sexual and domestic violence organizations, and an emotional containment workshops.\n\nThe Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, or SAGE, and the Survivor Support Community are amongst the two student-run organizations on campus that offer direct support and resources. Ultimately, both groups encourage students to attend the events and feel comfortable enough to talk to others about this issue.\n\nChristine Almadjian, the advocacy director of the Survivor Support Community, hopes students find meaningful conversations and comfort during each event.\n\nALMADJIAN: we really value creating a space for survivors and allies just to speak about their experiences, to find comfort in having group efforts to find a place that they can feel comfortable.\n\nLogan Terry is the co-director of SAGE. He and others members of SAGE present at the fair advocated for the importance of hosting this fair openly and welcoming all students.\n\nTERRY: It\u2019s a spotlight for victims of sexual assault and also about how we as students, but also like the greater culture that we\u2019re all part of, can work to support survivors and alleviate causes of sexual assault.\n\nOrganizations from all around Los Angeles rallied alongside each campus organization to show their support for the Trojan Family. Angel Gray, a representative of the YWCA of Greater Los Angeles, emphasizes how her organization aligns strongly with the campus event.\n\nGRAY: Our mission and our goals are eliminating racism and empowering women, and we do that through a multitude of different ways, specifically for our department, the sexual assault crisis services. We offer a ton of services, counseling for survivors and loved ones of survivors, as well as support groups... we work to raise awareness about all the different issues within the sexual assault field during this time of but really all year round.\n\nTo officially end sexual assault awareness month, the USC Male Engagement program in Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Services and USC Health will host a conversation about Sex, Boundaries and Dating this Thursday at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center from 6:00 P.M. to 7:30 P.M.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Irene Kim.\n```"}

Proposition 22 was signed three years ago and classified ride share and app-based workers as independent contractors rather than employees denying them of many crucial benefits like healthcare. Now, the workers are protesting to get back their rights and repeal the proposition.\n\nGig workers and members of SiTraRepa and SEIU shouted chants like \u201csi se puede\u201d and \u201cthis is what a democracy looks like\u201d while peacefully protesting outside the Argentina Consulate. Between chants, SiTraRepa member Emilse Icandri gave a passionate speech in Spanish about what the organization hopes to accomplish through their ongoing efforts.\n\nICANDRI: We\u2019re here in the us, in L.A., where these major companies have their headquarters, their businesses. But it is also the heart, where thousands of workers are gathering to fight to have their unions. Examples of these incredible victories are our colleagues from Amazon, our colleagues from Starbucks, our colleagues of California Gig Workers Union. We know that if they were able to take down those giants, we can do it as well!\n\nLAPD shut down the rally after 45 minutes, forcing protestors to put their hands in the air and leave the premise.

What do students really want to see? Since its founding in 2017, many stores have come and gone in the Village. We spoke to students to see what they think is missing from the development.\n\nThe Village has become a hot-spot for students - whether you want to work out, grab a coffee or finally run to the grocery store. But it\u2019s a relatively new establishment, and it\u2019s changed a lot during it\u2019s short history. Stores are shutting down and getting replaced as quickly as they\u2019re popping up. Why is that?\n\nThe USC Village opened in August 2017 as the largest development in the history of South Los Angeles, and it boasts some impressive numbers. The project cost $700 million to complete, spans 15 acres, includes 6 buildings with 36 retail spaces and has enough housing for about 2700 students. Despite those stats, just 13 of the 20 original shops remain open in the Village today. Two of those originals, CAVA, a Mediterranean version of Chipotle, and Dulce, a cafe known for its matcha lattes are two of the Village\u2019s most popular spots. Located opposite each other on the main village plaza, they are usually lively with long lines.\n\nMany of the Village\u2019s other retail spaces haven\u2019t enjoyed the same success. Among those is Lululemon, which senior Adam Novak said caught him by surprise. \"I just ripped my pants, like, literally yesterday playing hacky sack. So I was going to come and check out Lululemon pants, but they just closed the pop up shop.\" Boutique and beauty shop Fruit & Candy is the latest Village closure. It shut down earlier this semester.\n\nStudents cited health and value for money as reasons why they like eating at Cava, while Dulce\u2019s appeal seems to be its breakfast options and nice cafe environment. But places like Lululemon, Fruit & Candy and countless others haven\u2019t been able to find enough success to stay open, creating a revolving door of new shops at some locations while others remain abandoned for extended periods of time.\n\nSo what shops do USC students want to see in the Village? Novak would like a new burger place. \"I think if I had an In \u2018n\u2019 Out that would that would go pretty hard.\" Whether it\u2019s In \u2018n\u2019 Out or another place, whichever shop is next to move in will have to work to find its niche in order to break the trend and have long term success in the Village. For now, if you\u2019re feeling like eating a chicken sandwich, check out Honeybird, and if you want desert, grab a cookie from Insomnia, at least while they\u2019re still here.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Chris Ajose-Nixon.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack)\n\nBy Terence Holton April 24, 2023 at 11:51 pm PDT\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d is a column by Terence Holton discussing the latest men\u2019s college basketball headlines. While it is April, the college basketball season really is right around the corner. We\u2019ve got just about half a year to go until the season begins! So, here are some of my top superlatives for next season.\n\nBlue Devils are back? I hyped up Duke\u2019s recruiting class in one of my previous columns and partially because of that, they are my preseason No. 1. The Blue Devils, like I mentioned earlier, are bringing in a stellar recruiting class including four five-star recruits. While all of the recruits will have immediate impacts, guard Jared McCain and forward Sean Stewart will have the most hype. McCain is one of the most well-known recruits of all time, as he has accumulated nearly two million followers on Tik Tok. But don\u2019t let that distract you from his game: He won back-to-back California Gatorade Player of the Year award, won three straight CIF Open Division Championships and is a lights-out shooter. Stewart is a high flier who will dunk on anyone. During his senior year, Stewart averaged 16.7 points and 11.9 rebounds per game while leading his team to a 21-8 record. Don\u2019t be surprised if we see Stewart on Sports Center next year.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget about who Duke is returning, though. The Blue Devils are returning three, possibly four, of their four highest scorers (Depending on if Jeremy Roach decides to stay in the NBA Draft or not.) Next year, Duke will be led by freshman center Kyle Filipowski, who led the Blue Devils in points, rebounds and steals per game. Duke should regain supremacy in the college basketball world this season.\n\nDark horse Final Four contender\n\nOK, this is going to sound incredibly biased. However, USC is sneakily building an incredibly talented roster. The Trojans are returning three of five starters, including their leading scorer, senior guard Boogie Ellis. And one of the holes in the starting lineup is being filled with No. 1 overall recruit Isaiah Collier. The Trojans are also returning four of five players of their top-10 recruiting class from 2022. Defensively, this team will be scary. The Trojans are returning a top-10 shot blocker per game in senior center Joshua Morgan, and his partner in crime freshman center Vince Iwuchukwu. These two twin oak trees are the anchors of the Trojan defense, but let\u2019s not forget that USC held opponents to 39% from the field \u2014 good for top 10 in the country. Along with Iwuchukwu off the bench will be his fellow freshmen: guard Oziyah Sellers and forward Kijani Wright. Additionally from the bench will be four-star forward, Arrinten Page, who can stretch the floor very well for someone who\u2019s 6 foot 9. And I won\u2019t forget about the possibility of USC landing Bronny James, a fantastic shooter and team player. Like I said, it sounds biased, but the Trojans will be tough next year and are No. 13 in ESPN\u2019s Way-To-Early Top 25.\n\nA 7 foot 4 void to fill\n\nPurdue has a huge hole to fill next season, and I feel like most analysts are overlooking how big a factor junior center Zach Edey was for Purdue. Edey averaged 22.3 points and 12.9 points while taking home practically every single award in college basketball. Edey literally and figuratively carried the Boilermakers to a No. 1 seed. It looked like Edey was the only player who was trying when Purdue lost to Fairleigh Dickinson in the first round of the NCAA tournament. ESPN currently has Purdue as No. 15 in their most recent preseason poll. That is absolutely absurd. While the Boilermakers are returning much of their lineup from last year, that entire team was based around feeding the ball to Edey. Someone will need to become a true star for the Boilermakers to make any noise in college basketball, but I just don\u2019t see it happening. Purdue has no players I would consider star talent \u2014 just a bunch of role players. Over the last two years, Purdue has had one or two star players who carry them, but they just don\u2019t have that guy in 2023. I could see them missing the tournament.\n\nIt\u2019s only 191 days until November 1, 2023, which is around when college basketball season will start. I\u2019m not anxious for the season to start at all, clearly. See you all next season, when  College Basketball Catch-Up  returns. \u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/04/24/shooting-near-usc-leaves-one-dead/", "response": "```\nA car-to-car shooting occurred near the USC campus on Jefferson Boulevard and St. Andrews Place on Sunday night, which left one 30-year-old victim dead. The shooting occurred in the parking lot of St. Andrews Liquor Mart around 8:30 p.m., said Rodolfo Lopez, LAPD Area Commanding Officer of the Southwest. Following the shooting, the victim was driven about a mile and a half by a friend to Exposition Boulevard and Vermont, right at the southwest corner of campus, according to Lopez. Approximately 13 minutes after the shooting, the USC Department of Public Safety tweeted that there was police activity on the south side of Exposition Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. It clarified that no immediate threat existed, but that people should stay away from the area. Lopez said that no suspects have been identified or charged. The relationship between the shooter and the victim has not been determined.\n\nUSC students were made aware of the incident and subsequent police activity through a series of emails by DPS. The mass emails, which all current students, faculty and staff receive anytime there is a police encounter on or near the campus, notified recipients of \u201cpolice activity\u201d on Exposition Boulevard but mentioned nothing of a shooting occurring. Many USC students have long felt frustrated concerning the lack of specificity about incidents in these emails from DPS.\n\nSophomore Jolaiya Aldridge, a biological sciences major, was first made aware of the incident through the DPS alerts, but she said that she was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by the lack of information. \u201cThey always do that,\u201d Alridge said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. They make it seem like it\u2019s not a big deal ... we\u2019re really not that safe here.\u201d\n\nSophomore Adeel Chaudhry, a business administration major who lives off campus, was also unsurprised by the incident and the content of the mass emails \u201cIt just definitely doesn\u2019t feel the safest and makes you more cautious which makes you wish you were more protected,\u201d Chaudhry said Chaudhry, who witnessed the police activity on Exposition Boulevard, was unaware at the time that there had been a shooting. \u201cI know the streets that it was on and that\u2019s very close to where I go a lot. So if I just saw police activity, I probably would have still gone,\u201d Chaudhry said.\n\nSophomore Brandon McGowen, a business administration major, said USC should inform students properly about public safety incidents at the very least, if not prevent them. \u201cI think informing your students is the biggest thing, because then we feel more protected,\u201d he said.. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t know, then we\u2019re kind of clueless and in the dark.\u201d\n\nAccording to Assistant Chief of Public Safety David Carlisle, students were not made aware of the details of the shooting because it occurred off campus, pushing the shooting just outside of DPS\u2019 jurisdiction. Although reporting the specifics of the crime to students falls outside DPS\u2019 realm of responsibility, some students believe that they should have been better informed due to the proximity of the shooting to campus. \u201cI think if it\u2019s where students are living or anywhere near the fryft zone, even a mile outside of the fryft zone radius, I think that all warrants for us to know because that\u2019s a very close area that all these students are around,\u201d Mcgowan said. Fryft, or \u201cfree Lyft,\u201d refers to a USC program offering students complimentary access to Lyft rides around several surrounding blocks near campus. The majority of undergraduate students live within this \u201cfryft\u201d zone. \u201cStudents live in that area. They should have that right to know,\u201d Chaudhry said.\n\nSince DPS alerts are often broad, some students turn to alternative means of staying informed. Sophie Lee, a freshmen resident of Parkside Apartments, said that she found out about the shooting through a friend, who was alerted to the fatal incident by an app called Citizen, a crime reporting database run by civilian users. \u201cI have conflicting thoughts just because I know they don\u2019t want to spread mass panic by saying \u2018oh, there was a shooting,\u2019\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut at the same time if they don\u2019t make it a big deal, then people aren\u2019t going to take it seriously.\u201d\n\nThis shooting wasn\u2019t an isolated incident either in South Los Angeles. \u201cWe have seen a marked increase in confrontational shootings where it started off as an argument of some sort, where a gun gets pulled out and somebody gets shot,\u201d Lopez concluded. Ending his statement to Annenberg Media, Lopez offered the following advice to students. \u201cMake smart decisions, be aware of your surroundings ... try to avoid any confrontation,\u201d Lopez said.\n```"}

Filled with horror and \u201cmad dogs\u201d, Booba is highly anticipated. Mary Ahn has the story.\n\nGrauman\u2019s Chinese Theater, located on Hollywood Boulevard, will be screening a short horror film at 7pm. \u201cBooba\u201d is the product of 28 USC students and alumni, including director Gaoyang Ganjin, writer Hunter D\u2019Ancona and producers Joe Grode and Gabby Fiszman. The team worked with the production studio, Ingsane Productions, to bring the film to life.\n\nDirector Gaoyang Ganjin speaks about how Booba got started.\n\nGANJIN: This idea originally started, I came up with the idea originally in class. It was supposed to be for another project, but eventually what happened was I realized that the project is a little bit too big for what the school sort of allows me to make and sort of with all the restrictions. And from that point on, I sort of, I wanted to be ambitious and wanted to do something great. And and so I talked to, I met I met up with Hunter, and he completely, him and I, we completely reworked the script from the bottom up. We added so many more scenes. You know, after that, I found Joe and Gabby, which came together and produced this whole project.\n\nThe twenty-minute film is about the age-old relationship between man and a man\u2019s best friend. Inspired by Ganjin\u2019s dad and his dog, the director explored this thin line between companionship and control. The film visits the darker themes of relationships, even those that are seemingly as simple and straightforward as one between a human and their pet.\n\nScreenwriter Hunter D\u2019Ancona talks about the film\u2019s themes.\n\nD\u2019ANCONA: What we\u2019ve spoken about the film thus far. We keep using this phrase \u2018fairy tale\u2019, and I think that moniker sort of speaks to the fact that we are operating in this weird genre unto itself, but that sort of it\u2019s sort of rationalized and created a world where all of these elements would become inherent, like this idea of a man dog, this idea of this, It\u2019s baked in to the expectations of that kind of world. So really using genre to sort of leverage our way into the story, I think was huge.\n\nSid Grauman, the creator and managing director of the Chinese Theater, in 1927 spent two million dollars and eighteen months to import temple bells, pagodas, stone Heaven Dogs and other Chinese artifacts to establish it as a cultural staple of Los Angeles. However, the Chinese Theater is not only a significant landmark in LA history, but also in film production. It\u2019s a popular location for film screenings and premieres with hand-printed stars in its forecourt and packed red carpets. From its very first premiere of Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s \u201cThe King of Kings\u201d, the theater\u2019s rich cinematic history brings more than four million viewers and screens dozens of film studios every year.\n\nEven though the theater is usually home to blockbuster films, this small team of USC students was able to compete with giants. But the road to release wasn\u2019t without some issues. Joe Grode, one of the film\u2019s producer, speaks about how the team problem-solved throughout the process.\n\nGRODE: But I think really the big thing was just figuring out ways, like Hunter said, we wanted to create what was in Gao\u2019s mind and Hunter\u2019s mind too, and it was more of a thing of how do we accomplish this? How do we use creative ways to accomplish shots that we wanted to get. And every day was really just solving a problem.\n\nThe team\u2019s passion for Booba is palpable, not only in the end product but throughout the entire production process. Longtime friend and USC Film and Television Production student Nicholas Buckhalter, remembers the first time Ganjin thought of the idea for his film.\n\nBUCKHALTER: I remember one time I went over to his house and he was telling me this story about wanting to do a film about a man dog thing that lived in someone\u2019s basement like a maestro. And I was like, \u2018Okay, sure, buddy, sounds good.\u2019 And then you know what he did for production. And then I, you know, seen earlier cuts of it up until the final cut. So, you know, really proud of that guy and for Hunter two for doing it together you know because it\u2019s it\u2019s you know it\u2019s I guess relatively rare that people, you know, put so much effort into their outside projects.\n\nFrom an idea that started over a year ago, Ganjin, D\u2019Ancona, Grode, Fiszman and 24 additional USC students and alumni had to balance their coursework as well as film production to pursue their passion, Booba. The premiere will take place from 7 to 9pm at the Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard. All students, and all horror film and dog lovers are invited to attend.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Mary Ahn.\n```"}

Today marks 108 years. Families, high school students, teachers, and grandparents gathered today at the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue. The feeling of pride was palpable in the air as the youth and the elderly remember the sacrifices of their ancestors.\n\nAnna Dremenchyn says through tears that being Armenian is a big part of her identity. Dremenchyn: \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to be here because as an Armenian, this is part of our story. This is what we grew up hearing. My great grandparents came from, say, to turkey and they survived. Some of them lost their families and some of them didn\u2019t. The ones who did make it to Armenia or to Syria, to Armenia is where I come from. And I\u2019ve heard these stories over and over again growing up. So coming here, seeing everyone else who shares the same story is just a reminder of what people have gone through for us to be here.\u201d\n\nFor the first time ever the Los Angeles united school district\u2019s students and faculty took the day off in remembrance. LAUSD teacher Armine Shishikyan said she was relieved to not have to take a day off of work Shishikyan: \u201cI feel extremely proud to work with a supportive district, amazing coworkers, colleagues. They\u2019ve always supported us throughout the years, the student, and even more so this year now that the schools are closed.\u201d\n\nApril marks genocide awareness month. Since the end of the genocide in 1923, modern scholars estimate that 1.5 million Armenians were killed by the Ottoman empire, today known as the modern day Turkey, and another 800,000 were deported. The Armenian diaspora in the United States is the second-largest in the world. It\u2019s many cultures merge in Los Angeles. Shishikyan says its encouraging to see so many young people engaged. Shishikyan :  \u201cI think it\u2019s so important to see young people because they are going to be the next generation who carry this out for us. A lot of the events are organized by the young, young generation and the groups. I get very proud to see that our kids care, very passionate about it because they are the future and they are going to be the ones to make sure that all these events continue to take place in our wonderful city.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles area is home to over 200,000 Armenians, the largest concentration in the US. They express solidarity through cultural centers and youth-centered organizations which increase solidarity and keep the culture alive. Fourteen year old Nairi Simonian says that spreading awareness about the current issues is just as important as honoring the past. Simonian: \u201cUm, I think it\u2019s very important to be here and represent my Armenian culture and spread awareness to everybody who doesn\u2019t know what happened. Like, whoever doesn\u2019t know about genocide or, like, what\u2019s happening, what in after or something. We\u2019ll call it whatever. But, um, it just. It\u2019s very important to spread awareness, to make sure everybody knows. So we could also, like, try to seek help, see what we can do. And also so people know how to help out because it\u2019s an ongoing like genocide. It\u2019s never ending and we\u2019re not sure if there\u2019s ever going to be.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s ongoing gathering\u2019s show the Armenian community\u2019s commitment to keeping the memory of their ancestor\u2019s alive. They have found a hope in the cultural embrace like today\u2019s observance. And their future held by the passionate youth continued action.\n```"}

He is a contemporary artist who features avant-garde concepts in his paintings. Recently, his work has become extremely popular with Gen Z with his art going viral on various social media platforms such as TikTok. Many agree that his work is aesthetically pleasing and cute, but is that all he is trying to portray?\n\nThe subjects of his work are usually children, and they often hold weapons, creating a stark contrast between the cuteness of the subject and the danger of such weapons. This reveals \u201cemotional complexities from resistance and rebellion to quietude and contemplation,\u201d according to the Pace Gallery. Moreover, he uses this cartoonish, animated style of painting to capture a culmination of contradictory childhood emotions and anxieties in one subject.\n\nHis inspiration often comes from many factors such as his childhood, contemporary culture, Japanese manga, anime, American cartoons and even rock and punk music. Moreover, his adorable art style is adopted and influenced by Japan\u2019s \u201ckawaii\u201d (or cute) culture. Nara has also been influenced by the \u201csuperflat\u201d art of Takashi Murakami, which refers to both the non 3-D style of Japanese art as well as critique on the shallowness of consumer culture.\n\nPhilistines often don\u2019t understand Nara\u2019s art on a deeper level. His work has been trending on TikTok recently, and many Gen Z users love his work because of its cute style. Many have determined his work to be aesthetic and cute. However, what some don\u2019t often see is Nara\u2019s more cynical messages. His work hovers between two very contrasting images: childish innocence and violent adulthood. His work reflects the unease he felt being raised in post-war Japan, surrounded by fear and paranoia.\n\nNara\u2019s Sleepless Night (Cat), 1999 reveals the stark contrast between cute and serious in his works. This painting depicts a girl with cat eyes and teeth. Being a child, she elicits innocence, yet the dark background and atmosphere the painting creates divulges something more menacing. \u201cNara hints at the darker, wicked side of childhood that is sometimes overlooked. However, he also encourages us to think about the childish spirit lurking within ourselves as adults, one which is tinged with both fragility and a rebellious streak of malevolence,\u201d said curator Rosie Lesso in an article for The Collector.\n\nAt first glance, most of his works present an adorable figure whether of young girls, children or animals. However, upon closer inspection, his work elicits a sense of uncomfortableness. Nara\u2019s work revolves around concepts of loneliness, rebelliousness, disastrous events and cynical aspects of Japanese life such as earthquakes, war, nuclear weapons and tsunamis. All of these anxieties seep out of his works when scrutinizing the details in his work. The girls are often not smiling and depicted with dark elements such as fangs and bandages, revealing that something is wrong.\n\nIn 2021, Nara\u2019s works were installed in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. More recently, however, Nara has opened at The Art Gallery of Western Australia. This year, Nara\u2019s first solo exhibition \u201cReach Out to The Moon, Even If We Can\u2019t\u201d was shown this year. The free exhibition runs from February 26 to June 25. This exhibition will reveal major sculptural works alongside paintings, drawings, ceramics and photography. Nara will have an upcoming exhibition All My Little Words that will be shown in the Albertina Modern in Vienna, Austria from May 10 to November 1. It will encompass a multitude of mediums. Moreover, his work is shown on canvases and sculptures, and he uses more unconventional things as well such as napkins and envelopes.\n\nNara has many exhibitions that have started and are also coming up in the United States and internationally. In 2020, he was a part of \u201cConnecting Currents\u201d exhibition in Houston, and the exhibition will end sometime this year. In Boston, he is part of the \u201cHokusai: Inspiration and Influence\u201d exhibition from March 26 to July 16. Although these are the only two exhibitions in the U.S., there are more abroad, which can be found here.\n\nNara takes inspiration from various aspects of his life. It will be interesting to see how his art and the issues he focuses on evolves or follows a similar pattern throughout these various expositions as he continues to create art.\n```"}

The camera, set up by sophomores Zoe Beach and Khai-ly Tran and situated alongside prompts like \u201cstrike a pose,\u201d posts student responses online in a vintage-style video.\n\nUSC Home Movies was started last November as part of the students\u2019 internship, but they hope it also has a broader impact. Beach said she hopes it will be a way for both current and prospective students to learn more about USC and its students.\n\n\u201cWe really want the account to not just be a source of lighthearted and funny content, but also, you know, a source of information that can show ... what USC really is, what student life is about,\u201d Beach said.\n\nThe home video style originated from camcorders, often used to share memories with friends and was made to encourage others to live in the moment.\n\n\u201cHave you seen those videos on YouTube of what school was like back before iPhones? Really grainy videos of wholesome moments, kids just laughing, having fun, interacting with people.\u201d Beach said. \u201cWe really wanted to capture that energy and that passion of USC student life and bring that to life in a more digital way.\u201d\n\nAccording to the two, people were hesitant to approach the camera when they first began, but recently, more and more students have been recognizing the camera and being more open to expressing themselves.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really cool to see the growth already,\u201d Tran said. \u201cEverybody is super creative with a camcorder because nobody\u2019s watching them. They\u2019re just doing it on their own.\u201d\n\nTran explained that convenience is a big draw for people to participate, since friends read it aloud to each other as they walk to class and it starts a conversation.\n\nFor Nick Li, a friend of the creators who showed off his dance skills when answering that DANC 185B was the best class at USC, his reasoning for taking part in the video was simple.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Li said. \u201cI thought it was cool.\u201d\n\nOf course, running the project hasn\u2019t come without its challenges. Along with getting participants to speak on camera on their own, coming up with good questions, and coordinating times to set up and edit, even the recent rainy weather has been an obstacle at times.\n\n\u201cOn windy days, sometimes we try to film and the camera has fallen on multiple occasions, just face planted,\u201d Tran said.\n\nThe Instagram account currently has over 530 followers with videos covering topics from students\u2019 favorite things about game day to when the last time they cried was and why.\n\nTran explained that in the future they\u2019re hoping to focus on asking about timely topics for students as well as trying out different formats.\n\n\u201cI think moving forward, we want to try interview style videos ... where we bring around the camcorder and talk to people while still keeping the same themes of answering questions and Q&A,\u201d said Tran.\n\nAccording to the two, the videos they see as providing an insight into the passion, creativity and energy of USC students will be continuing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really fun just seeing people be their unique selves, coming up to the camera saying whatever\u2019s on their mind that day,\u201d Beach said. \u201dIt\u2019s just fun seeing USC in a different light.\u201d```"}
{"key": "/2023/04/24/varelas-views-chapter-2-please-leave-it-to-the-machines/", "response": "```\nVarela\u2019s Views: Chapter 2 \u2014 Please leave it to the machines\n\nBy Dominic Varela April 24, 2023 at 5:29 pm PDT\n\nI would call myself a baseball lifer. A purist \u2014 some would say. Maybe even a tad \u201cobsessed\u201d with the sheer history of a game that has become intertwined with the culture of the nation as a whole over the past century and a half. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about MLB\u2019s new rules if you have not lived under a rock over the past month and a half. Restricted shifts, bigger bases and the coup de gr\u00e2ce: the pitch clock. These new rules come from years of exceeding criticism and fallen viewership. But, considering how the Executive Committee handled the Houston Astros\u2019 trash can shenanigans, I was surprised at how quickly they were willing to implement such game-changing rules. Easily Commissioner Rob Manfred\u2019s magnum opus of significant decisions.\n\nNow what do I, a baseball maniac, think of these rules? Shit, I think they\u2019re great. Sub-three-hour games, with more hits and stolen bases? Sign me up! Common sense overrides my demand for purity. The game is objectively better than it has been in the years preceding 2023. And I\u2019m obviously not the only one who thinks so. Opening Day destroyed the all-time single-day viewing record by over 50 million minutes. Thankfully, that trend has held up throughout the past two weeks. Exact viewership numbers are difficult to verify, but views among the younger population are higher than in the past. That\u2019s the most important thing, really. Generation Z is the most crucial demographical draw, and the game\u2019s future partially lies with their viewership as a group. As long as the kids watch, baseball lives on.\n\nWhether or not you like them, the rules work precisely as MLB intended: drawing more eyeballs onto the on-field product. But why stop there? If baseball is finally changing for the better, it\u2019s time to take the next logical step toward the best possible version of the sport. That, dear reader, would be the establishment of electronic strike zones.\n\nIf you asked a casual baseball fan to name any umpire, just one name comes to mind: Angel Hernandez. Not because he\u2019s good or anything, oh no. Because he\u2019s so terrible at his profession, his name has become attached to the current state of umpiring in Major League Baseball. I\u2019m sure subpar strike zone judgment has been a constant in baseball since the sport was conceived in the mid-1800s, and the union was composed of just 37 states, but technology has progressed quite a bit since then. As a result, not only do we know instantly when a home plate umpire is correct, but we, more importantly, know when he\u2019s wrong. Within seconds, the broadcast has the technology to signal to umpires whether their call was correct, and a quick correction can be made. Other professional leagues have implemented such a system; even Triple-A just started doing so this season. The majors may make the change in 2024. But even if the league decided to do so, it\u2019s too late to rectify the years we\u2019ve suffered at the hands of unnecessary umpire ineptitude.\n\nI know I\u2019ve thrown around the word \u201cobjectively\u201d loosely. Still, it is an objective fact that humans will never surpass the quality of a robotic strike zone, and for one big reason \u2014 humans are prone to uncontrollable biases. For umpires, the critical bias they often find themselves subject to is a phenomenon known as \u201canchoring bias,\u201d where the first piece of information influences their judgment on subsequent data. In an umpire\u2019s case, the outcome of the previous pitch \u2014 whether a ball, a strike or whatever \u2014 has a noticeable effect on how they call the next pitch. I learned all about this in the 2021 book \u201cThe Inside Game\u201d by Keith Law. In Chapter 1, Law cites a 2016 paper that reported the results of a study of every pitch tracked by Pitch f/x from 2008 to 2012. The study found that umpires were 0.9% more likely to call the second pitch a ball if the prior pitch was a called strike. That figure increased to 1.3% if the last two pitches were strikes. In addition, the effect was 10 to 15 times higher on \u201cambiguous\u201d pitches than on \u201cobvious\u201d pitches. That may not seem like a vast difference, but the study analyzed 900,000 cases, meaning that thousands of pitches were influenced by anchoring bias. Those could have been entire ball games decided by unconscious decision.\n\nThe fact that every pitch does not exist in a vacuum \u2014 like it obviously should \u2014 is a complete travesty. It makes zero sense for umpires to consider what they called previously, deciding what to call for the next pitch. Hey, it\u2019s not their fault; the human brain is a flawed contraption. It comes down to the fact that humans like things to be friendly and even. For example, if the count starts at 0-1 and the next pitch is ambiguous, it makes sense for umpires to unconsciously call it a ball because 1-1 aesthetically looks and feels nicer than 0-2. You know what lacks a brain that thinks like that, though? Robots. Robotic umpires would call pitches accurately. They do so, of course, without considering what happened on the previous pitch. Wow! Referee quality could be better in every professional sport. I get that. But it\u2019s unfair that we allow subjectivity to creep in for a role dealing with something so highly objective. And it would be so easy to eliminate.\n\nAs I said, other professional leagues have switched, and the benefits are clear. So why do the best players in the world need more inaction from higher-ups? Although you may think otherwise, the Commissioner\u2019s Office isn\u2019t stupid. There\u2019s got to be a reason why they still need to execute the change. So many individuals would only be left with an occupation if I had to point to something. Come on, MLB. Plenty of jobs are available for the visually impaired in the modern world. Jokes aside, I don\u2019t see this changing anything regarding employment. There would still be a home plate umpire behind the box, performing almost precisely the same duty as he did before. He just gets a notification on a handheld buzzer if the robot says he called something incorrectly. No reason to fire anyone; the labor force stays intact.\n\nIf you still don\u2019t believe that robotic umpiring is unnecessary and we can all just suck it up and stop complaining, I\u2019ll leave you with this. UmpScorecards.com, a college-student-run umpire analysis website, has analyzed thousands of home plate umpires since the site\u2019s inception in 2019. According to their analysis, not only has there been a grand total of one \u2014 yes, one \u2014 game with absolutely zero incorrect strike/ball calls, but every umpire, not just the Angel Hernandezes of the world, misses obvious calls from time to time. Even the best umpire from last year, Pat Hoberg, was only correct on 95.5% of his calls. Over an entire season, that last 4.5% makes a sizable difference. And he\u2019s supposed to be the best one! On Tuesday, UmpScorecards\u2019s analysis page on Twitter (@UmpAnalysis) posted the league average accuracy so far this year, which currently stands at 93.9%. That\u2019s the highest the league has ever posted through the first 18 games of the season since pitch tracking became available. If in just two weeks, at the highest quality we\u2019ve ever seen from umpires, it means that there are still mathematically hundreds of calls that we know are incorrect the instant they are called, there\u2019s something wrong going on. When the best the league has ever done means over 6% of calls are still inaccurate, it\u2019s time they bite the bullet and let the machines take over.\n\nThe way the league is trending recently, robotic umpires will be implemented sooner rather than later. These new rules show that they at least have the willingness to change. Whether or not they actually do is still up in the air. Robotic umpires are an easier change than the pitch clock. I\u2019m optimistic that every Major League player would completely embrace a change that would guarantee the game is called 100% correctly. At the end of the day, I\u2019m all about enriching the on-field product. I want more viewers just as much as MLB does because not only would that give me more people to talk to about baseball, but it would ensure the survival of the national pastime for the foreseeable future. So, I\u2019m calling on you, Manfred. Make the change before it\u2019s too late. I can\u2019t live forever with Angel Hernandez\u2019s \u201cblown call\u201d compilations on my YouTube feed.\n```"}

Both pillars of their respective networks, the news has brought up conversations about the trustworthiness of news. Kimberly Aguirre reports.\n\nThis morning, it was announced that Fox News program host Tucker Carlson will be leaving the network. The last episode of his show, \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d aired on Friday. The exact reasoning for his departure is unknown, with the network releasing a statement saying they \u201chave agreed to part ways\u201d and thanking him. Some point to the lawsuit filed by former \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d producer Abby Grossberg. She alleges that working for Carlson subjected her to a sexist and anti-semetic workplace. Grossberg also claims she was coerced to give misleading answers in the recent Fox v. Dominion defamation case. Just last week, Fox News settled the case for just over $780 million. Dominion accused Fox of spreading false information about their voting machines in the 2020 election. A Dominion representative said Carlson\u2019s departure was not a part of their settlement.\n\nRife with what many people say are conspiracy theories, racism and unfounded allegations, Carlson and his show had become the face of Fox News. His was the most watched cable news show not just on Fox, but on all cable networks. Time Magazine dubbed him \u201cthe Most Powerful Conservative in America\u201d in 2021. Tucker Carlson\u2019s departure today sent shock waves through the news media landscape.\n\nNot long after the Carlson news, long-time CNN anchor Don Lemon was also let go. He\u2019d been with the network for 17 years. In a memo to staff, the CNN CEO thanked Lemon and wished him well. Lemon was just on air this morning. He had sparked uproar in February after saying presidential candidate the 51-year-old Nikki Haley \u201cisn\u2019t in her prime.\u201d Doubling down on this by saying women are in their prime in their 20s, 30s and 40s, telling people to \u201cGoogle it.\u201d\n\nWith two of the most recognizable faces on cable news coincidently being let go on the same day, talk about the news media and ethics are swirling. In recent years, trust in media has declined with a 2022 Gallup poll saying only about one-quarter of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion on the news.\n\nAt Annenberg Media, we went out to ask USC students how they feel about today\u2019s news media landscape. Erik Mosteller, a vocal arts and opera student, has trouble trusting the news.\n\nMOSTELLER: Everyone seems to have an agenda. And it seems like in order to get a news story to sell, people have to. I don\u2019t know either reach to a very far side of the political spectrum or they have to say things that get reactions out of people as opposed to just reporting, you know, the news and the facts.\n\nAlyssa Mirabal, a junior majoring in Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Studies, is cautious when consuming news.\n\nMIRABAL: I feel like a lot of, like, news, like stations will have like some sort of bias in it, Like, it\u2019s kind of, like, inherent. So there isn\u2019t a way to kind of, like, avoid it. But I do try to be conscientious of that fact when I am receiving any type of news that there is going to be some form of bias in it to kind of just take that into consideration. So I\u2019m not influenced in one specific direction per se.\n\nNot all students feel the same way about the news. Freshman journalism major Katie Simons plans to continue to pursue journalism, seeing it as too important of a cause to give up on, even with public scrutiny.\n\nSIMONS: To me, journalism has always been like a very integral part of democracy and like keeping conversations open and, like, flowing, I guess. And so I know I love writing and I think it\u2019s a really important form of media that we can\u2019t get rid of.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Kimberly Aguirre.\n```"}

The museum is expected to open in 2025. (Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Brooklyn Blasscyk April 24, 2023 at 4:28 pm PDT\n\nIn 2025, South Los Angeles residents can expect a new spacecraft to land in Exposition Park: the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art. After many trials and tribulations, the innovative museum has found its home right next door to USC, whether South L.A. is ready for it or not. Co-founded by Star Wars filmmaker George Lucas and Ariel Investments president and his wife Mellody Hobson, the museum will showcase the couple\u2019s personal art collection as well as some notable additions \u2014 including works from Frida Kahlo, Norman Rockwell and Maxfield Parrish.\n\nThe museum will be prioritizing all forms of narrative art and visual storytelling, from sculptures and photographs to comics and illustrations. The building will also be hosting two theaters, as well as classrooms for interactive workshops.\n\nAnd yet, with any new project in South L.A., there is room for hesitation. The billion dollar spacecraft is landing in a neighborhood where the median household income is $33,999, with no clear announced plan for local hiring once the museum opens; the museum did focus on hiring local contractors for the construction work.\n\nThe building, rounding out to be 300,000 square feet atop the property\u2019s 11 acre campus, is hard to miss, lining the side of Vermont Avenue and sandwiched between Exposition and Martin Luther King Jr. boulevards. Designed by acclaimed architect Ma Yansong, the futuristic project is full of Star Wars-esque elements, sleek and fit for a spaceship in a galaxy far, far away. Final renderings of the design include a waterfall and a rooftop garden space, setting the museum far apart from the current architectural makeup of the surrounding community.\n\nConstruction preparations began in January 2018, with an original planned opening for 2021. Yet, similar to most industries, the pandemic and supply chain issues forced construction to be prolonged, initially to 2023, and most recently to 2025, leaving part of the South L.A. neighborhood under perennial construction.\n\nThe museum\u2019s complicated history includes two other previously preferred (yet troubled) locations: San Francisco and Chicago. San Francisco serving as Lucas\u2019 hometown, Chicago as Hobson\u2019s. The doomed Northern California location was planned for historic Crissy Field (because there was simply not enough room one county over in Marin, home to Lucas\u2019s Skywalker Ranch, which is a mere 4,700 acres), but ultimately fell victim to failed initial negotiations. In Chicago, the museum was slated to be built on a property overlooking Lake Michigan, but was pushed out by harsh litigation from local environmental advocacy groups. By this point, the project was delayed until an invitation from Mayor Garcetti to give L.A. a shot. From there, the rest is history.\n\nUSC and the Lucas Museum have struck up a powerful camaraderie since the museum\u2019s relocation to Exposition Park. Lucas, who graduated from USC\u2019s School for Cinematic Arts in 1967, has been a generous alumni since his graduation, and his alma mater being just a street over from the site of his and his wife\u2019s passion project was a helping hand in the process.\n\nAs the Lucas Museum\u2019s managing director of social impact, Germonique Ulmer described USC was actually readily involved in the building\u2019s entitlement process, the legal process in which a developer attempts to gain approval from the local government to begin their real estate plans. This was later confirmed by David Galaviz, the associate vice president of USC\u2019s government and community relations office. Galaviz wrote in an email to Annenberg Media that USC was \u201cpleased to support initial introductions between museum leaders, local leaders and community members\u201d once the move to L.A. was finalized, where city council members unanimously agreed to move forward with development.\n\nThe museum is intent on adding to the already lively cultural landscape offered by Exposition Park, which is home to the Natural History Museum and California Science Center, as well as California\u2019s African American Museum. Further, the specific location serves as an educational hotspot. According to Ulmer, the precise location of the campus contains 500 kindergarten through college schools within a five mile radius.\n\n\u201cA lot of what we hope to do is to be able to provide programming for our students and young people and to be able to work with schools,\u201d Ulmer said.\n\nWhile the 11-acre museum will be built in replacement of a parking lot and will boast plenty of greenery and park space, residents and community members have not entirely welcomed the museum with open arms just yet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone asked us about building [the museum], but it\u2019s too late now,\u201d said South L.A. resident Canelda Reyez.\n\nFollowing backlash and concerns for gentrification from South L.A. community organizations due to the construction of the USC Village in 2017, new developments in the area face heavier scrutiny. However, the museum\u2019s construction team has held outreach meetings throughout the area since 2018, with a total attendance of over 1,000 individuals. In addition, there\u2019s record that the city held at least one public hearing regarding the construction in April 2017, inviting occupants or property owners within a 500 foot radius of the building. The museum also held three separate job fairs to match locals seeking construction jobs with hiring contractors.\n\nStill, this is not an entirely relieving effort for some residents.\n\n\u201cA lot of people say, well, the construction jobs, 30% of them are going to [local] people. But those are temporary jobs,\u201d said Adriana Cabrera, president of the Central Alameda Neighborhood Council and co-founder of South Central Mutual Aid, a community collective focused on confronting issues such as food insecurity and rent relief. Cabrera, who is heavily involved in South L.A. community affairs, stressed her concerns following the project\u2019s ongoing development.\n\n\u201cI called a lot of people that I know do a lot of important work in terms of art advocacy [and] cultural competency here in South Central to ask them like, \u2018Hey, has anyone from the Lucas Museum ever hit you up or reached out to you for support?\u2019 And they said no,\u201d Cabrera said.\u201dFor me, those are red flags that I know that we can change and we can transform.\u201d\n\nStill, links between the museum and university exist in creative fields, as well. The culmination of a museum dedicated to narrative art inspired professor of art at the Roski School of Art and Design Keith Mayerson to create a narrative art minor.\n\n\u201cSCA is on one side of Roski and the Lucas Museum is on the other. It just makes sense to do something about this and start a minor and a program,\u201d Mayerson said.\n\nThe curriculum, which currently has five classes in place this semester, is a collaborative effort between SCA, Roski and Dornsife, but is open to students of any major. Come fall, three more classes will be added to the program, in anticipation of more students taking on the minor. These classes are only available to current USC students, and as Ulmer emphasized, programming and workshops within the museum will be primarily focused on students within the area of all ages.\n\nWhile there is no direct promise on what workshops or special benefits will be offered to residents, \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of listening ... a lot of learning and a lot of connecting and engaging with the community to really understand what it is that the community wants and what it is that we ultimately [can do to] align with those needs and with those desires in our programming,\u201d Ulmer said.\n\nAs the time has passed for further input from members of the neighborhood, residents now can only look to the future.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have access to spaces that honor our passion for art, our passion for culture, you know,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201dHopefully this development provides us with that opportunity and serves as a model for our community to be able to collaborate with developers as they come to our neighborhood.\u201d\n\nAs the grand opening looms closer, South L.A. and its locals can only wait and see what impact a project of this grandeur will have on the community and its entwined culture.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: A previous version of this story stated that the museum\u2019s team held two job fairs rather than three. Several other details about the museum\u2019s development, including its waterfall plans, were corrected as well. Annenberg Media regrets these errors.\n```"}

(Photo by Cl\u00e9mence Feniou)\n\nBy Will Camardella April 23, 2023 at 10:53 pm PDT\n\nAfter an 8-3 loss on Friday night, USC baseball looked like it was in a tailspin. Less than 48 hours later, every member of the Trojans roster was in a mosh pit in the outfield of Dedeaux Field, celebrating a series victory over the No. 22 UCLA Bruins.\n\nDefeating rival UCLA two times out of three is always a major accomplishment for the Trojan program, but the two wins on Saturday and Sunday meant even more because of the resolve it showed. The team had dropped five straight games in the Pac-12 and sat just two games above .500 in conference play after a 9-2 start. Yet, the Trojans shook all that off and secured two come-from-behind wins to take their fifth conference series of the season.\n\n\u201cWe had a rough weekend in Corvallis,\u201d head coach Andy Stankiewicz said. \u201cIt takes courage, it takes fortitude and toughness to let it all go, forget about the past and focus on the present. We got kicked around a little bit, the guys said, \u2018Enough\u2019s enough, let\u2019s play some good baseball.\u2019 That\u2019s what they did in these last two games.\u201d\n\nFriday night\u2019s game was full of anticipation before the first pitch was even thrown. Dedeaux had its largest crowd of the season by far, with an announced attendance of 2,057. The Spirit of Troy and the Song Girls were in the stadium, and the ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by none other than Lincoln Riley. Riley\u2019s pitch was a perfect strike.\n\nUnfortunately for USC, the Trojan pitching staff did not have the same success on the mound as their head football coach. Junior starting pitcher Tyler Stromsborg had a rough start to his evening. The two teams exchanged runs in the first, but the Bruins hit back-to-back singles to put traffic on the bases once again in the second. With runners on second and third, junior designated hitter Carson Yates attempted a sacrifice bunt to score the runner from third. Stromsborg charged to the ball quickly, and attempted to throw out senior catcher Darius Perry. No further than ten feet from the plate, Stromsborg threw the ball to the backstop, allowing both Perry and sophomore center fielder Malakhi Knight to score unearned runs. The Bruins would tack on two more in the inning to lead 5-1.\n\nStromsborg was charged with three more earned runs in the sixth and could not finish the inning. The right-hander\u2019s 5.1 innings pitched was his shortest outing since March 3. Facing junior right hander Jake Brooks, the Trojans were unable to string any offense together throughout the night. They finished with more base hits than their opponents, but never put up a crooked number. The heart of the USC lineup could not find its way on base. The two-through-seven hitters recorded one base hit in 20 at bats.\n\nThe lone bright spot on an otherwise lost night was freshman center fielder Austin Overn. Leading off the bottom of the first inning, Overn made history, breaking Grant Green\u2019s record for triples in a single season by a Trojan with his 11th. The record had stood since 2007. Overn was hardly satisfied, as he then recorded his 12th three-bagger down the right-field line in the fifth.\n\nSaturday\u2019s game was a battle of ace pitchers. Sophomore right hander Caden Aoki entered the game with an ERA of 1.37, while sophomore Alonzo Tredwell had the fourth-lowest ERA in the conference among qualified pitchers. Naturally, not much scoring took place early. Aoki had yet another career day on the mound for USC. He pitched 6.1 innings \u2014 the first time he had ever pitched into the seventh as a starter \u2014 and set a new career high in strikeouts with eight. His only hiccup came in the fourth, when he allowed a solo home run to sophomore first baseman Jack Holman. Aoki has now allowed one run or fewer in seven of his eight appearances this season.\n\n\u201cAoki did a great job,\u201d Stankiewicz said. \u201cWe needed that shot in the arm, and it gave us some momentum going into [Sunday].\u201d\n\nWhile Aoki was dealing, the offense was struggling to hit Tredwell. The right-hander only needed 65 pitches to keep the Trojans off the board in the first five innings. Given how dominant Aoki had been, just one crooked number could give USC the edge it needed. The big offensive inning finally came in the bottom of the sixth. Junior left fielder Carson Wells went the other way with an RBI double that landed just inside the foul line to even the score. One at-bat later, senior third baseman Johnny Olmstead, who had been moved up to the cleanup spot that night, hit a pitch below his knees over the wall in left field for a two-run homer. Tredwell was knocked out of the game before he could get through the sixth, but USC was not done. Junior shortstop Ryan Jackson hit a two-run single with the bases loaded, giving the Trojans a 5-1 lead. That score would stand for the rest of the night, as neither sophomore left-hander Caden Connolly or redshirt junior righty Kyle Wisch allowed a Bruin to reach base while recording the final eight outs of the ballgame.\n\nRedshirt senior right-hander Blake Sodersten was sensational Sunday, pitching five innings of two-hit, shutout ball, tied for his longest outing of the season. Sophomore lefty Ethan Flanagan also had a career day in length for UCLA, but gave up solo homers to senior right fielder Gabrielson and freshman first baseman Ethan Hedges in his four and a third. USC took a quick 3-0 lead in the early innings, but failed to extend the lead at all by the time it went to its bullpen.\n\nJunior third baseman Kyle Karros, who had been 0-for-11 in the series thus far, turned the game on its head against Wisch in the seventh. He hit a bases-clearing double down the right field line that gave the Bruins a 5-3 lead. After losing a three-run lead in two innings, the Trojans were in desperate need of a break. It came in the bottom half of the seventh, when Overn hit a ball right between the legs of Holman at first base, putting runners on second and third. Redshirt freshman second baseman Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek got his team within a run with a long sacrifice fly, and Wells tied the game with a check-swing RBI single that landed in left field.\n\nWith the score now even in the late innings, each team turned to their elite reliever. USC pitched redshirt senior righty Garrett Clarke in both the eighth and the ninth, who stranded four UCLA baserunners in his two scoreless frames. With Clarke keeping the game tied, the drama shifted to the bottom of the ninth, as the Trojans looked for their first walk-off win of 2023. It would be no easy task, as they faced freshman reliever Cody Delvecchio, who entered the game with an ERA of 0.55. Yet, the team loaded the bases on singles by Jackson and Martin-Grudzielanek, as well as an intentional walk to Wells. With one out, Olmstead fouled out to third, putting the game in the bat of Gabrielson.\n\nGabrielson was 0-for-4 at the plate entering that at-bat, but all of that was about to be forgotten. He smoked a ball the other way to deep right field, where junior right fielder JonJon Vaughns was playing shallow, and the ball landed over his head onto the warning track to win the game.\n\n\u201cKudos to the guys in front of me for getting on base,\u201d Gabrielson said. \u201cWhen I got up there, I just looked for my pitch to drive. I wasn\u2019t trying to do too much, just needed a base hit. I felt like I was seeing it well, I got my hacks off and was able to get a good pitch I could drive. I\u2019m just happy I got the job done for the boys.\u201d\n\nAfter touching first base, Gabrielson sprinted out to left field to celebrate, before being mobbed by every member of the USC roster. His jersey was ripped off, the crowd of over 1,800 was in a frenzy and the Trojans had earned their first home series win against their crosstown rival since 2005.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty exciting,\u201d Stankiewicz said about the atmosphere over the weekend. \u201cWe want to play well for our family, our friends and our fans. We want them to be excited about coming back to Dedeaux. Hopefully this is the beginning of something we can continue to build on.\u201d\n\nThe series win improves USC to 24-14-1 on the season and 11-7 in the Pac-12. It will finish up a five-game homestand on Tuesday night with a nonconference bout against UC San Diego.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Charles Sykes/Invision/AP)\n\nBy Yvonne Abedi April 23, 2023 at 8:50 pm PDT\n\nSinger Frank Ocean made waves Wednesday night by announcing that he was pulling out as a headliner for the second weekend of the Coachella music festival. In a statement to TMZ, the singer\u2019s team said he \u201csuffered an injury on festival grounds a week leading up to the performance.\u201d The statement also said that Ocean performed during weekend one due to the fans\u2019 anticipation of his performance, but not in the capacity that he had planned to or that his fans had hoped to see. The statement said that per his doctor\u2019s orders, Ocean isn\u2019t allowed to perform because of two fractures and a sprain in his left leg.\n\nThis past Sunday, Ocean took the stage for the first time in over six years. His return was highly anticipated, with fans traveling from all over the world to see his performance. He was set to headline Coachella in 2020, but due to COVID the festival was postponed leaving fans disappointed. It was said that Ocean arrived over an hour late into his two hour set, which led to security having to end the show earlier than expected due to the strict curfew Coachella has in place. Many fans had been camping in the sun since 12 p.m. that afternoon waiting for the singer to take the stage.\n\nDuring the performance, he performed his first two songs behind the stage. Fans weren\u2019t able to see him during the majority of the performance because of the unorthodox stage set-up. Fans stated that he could barely be seen on screen, blocked by the dancers on stage, and seated too far back on the stage. He also left the stage or stopped performing multiple times during his set, leaving the audience in a sea of silence. Festival-goers on TikTok shared that he only performed about five songs, the majority of which he lip-synced to while vibing around the stage, which left many fans saying they felt like they attended a listening party not a performance. Many fans began to leave throughout his set because they felt as though it wasn\u2019t worth it, and some even took to the internet to say they felt scammed.\n\nAccording to Variety, his initial stage design was supposed to have an ice rink. However, at the last minute, Ocean had to make changes to the stage design due to an ankle injury he experienced during rehearsals, said TMZ. According to the Festival Owl on Twitter, Ocean wouldn\u2019t perform until the ice rink was melted down. This was said to have been the reason he was late to his set. Fans who weren\u2019t able to attend the show were also left disappointed after YouTube tweeted \u201cFrank Ocean is not scheduled to appear on the Coachella live stream.\u201d Many fans at the performance were resourceful and decided to live stream the show themselves for the fans at home.\n\nOcean has come out with a statement to TMZ about his drop from the festival saying, \u201cIt was chaotic. There is beauty in the chaos. It isn\u2019t what I intended to show but I did enjoy being out there and I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d\n\nOcean hasn\u2019t announced plans to tour or perform again soon, as he alluded to in his previous statement, but this series of events may have scared potential concertgoers away. Blink-182 is set to replace Ocean as the headliner this upcoming weekend. Last time Frank Ocean was replaced it was by Drake in 2019 and his fans boo\u2019ed him off stage.\n```"}

USC came up short 4-3 in the match and are now 15-8 overall and 6-4 in conference play. The Bruins wiped the floor with the Trojans, winning the first point by defeating the Trojans in doubles. When the play paused, freshman Emma Charney and graduate Nathalie Rodilosso were trailing at 5-4.\n\nThe pressure was immense for the Trojans as they had to win four of the six singles matches to win. Charney tied the score after defeating Ava Catanzarite with barely a scratch, 6-0, 6-2. \u201cLosing doubles is tough because then you have to win four singles,\u201d Charney said. \u201cBut I just went out there and focused on my singles match, and it was nice to get a quick win so I could go out there and support my teammates after I finished.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Bruins gained the upper hand when junior Naomi Cheong lost 6-3, 6-2, and freshman Maddy Sieg lost 6-4, 6-3.

Redshirt sophomore Snow Han fought until the last minute, winning the first set 6-2 despite losing to No. 106 Hance in the last two.\n\n\u201cI think the fight was there. We dug in, we came out on top of a third set.

But certainly, shout out to all our players for really digging in and trying to find a way on their courts.\u201d\n\nCharney talked about what she\u2019s looking forward to the most in the Pac-12 tournament: \u201cIt\u2019s my first time. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a really fun tournament, so I\u2019m super excited to play teams and hopefully get the chance to play teams that we\u2019ve lost to this season and go there and get some revenge.

My early years lent themselves to meals of little flavor or extravagance. For dinner, a simple bowl of buttered fusilli noodles or Jasmine rice often found a seat at my placemat. But one dish with slightly more gusto always excited me. The understated potatoes au gratin.\n\nGrowing up with a mother from Utah, potatoes were a staple in my household. With a simple layer of cheese and sprinkle of light thyme seasoning, Potatoes au gratin became a quick comfort food option when she worked late. Except we called this recipe something else in my household. We called them \u201cfuneral potatoes.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m an only child, but my mom comes from a large, overwhelmingly religious family. My cousins, while usually several years my senior, became my fill-in brothers and sisters. I was the youngest grandchild of my mother\u2019s siblings and am often still lovingly referred to as \u201cbaby Rachel.\u201d\n\nBut being so much younger than the rest of my big family ushered in another reality of life: experiencing death early on. In the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-day Saints, funerals are often elaborate events. There\u2019s the viewing, the service, the wake and, of course, the buffet. My family\u2019s funerals were always celebrations of life. They were a chance to get together in remembering someone special, all over a delicious meal.\n\nAs a kid, these moments of emotional connection struck me. I remember watching my mother embrace my aunt at my grandfather\u2019s wake. They cried and laughed and scooped a heaping portion of green bean casserole onto each other\u2019s teetering platters in the buffet line. I thought it was beautiful \u2014 that all three of those things could happen at the same time.\n\nWhile the buffet meals often changed, one dish always appeared without fail. My cousins and I slopped massive scoops of the funeral potatoes onto our Dixie brand paper plates. We\u2019d test the amount each plate could hold, and whooped with excitement as they sagged under the weight of mozzarella, parmesan and gruyere. At the kids table we dug in. The boys shoveled their potato slices quickly, plate and lip always connected by at least one straggling string of mozzarella cheese. Us girls approached our meals a little slower. With a meticulous eye, we plucked the tiny thyme leaves out, one by one, before finally giving up and following the boy\u2019s suit.\n\nI grew up in the Bay Area and while I spent many of my school breaks in Utah, I always felt a small sense of removal from the rest of my family. These funerals were a place to reconnect in a more vulnerable way. They were moments of love, despair, joy and gregariousness \u2014 each emotion like a separate layer of potato, bubbling about in my beloved buffet dish. No matter how far we strayed from our home in Utah, we remained connected, like a string of mozzarella cheese. The funeral potatoes always brought us back together.\n```"}

Individually, Avery and Park tied for third place at 4 under par, Nam tied for ninth at 2 under par and Kou tied for 20th for the tournament.\n\n\u201cAmari Avery came up huge \u2014 she\u2019s our top-ranked player in the world,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cShe knew that she needed to put up a big round in the final round for us to hold off two or three of the best teams in the country, and she did that. She birdied three of her last four holes.\u201d\n\nSilverstein additionally noted that Park has been a stabilizing factor for the team the past few weeks, which is a great sign considering she\u2019s only a freshman.\n\nAvery, Kou and Park were all selected onto the 2023 Pac-12 All-Conference team, and junior Brianna Navarossa was awarded Honorable Mention honors.\n\nSilverstein explained that regardless of specific honors and achievements, all six USC golfers stood out. This was the only event of the year where substitutions were allowed because normally the maximum number of players is five, and all six players had counting scores for the week.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a testament to our depth, and something that we pride our program on is recruiting really well top-to-bottom of the roster, and not just focusing on our top five and continuing to develop players that are not regularly in our starting lineup,\u201d Silverstein said.\n\nReflecting back on the moment that USC won the tournament, Silverstein explained that seeing the scoreboard after completing the 16th hole, the team knew they had effectively clinched the title. After Park sank her final putt on the 18th hole, the team ran on the green and doused Silverstein with water.\n\n\u201cIt was cool to see them jumping up and down screaming, and seeing how far they\u2019d come,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cSeeing them put on the championship merch never gets old.\u201d\n\nLooking into the future, the Trojans will compete in the NCAA Regional Championships on May 8, and next week they will find out where they are headed.\n\n\u201cWe are excited for the challenge to prove some people wrong, but we have to take care of business at Regionals before we can get to [the NCAA Championships] and worry about winning another big trophy,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cWe have historically been the best regional program in the country and have won considerably more of those than any other team, so we\u2019re looking to carry on that legacy. But it\u2019s gonna start in the preparation, so we\u2019ll find a way to get them re-motivated and get ready for that.\u201d\n```"}

{"key": "/2023/04/21/voters-and-residents-weigh-in-4-months-after-karen-bass-took-office/", "response": "```\nVoters and residents weigh in four months after Karen Bass took office\n\nBy Jianing Liang April 21, 2023 at 4:27 pm PDT\n\nAfter first being elected to the California State Assembly in 2004 and later to Congress, Karen Bass returned to her hometown of Los Angeles to run for mayor. Defeating her opponent Rick Caruso, she currently stands at an approval rate of roughly 50% among Angelenos, according to a poll from Suffolk University/L.A. Times conducted between March 9-12, which was similar to her predecessor Eric Garcetti who stood at an approval of 56% in his first 100 days as mayor. This number shows that residents are hopeful about this new administration and the leadership skills of Mayor Bass.\n\n\u201cSince Karen Bass took office, more people are coming in, and they find Bass to be more approachable,\u201d said Cecily Chan, a constituent representative serving city hall. \u201cOne thing people are excited about is Bass has more resources in her connection with other political institutions than her predecessor Eric Garcetti, as she can pull more funding and resources from state and federal government.\u201d\n\nHowever, one can definitely make the case that it is a more difficult task to lead the second most populated city in America with many more crises than her previous position as a congresswoman. L.A.\u2019s homelessness crisis has long been such an issue that plagues the city that people are losing confidence in government officials despite the leadership. One of the root causes of homelessness is the soaring rent costs in L.A. The latest Zillow data shows that median rent cost in LA is $3,000 as of March, while the national median is $1,937.\n\nIn February, one of Bass\u2019 first plans as mayor was to push the city council to pass the extension of the pandemic-era eviction ban in an effort to keep tenants in their homes. It has been a victory for progressive advocates, who have long claimed that landlords are the primary cause of homelessness and why so many are unhoused. Jason Reedy from the social justice organization People\u2019s City Council gave Bass compliments on the move. \u201c[A] majority of the rental houses being offered in the market are owned by big corporations who come into the city and speed up gentrification,\u201d Reedy said. \u201cLandlords are scums.\u201d He also believes that evictions should not be existing, because it is a violent and cruel act carried out by police that results in the death of people.\n\nWhen it comes to directly addressing homelessness, he said that Karen Bass has done something, but there are still people being left behind. Sasha Hussain, the president of Trojan Democrats, a student and USC-based political organization that advocates for Democratic policies and supports Democratic candidates, also said that she is glad to see Bass is taking some new measures to make sure more people are being housed, which will definitely make an impact on USC student\u2019s daily lives. In 2020 when the pandemic hit, despite various financial aid, some 2000 USC students experienced homelessness or had experienced homelessness in the past year.\n\n\u201cI think USC also has gentrified this area ... a lot of the issues Karen Bass supports that she has been talking about are very very applicable to our surrounding community as USC students,\u201d Hussain said. Yet the eviction ban extension also highlights the long-existing conflict between landlords and tenants. Jacqueline Kan, a real estate agent who has been working in the industry for decades primarily with customers with a Chinese background, said \u201cthe politicians do not understand the \u2018suffering of the masses.\u2019\u201d\n\nMany of her customers are ordinary middle-class home buyers who spend half of their lives accumulating wealth and are looking for a place to invest in. As a real estate agent, Kan explained that \u201cindividual landlords are spending a lot of their time and money to make sure their houses are being kept in good shape.\u201d She further expressed the detriments of strict rent control and policies that crush their profit. For example, in Santa Monica, voters last year passed a measure that limits annual allowable rent increase to 3%, or $19 a month, landlords will not have the incentive to provide proper maintenance to the house. Particularly, with the challenge of high inflation in the past year, every homeowner was also having a heavier economic burden on themselves.\n\nIn this case, when the profit for landlords shrinks, they will be reluctant in fixing water pipes, lawns and many other facilities in their houses. Furthermore, the increasing cost of renting their houses will force the landlords to collect more deposits and enhance renter background checks, making it even harder for low-income renters to become housed. Bass\u2019 challenge does not stop in housing. Another issue that residents have called out is police brutality, which many believe is responsible for three deaths involved in police activities at the beginning of 2023.\n\n\u201cThere have been more than 1600 emails sent to her office protesting Karen Bass in her reappointment of police chief Michael Moore, who has been a controversial figure as people accuse him of being responsible for police brutality in LAPD,\u201d Chan said. In regard to this, Reedy expressed his disappointment to Bass, as she campaigned on holding the police force accountable. He also said that Bass was by no means a true progressive whom many of her constituents believed her to be, and that \u201cHe (Moore) has overseen one of the most murderous police departments year over year. He was the head of the police department when they bombed the neighborhood in South Central in 2017, no one was held responsible for that. \"\n\n\u201cThere definitely needs to be some accountability,\u201d Hussain said. She also said that she is glad there are people who are protesting and trying to hold Karen Bass on her campaign promises. In this divided era, we need strong leadership that can deliver results to our city. While 100 days is far from enough to see any substantial change to be made, we will keep an eye on how she is leading the city in the years to come.\n```"}

California lawmakers are flush with money and unfinished business from last year as they return to the state Capitol, Monday, Jan. 3. Gov. Gavin Newsom promised he will seek $100 million to clean up homeless encampments in his state budget proposal that he must present by Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)\n\nBy Claire Sures, Matthew Tsai, and Charlotte Shook April 21, 2023 at 4:01 pm PDT\n\nOn Thursday, a judge reviewed a proposed settlement with the Los Angeles Alliance for Human Rights that would advocate for the addition of 1,450 hospital beds for unhoused people with mental illness or substance abuse. If ruled in favor, the beds would be seen active over the next few years. But, U.S. District Judge David O. Carter rejected the country\u2019s settlement proposal due to an insufficient number of beds and a desire for more oversight on the project.\n\nLast November, Carter rejected a similar deal requesting about 300 beds. Carter said the settlement wouldn\u2019t provide nearly enough beds for the unhoused and claimed county officials could come up with a more adequate solution. \u201cBare minimum\u201d is how Carter described the county\u2019s most recent offer during this Thursday\u2019s case in regards to aiding people experiencing homelessness in L.A.\n\nIn 2019, a county report determined that the necessary amount of beds would be around 3,000. Experts say the number of unhoused people with mental health or substance abuse issues has only risen since then. L.A. settled with L.A. Alliance last September. The county committed $236 million, and the city $74 million, to fund homeless services over the next five years.\n\nMayor Karen Bass made homelessness a key part of her campaign. She declared it a state emergency her first day in office. The new deal proposed about 1,550 beds short of what the 2019 report determined would be necessary to provide relief for the L.A. homeless community.\n\n\u201cWhile we were pleased that the County had agreed to five times the number of beds that it had offered in October, this new number is still far short,\u201d said L.A. Alliance for Human Rights in a statement made yesterday. \u201cOur goal is a global settlement ... that global settlement must address the needs of the people of Los Angeles \u2014 those experiencing homelessness who need beds, treatment and safety.\u201d\n\nCarter also reprimanded county officials for not taking initiative in providing mental health and substance treatment beds sooner and stated that the county has the appropriate funding to take action. This is in regards to the county\u2019s $40 billion plus annual budget. \u201cThe county should have done this years ago without even coming before the federal court,\u201d Carter said. \u201dDon\u2019t throw the lack of money at me from the county\u2019s perspective.\u201d\n\nAnother one of Carter\u2019s main concerns with the proposed deal was the lack of authority given to him which would provide him the ability to closely monitor whether county officials were following through on their commitments. County officials opposed this notion arguing that money spent on the courts special counsel monitor should instead go directly to aiding individuals with home insecurity.\n\n\u201cEvery single resource needs to be devoted to helping people on the streets, not attorneys,\u201d said Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, who was in attendance at the hearing.\n\nNow, the case transitions to a traditional lawsuit, with hearings in the upcoming weeks. This means the county\u2019s timeline for implementing additional beds for the homeless will depend on the proceedings of the lawsuit. Carter pointed out that the county does not require a settlement in order to move forward with new bed provisions. Board of Supervisors Chair Janice Hahn reported to LAist that work is already in progress.\n```"}

Students and Los Angeles designers will be displaying their work at the Fashion Industry Association fashion show. The theme for this year is \u201cwonder,\u201d one could only wonder what to expect at the event and how the FIA team is preparing for their big night.\n\nThe fashion show has been in the works since January, involving various working parts including the casting, design, modeling and outreach teams, along with the supervising executive board and other FIA members. Simone Brown, a junior majoring in communication and co-president of FIA, shared that FIA is shaking things up this year and trying new things for their show.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating a reception before the show that\u2019s kind of on theme, so we\u2019re going to have tattoo artists, poker, tarot readers, magicians, music and food,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSo that kind of space for people to enjoy, and get to know each other and just have a nice evening in L.A.\u201d\n\nJustina Chou, a freshman majoring in world bachelors of business and a member of the FIA outreach team, is most excited about the reception before the show and the general social scene expected at the event. The outreach team has invited surprise VIP guests to attend, which Chou shares she is genuinely excited about.\n\nThe event is an opportunity for USC students to mingle and connect with members of the fashion community. FIA also opens the opportunity for USC students, alum and designers in the L.A. area to design for their fashion shows. Designers can apply through a Google form, then the FIA team considers the designer\u2019s previous work, style and vision for the show, according to Chou.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited for people to see, of course, the designs because I have been able to see the iterations of what the designers are working on,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to see them go from sketches to actual pieces.\u201d\n\nThe casting team held two casting calls for students to audition and become a model for the FIA fashion show, two months ago. Models were asked to wear dark, form-fitting clothing for the audition along with heels for female-presenting models. Students lined up in the PED hallways in order to audition and be cast as part of the show. They walked in small groups demonstrating their runway walk to the casting team.\n\nRui Zhang is a freshman and was selected as a model for this year\u2019s FIA fashion show, which will be their first time ever walking in a real fashion show.\n\n\u201c[The casting team] asked us to walk, which is nerve-wracking. Especially because there are definitely people there who have actually walked in a fashion show before,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cSo it\u2019s kind of scary, but a pretty cool experience.\u201d\n\nThe modeling team has been rehearsing their walks as a group, often rehearsing in empty practice rooms and outdoors. They have also been working closely with the designers, going through fittings to ensure the clothes fit properly before hitting the runway.\n\nThe casting team was responsible for selecting a group of over 30 models to walk the runway at this year\u2019s show.\n\n\u201cI think our show is really, really diverse, which I thought was so cool and there\u2019s, I think, a really great variety of people who have some experience modeling and some people have never done it before.\u201d Zhang said.\n\nWith no official major and only a few fashion courses offered, there are limited opportunities for the fashion community at USC. However, FIA offers opportunities for students to gain real-life and first-hand experience with running a fashion show.\n\nFor the members of the FIA, their love for fashion pushed them to create a community.\n\n\u201cI was really interested and really wanted to do something hands-on with fashion, so that\u2019s why I applied this semester,\u201d Chou said.\n\nZhang recalls not having the chance to do much stuff on campus yet as a freshman, but is grateful for the people they\u2019ve met through this project.\n\n\u201cI feel this experience really exposed me to this whole other group of people on campus that I didn\u2019t even know existed. They\u2019re like the coolest people ever, so it\u2019s been great,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nBrown agreed that there are limited opportunities for people interested in fashion at USC, but is proud to be a member of one of the campus\u2019 biggest fashion clubs including their diverse team.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really grateful that our club is very diverse and open to anyone, regardless of age or background.\u201d Brown said.\n\nAs the annual fashion show vastly approaches, FIA continues to prepare for its big night of \u201cwonder.\u201d The event starts this Saturday at 7 p.m. and will be held in downtown L.A.

{"key": "/2023/04/21/rest-in-peace-buzzfeed-news/", "response": "```\nThe lights are being turned off for BuzzFeed News. Following multiple hefty workforce reductions, BuzzFeed News can no longer financially support themselves as an independent news outlet. CEO and founder Jonah Peretti announced in a company-wide memo via email on Thursday that they would be making a 15% cut from the workforce at the outlet across all departments. Additionally, he added that they would begin the process of closing BuzzFeed News.\n\nWhile this heavy email may seem to have come out of left field, this is not the first instance of an abrupt staff reduction for \u201ccost cutting.\u201d According to an article published by USA Today, In December 2022 a similar instance occurred where Peretti released a statement that BuzzFeed News would be laying off roughly 12% of its staff. This process is still active and shifting but, Peretti added, while BuzzFeed News will no longer stand on its own, it will be merging with HuffPost, an outlet acquired by BuzzFeed in 2020.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, we will have a single news brand in HuffPost, which is profitable, with a loyal direct front page audience,\u201d Peretti said to  USA Today . For some of those who were laid off, this closure is not the end for their career as there will be some parallel job opportunities awaiting them at HuffPost.\n\nTo see BuzzFeed News be battered away amidst this situation is an unexpected circumstance considering it is regarded in the field of journalism as an iconic and imperative news outlet. Just two years ago, BuzzFeed News was awarded its first Pulitzer Prize for its international reporting. If that wasn\u2019t enough to explain how important the platform has been, it has also won a George Polk Award, a Sidney Award, a National Magazine Award and the National Press Foundation Award. It is no secret that BuzzFeed News encapsulated all that was needed to be an influential news source when you note all that it has been recognized for.\n\nHowever, the consistent pursuit for accelerated revenue might have been the final straw. According to an article by  Current Affairs , \u201cPeretti has been ruthlessly focused on maximizing traffic by any content necessary.\u201d The founder has pointed the blame to the COVID-19 pandemic, tech recession, tough economy, declining stock market, ongoing audience and platform shifts to explain why the outlet will no longer see the light of day. In the  USA Today  article Peretti admitted, \u201cI could have managed these changes better as the CEO of this company and our leadership team could have performed better despite these circumstances.\u201d\n\nSo, the question that bears to be answered, what does the future of investigative journalism look like without BuzzFeed News? It is truly the end of an era. BuzzFeed News made a substantial mark in digital media that other sources didn\u2019t prioritize. Despite being such a popular platform, it remained as an accessible source with no pay walls. It did not require a subscription with a monthly payment to view its content, which is a rarity in today\u2019s media landscape.\n\nOn the topic of accessibility, it encompassed an open mind that allowed for all generations to have their voices heard. Sasha Urban, a student at USC, has written articles for BuzzFeed News covering sexual abuse on college campuses. It is crucial that outlets utilize their platforms to produce media that other generations find important to shine a light on. In this case, they supported Urban\u2019s push to exploit these heinous issues that oftentimes get swept under the rug.\n\nThe future of BuzzFeed News in its next stage is to be determined. It will be interesting to see if it continues to uphold these standards in its merge with Huffpost, or if its image will be completely decimated along with its name.\n```"}

Trousdale is expected to be filled with over 150,000 people eager to dive into the different worlds of literature. Over 300 exhibitions and more than 500 authors will be in attendance including author Daniel Nieh (knee-aye). He will be at the festival for the first time with his most recent book Take No Names. This heist thriller comes out in paperback in a couple of weeks.\n\nAlthough he has been to two other book festivals, Nieh explains the significance of this book festival. A festival that allows for readers and authors to connect on a personal level.\n\nDaniel Nieh: It\u2019s an opportunity for people who maybe mostly spend their time writing in a little, you know, tree house or cave or whatever to get out interact and learn about readers and what they\u2019re interested in and opportunities for readers to interact with writers. And everyone gets together and socializes at the same time. You know, it gives us authors a chance to talk about our work and the platform other than social media, you know, and it gives people who want to buy books the opportunity to kind of browse in a way that you can still do in a bookstore.\n\nAs well as connecting with readers, Nieh emphasizes the excitement that comes with connecting with fellow authors.\n\nNieh: To see just this packed room full of people who are just stoked on books on a Saturday morning is a wonderful feeling for a writer. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve changed individual things that I do. But when I go to a book festival after spending, you know, months and years on my own wondering if anyone\u2019s ever going to read this writing, if people are excited about books when there\u2019s always Netflix, you know, it\u2019s a really great feeling to just feel the enthusiasm at book festival.\n\nNieh also dived into his passion for writing and what motivates him.\n\nNieh: To me when I write. I\u2019m just trying to tell a story that is interesting, exciting, and emotionally resonant to me personally. So in many ways, I\u2019m just trying to write a book like the book I would like to read or have. Say No Names, I was thinking about that joy of reading feeling when you\u2019re dying to know what happens next. And you get to the end of the chapter and like, you know, you should go to the gym or even like, the bathroom, but like, you\u2019ve got to read that next chapter and it\u2019s just like downhill skiing. Like, you just it feels like you lose yourself in a story. So that\u2019s the kind of experience I\u2019m trying to offer through this book, because I remember, you know, reading exciting page-turning thrillers that I lost myself in.\n\nWhen asked about his goal while writing a book, Nieh mentioned writing a book that reminds him of how he fell in love with the pages.\n\nNieh: I remember, you know, reading exciting page-turning thrillers that I lost myself in. It\u2019s so hard these days to lose track of time, and I\u2019m trying to write a story that allows readers that experience.\n\nTo hear more about Take No Names, catch Nieh at his mystery thriller international intrigue panel on Sunday from 10 to 11 a.m.\n\nFor Annenberg Media I\u2019m Andie Kalinowski.\n```"}

According to Business Insider, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is worth more than $25 billion worldwide, turning comic book characters into desired roles by A-list celebrities and dedicated theme park attractions like \u201cAvengers Campus\u201d outfitted with merchandise, rides, and costumed actors. What was previously considered a genre for \u201cgeeks\u201d and \u201cdorks\u201d, these blockbuster films have revolutionized the way super heroes are now seen, and have turned 60% of adults in the United States into superfans.\n\nToday, the emergence of popularity continues to rise to higher heights and their notoriety has sparked the interest in fans of the films visiting comic bookstores to discover where their favorite crime-fighting vigilantes come from. Geoffrey Patterson Jr., the owner of Hi De Ho Comics in LA and Geoffrey\u2019s Comics in Torrance, spoke on the evolution of the image of comic books through the decades.\n\nGeoffrey Patterson Jr.: I mean, well, this has changed so much because. As recently as just 15 years ago. Comic books like would be looked at differently at a dinner party. If you mentioned you read comic books, you know, and now it\u2019s just another thing that people read. I think that to me is the biggest change is how there are people who just casually read some comic books nowadays.\n\nAlthough the rapid growth of these movies have only taken increase in the 21st Century, many of these local comic book stores have been around since the mid 70s with passionate comic book enthusiasts like Patterson Jr\u2019s father, opening Hi De Ho Comics in 1977, a store Patterson Jr. expressed held a special connection to through his bonding experience with his father everyday after-school as a boy.\n\nPatterson: Oh, well, my dad opened the comic book store before I was born, and so I was very much born into a comic book store. So just every day after school run from school to the comic book store, because that\u2019s where my dad was. And we would read comic books and watch cartoons and do all kinds of fun stuff. And so that\u2019s kind of what comic books always meant to me was fun and spending time with your dad and just all that kind of good stuff.\n\nWarren Jaycox is the owner of Galaxy of Comics in Van Nuys feels that both the visual creativity that comics have always had along with the film industry constantly producing films have helped to grow comic book popularity.\n\nWarren Jaycox: These are it is a very visual story. So it allows you to kind of put put yourself in it. You know, if you\u2019re if you\u2019ve got a good imagination, you know, sometimes these comics can be read like, you know, like a good movie. And I think a lot of I think a lot of of, you know, producers of television and and movies kind of recognize that, you know what I mean? And that\u2019s why they\u2019ve taken a lot of these stories and made them into movies and television. But yeah, I think that\u2019s why we why we enjoy it. You know, they\u2019re very visual.\n\nJaycox also spoke on how he sees people of various ages, ethnicities, and cultures in his store who love comics.\n\nJaycox: Honestly, they\u2019re all over the place. There\u2019s just there\u2019s so there\u2019s so many of, you know, different kinds of customers that we that we\u2019ve got, you know, all the way from, you know, 60 or 70 year olds have been, you know, literally buying the stuff all their lives to, you know, to kids or just discovering them, you know, come in with their families, returning fans who rent them, you know, as a kid or a young adult come back now that they\u2019ve got a family, there\u2019s you know, it\u2019s kind of all over the place.\n\nThe film industry using movies and television shows have brought back many industries, and for no industry is that more than comic books.

{"key": "/2023/04/21/opinion-what-public-relations-really-means/", "response": "```\nOPINION: What public relations really means\n\nWe are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, and our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.\n\nA vintage newspaper advertising for Lucky Strike cigarettes (The Scranton PA Republican, October 8, 1929)\n\nBy Matthew Calma April 21, 2023 at 12:10 pm PDT\n\nThe year was 1928 and the United States had a lot of problems. One was a lack of women\u2019s rights. Another, one seemingly more pressing to the American Tobacco Company, was that women were not smoking. The American Tobacco Company was only able to tap into half of the American market. Not wanting to be seen as \u201cunwomanly,\u201d women in the U.S. chose not to smoke. To the American Tobacco Company, it seemed that traditional gender roles could be an impediment on the revenue. George Washington Hill, the president of the American Tobacco Company, set out to double his company\u2019s market and did so by employing Edward Bernays, the man who was testing out a new industry that we now know as public relations.\n\nThe public relations industry has evolved into a multibillion dollar industry in the United States. The tobacco industry has continued using the art of public relations to go from the co-opting of first wave feminism to targeting the LGBTQ+ community of today as a new profitable market.\n\nBernays saw a creative opportunity to use the growing rebellion of the first wave feminist movement of the 1920s to the company\u2019s advantage by creating the Torches of Freedom Campaign. The plan was simple: Bernay\u2019s employed his secretary, who brought along other women, to smoke a Lucky Strike cigarette, the company owned by the American Tobacco Company, during the Easter Parade on March 31, 1929. The press was alerted that a group of women would be smoking cigarettes during the parade, and the next day The New York Times published a story titled, \u201cGroup of Girls Puff at Cigarettes as a Gesture of \u2018Freedom\u2019\u201d. Under the guise of supporting feminism and women\u2019s liberation, Bernays created a socially scandalous event that encouraged women to smoke cigarettes. Cigarettes became a form of rebellion in women\u2019s minds, and they were more than happy to rebel against a social structure that sought to hold them back. For the American Tobacco Company, sales doubled for the American Tobacco Company from 1923 to 1929. For women, not much could be said about how smoking cigarettes contributed to their liberation.\n\nThe tobacco industry has benefited much from Edward Bernays\u2019 art of public relations. Today, Big Tobacco, quite similar to the American Tobacco Company co-opting the feminist movement in 1928, has used tactics of public relations to target the LGBTQ+ demographic in their pursuit of profit. In 2000, documents from R.J Reynolds leaked to the press detailed what they titled \u201cProject SCUM\u201d or Project SubCulture Urban Marketing, an advertising campaign targeting young gay men and the homeless in San Francisco. The campaign aimed at the LGBTQ+ community has proven to be effective over the years. 1 in 4 queer adults smoke, compared to 1 in 6 straight adults. Queer individuals are twice as likely to start smoking before the age of 13 than their straight counterparts. A group that is already oppressed is being targeted with a product that kills. The LGBTQ+ community has much higher rates of anxiety and depression, which are higher predictors of tobacco use, while tobacco simultaneously increases these mental conditions. Just as the Torches of Freedom Campaign of 1928 by the American Tobacco Company, smoking by the queer community has been seen as a part of counterculture. For many young individuals who feel exiled from society, smoking has been sold to them as a means of self-empowerment in a packaged form of rebellion.\n\nEdward Bernays, prior to his 1928 cigarette campaign, was employed at the Committee on Public Information, the Federal Government\u2019s propaganda organization tasked with motivating Americans to support joining World War 1. After the war ended he realized, \u201cif you could use propaganda for war, you could certainly use it for peace.\u201d Bernays stated that the Germans gave \u201cpropaganda\u201d a bad name during the 1930s, so he couldn\u2019t use that term. Instead, he created the title\u201dpublic relations\u201d. Bernays utilization of public relations on the American public would be motivated by his uncle Sigmund Freud\u2019s theory of the \u201cgroup mind\u201d. The Freudian group mind is the idea that groups are composed of the unconscious life of each member. The group cannot be understood without understanding the other members of the group and that the individual cannot be separated from the group that they are a part of. The overwhelming success of propaganda, and therefore public relations, is predicated on this freudian idea.\n\nDuring Edward Bernays\u2019 time at the Committee on Public Information, he worked with Walter Lippmann, an American journalist who created the concept of the \u201cCold War\u201d in reference to US and Soviet Union global tensions, and who also coined the term \u201cstereotype\u201d. He is most noted for his critique of democracy and the media. In his book, The Phantom Public, published in the 1920s, he states that \u201cThe public must be put in its place so that each of us may live free of the trampling and the roar of a bewildered herd.\u201d. What Walter Lippmann was referring to as the \u201cbewildered herd\u201d was the ordinary person participating in democracy and therefore the decision making regarding society and people. Lippmann believed that \u201cthe masses\u201d were incapable or unwilling, or both, of making the proper decisions for society. Therefore, the masses are not to be active participants in the democratic process, they are meant to be spectators and let a small group of \u201ceducated\u201d and \u201ccapable\u201d men make the decisions for society. Bernay\u2019s looked up to Lippmann and his ideas regarding the public and their opinion. In his 1928 book Propaganda, he states in direct alignment with the ideas expressed by Walter Lippmann,\u201dThe conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.\u201d Bernays makes clear in Propaganda that, \u201cmass production is profitable only if its rhythm can be maintained. Business cannot afford to wait until the public asks for its product. It must maintain constant touch, through advertising and propaganda... to assure itself the continuous demand which alone will make its costly plant profitable.\u201d Our desires must be created for us, we do not have enough on our own to drive the profit economy. Introductory economic courses in college teach students that consumers are rational, making the best decisions based on what is important to them. But if you have ever been sold anything, you are well aware that the advertisements are not treating their audiences as rational consumers, rather they target your heart.\n```"}

They enter the main hall (Darbar Hall) and bow to the Guru Granth Sahib and eat langar. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual Baisakhi celebrations, called the Nagar Kirtan, was held online for the past three years. This year, it was held in person where thousands of people from California and out-of-state congregated to celebrate around downtown L.A.\n\nThe theme of this year\u2019s Baisakhi celebrations was the \u201cPanj Pyare,\u201d which means \u201cfive loved ones\u201d in Punjabi. Baisakhi is the holiday based on the story of five brave souls who were willing to sacrifice their lives for the Sikh Panth. The sakhi, or fable of the Baisakhi holiday, depicts Bhai Daya Singh, Bhai Dharam Singh, Bhai Himmat Singh, Bhai Mohkam Singh and Bhai Sahib Singh who stepped up and gave their lives for their guru.\n\nNagar Kirtan is loosely defined as the singing of hymns in a residential area and consists of the Sikh congregation parading around the neighborhood chanting prayers and hymns. In this year\u2019s Nagar Kirtan, the streets around the L.A. Convention Center were closed down. Prior to the parade, the Sikh congregation gathered inside the Convention Center for prayers inside the Darbar Hall. Outside the convention center, speakers discussed the current state of Indian oppression in Punjab. Many wore or carried flags representing the Khalsa panth (Sikh congregation). The protest is an attempt to bring light to the arrests of Sikh activists and media blackouts happening in Punjab right now.\n\nNagar Kirtan participants line up in the Darbar Hall to pay their respects to the holy book known as the Guru Granth Sahib.

Polyethylene, the least recycled of the large-scale plastics, is commonly found in products such as plastic water bottles, disposable cups and plastic bags, while polystyrene plastics are used in CD and DVD cases, as well as Styrofoam products.\n\nPolystyrene plastics are one of the most invasive plastics in nature. They break down easily into smaller pieces that can be ingested by marine organisms, such as fish and birds.\n\nBut where does all of this plastic trash on Catalina\u2019s shores come from? From the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, located between Hawaii and California, where around 80,000 tons of ocean plastic is. Unlike paper and food waste, plastic isn\u2019t biodegradable; therefore, it often ends up in waterways that lead to the ocean.\n\n\u201cIf this goes on long enough because the plastic can\u2019t break down under normal ecological conditions, it\u2019s just going to accumulate,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThe patch\u2019s immense size now dwarfs certain countries, making them appear as mere islands in comparison. \u201cFor 70 years now it\u2019s gotten to be that this Pacific Garbage Patch is now three times the size of France,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThe amount of waste accumulating in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is expected to increase, with projections indicating an annual volume of 1.1 billion tons by 2040.\n\nThe researchers are trying to combat this by making regular visits to the island\u2019s shores, but each time they go back, the plastic has already accumulated again, sometimes within weeks.\n\nInstead of sourcing plastic from other areas, the researchers like to use plastic specifically from the ocean. They say it not only helps the environment, but it also pretreats the plastic by cleaning and breaking the particles down before the team turns it into a new product.\n\nOnce the researchers collect the plastic waste, they initiate a two-phase laboratory procedure. In the first stage, Williams collaborates with his team of students to break down the plastic into a fine white powder. Next, Wang and his pharmacy students transform the powder into a substance they fondly refer to as \u201cfungus food.\u201d This material contains the substances that ultimately contain the medicinal properties they seek.\n\n\u201cWe can make the conversion of plastics into different high value pharmaceuticals in less than one week. It is rapid, much quicker than other conversion methods reported and the value created in these products is much higher,\u201d said Christian Rabot, a graduate student studying pharmaceutical sciences.\n\nAs a member of Wang\u2019s lab, Rabot expressed he is grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this impactful project. \u201cIt is very rewarding to take the techniques that I have learned throughout my Ph.D. and apply it to a very pressing issue. We are proud of the work that we\u2019ve done so far and we are looking forward to expanding,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to the quick turnaround, this process is also inexpensive, which shows promise in terms of medicine affordability. According to preliminary data from 46brooklyn Research, the median wholesale acquisition cost for brand drugs has already risen by 5% in January, and approximately 450 medications experienced price hikes by pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n\n\u201cThink about how many cancer patients there are in the United States or even around the world, and what mass of cancer drugs they take ... it is going to be expensive,\u201d Williams said. \u201cPeople think because we are manufacturing cancer drugs they are going to be expensive, but because we are sourcing them from plastic, it\u2019s an inexpensive alternative.\u201d\n\nThe pharmaceuticals are currently in the preclinical research phase, an essential step toward getting it into the hands of consumers. The researchers are determined to continue their work and want to go beyond converting polyethylene and polystyrene plastic. Their ultimate objective is to scale up their process to encompass all kinds of plastic.\n\n\u201cIn addition to science I think getting students really excited about our topic, for me, is a big thing,\u201d Wang said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other plastics that we want to work on and our labs are going to make that breakthrough.\u201d```"}

I cannot overstate this enough: College basketball was outstanding this year. So in order to send this season off on a high note, let\u2019s take a look at five of the best games we witnessed this year. Quick note: When I call a game \u201cgood,\u201d I look at a myriad of factors. This includes the teams playing and their playstyles, how each team performs in terms of their efficiency, the rewatchability and the storylines of the game.\n\nNo. 10 Creighton vs. No. 9 Arkansas, 90-87 (November 22, 2022)\nThe 2022 college basketball season started off with a bang after Crieghton beat Arkansas in the semifinals of the Maui Jim Maui Invitational. This game previewed two teams ranked in the Top 10 of the preseason AP poll, and both went on to make deep March Madness runs. It featured five players who scored at least 20 points, and both teams shot over 40% from behind the arc. Arkansas, led by future NBA lottery pick freshman guard Anthony Black, trailed by 12 points with 1:45 left in the first half, which was the largest lead of the game. From there, the team traded baskets back and forth before a dunk from junior center Ryan Kalkbrenner cemented Creighton\u2019s win. Combine that with the tournament itself, a college basketball nerd\u2019s dream, and the game was electric from start to finish. Not only were the teams good on the day, but both teams pulled off upsets en route to their respective strong finishes.\n\nNo. 21 Indiana vs. No. 1 Purdue, 79-74 (February 4, 2023)\nThe season\u2019s first battle for college basketball superiority in the state of Indiana was a thriller that ended up with a sea of red and white on the floor of Assembly Hall. The Indiana Hoosiers entered the second half of this rivalry game with a 15-point lead, and slowly but surely, the Purdue Boilermakers chipped away and made it a four-point game with less than 10 minutes remaining. What followed was a nervous finish for Hoosier fans as the Boilermakers made it a one-point ball game in the final two minutes. Indiana won this game in large part due to their defense. Usually, when games are high scoring, players don\u2019t accumulate impressive defensive stats, but the Hoosiers had 11 steals during the game. This game also saw junior center Zach Edey score 33 points and grab 18 rebounds, as the defense of senior forward Trayce Jackson-Davis could not stop the soon-to-be National Player of the Year. It also foreshadowed Purdue\u2019s eventual embarrassing loss to 16-seeded Fairleigh Dickinson, with the Knights forcing the same amount of turnovers as the Hoosiers did in their win.\n\nNo. 6 Marquette vs. No. 11 UConn, 70-68 (March 10, 2023)\nGus Johnson and Madison Square Garden. What could be a better combination? This game was a matchup that felt like the final of the Big East Tournament with Marquette and UConn, two soon-to-be trendy Final Four picks. If you ask for a matchup that epitomizes the tough but skillful brand of Big East basketball, this would be the perfect one. This clash of Big East heavyweights came to a close through incredibly stout defense. After Marquette took a 4-point lead with 3:42 left in the game, they scored a grand total of zero points in the rest of the game. The Golden Eagles held on and took down the future National Champions at the World\u2019s Most Famous Arena. The shot making on display by sophomore forward David Joplin helped propel Marquette to their first Big East Championship in school history.\n\nNo. 3 Kansas State vs. Michigan State, 98-93 (March 23, 2023)\nCometh the man, cometh the hour: senior guard Markquise Nowell. Sometimes a player\u2019s individual performance is so good that it etches a particular game into college basketball history. Nowell set an NCAA tournament record for assists after dishing out his 19th assist with 0:15 left in overtime. This game was the definition of an offensive clinic, with both teams making utterly ridiculous shots and shooting over 45% from 3-point range. But the game will forever live in our minds as college basketball fans for one play. Nowell dribbled up the court with less than a minute remaining, arguing with his coach about what play to run. Only, it turned out that the argument was a ruse. Senior forward Keyontae Johnson cut back-door, and Nowell threw him a perfectly placed lob pass to take the lead. This play was executed to perfection. That day, it just felt like Nowell and Kansas State could do no wrong.\n\nNo. 9 Florida Atlantic vs. No. 5 San Diego State, 72-71 (April 1, 2023)\nJim Nantz\u2019s penultimate Final Four game was bound to be an instant classic, and on all accounts, it delivered. For a large part of the game, the Aztecs weren\u2019t performing at their highest level \u2014 Florida Atlantic held a 14-point lead with 13 minutes to go. As the Aztecs chipped away at the lead, many wondered if they\u2019d get over the hump and regain it, once and for all. With 10 seconds remaining, Florida Atlantic sophomore guard Johnell Davis drove the lane, only for his shot to come up short. The ball was passed to San Diego State junior guard Lamont Butler who attempted to drive towards the hoop, only to be walled off. Realizing the time left on the clock, he backed it out and took a comfortable mid-range jumper which found the bottom of the basket. It was a \u201cSan Diego State miracle,\u201d as called by the legendary broadcaster. This year was absolutely electric, and there are plenty of honorable mentions, but these games are the ones that I will never forget. \u201cThe March Toward March\u201d runs every Thursday.\n```"}

So I was so happy last year at the Festival of Books when I happened to come upon what I thought was a book of photography. It wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s much more than that. At least to me. Along Trousdale during the book festival weekend foot traffic is heavy. Tents stand left and right. Authors are speaking. Music plays. Don\u2019t forget to hydrate, too. I perused books from New York Times bestsellers to novels by local authors. Good fun, but nothing really caught my eye... I was heading for the exit when nearing the checkout, I took one last look at the table next to me. Art books neatly stacked on  a white table. One jumped out at me. It must have been the cover--a picture of palm trees and behind them a dark sky and a building the building reflected a pink hue. Union Station, Los Angeles, where I live. Something about this image and this book made me pick it up to see more. I bought the book and took it home. After a day of reading, it became my favorite. I even love the title. \u201cAfter/Image: Los Angeles Outside of the Frame\u201d, by Lynell George.\n\nLynell George: Outside of this frame of reference people have about Los Angeles or the actual like motion picture frame or the photographic frame. It\u2019s that it\u2019s what was alive around the edges. And what do you have left when you pull that center image away? What is and also it\u2019s playing on the term after image, you know, of that that sensation you have when you\u2019ve looked at something for a long time and you close your eyes, what remains in your field of vision? You know, what is what is what is it that we think about when we think about L.A., when it\u2019s pulled away?\n\nIn After/Image Lynell George tells her personal story of her experiences growing up in Los Angeles. Her Los Angeles. Inspired by the lens she viewed Los Angeles through. George plays with the title of the book. She expresses her experiences vividly in ways that allow you to connect to her. I can imagine myself in her shoes, growing up in South Central and seeing the city evolve in front of her eyes. I personally relate to her experiences as a Black woman in America. Although I did not spend most of my childhood in the country, I relate to her as she navigates her identity.\n\nGeorge moved to Los Angeles with her family when she was young. They were considered \u201cblockbusters\u201d at the time of the Great Migration. Her neighborhood soon became a place where families of different cultures came together. It allowed her to find community in the metropolitan city. George: But people really did bring their culture to Los Angeles in a way that was vivid and we practiced it. It was in food, it was in slang, it was in music, it was in, um, this the stories they told. And when I, when I am like, feeling melancholy about what I miss about living there, it\u2019s that that kind of closeness, that kind of family.\n\nToday, if you ask me what is my favorite book, I will say  After/Image,  partly for reasons Lynell George expresses. George: In certain ways there\u2019s a Los Angeles that lives in our mind that does not exist anymore. But we are these beautiful representations of what that was and what that possibility was, and, you know, being able to have conversations across. Race lines and ethnic lines and and really like, build coalitions together and and that sort of thing. And how that merging of music and language really informed who we became and the jobs, you know, we chose to do because we were living in proximity to one another. And that richness really did matter. So I would say that that was something that discovering, you know, fellow travelers on this road. I am pleased and proud to be a fellow traveler with Lynell George. I\u2019m so glad I picked up the book that day.\n```"}

(Photo by Eric Yeh)\n\nBy Eric Yeh, Anjali Patel and Thomas Johnson\nApril 20, 2023 at 6:33 pm PDT\n\nWith the upcoming Los Angeles Festival of Books, here are some local bookstores around South L.A. to check out for your bookworm needs.\n\nThe Salt Eaters Bookshop\nThe Salt Eaters Bookshop was founded in 2020, but because of the pandemic, doors did not open until the end of 2021. The name of the store was inspired by a book by Toni Cade Bambara, titled The Salt Eaters. Rather than acting as just a general bookstore, Salt Eaters has a very specific focus.\n\n\u201cThe Salt Eaters is an independent bookstore that prioritizes books, comics and zines by and about black women, girls, femmes and gender expansive people,\u201d said Asha Grant, the owner of the bookstore. Grant wants her bookstore to have that focus so people like her will have an easier time finding stories that they have to usually search for outside of their own curated spaces.\n\n\u201cAnd so it was important for me to push the stories that I feel aren\u2019t always represented in the mass, all in one place,\u201d Grant said. Grant began a GoFundme in 2020 to cover the startup costs for the store. She was joined by her neighbors and community members in building the shop.\n\n\u201cEvery part of this store has been touched by someone in the community,\u201d Grant said. The store is located at 302 East Queen Street in Inglewood and is open Wednesday to Friday from 1-6 p.m. and Saturday 12-5 p.m.\n\nWord of Life Christian Books\nThe oldest black-owned bookstore in Southern California, Word of Life was founded in 1961 by Joe and Evelyn Curtiss and is now managed and co-owned by their son, Jon.\n\n\u201cThe way things started, my dad was a minister. He loved books. He got involved in the book club. And then he realized he had these books. His mom said, \u2018Let\u2019s start a bookstore.\u2019 And so they started a bookstore,\u201d Curtiss said. They also have a strong focus \u2014 mainly selling Christian books, curriculum and attire.\n\n\u201cThat was the demographic,\u201d Curtiss said. \u201cAnd so we began to go to national conventions and have book signings and just expand in the market of Christian retailing.\u201d The shop is located in the heart of South L.A., and the community is close to their soul.\n\n\u201cWe bring in unique gifts,\u201d Curtiss said. \u201cWe bring in books from different topics dealing with African-American families or just different health books, just meeting the needs of the community and listening to the community and finding what people need. And so people come in to just experience the walking environment and people come in to just connect.\u201d Word of Life Christian Books is located at 6321 West Blvd and is open Tuesday to Friday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nAll Power Books\nVolunteer-run, All Power Books opened in June 2021 after the co-founders met the year before. \u201cWe all met protesting in 2020 and saw a really big need for a leftist space for other organizations and mutual aid groups to be able to use as either a meeting space, or a space for events, or just a community space,\u201d co-founder Cat Quach said. All Power is more than a bookstore. They consider themselves a \u201cthird space,\u201d a meeting place for the community that\u2019s separate from both home and work.\n\n\u201cThey are pretty much all just political bigs,\u201d Quach said. \u201cA lot of political theory. A lot about anti-imperialism, anti-racism, anti-colonialism, things like that.\u201d But it is their status as a political hub that makes them so unique.\n\n\u201cI think that we are very outspoken in our politics and we don\u2019t really shy away from that. And I don\u2019t really know that there\u2019s other really political stores,\u201d Quach said. \u201cI guess it would set us apart, we\u2019re mostly focused on political education.\u201d All Power Books is located at 4874 W Adams Blvd. 2-7 p.m. Wednesday to Friday and 12-7 p.m. on Saturdays.\n```"}

Here\u2019s how to livestream Coachella\u2019s performances\n\nThe Coachella YouTube channel will live stream almost all performances of weekend two.\n\nA Boogie wit da Hoodie performs at the Coachella Music & Arts Festival at the Empire Polo Club on Sunday, April 16 (Photo courtesy of  Amy Harris/Invision/AP)\n\nBy Katie Simons April 20, 2023 at  6:22 pm PDT\n\nThe first weekend of Coachella provoked much discussion between Frank Ocean\u2019s lackluster performance and Bad Bunny and BLACKPINK\u2019s history making sets. If you missed out on the action last weekend and want to be in on the conversation, here\u2019s how to stream weekend two\u2019s performances.\n\nWhere can I watch the performances? Coachella will be livestreaming almost all performances on their YouTube channel, as they\u2019ve done since 2011. At the beginning of this year, Coachella and YouTube actually extended their contract through 2026, so fans won\u2019t have to worry about how to stream performances for the next few years. Each of Coachella\u2019s six stages will have their own stream going, so make sure to check which stage your favorite artist is performing on before joining the livestream.\n\nWhat time do the sets start? The livestream will begin right as the acts start in Indio Valley. On Coachella\u2019s website, you can find the breakout of when each artist will hit the stage. Additionally, the performances will be available to rewatch on YouTube after the set. However, be prepared for sets to not start on time. BLACKPINK and Calvin Harris both reportedly began their sets 30 minutes late and Bad Bunny\u2019s set experienced several technical issues, forcing the artist to sing parts of his set a capella.\n\nWho should I tune into? If you\u2019re looking for new rock music, boygenius, who released their debut album less than a month ago, created a buzz for their mix of rock beats with deeply emotional lyrics. The trio \u2014 Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, Julien Baker \u2014 will be performing on Saturday on the Outdoor Theater stage from 8:10-9 p.m.\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping to listen to guest musicians, look out for Kali Uchis\u2019 set. Last weekend, the singer brought out Tyler, The Creator, Omar Apollo and Don Toliver to perform alongside her. Uchis will perform on Sunday from 6-6:50 p.m. on the Coachella Stage.\n\nIf you want a high performance quality, check out singer Charli XCX\u2019s set on Saturday from 5:35-6:25 p.m. on the Coachella stage. The artist received much praise for her energetic, electrifying performance during weekend one.\n\nBut what about Frank Ocean? While almost all artists were available through YouTube last weekend, Coachella\u2019s arguably most notable headliner, Frank Ocean, was not live streamed. While his performance was originally slated to be aired on the channel, just hours before his performance YouTube tweeted that his performance would no longer be streamed.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ocean backed out of performing during weekend two, citing a leg injury. Blink-182 \u2014 who had their much-awaited comeback during weekend one \u2014 will fill Ocean\u2019s performance slot, and as long as no major changes occur, the band should appear on Coachella\u2019s livestream.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Olivia Siu)\n\nBy Wendi Lu April 20, 2023 at 5:34 pm PDT\n\nUSC\u2019s game design program produces award-winning video games that are not only entertaining, but some are also applicable in fields like neuroscience, public health and medicine. But what really sets the school apart is its unique playtesting program.\n\nAdvanced games projects (AGP) is a year-long course and capstone project in the interactive media division of USC\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts (SCA). Teams of students start the year with an initial idea and by the end of the semester, they\u2019re able to produce a full-fledged game.\n\nWhat students and faculty alike say they value about the course is that it simulates the real-life gaming industry. \u201cWhat prepares us for the [gaming] industry is having that constant and quick feedback, but also the quick grind out of a new version of a game every week,\u201d said Olivia Siu, a master\u2019s student majoring in games, media and health.\n\nFaculty stand in for roles such as engineers, the usability department, production and narrative marketing, all of which students would encounter if they were to enter the industry. Employees from Rockstar Games, an American video game publisher based in New York City that is famous for games like Grand Theft Auto, stop by and give students pointers about what features might be better to implement in the games.\n\n\u201cEvery team is composed of part-time employees who are in their pods or departments such as engineering, arts, design, usability. It reflects a workplace setting because our class is basically a three-hour work time session,\u201d Siu said.\n\n\u201cUsability\u201d is another important part of the real-life simulation. According to Dennis Wixon, an adjunct professor in the interactive media division of SCA, any commercial game\u2019s success depends on its interaction with consumers; playtesting sessions are how designers learn that information. Playtesters\u2019 perceptions don\u2019t always align with the vision that designers had in mind, he added, so the sessions serve as a bridge between these two parties.\n\nAfter being selected by the faculty and reviewed by Rockstar Games, the end project will be an on-campus expo open to the public \u2014 a festival for every student to exhibit their year-long projects.\n\nSiu, who is also the usability teaching assistant for USC Games, said that designers have to consider their users\u2019 mindsets and experiences going into the game, considering that players come from different gaming backgrounds. For example, players who don\u2019t have previous experience with virtual reality games may do something outside of the developers\u2019 expectations.\n\n\u201cWe are just the developers who know how our game works. So, every step we want to see the external perspective and player\u2019s expectations,\u201d Siu said.\n\nShe gave some examples from her game, Neon City, the only virtual reality (VR) game in this year\u2019s AGP where you use your hands to build a city. \u201cDid they expect this one building to light up,\u201d Siu asks herself. \u201cDid they expect a citizen to talk to you?\u201d\n\nSiddhant Gupta, a graduate student studying computer science, was one of the playtesters for Neon City. \u201cI haven\u2019t played a lot of 3D games. So that was one thing that I liked about [the experience]. It was pretty smooth. I didn\u2019t have any problems [playing it],\u201d Gupta said.\n\nHowever, there is a standard for an ideal playtester and playing the game right it\u2019s just part of it. \u201cI think a good playtester is someone who talks as they play to give the designers the most information possible. A common phrase is \u2018talk like a streamer.\u2019 A good tester finds the balance between talking about what they are doing and playing the way they would play the game\u201d according to Nickey Olson, an interactive media and game design MFA student.\n\n\u201cIf you are watching the video, it\u2019s hard to tell from their [gamers] behaviors what they are thinking,\u201d Wixon said. \u201cAre they hesitating because they are admiring the 3D view that the virtual reality world builds? Or are they hesitating out of confusion?\u201d\n\nProfessor Wixon is saying that the thought process behind the seemingly similar behavior is drastically different from one person to another, helping the students to prepare for a diverse audience of players once they enter the industry as professionals.\n\nPlaytesting is open to all majors on campus and is accessible remotely. Students who want to volunteer to become playtesters can fill out this survey.\n```"}

Times Festival of Books\n\nAuthor of \u201cThey Both Die at the End\u201d Adam Silvera will be discussing identity on the YA stage Saturday.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find ourselves in books. It\u2019s a real challenge to look, scour for some Latine representation that doesn\u2019t fall into stereotyping; and, it\u2019s hard to find any good queer Latine representation. Trust me, I\u2019ve looked. In a 2017 CCBC study, it showed that out of 136 queer books less than half were actually written by someone from the LBGTQ+ community. Out of every 100 romance books only 7% were written by people of color. And, whoo knows what that looks like today or in different genres because no one is talking about it. No one is talking about or researching the percentage of queer Latine authors writing for queer Latine youth. That makes me feel alone. Disempowered by the status of things as a queer Latine writer and member of this very complex, intersected identity.\n\nMost protagonists in books today assume the role of maintaining this false idea that our identities don\u2019t exist, that the Latine queer population could just be silenced into erasure. That\u2019s what makes books like \u201cThey Both Die at the End\u201d so monumental. Its author Adam Silvera is the person behind the book and someone to watch out for this weekend at the L.A. Times Festival of Books. Born in New York, Silvera is Latino and gay. He became a writer, writing about books that have characters with queer and brown identities in a new nuanced way. His three dimensionality in how he characterizes queerness with normality or the baseline makes any other less representative characters just seem silly.\n\nIn this novel, \u201cThey Both Die at the End\u201d two boys who are Puerto Rican and Cuban American who were also queer on their own terms. Mateo, one of the protagonists, never explicitly defines his queerness which is such a valid and occurring reality for a lot of queer people. Rufus\u2019s bisexuality is explicit and empowered. Also a valid reality. Both are Latine kids, both have storylines outside of their identity but not ignoring the intersections of it. This should be the norm. Why can\u2019t queerness and brownness coexist as a given, accepted, and empowered identity?\n\nSilvera\u2019s characters center dimensionality over meeting the check marks of diversity and handle these identities, which he holds himself, with so much care and compassion. It will be interesting to see how Adam Silvera, best-selling author of \u201cMore Happy Than Not\u201d \u201cHistory Is All You Left Me\u201d, \u201cThey Both Die at the End\u201d and others, will continue to center our storylines.

Times Festival of Books\n\nThe need for art activism at the festival.\n\nBy Myriam Alcala April 20, 2023 at 2:53 pm PDT\n\nHow much of art should reflect on and comment on real life? Some art is viewed as a form of escapism, others more of a reality distortion. While we remain coiled up in such debates of what art \u201cis,\u201d there is a climate crisis and that is our reality. Chicanx poet Anthony Cody does what other marginalized community members do. When not given the luxury to access art or ignore the issues inflicting your identity and community, you write about them. To tell the story of his own experience and universalize issues that are ongoing yet remain ignored by society at large.\n\nClimate change is one of those pressing issues that continues to be adamantly pushed to the sidelines of art and coverage. There could be a million pleads and tangible proof of a climate crisis happening yet the numbers are ignored and the status quo remains. At that point creating art becomes obsolete. But Cody found a way to merge these two things together, something that Indigenous, Black and brown artists have been doing for centuries, creating art activism.\n\nIn \u201cThe Rendering,\u201d Cody relays the history of the Dust Bowl, its settler colonial roots and the impacts it left contributing to the current crisis and cultural devastation. It puts at the forefront identity and its relation to climate change. Poetry, and writing in all forms can exist as a form of activism, as a tool to inform and place identities at the forefront of spaces that have been historically exclusive; places like the Festival of Books and USC. Storytelling can be the key to empowering increased representation and justice.\n\nThis is why Cody\u2019s reading of \u201cThe Rendering\u201d is so crucial to the understanding of and reflection on the climate crisis we have here, in our own community. Cody\u2019s reading will be on Saturday, April 22 on the Poetry Stage at 4:40 p.m. Earlier that day at 12:30 p.m., Cody will be a participant of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize Poetry Finalist Roundtable on the same stage.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Hayley Bill)\n\nBy Myriam Alcala April 20, 2023 at 2:45 pm PDT\n\nThere were 853 known deaths last year on the U.S.-Mexico border, and Sol Lagos felt guilty. Like many Latine, first generation people, we face this guilt of survival and of being where we are, \u201cit\u2019s easy at USC to just forget that you are still here by luck,\u201d Lagos said.\n\nGrappling with the border crisis that often gets ignored until it\u2019s used as a political fact or figure and attending a university where there is distance from the reality of our ancestors, Lagos found solace in writing. He began to write a play about two people: Salvador, a college student, and Memo, a 10 year-old-boy. They were divided by The Wall, an unknown mystery and the story follows their experience in unpacking why they were at this crossroad. The play is titled: \u201cMirror.\u201d\n\nLagos brought in an all Latine cast and majority Latine crew to the project that will premiere Thursday April 20, and run until Sunday April 23. \u201cIt was immensely difficult to find Latino people available here in a predominantly white institution who were also willing to take on this story,\u201d Lagos explained. But they were able to meet this goal and bring in people who added joy to a story not sugarcoating a reality.\n\nLagos recalls how fun it was on set. One of his favorite memories were of Alec, who is Mexican, and Frankie, who is Dominican, comparing the differences in their dialect. They also began joking about translating the play into Spanish. \u201dThere\u2019s no pressure, there\u2019s no isolation, there\u2019s no otherness.\u201d\n\nHowever, the play being in English was a choice. Of course there is Spanish interwoven in the story, but English, added Lagos, brought non-Spanish people into the story who also face border crisis. Bringing people in, making the experience known to all audiences was something he kept in mind while writing and making \u201cMirror\u201d come to life.\n\n\u201cFor anybody who has ancestry divided by borders, I want them to acknowledge their ancestry, what it means to be connected to them, not just in trauma but also survival and resistance,\u201d he said. \u201cFor other people ... I want the reality of the border crisis to still be in your mind.\u201d And at the end of the day, Lagos also wants to highlight the joy of survival and the power of ancestry. \u201cThere will be Latine resilience,\u201d he said. That is what \u201cMirror\u201d does which is special, bringing in hardship and resistance, and tying in the reliance of storytelling.\n\nTickets to the show are available on instagram @brandnewtheatre. Stay tuned for Dimelo\u2019s post-coverage of the show.\n```"}

She asked about her teachers, principals and peers. She wanted to know their names, and what my mom thought of them. After asking my mom about her favorite teacher, my baby sister had one more question. \u201cMom, what was your police officer\u2019s name?\u201d My mom attended school in the late 80s and 90s. They did not have any police officers on campus.\n\nAnyone who knows me knows that my siblings and my mother are the most important things in my life. When you ask me what I love most in this world, it\u2019s my siblings. When you ask me where I would rather be, at any time, it is with my siblings. They mean more to me than anything in this world. I would rather be on a Starbucks date with my 4-year-old sister than anywhere else in the world, at any time.\n\nMy sister is fearless and full of energy. She likes to \u201ctattoo\u201d herself with Crayola markers and play dress-up. She likes cake pops, going as far as to think that there is an endless supply of them every time we enter a bakery or a coffee shop. Every night before I have to head back to college, we have sleepovers on her pink carpet floor because it makes her feel safer. She wakes me up at 3 a.m. because she can\u2019t sleep without me, and she likes to draw portraits of me and send them to my school address. We are half siblings, but she has told me that she believes that we are not only best friends, but also twin sisters, because we are both girls.\n\nMy family has taken to teaching my baby sister how to do her own \u201cmantras\u201d and \u201caffirmations.\u201d We have taught her to say: \u201cI am brave, I am beautiful, I am strong.\u201d My baby sister believes that her family can protect her from everything, which is why she latches on to me every time we are around a stranger. I hate that I cannot protect her from everything.\n\nMy sister is 4 years old, almost 5. She is less than five years younger than William, Evelyn and Hallie, the 9-year-old victims from the mass shooting at the Covenant School on March 27 in Nashville, Tennessee. Every day, when I wake up for class, my mind goes right to thinking about my sister and her peers. Her elementary school is the same one that I attended, educating kindergartners through fourth graders. Her elementary school isn\u2019t too different from the one that endured tragedy at the Covenant School. Her elementary school isn\u2019t too different from Sandy Hook Elementary School, either. Her elementary school also isn\u2019t too different from Robb Elementary School. Do you see the problem?\n\nIt is April 6, 2023. Kids who are the same age as my baby sister have been going through active shooter threat training and drills. They are being taught to hide from the \u201cbig bad wolf.\u201d The Covenant School mass school shooting marks the 131st mass shooting in the U.S. just this year. Last year, there were 51 school shootings with injuries or deaths. My sister was 3 years old last year. As of April 6, there have been 13 school shootings this year that have resulted in injuries or deaths. Since 2018, there have been 157 such shootings. The year 2022 marked the most school shootings with injuries or deaths in a single year, according to Education Week which began tracking the data in 2018.\n\nEvery time I wake up, it\u2019s three hours later in the day in my hometown than it is where I attend college. Most of the time, that means that my sister is in the peak of her school day. She\u2019s probably learning numbers alongside her peers \u2014 maybe she\u2019s learning how to spell her name. Maybe she\u2019s at recess. Maybe my mom let her take the day off, and they\u2019re at Target. The problem is that I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing at any time, and that in this day and age, I can\u2019t just imagine her playing with toys alongside her friends or gaining the foundation of an education that will follow her forever. I never have peace of mind. Nobody who cares for a child who attends a K-12 school can have peace of mind from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday.\n\nThe world that we live in forces me to think about other things that could be going on \u2014 as I go to school across the country, at a college that\u2019s not too different from Virginia Tech. A college that\u2019s not too different from Michigan State University. Do you see the problem?\n\nMy brother goes to school, too, and his goal is to attend university in San Diego. My brother is funny, kind and down to earth. He likes to play baseball and drive his friends around in my old, beat-up Nissan Altima. He\u2019s calm, easy-going, and brave. He has a huge heart, and has been through more than anyone his age should have to. He goes to a high school not too different from Stoneman Douglas High School. A school not too different from Columbine High School. Don\u2019t you see the problem?\n\nEach day, 12 children die from gun violence in America. Another 32 are shot and injured, according to the Sandy Hook Promise. Guns are the leading cause of death among American children and teens, with one out of every 10 gun deaths being age 19 or younger. I hate that I can\u2019t shield my siblings from the horrors of the world that make it so hard to fall asleep every night. I hate that every time a school shooting occurs, we as a society collectively get overwhelmed and upset, then watch it pass into the abyss and become just another statistic.\n\nOur children are not just a statistic. Five hundred fifty five is one of my favorite numbers in the world because it signifies change. With positive change comes hope, and hope is what we\u2019re all seeking. It\u2019s so easy to feel hopeless in a world where we\u2019re seeing 1.5 mass shootings per day so far in the United States. A world where school shootings are becoming so common that we can\u2019t keep track of them \u2014 so common that we are becoming desensitized every time they happen that we are starting to believe that this is just the way it is.\n\nAt the end of the day, I believe that we\u2019re all on the same page. When it comes to school shootings, we all want them to stop and we want to prevent them. But, what are we doing? What can we be doing? The polarization of our country has led us to a suspenseful stagnancy, in which no change is on the horizon due to conflicting morals, beliefs and politics. What we should not be divided on, however, is the belief that our children deserve the right to an education in which they don\u2019t have to fear for their lives each time they enter the classroom.\n\nIf we don\u2019t make a change now, we are going to keep waking up to more violence and our children are going to be caught in the crossfires of our stagnancy. Next time that this happens, god forbid, are we going to accept it and watch as the headlines come and go? Are we going to turn a blind eye to our future leaders of our country, when they need us most? When will it be enough? We shouldn\u2019t wait for it to affect us to be prompted to act. We need to be proactive and take matters into our own hands, before the next violent act.\n```"}

Days following the conclusion of the tour, she released the \u201cUniverse EP,\u201d featuring songs like \u201cUniverse\u201d and \u201cBad News / Good News,\u201d that were also part of her setlist. The Nashville singer\u2019s discography is filled with catchy, soulful pop tracks that show off her vocal range.\n\nWhile Lomis was originally the only opening act for the tour, 19-year-old singer Jenna Raine performed as a second support act for the L.A. shows. Jenna Raine performs a cover of \u201cAs It Was\u201d by Harry Styles. Originally from Texas, Raine took her passions for songwriting and performing to L.A.

Following his first few songs, Bassett told his inspirational story of his initial move to L.A. in which he lived out of his car. Just as he was about to give up on his acting and music career, his father instructed him over the phone to live in the city for two more weeks. Within that short time frame, he received a call that he had been cast as Ricky Bowen, the lead of the hit series, \u201cHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series.\u201d\n\nThroughout the first three seasons, he wrote a handful of songs such as \u201cJust for a Moment,\u201d \u201cThe Perfect Gift\u201d and \u201cFinally Free.\u201d The release of these singles eventually translated into his signing with Warner Records where he has since continued to release music.\n\nBassett reaches out to a fan in the audience during the beginning of his final concert of The Complicated Tour.

Bassett encouraged fans to make amends with those in their lives and reminded them that they are never alone in their mental health struggles: \u201cI know that I\u2019m not alone in those thoughts, and I know that many people struggle.

USC baseball reached the Top 25 in ESPN/USA Today\u2019s Coaches Poll last week for the first time since 2015, but following a series sweep to Oregon State, the Trojans fell from the rankings.\n\nLooking to bounce back, USC welcomed CSUN for a midweek clash at Dedeaux Field.

Faces illuminated by the fluorescent glow of laptop screens. Starbucks cold brews and Dulce matcha lattes sit half-drinken on tabletops scattered with notebooks and iPads. There are no windows. There is no light getting in. Here time is only marked by completed assignments. The bookstacks in USC\u2019s Leavey Library are buzzing with academic conversations, and all signs point to a quickly approaching finals season, and with it, the threat of burnout.\n\n\u201cIf I got to be honest, I feel overwhelmed right now,\u201d said Minh Pham, a junior studying computer science and business administration. \u201cNext week is the last week of instruction and we have projects and then some finals happen early, so it\u2019s a bit overwhelming. At the moment I feel underprepared.\u201d\n\nPham\u2019s studying companion, Abraham Solovy, is one year ahead, a senior studying political economy. The source of his stress has to do with divided attention; balancing academic life, social life and preparing for life after graduation.\n\n\u201cI think jobs become the main focus. So just half your day is spent applying to jobs instead of doing schoolwork, which is an added layer of stress,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to balance between hanging onto the last memories with my friends ... but I have to stay motivated with finals. I\u2019m somewhere between senioritis and normal.\u201d\n\nWhile Solovy is in the final stretch of his college years, freshmen Julia Kwon and Brady Hines are just getting started.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very exhausting,\u201d said Kwon, a performance and pharmacology major. \u201cWe\u2019re just working on our bio projects right now. We have a presentation on Friday and we haven\u2019t even started. I have an essay due tomorrow and a lot of work due this week. So yeah, we\u2019re kind of cramming.\u201d\n\nHines, a biology major, expressed similar feelings about the workload.\n\n\u201cI feel like this semester is much more difficult than the first semester. Usually when it gets to second semester, I\u2019m much more burned out, I\u2019d say,\u201d he said.\n\nAt an adjacent table, study partners Sarah Tumiya and Bianca Hong, both juniors studying business administration, found themselves in the cavernous bookstacks this afternoon as a last resort.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been avoiding Leavey,\u201d Tumiya jokes. \u201cIt\u2019s a little more distracting because everyone\u2019s talking, but it\u2019s nice to keep yourself from feeling like you\u2019re in a room alone by yourself, studying and not interacting with humans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI kind of just want to stay in bed and watch whatever TV show I\u2019m watching right now,\u201d Hong said. \u201cBut there\u2019s only two weeks, so I\u2019m just like, \u2018get it over with, you know?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo, how do students cope? For some, it\u2019s about getting ahead of the game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to study on our own so we can get ahead before we start having big group study sessions because it\u2019s harder to get focused if you\u2019re not already familiar,\u201d Tumiya said. \u201cBut yeah, motivation is pretty low.\u201d\n\nOther students in a time crunch find themselves in the library for hours on end. For Hines, a venti cold-brew is his life source for pulling off all-nighters from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. in Leavey.\n\n\u201cI just designate doing [work] at night because I can\u2019t really work during the day. I usually come here, pull all nighters,\u201d he said. \u201cI stay motivated by just telling myself, if I do this, I\u2019ll maybe get a good grade.\u201d\n\nLate night ventures into the bookstacks is the same tactic for Pham.\n\n\u201cI stay up pretty late to catch up with lectures and then I\u2019ve got to do what I have to do, like get the grades and get the work done eventually,\u201d he said.\n\nBut late nights at Leavey aren\u2019t the only way to make it to the end of the semester. Dr. Kelly Greco, a USC Student Health counselor at USC Annenberg, has some advice for students as they make the final push to the end of the semester.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things I say to students is that we have to focus on what we can control, and let go of what we can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get rid of stress, anxiety or loneliness. We have to accept that that\u2019s where we\u2019re at, and then we would have to look at how we would problem-solve it.\u201d\n\nTime is of the essence, according to Greco. Using time wisely, she said, can alleviate a lot of stress.\n\n\u201cCreating a lot of structure in terms of mapping out what I\u2019m doing every hour, scheduling, study time when I\u2019m studying, those are things that you and I can control as students,\u201d she said. \u201cDecisions I make not taking on more than I can, as well as taking good care of myself, you know, prioritizing sleep, eating, exercise as well.\u201d\n\nCounseling services is another option for students looking for help with stress management. USC offers several student health resources where students can speak directly with clinicians about problem solving, resiliency and stress management. Online resources such as workshops, drop in appointments and therapy services can be found at this link.\n```"}

The festival will feature three plays and will run from April 20 to April 27.\n\nBy Nicole Santos, Stefano Fendrich and Nora Miller\nApril 19, 2023 at 6:02 pm PDT\n\nThree USC graduate students are about to see their words come to life. Christina Carrafiell, Adi Eshman and Matilda Corley Schulman, third-year students in the USC dramatic writing graduate program, will debut their plays in the upcoming New Works Festival, which takes place from April 20 through April 27 at McClintock Theatre, where they will showcase their talent to a live audience. Students and professors from all programs in the School of Dramatic Arts are taking part in the productions.\n\n\u201cThose young women and men get an opportunity to put [their work] in front of an audience, and they get the opportunity to feel like an ensemble through its entire process \u2014 casting, rehearsals, breaking the script down, originating a role,\u201d said David Warshofsky, director of Schulman\u2019s new play \u201cbloody noses\u201d and head of the MFA acting program. \u201cAll these things that they never would have had an opportunity to do before.\u201d\n\nThis will be the first time the USC dramatic writing MFA program has put forth fully produced performances with costumes, sound, lighting, design and choreography. In the past, graduate students only had the opportunity to showcase their final products in stage readings at the Pasadena Playhouse or in their classrooms.\n\n\u201c[SDA] decided to give the playwrights fuller productions and a production design and a budget,\u201d Warshofsky said. \u201cThat\u2019s where myself and my MFA colleagues and some of my actors became involved ... It became a full and true all-school production.\u201d\n\nGraduate students in the program said the opportunity to work with other SDA students and professors in a collaborative rehearsal process has been an invaluable experience. Adi Eshman, the playwright of \u201cWeekend Warriors,\u201d said the productions have been an exciting experience in bringing students\u2019 work to a different level of interpretation.\n\n\u201c[It] is ultimately what you want from a director, to be able to interpret your work and move it forward,\u201d Eshman said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really powerful to see how the words get translated through [Director Fran de Leon]\u2019s own mind.\u201d\n\nChristina Carrafiell, the playwright of \u201cMichaela\u2019s Fluent Aphasia,\u201d said she spent nine years writing her story and feels excited to finally be able to show it to the world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing experience and I\u2019ve loved every second of it,\u201d Carrafiell said. \u201cThe rehearsals, the technical aspects, the production meetings and just the fact that all of these really talented artists want to work with me and work on my play is a real honor and a privilege.\u201d\n\nAccording to Warshofsky, the graduate playwriting and acting programs are \u201cone of the handful of the best in the country.\u201d He said he hopes the program continues to showcase the integrity and work of their students to give them commission opportunities in the future.\n\nCarrafiell said she hopes students who attend the festival feel inspired by the work they have put into their plays.\n\n\u201cI hope that our work challenges the other people in the program in the way that the older students challenged me and inspired me,\u201d she said.\n```"}

The event, held at the University Club at King Stoops Hall, was followed by an informal lunch during which students could learn the life stories of faculty and administrators.\n\nBohn has had a quick and successful rise since he assumed his position in 2019. He was also named the NACDA Athletic Director of the year in 2022, in just three years. Bohn was introduced by a close friend and colleague, Clarke Stroud, who praised him for his integrity, work ethic, and positive impact on athletes at USC.\n\n\u201cWhat strikes me about this man is his commitment to students, his commitment to the student athlete experience,\u201d Stroud said. After breaking into song, a shared hobby among himself and Bohn, the talk began.\n\nWhen posed with the question, \u201cWhat Matters to Me and Why?\u201d, Bohn spoke about his family and his love for sports that developed at a young age, particularly taking root in his mother who was the \u201cfirst state female administrator of Little League Baseball west of the Mississippi.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I grew up, the sense of team was everything,\u201d Bohn said. His avid participation in sports fostered a love for people and creating relationships with others. However, the overall theme in Bohn\u2019s life, career and the message he wanted attendees to take away was the importance of fostering and maintaining an encouraging spirit in one\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cTake time and think a little bit about who has encouraged you to be where you are today, who\u2019s inspired you, and you start thinking of all those people in your life,\u201d Bohn added.\n\nFor a prolific sports fan, Bohn\u2019s unlikely story about gaining inspiration from a classic Broadway musical, \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d became a highlight of the talk. Bohn said he even keeps an ornament of Simba in his office as \u201ca reminder of the people in my life that I owe an obligation to, to be encouraging and to have an awesome attitude and be supportive.\u201d\n\nReflecting on his career, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve made some fun things that come together. I didn\u2019t do it alone,\u201d crediting the many people who made him the person he has become. \u201cI feel an incredible responsibility to deliver back to the people I grew up with,\u201d Bohn said.\n\nMusic, sports movies, faith and a love for his country were among the other things that Bohn mentioned matters to him.\n\nMarilyn Perez, a sophomore studying global health, resonated with Bohn\u2019s message as a college student. \u201cI feel like you get a lot of imposter syndrome from everything. Having those people encourage you and lift you up, I think it\u2019s very important,\u201d she said.\n\nThe \u201cWhat Matters to Me and Why\u201d series first began in 2009, hosting several faculty members and administrators within the university, including Pulitzer Prize winner Professor Viet Thanh Nguyen and President Carol Folt. The series aims to encourage \u201creflection about values, beliefs, and motivation in the lives of those who help shape our university,\u201d according to the USC Office of Religious Life.\n\n\u201cThis speaker series represents a creative solution to an important problem in the university setting, and that is the separation of intellectual life from the personal and the spiritual,\u201d said Brake.\n\nThe events have featured speakers such as School of Dramatic Arts Dean Emily Roxworthy and USC Staff Assembly President Kristi Culpepper this semester.\n```"}

As part of the month\u2019s festivities, the university is hosting several different sustainability-themed events, including \u201cE-Waste Collection Days,\u201d where university officials collected 11 laptops, 60 CPUs, 20 headsets and 50 phones for recycling, as well as a workshop on \u201cHow to be a Sustainable Trojan.\u201d\n\nOver the course of three days, USC Human Resources, Equity and Compliance, or HREC, set up bins at various locations where students and faculty could drop off old electronic devices. \u201cWe always try to give our items that we\u2019re recycling a second or third life to avoid diverting toxic metals, glass, and plastic to the landfills,\u201d said Anthony Rodriguez, a USC hazardous materials supervisor.\n\nAccording to Rodriguez, HREC recycled 337,000 pounds of electronic waste last year. The lead organizer of the event, Emily White, explained that all devices collected are wiped by the publicity team and then wiped again by a contracted company. Additionally, HREC has an outreach program that expands their reach beyond the borders of the university. \u201cWe donate [devices] to schools when we can,\u201d White said. \u201cWe go to the 10 schools within USC first, and then we go to the community at-large.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the USC Staff Assembly hosted \u201cHow to be a Sustainable Trojan,\u201d a workshop where students and faculty learned about USC\u2019s sustainability efforts and how to personally help the university in achieving its goals. Some long-term goals presented at the event included increasing sustainability courses by a count of 10 each year, doubling sustainability research by 2028 and achieving climate neutrality by 2025.\n\nBrad Haydel, associate director of the Office of Sustainability, was the main speaker and shined a light on the digital resources USC offers, including sustainability progress reports, a sustainability map and newsletter to stay informed on interactive events and statistics. Traveler is another tool the USC community, especially those who commute, can use to reduce their carbon emissions footprint. The webpage includes information on a carpooling program, a network of free buses and informs faculty and staff of their 50% transit subsidy.\n\nHaydel also said energy management is a priority, so USC has increased energy efficiency over 15% and a quarter of USC\u2019s electricity is provided with power from a solar farm in Mojave. The events also encouraged students to take personal measures such as using natural lighting as much as possible, keeping thermostats at 78 degrees in the summer and 68 degrees in the winter and unplugging devices when not in use.\n\nUSC has also installed low-flow faucets and water meters to provide real-time usage data as well as deployed weather-based irrigation sensors.

There\u2019s more to campus squirrels than their infamous feisty demeanors\n\nA campus squirrel peaks into a student's backpack. (Photo by Cari Spencer)\n\nBy Cari Spencer\nApril 19, 2023 at 5:16 pm PDT\n\nThere are hundreds of squirrels on USC campus, notorious among students for their big appetites and feisty personalities. If you look closely, you might notice collars on some of them. What\u2019s up with that? Here\u2019s Cari Spencer with the answer.\n\nIf you\u2019re a USC student who has spent time lounging by the trees, chances are you\u2019ve got a squirrel story. FAULKNER: All of last semester, I would go to the tutor center. I would get my acai bowl and I would try to eat it behind Annenberg at the little stage place. And all these squirrels would just come bother me and be terrible and just keep getting increasingly closer.\n\nThat\u2019s Indi Faulkner, a freshman jazz major. She\u2019s had one of the most quintessential USC experiences. Being approached by gray, chunky squirrels who don\u2019t seem to fear humans. At ALL.\n\nFAULKNER: The more eye contact you make with them, I\u2019m serious, the more eye contact you make, the more dangerous it becomes. Because they will come at you, like they won\u2019t, but they will. And like one time, one of them, like, stood up at me and it was awful.\n\nDangerous or not, you can find squirrels chasing each other in the Music Complex, being fed peanuts outside of Taper Hall, or digging into a McDonald\u2019s bag by the Old Annenberg stage. The squirrels you see are Eastern Fox squirrels. And they\u2019re actually not native to California. Former Civil war soldiers brought them to the Veterans Hospital near UCLA to keep as pets. In 1904, they got loose. Now you can find them all over LA. Including at USC.\n\nDEAN: Sorry, dude, I don\u2019t have anything. I\u2019m sitting with USC biology professor Matt Dean on a bench between Taper Hall and the old Annenberg stage. We\u2019re in squirrel territory. Just ten minutes into an interview about his squirrel-tracking mammalogy class, this bold, collared guy darts over. He sniffs and pokes around, probably hoping we have some Cheetos to toss his way.\n\nDEAN: Do you see the wire hanging out? That\u2019s, that\u2019s the antenna. So he\u2019s got it out. It\u2019s normally wrapped up inside the tube.\n\nSince 2019, Dr. Dean has been teaching BISC-363 with Professor Jim Dines. In the class, students help put wire collars on a dozen squirrels and track their radio signals. It\u2019s a special opportunity for students to do real wildlife biology fieldwork, despite USC\u2019s urban setting. The collaring usually happens during a break when there are less concerned student eyes around.\n\nDEAN: We don\u2019t really want to attract attention to ourselves when we\u2019re trapping squirrels because some people will get upset about it.\n\nThe squirrels are not harmed during the process, but they\u2019re not happy. The squirrels are lured into rectangular metal traps with peanuts, then into pillowcases to help gently pin them down.\n\nDEAN: It\u2019s basically in a full Nelson...But it can\u2019t turn around and bite us. It can\u2019t scratch us. The claws are really dangerous on a squirrel.\n\nStudents help slip a loose zip tie-like collar over the squirrels\u2019 neck, then tighten it. But not too tight. The whole process is approved by USC\u2019s Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nDEAN: We love the little buggers, right? We don\u2019t want to hurt them. We just want to figure out where they\u2019re going.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the class\u2019s teaching assistant Charlie Toney comes in. TONEY: You hear that static? So I hear it kind of faint over this way. Now I\u2019m pointing back south. A lot louder. Then point north. It\u2019s a little bit quieter. Still some volume here. South again, pretty loud. All right. So we\u2019ll walk south.\n\nI\u2019m following Charlie as he locates squirrel #020. In one hand Charlie\u2019s got a metal antenna that\u2019s about two feet long, and on his shoulder he\u2019s lugging what looks like a brown lunchbox. Except inside is an electric box covered in numbers and knobs.\n\nTONEY: So I\u2019m pointing the, uh, the antenna north right now, and we hear a certain frequency or a certain volume. Really loud this way.\n\nThe fancy name for the process is radio telemetry. It\u2019s kind of like a game of \u201cHot and Cold.\u201d You know, that kids game where you tell someone if they\u2019re close to something or not.\n\nTONEY: It\u2019s a lot of walking around in circles trying to hear where the beep is loudest. But basically we tune this to the frequency of the individual squirrel and which is also the squirrels ID number. And then we follow the trail of the increasing volume of beeps until we arrive at what we hypothesize are observed to be the squirrel\u2019s location.\n\nThe beeping gets louder and louder, making it clear the squirrel is up in an oak tree behind Bovard. We see four different squirrel nests, but no squirrel.\n\nTONEY: I\u2019m going to guess that the squirrel is sleeping up here in one of these tree nests. So squirrel #020\u2032s GPS coordinates get logged as the oak tree.\n\nThere\u2019s no groundbreaking squirrel research going on, there\u2019s no top-secret experimentation done on the collared squirrels either. But there is a lot of practice for aspiring biologists. Charlie said taking the class as a sophomore is what put him on track to where he\u2019s now. A first year graduate student in the molecular biology program, working in Dr. Dean\u2019s lab.\n\nThere\u2019s much more consequential research happening in that lab, but as far as this undergrad class goes, Dr. Dean loves what he does.\n\nDEAN: We\u2019re just, we\u2019re like science geeks and we like mammals and we like learning about them and we like learning about how to study them. And that\u2019s what the class is about.\n\nSo maybe the next time you\u2019re approached by squirrels when you\u2019re just trying to eat your lunch, you\u2019ll notice a collar. And hey, maybe you\u2019ll actually see squirrel #020.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Cari Spencer.\n```"}

However, they aren\u2019t made by the actual artists they feature! Gabriella Medina has the story on music and its  crossroads with AI lately\n\nRapper Drake (via WikiCommons)\n\nBy Gabriella Medina April 19, 2023 at  5:12 pm PDT\n\n\u201cHeart on my sleeve\u201d may have gained millions of listens and clicks since going viral over the course of just two days, but like most one hit wonders, the AI generated track\u2019s 5 seconds of fame are up. Universal Music Group shut down the song by pulling the track from all streaming services on Tuesday. In a statement, UMG said \u201cthe training of generative AI using [their] artists\u2019 music represented \u201cboth a breach of [their] agreements and a violation of copyright law.\u201d While the song can\u2019t be heard on Apple Music or Spotify anymore, re-uploads are still floating around TikTok and Youtube. The song was originally uploaded by a TikTok user with the handle Ghostwriter977. In a now deleted post, Ghostwriter said they wrote and produced the AI-generated vocals for the track. The song\u2019s catchy hook and identical Drake vocals had fans listening on repeat despite the fake Weeknd feature sounding less convincing. On the song, the two artists spit back and forth about things like The Weeknd\u2019s ex, Selena Gomez, and Drake\u2019s hometown, Toronto. While the song was quickly removed by UMG with no further action taken, the song\u2019s success raises questions about the legal implications of AI undercutting musicians.\n\nFABER:  I think there is certainly an option to pursue litigation. Intellectual property and licensing expert Jonathan Faber says that just taking down songs violating copyright is not enough to solve the problem. FABER:  I don\u2019t throw litigation around as a first option. You know, I think it\u2019s something that really needs to be weighed carefully, but. This may be one of those instances. The fake Drake track not only presents legal issues but creative issues, too. Technology may be moving faster than the law but it might be moving even faster for aspiring artists. FABER:  \u201cYou know, and it\u2019s one thing for some artists to sound a lot like another artist and maybe derivative. So and the music business has long had to deal with that. But this is not derivative issue. This is not in the style of issue. This is something that it sounds like it is actually Drake performing. And and therein lies a very significant problem. And I think it\u2019s a big enough problem that the concern parties will have the option at least to consider litigation as a as a way to address it.\u201d\n\nDrake and the Weeknd aren\u2019t the first artists to be targeted by A.I. Tiktok and forums online are flooded with fake covers by Kanye West and Jay-Z. Just last year, the company Factory New launched an AI rapper called FN Meka who was eventually signed to Capitol Records. Eventually, folks like Tech and Culture writer Lauren Chanel noticed an interesting pattern taking place. CHANEL:  What\u2019s peak interesting to me is the artists and the genres that people are choosing to play with. It\u2019s not Elvis, it\u2019s not The Beetles, it\u2019s not Harry Styles it\u2019s not Taylor Swift. What are we implying here? This is just another example of people wanting black creativity, black art, black skills without black people. And I hate it.\u201d Beyond race, Chanel believes all artists of different mediums are at risk of being undermined and diluted by A.I. CHANEL:  \u201cThis is across the board, across race and gender. People undervalue creates creative output. Creative skill sets like you create whole worlds. The Marvel Cinematic Universe would not be what it is without the writers, but instead people attached to the people they see on screen, or the actors or the producers or the directors. And of course, those are crucial, you know, elements to this project. But I think in general, people just undervalue, create creative skill sets.\u201d\n\nWhile the world struggles to keep up and come to terms with the effects of A.I., two new fake Drake tracks dropped today, with a decision yet to be made by UMG.

Recently, Piqu\u00e9 discussed his separation from Shakira on sports journalist Gerard Romero\u2019s podcast, sharing that he has received hate on social media from Shakira\u2019s fanbase following their divorce. \u201cMy ex is Latino Americana, and you have no idea what I\u2019ve received over social media from people who I guess don\u2019t have lives,\u201d Piqu\u00e9 said during the podcast interview.\n\nThe former Spanish soccer player received backlash for the way he used the term \u201cLatino Americana.\u201d Many people on social media perceived it as \u201cxenophobic\u201d and \u201cracist.\u201d Latinx students at USC are divided on whether or not Piqu\u00e9's \u201cLatino Americana\u201d comment was problematic as well as the use of other identifying terms within the community.\n\nMartin Aguirre is a Colombian international student at USC, whose family is from Shakira\u2019s hometown of Barranquilla. Aguirre explains that as a Spaniard, Piqu\u00e9's comments are problematic considering Spain\u2019s historical record of colonialism. \u201cI think the way he did it was derogatory. It was meant to be an insult of inferiority, and I think that is like the underlying dynamic of his comment,\u201d Aguirre said.\n\nMaycee Campano, a theater major with an emphasis in acting, said she has been keeping up with the Piqu\u00e9 story, adding that they found Piqu\u00e9's comments to be \u201cout of pocket.\u201d \u201cAll of the successive comments about [Shakira] and her identity are just not necessary, and he really just needs to put that to rest,\u201d Campano said.\n\nAdrian Salguero Guevara, a student worker at USC\u2019s Latinx student center, La CASA, majoring in political science with a minor in Spanish, shared that he actively supported Shakira during her divorce from Piqu\u00e9 but didn\u2019t view Piqu\u00e9's comments as problematic. \u201cI did see those comments [people calling Piqu\u00e9's comments racist and xenophobic]. I personally didn\u2019t see it as that,\u201d Salguero Guevara said, \u201cI think he was just calling out her fan base, and they just happened to be Latin American.\u201d\n\nShakira responded to Piqu\u00e9's comment on Twitter, reclaiming the term with the tweet, \u201cProud to be Latino Americana,\u201d accompanied by the flags of all Latin American countries. As many debate the racist and xenophobic undertones in Piqu\u00e9's comment, others also debate whether there are more appropriate terms than \u201cLatino Americana\u201d to include all genders.\n\nIdentifying terms such as Latinx, Latino/a and Latine, for example, have emerged in the Spanish-speaking community to include those outside of the gender binary while speaking the traditionally gendered language. Professor Alvaro Ramirez, a Spanish professor at St. Mary\u2019s College, personally identifies as Latino and discusses the origins of the term Latinx. \u201cIts origin, to me as I see it, is within the university, within the gender and women\u2019s studies department, where obviously there was a movement towards making language more inclusive to make people visible,\u201d Ramirez said.\n\nHe continues to explain that the push for more inclusive language started in the early 2000s, but terms such as Latinx and Latine have been introduced in more recent years. These terms are only utilized in the United States and discussed at the higher education level, where many people outside of the U.S. in Latin American countries haven\u2019t fully adopted any variation of the term Latinx.\n\nAs an international student from Colombia, Aguirre first heard the term \u201cLatinx\u201d when he immigrated to the U.S. Despite American scholars attempting to create an inclusive Spanish language, there is a disconnect between academics and the experiences of the Latinx community, including immigrants, Aguirre said. \u201cI personally don\u2019t really use the term Latinx or like Latine, because those are terms that aren\u2019t really coined by Latin American people, and they\u2019re not used in Latin America popularly,\u201d Aguirre said. \u201cHowever, I do think there needs to be work done in inclusive language and making sure that we are being inclusive of people\u2019s identities.\u201d\n\nAguirre says the Spanish language can naturally evolve to become more inclusive; however, he hopes that residents of Latin American countries can lead that change rather than simply those in the U.S.\n\nCampano shares their preferences and views on being referred to in Spanish, as a gender non-conforming individual. \u201cAs somebody that is gender non-conforming, I really don\u2019t care what people do refer to me. I get a Latino, I get Latina, and I also get Latinx,\u201d Campano said.\n\nStudents share that they personally identify with a preferred term, but use Latinx to include non-binary and trans people within the Latinx community. \u201cWhen I talk about the community, I use Latinx, just so everyone feels included in the community,\u201d Salguero Guevara said. \u201cI personally identify as Latino, but it\u2019s just being aware that you\u2019re just trying to be inclusive and try to make everyone feel part of the community.\u201d\n\nAlthough the terms such as Latinx and Latine are highly debated within the community, the fight for inclusive language remains. \u201cYou [young people] are going to be the ones in charge to make those changes or try to make those changes in society so that it becomes more inclusive, more respectful of each other and to make visible everybody in the community,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cSo then no one remains invisible.\u201d\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nBy Jack Hallinan April 19, 2023 at 12:18 pm PDT\n\nAfter releasing two critical and box-office darlings in quick succession, Ari Aster needed about three years to craft his latest feature film. Reportedly, the idea for \u201cBeau Is Afraid\u201d has been bouncing around Aster\u2019s head for more than a decade. He made a short film in 2011 titled \u201cBeau\u201d that became the basis for one of the film\u2019s opening sequences and a draft of script from 2014 has circled the internet, containing many of the same details in Aster\u2019s 2023 film.\n\nThe A24-produced movie takes place over several days, as the titular Beau Wassermann (Joaquin Phoenix), a timid, anxious man-child tries to reach his demanding mother\u2019s funeral, with whom he had a strained relationship. While you\u2019ll see \u201cBeau Is Afraid\u201d loosely described as a dark comedy horror film, Aster leans away from the true horror elements on display in \u201cHereditary\u201d and \u201cMidsommar\u201d and pushes fully into absurdist comedy territory.\n\nThe film\u2019s scarier moments come from the nightmarish events that happen to Beau \u2014 not in a spooky, Ouija board way, but in the succession of unfortunate events he experiences. In one early sequence, he mysteriously loses his keys, has an anxiety attack, then takes his anxiety pills improperly, sending him into a frenzy to alleviate the side effects.\n\nThe absurdist series of events gives the film a manic quality, which feels like Aster eschewing the masterfully tight pacing of his previous work. Phoenix instills the character with a believable paranoia that, between his performance and the editing, places the audiences firmly in Beau\u2019s point of view as he goes on this hellish journey to return home.\n\nBefore delving deeper into the story\u2019s successes and failures, it\u2019s important to note that Aster\u2019s crew pays incredible attention to the production design. After reportedly being given A24\u2019s highest-ever budget, Aster and his crew leave no stone left unturned, particularly in their location scouting and the utilization of those spaces.\n\nBesides the general understanding that \u201cMidsommar\u201d takes places in Northern Sweden, Aster films are geography-less. They don\u2019t take place in any real state or city, making them recognizable and relatable in some way to almost everyone. Beau\u2019s apartment looks like it could be in downtown Los Angeles, but it could just as easily be an undesirable enclave of San Francisco or Manhattan.\n\nBut while the exact location lacks specificity, the walls are literally bursting with detail. The entry corridor of Beau\u2019s apartment is littered with lewd graffiti that will surely elicit laughs in the theater. Every storefront sign and billboard in the neighborhood says something funny and so ridiculous it can\u2019t possibly be real, but it will still remind you of a street you\u2019ve driven down or a store you\u2019ve walked past.\n\nThe whole cast around Phoenix gives over-the-top performances and that counter-balance Beau\u2019s confused and overwhelmed demeanor. In particular, Nathan Lane as the surgeon Roger delivers farcical line readings in the second act that provide a punch the film would otherwise be lacking in the middle. Amy Ryan as Roger\u2019s wife Grace and Kylie Rogers as their daughter Toni combine to create a dysfunctional and hysterically un-self aware family unit.\n\n\u201cBeau Is Afraid\u201d falls short of expectations in the third act, when Aster becomes too explicit in his exploration of the themes. It doesn\u2019t take a psychology degree to figure out that the film centers around Beau\u2019s bizarre relationship to his mother. Aster pulls from Sigmund Freud\u2019s Oedipus complex theory \u2014 and distorts it in amusing-enough ways \u2014 but he needed to be tighter in the writing and editing for the emotional arc between Beau and his mother to pay off.\n\nOne scene near the film\u2019s end serves as the nominal climax for their relationship, but it falls flat because Aster wrings every emotional beat out of their relationship before the audience even arrives at that conversation. In the same sequence, Aster unveils a monstrous presence in Beau\u2019s home that should be absolutely hilarious, but it\u2019s such a literalization of the motif that it feels oddly dull.\n\nInside of \u201cBeau is Afraid,\u201d there is a truly excellent movie, but that movie needed to be two and a half hours long, not three. Aster\u2019s self-indulgence comes as a disappointment in his third effort, because his first two, especially \u201cHereditary,\u201d displayed admiral self-control. In \u201cHereditary,\u201d Aster gives the audience just enough detail about the family\u2019s dynamic and the cult\u2019s mythology to keep the audience invested, whereas \u201cBeau Is Afraid\u201d makes the absurd feel tedious with its repetition.\n\nPhoenix\u2019s performance, which is Oscar-nomination worthy, still makes it worth the price of admission and Aster\u2019s ceiling as a director is still as high as any filmmaker under 40 years old. If anything, it seems like he was sitting on this idea for too long and just couldn\u2019t decide what to cut in the edit bay.\n```"}

The historic initiative comes in light of the expiration of the state and federal pandemic emergency funds, which were used to fund homeless shelter programs for the past three years.\n\nIn L.A. City Hall, Bass and her team put an emphasis on bringing unhoused Angelenos off the streets and into safe housing with the eventual goal of transitioning into permanent residences. \u201cMy top priority from day one to day 100 of my administration has been confronting the homelessness crisis with the urgency it requires, and that won\u2019t stop,\u201d Bass said in a statement. \u201cTogether, we will work to make Los Angeles safer and more livable in every neighborhood.\u201d\n\nThe biggest chunk of the budget, $250 million, has been set aside for the Inside Safe Program, which aims to reduce homelessness by purchasing motels to serve as interim housing and hiring new staff members to run the program. Of those, $47 million will be used to acquire motels and hotels to reduce future program costs.\n\nJason Ward, who serves as an economist and associate director of the Research and Development (RAND) Center on Housing and Homelessness, views the Inside Safe program as a step in the right direction. \u201cI think any worthwhile effort to get people off the streets is important, particularly given the scope of the problem here in L.A.,\u201d Ward said. \u201cThere\u2019s a report from L.A. County that came out concerning the period from May 2021 to 2022 that suggested that an average of around five unsheltered people a day were dying in the county, so that\u2019s a pretty dire situation.\u201d\n\nKristen Aster, who works as the director of public policy and advocacy for the People Concern, a social service agency aimed at alleviating homelessness and poverty, says she appreciates the program for its coordination between the city and the county of L.A. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just the city\u2019s initiative,\u201d Aster said. \u201cIt\u2019s really done in partnership with a lot of important stakeholders, and that collaboration is so important to really solve homelessness.\u201d\n\nAster specifically mentioned the resources that initiatives like Inside Safe provide, calling it an \u201ceffective intervention.\u201d \u201cOur outreach teams work really hard to build trust with our unhoused neighbors, but we often don\u2019t have the resources,\u201d she said. \u201cSo having that housing resources right then and there that we know people will be able to go into is really important.\u201d\n\nDespite the resources Inside Safe provides, Ward admits the solution to eradicating homelessness is more multi-faceted, requiring long-term development within the city. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think, you know, Inside Safe or really any combination of the kind of programs we have are going to solve homelessness,\u201d Ward said. \u201cThat\u2019s really more a matter of dramatically increasing the stock of housing that we build in the city over a long period of time to reduce the cost of housing in a meaningful and sustained way.\u201d\n\nAndy Bales, president and CEO of the nonprofit organization Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles, has expressed his support for Inside Safe. \u201cLeaving somebody outside is the worst thing that you could do for them,\u201d Bales said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, Los Angeles has a history of leaving more than 70% of the (unhoused) people out on the streets while helping a few.\u201d\n\nBass\u2019s program has been met with controversy from advocates who believe that moving individuals into hotels away from their familiar environment may be harmful. However, Ward believes these criticisms \u201cdon\u2019t seem particularly constructive,\u201d considering that most homeless individuals lack other options that are safe or viable. Bales agrees with Ward\u2019s response to criticisms, stating that the program does more good than harm. \u201cThere\u2019s always some complaints and some mishaps when human beings are involved,\u201d Bales added. \u201cBut I think overall there\u2019s a huge percentage of people getting help right now in Inside Safe and there\u2019s a large percentage staying.\u201d\n\nAccording to Aster, solutions like Inside Safe need to be more holistic and accompanied by social services tailored to the needs of the individual. Part of that initiative involves building trust with the community. \u201cI think it\u2019s all about having solutions that bring people indoors with dignity, that will help make people feel safe and secure where they\u2019re in housing and address their individualized needs, and that they have trust with the provider that\u2019s helping bring that that offer of housing and that it\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s going to work for their individual circumstance,\u201d Aster said.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/04/18/karen-bass-increases-lapd-budget-by-63/", "response": "```\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced a controversial proposal Tuesday to increase the budget of the L.A. Police Department and hire hundreds of new officers in the mayor\u2019s first city budget. The proposed budget would increase the LAPD\u2019s budget by almost 119 million, a 6.3% increase from last year\u2019s budget. \u201cI believe that living in a safe neighborhood is the right of every Angeleno,\u201d Bass said in her budget proposal. The LAPD currently operates on a budget of $1.9 billion which represents 16% of L.A.\u2019s overall budget. When costs like pensions and health benefits are considered, the number rises to $3.15 billion, representing 26.8% of the overall budget.\n\nData collected by the Action Center on Race and the Economy found that other major cities, those with a spending budget of more than $5 million, spend significantly less on policing. The New York Police Department, the largest police department in the country, spends only 5% (about 5,000 million) of the city\u2019s overall budget. In 2020 L.A. City Council cut the LAPD police budget by $150 million after massive protests following the murder of George Floyd. However, the budget\u2019s increase comes after concerns about the years-long decline of LAPD officers, having lost nearly 1,000 police officers since 2019.\n\nIn her first State of the City Address, Bass noted her \u201cdeep worry\u201d for this concern and proposed \u201caggressive recruiting\u201d and incentives for those who join the LAPD. Her proposed budget calls for the city to restore the department to 9,500 officers, which now stands at 9,103. Also addressed was the improper handling done by LAPD in the past, with Bass emphasizing the need for training that makes officers more equipped to deal with those mental illnesses. This comes after an LAPD investigation was launched in January, following three people with mental illnesses dying at the hands of the police.\n\n\u201cThe whole process is making sure that the LAPD knows when to pull off,\u201d Bass said. \u201cBut then we have to make sure that somebody picks up the phone.\u201d In an open letter Bass submitted alongside her budget proposal, she stated that \u201cpublic safety means different things to different neighborhoods,\u201d and her community safety plan \u201cis tailored to the unique needs [of] communities in Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nSome residents support Mayor Bass\u2019s proposal. Betty Carter, a resident of West L.A, said that she notices police officers everywhere in her neighborhood, but doesn\u2019t mind. \u201cI think they should be involved in the social services around the neighborhood. It\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Carter said. \u201cYou know, it makes you feel secure. I live alone, so I need to be made to feel secure.\u201d Ottnar Alteanirano, a South L.A. resident who also expressed his approval for increased police presence in his neighborhood, says that crime was \u201ctaking over.\u201d\n\nAs of April 1, violent crime had decreased by 11.7% since last year. In response to these numbers, LAPD Police Chief Michel Moore emphasized how the crime had increased since 2019, with the number of homicides and motor vehicle theft increasing by 8.2 and 47%, respectively. But while some individuals believe an increase in police numbers would best serve their communities, other L.A. residents believe in bolstering the city\u2019s budget elsewhere.\n\nA study conducted by LMU in 2022, found that 52% of L.A. residents supported proposals to redirect money from the LAPD budget. USC sophomore business major Rafael Andrade believes increasing the police force is not the only way to come back increasing crime rate. He said he \u201c100%\u201d agrees with those who argue that the proposed police funding should be diverted toward social services and community programs.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that law enforcement doesn\u2019t actually address the root causes of why harm happens in our communities,\u201d said Ivette Al\u00e9-Ferlito, the co-founder of La Defensa, a movement seeking to decarcerate the L.A. County jail system. \u201cIn fact, law enforcement doesn\u2019t prevent any harm. Law enforcement is called when things have already happened.\u201d Al\u00e9-Ferlito believes the mayor should devote more attention to creating a better outreach program that is more effective at linking people to services that they need.\n\n\u201cOur police officers know as well as anyone: Law enforcement is only one piece of the puzzle,\u201d Bass said. \u201cBreaking cycles of crime must be the goal. This work of ending the vicious cycle of violence requires prevention, intervention, mental health services, substance abuse treatment and police reform.\u201d \n```"}

(Photo by Jason Goode)\n\nBy Jack Waterman and Payton May April 18, 2023 at 9:28 pm PDT\n\nGoodbyes were said to USG President Hannah Woodworth on Tuesday night as the university welcomed in fresh faces of leadership at the state of USG address. \u201cI am truly delighted as I look at this group before me,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cAs I look at all of these faces, I see colleagues, mentors and advocates that have contributed to our historic success this year.\u201d\n\nWoodworth began the address by sharing the goals she and her vice president, Nivea Krishnan, entered their term with. She emphasized their mission to maximize student government\u2019s full potential: to build relationships and come together as an organization, student body and partner with university administration.\n\n\u201cAt the start of the academic year, Nivea and I felt a strong sense of optimism,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cI think many of us thought that \u2014 we were entering our first fully in-person year since 2018.\u201d But just days before the beginning of the semester, an overwhelming majority of USC\u2019s fraternities disaffiliated from the university \u2014 an obstacle Woodworth said they couldn\u2019t have seen coming.\n\n\u201cThis year we would inevitably face obstacles, things that were out of control \u2014 but what we could control is how we react,\u201d Woodworth said. With the support of her executive cabinet, partners in student affairs and senior leadership, Woodworth said they got to work on an ambitious agenda.\n\nIn October 2022, USG launched a pilot program offering free shuttle rides to LAX for students during school breaks. The affordability and sustainability initiative was used by over 4,000 students and was designed to eliminate travel barriers for students as well as decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Woodworth proudly announced that the project is being overtaken by university administration, increasing USG\u2019s budget for the following year.\n\n\u201c[This] offers us the flexibility to keep pursuing dynamic initiatives that reflect the changing needs of our student body ... it was a reflection of our approach to advocacy this year,\u201d Woodworth said. This accomplishment inspired USG\u2019s qualitative interview initiative \u2014 a program in which cabinet members met with over 20 student leaders from registered student organizations across the university. They used these conversations to inform their agenda for the year and learn how to better serve the student body and its many diverse interests.\n\nSome of these agenda items included increasing accessibility of funds towards registered student organizations and advocacy completion through outreach. Woodworth shared that they achieved these goals with the funding department allocated 98% of its budget this year compared to only 64% last year, and their communications channels reaching over 50,000 students digitally. She thanked her programming department as well for their work in hosting roughly 170 events for students and celebrated the passage of over 50 bills by the Senate.\n\n\u201cI think this really speaks to the willingness of our senators to tackle the tough issues and engage in meaningful dialogue about the structural changes that are needed to make student government the most effective for most students,\u201d Woodworth said. To close the cabinet\u2019s long list of accomplishments, Woodworth left attendees with the success she\u2019s most proud of.\n\n\u201cWe are well on our way to fully revitalizing our organizational culture,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cFrom day one, our cabinet committed to being in the office day in and day out; it doesn\u2019t just mean being physically in the office, it means being committed to this role.\u201d Woodworth went on to say she never saw herself in student government, and instead had always been the one criticizing the institution. After returning to campus her junior year though, she was encouraged to apply and said she saw the organization\u2019s potential.\n\nTwo years later, she reflects on that decision and looks forward to the future she hopes USG has been able to create. \u201cIn this moment, it is my utmost goal that, when we look back in 10 years from now, we know that we are setting up the next year and the next, to be better than we are, to have the ability to make the changes we could not,\u201d Woodworth said. To close, she provided some parting words of advice.\n\n\u201cBe courageous in your advocacy because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll never know what is possible,\u201d Woodworth said. \u201cAnd for one last time, as always, fight on.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the president-elect was sworn in.

This process could take years to complete along the many other initiates the committee has set, he said.\n\nIn the meantime, the committee hopes that the student body will engage in the newly launched Trojan learning modules as it is a widely accessible way for students to educate on how to become aware and involved in sustainability on campus.\n\n\u201cStudents like to hear from other students who like to learn from other students,\u201d Dux said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a pathway. It comes down to time. So we welcome everybody into this work together.\n```"}

Jinny Kim brings you more on invisible disabilities and how they affect celebrities and fans alike.\n\nI want to talk about Selena Gomez. And no, it\u2019s not about her dating rumors or drama. In February, Gomez livestreamed on TikTok to respond to the recent fat shaming comments from tabloids and the Internet.\n\nGOMEZ: I just wanted to say and encourage anyone out there who feels any sort of shame for exactly what they\u2019re going through and nobody knows the real stories.\n\nGomez has lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the immune system to attack healthy tissue. Weight gain can be a side effect of medication, which she has publicly opened up about.\n\nGOMEZ: I don\u2019t believe in shaming people for body or anything.\n\nThis body-shaming phenomenon of celebs who have chronic illnesses unfortunately isn\u2019t unique to Selena. Twitter users recently poked fun at a red-carpet picture of Abbott Elementary star Tyler James Williams for his thin-looking frame\u2014without knowing that he has Crohn\u2019s disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. It\u2019s also reminiscent of late actor Chadwick Boseman, who received similar comments about his body before his sudden passing in 2020 due to colon cancer.\n\nWhen you don\u2019t know someone\u2019s medical history, you truly have no idea what someone might be going through.\n\nDr. William Stohl is professor of medicine at the Keck School of Medicine and chief of the Division of Rheumatology. He spoke about some of the less visible manifestations of chronic illnesses like lupus.\n\nSTOHL: Perhaps the more invisible or what perhaps people don\u2019t think about as much is that you just feel lousy. You don\u2019t have the energy you used to have. You don\u2019t have the stamina you used to have. Brain fog. That\u2019s a real big one.\n\nDr. Patricia Ganz, a medical oncologist and the associate director for Population Science Research at the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, backed up Dr. Stohl\u2019s comments about the struggles of less visible chronic illness symptoms.\n\nGANZ: Social Security disability was using very old classifications, like if you have very advanced cancer and are going to die from it, you know, they would give you disability. But we pointed out all of these things, the fatigue that may make it difficult for people to work, the cognitive difficulties.\n\nAccording to health and disability news publication Disabled World, an estimated 10% of people in the U.S. have an invisible or hidden disability. But Dr. Ganz explained how these misconceptions about what a disability \u201cshould\u201d look like make it harder for these people with invisible disabilities to receive accommodations.\n\nGANZ: There are legal options in terms of protecting this, but sometimes it is difficult when people look well, they\u2019re well-groomed, they look like there\u2019s no scar, you know, physical scar that you can see. It\u2019s, it\u2019s harder for them to get those accommodations.\n\nAlong with medical professionals like Dr. Ganz and Dr. Stohl making developments in the treatment and education of chronic illnesses, star power is also making strides. Other celebs like Lady Gaga, Michael J. Fox, Daniel Radcliffe, and Gigi Hadid are helping break down the stigma by being open about their hidden disabilities and chronic conditions.\n\nIf you are seeking accommodations or other disability-related resources at USC, check out the Office of Student Accessibility Services at osas.usc.edu.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Jinny Kim.\n```"}

IOC President Thomas Bach strikes again by officially recommending the inclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes, paving the way for their participation in Paris 2024.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and IOC President Thomas Bach meet in the Bolshoi Ice Dome in Sochi, Russia, on February 15, 2014. (RIA-Novosti, Mikhail Klimentyev, Presidential Press Service via AP, file)\n\nBy Valerie Fang April 18, 2023 at  5:36 pm PDT\n\n\u201cIn the Loop\u201d is a column by Valerie Fang dedicated to the sport of figure skating. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has recently issued a series of official recommendations that, if adopted by its member sports federations, would allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to international competitions. These recommendations indicate that athletes with Russian or Belarusian passports must compete as \u201cIndividual Neutral Athletes.\u201d While Thomas Bach, the President of the IOC, dodged the question of whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete in next year\u2019s Summer Olympic Games, the recommendations conveniently came in the middle of the qualifying period. Essentially, the athletes would be allowed to earn places at those qualifying competitions, opening a path to Paris 2024.\n\nI wrote an article a while back when the IOC first released a statement in January saying that they were considering the possibility of including Russian and Belarusian athletes in international competitions. I still stand by what I wrote in that article. Figure skating has been widely regarded as Russia\u2019s national sport. Similar to how chess was once deployed as political propaganda by the Soviet Union, Russia\u2019s dominance in figure skating in recent years is being used by the government as a means to project national power, boost national pride and even advance political goals. The Russian government has poured significant resources into training programs and facilities. By promoting the development of young skaters, especially in the discipline of women\u2019s skating, Russia is able to demonstrate the country\u2019s athletic superiority and cultural sophistication. Moreover, Russian officials have often used figure skating competitions as an opportunity to engage in high-level diplomacy with other countries, leveraging the popularity of the sport to build relationships and advance their foreign policy objectives.\n\nGiven this politicized context surrounding Russian figure skating, I am worried that the return of Russian and Belarusian athletes would restore Russia\u2019s international influence to an extent, leading to more aggressive measures on Ukraine. According to today\u2019s news, the recently appointed President of the Figure Skating Federation of Russia (FFKKR), Anton Sikharulidze, claimed that \u201cmany international officials are keen for the return of Russian competitors despite the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine,\u201d and \u201chas pledged to maintain contact with the International Skating Union (ISU).\u201d Please, take care of Kamila Valieva\u2019s doping scandal before you demand for more. Olympic team figure skaters are still waiting on their medals from Beijing 2022 because the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) is too busy with trying to protect the skater, delaying the process of reaching a just decision on the future of this 16-year-old who has been championed as a national hero back in Russia. The latest status of Valieva\u2019s doping case is that the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is appealing RUSADA\u2019s questionable decision of \u201cno fault\u201d to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which will take at least another several months.\n\nUltimately, I am once more disappointed in Bach\u2019s hypocrisy. Even before the invasion of Ukraine, Russia should have received a harsher punishment than competing as the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) for its state-sponsored doping program. Nothing has changed for the Russian athletes and they are still cheating. Now, Bach is again choosing leniency towards Russia and seems to be not considering any negative complications the IOC\u2019s decisions might cause. The ISU will convene in June to decide whether or not the figure skating governing body will adopt the official recommendations. Considering how the ISU has already opened its door to Russian skating representatives, I predict that, yes, the ISU will allow Russian and Belarusian skaters to gradually return to the game. With a heavy heart, we will stay tuned. \u201cIn the Loop\u201d runs every other Tuesday.\n```"}

Many students are expressing their struggles with a club culture that appears to be both overly selective and exclusionary to new applicants.\n\nJunior theater major Mia Juni shared her frustration with what she feels is too harsh of an application process.\n\nJUNI: I think a lot of times clubs will reject like a large amount of people or especially underclassmen, because they consider it like a tough love thing where it\u2019s like everyone is initiated like this and we\u2019re only in this position because we were also rejected. But I don\u2019t know if that necessarily encourages people to come back and it might like dishearten them instead, because I know that\u2019s happened to a couple of people.\n\nPart of the appeal of joining a club at college is meeting new people. However, with clubs seeming increasingly restrictive, opportunities for meeting other students seem more elusive than ever.\n\nFreshman Mac Werthman shared her thoughts on how different the club landscape feels at USC.\n\nWERTHMAN: In high school it was like, you know, you could just sign up and then show up and people were just happy to see you there. Whereas like now it\u2019s like you have to apply or you have to pay or you have to audition or you know, you have to know someone in order to get in.\n\nFor some clubs, connections seem to be key, making who you know feel more important than what you can do.\n\nFreshman theater major Keira Osborne shared her frustration with a culture she perceives as rooted in nepotism and her experience being rejected from a dance club, despite being a dancer of 15 years.\n\nOSBORNE: I figured, like, if you are a trained dancer, like, you wouldn\u2019t have a problem getting onto them. And then obviously, like, that wasn\u2019t the case because I went to an audition for like a contemporary dance team and I auditioned. I walked in the room and everybody had on a T-shirt that said, like, what sorority they were in? And I\u2019m not in one.\n\nWhile the process may be difficult, Osborne offered her thoughts on how it can be improved to welcome more students.\n\nOSBORNE: Maybe the people who run the clubs, like, should have somebody like that\u2019s facilitating to make sure that you don\u2019t like put your friends in it. Like, I know for, like the ISP\u2019s for theater, like we have like an idea coordinator who makes sure that like the cast is diverse and things like that. So I think and to make sure that the directors not just like putting their friends in it, like maybe a position like that might help.\n\nWith over 1,000 student organizations at USC, not even the long application processes can stop students from finding a community they connect with.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Maya Gomes.\n```"}

(Photo courtesy of Stevepb)  By   Grace Gerstner April 18, 2023 at  4:42 pm PDT \n \nDiet culture seems to be the latest buzz word from influencers on TikTok but it is also crept its way into the classroom. Reporter Grace Gerstner helps us take closer look of how diet culture effects the everyday life of USC students. Diet culture is a way of thinking that has been criticized for putting appearance and body size over healthy eating and exercise. This culture causes harm to both physical and mental health by creating dangerous behavior. Diet culture is extremely prevalent on college campuses because we are constantly comparing ourselves to our peers.\n\nHailey Martinez, a junior at USC, says that even if you cannot always feel the toxicity of diet culture, it still exists under the surface. MARTINEZ: I feel like diet culture is not something that you see, but rather something that you feel or hear about, like just from individual students. So I don\u2019t know if that is something that is not wrong with them or something to criticize about them, but rather a reflection of bigger issues that we have.\n\nSeeing the effects of diet culture take place first-hand or heard can be disheartening. Elsie Bencke, a freshman at USC sees the diet culture in specific parts and groups on campus. BENCKE: Definitely dining halls is a main place. I just hear it amongst me and my peers, and especially especially in circles and Greek life and girls.\n\nA lot of the USC population is aware of the culture on campus and there needs to be a change. This issue has reached the masters student programs who are working to create a more accepting and healthy environment on campus. Kristine Wong is a first-year master\u2019s student obtaining her degree in nutrition, health span and longevity. Diet culture is a beast that affects everyone differently. It can affect your social interaction, self image issues, and physical health.\n\nWONG: I think that diet culture is really complex because every single person will have a different experience with it and have has been impacted by it in a different way. Ultimately, I think it is an idea of what your body should look like and what you should be eating or doing to obtain that.\n\nWhile at USC, Kristine noticed that diet culture was exacerbated by the social expectations and life at USC. When restrictive dieting occurs your body is put into stress and enters a type of survival mode. WONG: So a lot of the harm in dieting is on the physical and mental part of health, because when you\u2019re dieting and you\u2019re putting your body in this, like restricted caloric zone, your body has so many adaptive strategies to help you survive.\n\nKristine says that we all need the reminder that health is not determined by body size. Everyone is different and requires a different amount of food. WONG: Ultimately, one of the concepts that I really try to practice is health at every size, which is this idea that you can\u2019t base someone\u2019s health based off of their body size. It is so important to remember the importance of putting your health before social expectations of what you should look like. Not all bodies are the same and there is no specific diet that works for everyone.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Grace Gerstner.\n```"}

Well, look no further - USC H-REC is here to help. The center hosts e-waste drives, encouraging students to recycle their old phones and other electronic drivers. Logan Drone has more on the story.\n\nAccording to the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, in 2019, 7 million tons of e-waste was produced in the United States, but just 15% of it was properly recycled. To combat that, USC\u2019s Human Resources, Equity and Compliance, or H-Rec, department partnered with the hazardous materials division of the California Department of Health and Safety to host USC\u2019s first annual e-waste drive.\n\nLast year, the university as a whole recycled a little over 337,000 lbs of electronic devices. Emily White, the business operations specialist of H-Rec, says many people just don\u2019t know what to do with their old devices.\n\nWHITE: What I\u2019m finding on this drive that we have is people have tons of recyclable items at home that they really want to know where to put.\n\nAnthony Rodriguez, a worker at the hazardous materials division, says it\u2019s important that people dispose of their old technology the right way, because it can be dangerous when misplaced.\n\nRODRIGUEZ: So the electronic components do have a lot of metals...that have a negative impact to the environment. So by managing these properly and giving them a second life as well as proper recycling of these, we keep these out of the landfill - so there\u2019s no possibility for any of these metals to leach out into the environment.\n\nLeeching, as Rodriguez mentioned, occurs when toxic metals like mercury and lead found in hardware dissolve spread out, eventually pooling into the ground under the landfill. The toxic materials can contaminate groundwater, which can affect nearby wildlife.\n\nHowever, White encourages recycling as it prevents the need for mining new materials and unintentionally throwing out old equipment that is still usable.\n\nWHITE: What we really want to do is make sure that we can give it a second life or at least keep it out of landfills. What we\u2019d like to do is donate a lot of our desktops to high school students and the community that really can use it.\n\nIf you have any extra electronic devices and are looking to give them a second life, the e-waste drive will be open until Thursday from 9:30 A.M. - 1:00 P.M. at the USC Credit Union tomorrow and the Carol Little building on Thursday.\n\nFor Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Logan Drone.\n```"}

Phones lit up with the notification of the album\u2019s release on platforms as Caesar took the stage. Alone on stage, Caesar left the theatrics behind and stripped his soul bare to his audience as he passionately sang through the entirety of his new album. The crowd listened quietly, taking in every word of the unheard songs as Caesar told the story of his newest project.\n\n\u201cIt really means a lot that you guys are here right now,\u201d Caesar said, emotion-filled. \u201cNEVER ENOUGH\u201d is a key to Caesar\u2019s thoughts and troubles. The songs range from playful and mellow to self-reflective and brokenhearted. Listeners are taken through the journey and cycles of finding love and falling in and out of it. Much like the rest of Caesar\u2019s discography, each song centers his vocals.\n\nThe first song on the album, \u201cOchos Rios,\u201d establishes how truthful and open Caesar is in this project. His words are raw and unfiltered as he speaks to relatable pains and emotions. \u201cOchos Rios\u201d introduces the album\u2019s overall themes of being lost, being in love and facing heartbreak. \u201cGirl, I don\u2019t deserve you / You\u2019re the one I turn to / Never meant to hurt you / You\u2019re my saving grace,\u201d Caesar sings. His admission of regret and need for this individual attests to how real and honest this album is.\n\n\u201cToronto 2014\u2032\u2032 emulates similar feelings of despair, hopelessness and the feeling of being lost. \u201cIf only I could find my way through space-time / Back to when I was happy being me,\u201d Caesar sings. Desire and love are other prevalent topics throughout the album. Caesar is adamant and forthcoming about his obsession and deep love for someone in several songs. In \u201cValentina,\u201d he says, \u201cFrom the first time I looked in your eyes / I knew that I would find a way / To make you mine.\u201d There are no conflicted feelings or second-guessing \u2014 Caesar is blatant in love songs like \u201cDo You Like Me?\u201d and \u201cSuperpowers.\u201d\n\nWith love comes heartbreak, and Caesar does not hide that in the album. In \u201cBuyers Remorse,\u201d he sings about the pains of being in a relationship that is breaking down after wanting nothing more than to be with someone and losing yourself in the process. In \u201cLet Me Go,\u201d he speaks to the difficulties when an ex won\u2019t let you move on in a passionate and intense way. \u201cI\u2019m tryna breathe, why won\u2019t you let me? / I\u2019m tryna leave, please just forget me,\u201d Caesar sings.\n\n\u201cAlways\u201d shows him in a much different light, begging for someone to come back to them despite a breakup or a new relationship. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care / If you\u2019re with somebody else / I\u2019ll give you time and space / Just know I\u2019m not a phase,\u201d Caesar pleads in \u201cAlways.\u201d In the last song in the album, which he proclaimed during the concert was his favorite, Caesar seems finally content and comfortable with the person he is with. \u201cWhen I wake up in the morning, all me want to see is you,\u201d he sings in \u201cUnstoppable.\u201d However, in this song, he speaks to more than just his feelings, but the relationship he has and the entity they have become. \u201cNow who\u2019s gon\u2019 stop us? / We\u2019re unstoppable, yes,\u201d he sings.\n\nUnlike the other love songs on the album, \u201cUnstoppable\u201d shows Caesar having feelings reciprocated and solely happy and in love. Caesar will visit six cities in his \u201cAlmost Enough: The Intimate Sessions\u201d tour, ending in Berlin on April 22.\n```"}

Taking place at USC on April 22 and 23, the festival will feature the L.A. Times Book Club and will host a variety of events in different stages, including the L.A. Times Main Stage, Children\u2019s Stage, L.A. Times en Espa\u00f1ol Stage, and Poetry Stage. The event will also have live music and food trucks. As well, the event will be attended by several celebrity memoirists, including Matthew Perry, Meghan Trainor and Jennifer Garner.\n\nThe largest literary event in the country, the festival was hosted by UCLA until 2011, when USC took over the reins. Since then, the festival has only increased in popularity and attendance, according to Kheon Ellis, a sales manager at the L.A. Times. \u201cIt feels like the turnout is [now] a lot better because it\u2019s in a general downtown area,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nDespite the celebrities that will be in attendance, the festival it\u2019s more than just a fun event for attendees, but is also a way to connect with the community. \u201cWhat makes the festival so important and unique is the community that it builds and the relationships that it develops,\u201d said Monica Rodriguez, a sophomore majoring in quantitative biology at USC who\u2019s attended every year since she was in third grade.\n\nRodriguez shared how Rachel Ren\u00e9e Russell, author of the Dork Diaries series, was the catalyst for her meeting her best friend in fifth grade due to their shared love of the series. Rodriguez would later meet Russell at the Festival. \u201cI remember I was the first person in line for the Dork Diaries signing booth,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cI told [the author] about me and my best friend from elementary school, and then she ended up giving me a signed poster for free.\u201d\n\nFestival-goers this year can check out a variety of events as Rodriguez did. Whether you want to hear about reporting on Silicon Valley, see Jamele Hill talk about her new book, or watch a dance performance by UniverSOUL Hip Hop, there is something for everyone. And, in the age of technology and immediate information, events like this one may just be what the world needs. \u201cRight now everything is digital. There\u2019s not really a lot of reading books and things like that so I think that it\u2019s really good to have a festival where it\u2019s dedicated to literature, books and different things,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nNot to mention the sheer power that a simple book can hold. \u201c(Getting) exposed to new ideas ... is something that literature and books just offer that sometimes you can\u2019t learn in the classroom,\u201d said Kyle Tien, a junior studying real-estate development.\n\nAlthough some indoor events and panels will cost money, anywhere from $5 to $200 for an all-access pass, general admission to the festival is free of charge. USC\u2019s campus will be covered with hundreds of white tents and a variety of stages where patrons can buy a book that catches their eye, dive into a niche interest or just enjoy the buzzing atmosphere around them.\n\n\u201cYou meet so many people from USC, you meet authors who came from across the country, and it\u2019s just that kind of community,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThat kind of interaction is what makes the Festival of Books.\u201d\n\nCheck out the L.A.

(Photo by Bryan Fernandez, courtesy of Zuniga)\n\nBy Tony Fajardo April 18, 2023 at 1:46 pm PDT\n\n\u201cI was very nervous and at the same time very excited.\u201d This is what Isidro Zuniga, a junior studying political science and Spanish, thought when he started to approach students to develop what is now Latino Students in Law (LSL). Zuniga felt a need to develop an organization that helped Latino students pursue a legal profession. With a city council committee recently approving the details of RepresentLA which aims to offer free legal representation for immigrants in Los Angeles, the need for diverse legal aid is crucial.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s from a personal level,\u201d Zuniga said. \u201cFrom not seeing an organization that is tailored to specifically Latinos here at USC but also on a broader scale outside of USC and in our society where we see there is a need for representation.\u201d Zuniga noticed a disparity between him and his peers, as unlike him, many came from families of legal professionals such as attorneys and judges. He believes the mentorship and guidance they can gain from this are currently unattainable for first-generation students who want to go into the legal field and a major setback to students such as himself.\n\nA recent struggle Zuniga faced as he started to prepare his law school application materials for the fall was a review of his personal statement. USC offers personal statement reviews on the pre-law advising website and writes feedback will come \u201cwithin 5 business days.\u201d However, at the time of Zuniga\u2019s interview, he said he had not heard back yet even after sending the statement two weeks prior.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s small things like that where I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, the system is there, but it\u2019s not doing anything for me,\u2019\u201d Zuniga said. \u201cLatino Students in Law is, by the name, tailored to Latinos. Most are really first-generation college students. Most are low-income,\u201d Zuniga said. \u201cOur purpose is to really help these students, including myself, get to law school, choose a career path within the legal field to follow.\u201d\n\nAccording to the State Bar of California, in 2022 Hispanics/Latinos accounted for 36% of California\u2019s adult population but only 6% of licensed attorneys in the state. In comparison, white adults accounted for 39% of the adult population but 66% of licensed attorneys.\n\nAnthony Solana, the founder of For People of Color Inc., was the first speaker LSL had come to present to their members. Solana\u2019s organization offers free law school admission consulting services to prospective applicants. They help explain supplements such as personal statements, letters of recommendation and how to prepare for the LSAT, the law school admission test. He says it\u2019s wonderful to see LSL build the community that is needed to be successful in this process.\n\n\u201cA lot of members of our community that want to go to law school are typically first generation, the first in their families to go to college, first in their families to even attempt to go to law school. And many of them do not have the resources or connections or mentors that can walk them through the process,\u201d Solana said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult process. It\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not intuitive.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Law School Survey of Student Engagement, 29% of law students are first-generation college students, but among Latino law students, that percentage is even higher, at 55%.\n\nZuniga says he was motivated by other professional Latino organizations that are also tailored to Latino students at USC such as Latino Students in Medicine (LSM) and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers at USC (SHPE).\n\n\u201cI was trying to emulate that mission, the mission of providing resources to Latino students,\u201d Zuniga said. \u201cI knew this organization was possible because there were other organizations similar to this one, in the idea that it would provide resources and it would provide community to Latino students in particular.\u201d\n\nOne of the ways LSL provides resources is with a biweekly newsletter that has information about internship opportunities, pipeline programs and scholarships. However, one of LSL\u2019s key attractions is their speaker events that have had speakers such as John Hoyt, USC Gould\u2019s Director of Admissions, and most recently, L.A. Supreme Court Judge E. Carlos Dominguez. These speaker events have been spaces in which LSL members have learned more about different career paths and further details about the admissions process as they prepare to apply to law school.\n\nZuniga says above all else, these events have been able to provide members with a place of acceptance and to not feel overlooked among the many other pre-law students at USC.\n\nSolana said he was honored to come to talk to the students about the law school process on the necessary items students need to understand when applying and he says he was proud of the organization\u2019s formation and the support it aims to provide.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re necessary at every campus in the country. I was actually frankly surprised that there wasn\u2019t an organization like this already at USC,\u201d Solana said.\n\nSolana also said he also believes that LSL has placed the necessary building blocks to develop great community leaders and as an example to follow.\n\n\u201cNot only for SC, but throughout Los Angeles as a model as to what students at college campuses can do to provide that support network and that mentorship in order to advance their career ambition,\u201d Solana said.\n\nSilvia Argueta, executive director of the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, also agrees with the idea that one of the biggest motivations for her decision to become a lawyer came from exposure and mentorship from people already in the profession during her junior year at UCLA.\n\nThe Legal Aid Foundation is a nonprofit law firm that provides free legal services to people in L.A. on a variety of subjects such as immigration, housing, and medical issues. The foundation has various offices located throughout the city and is open to volunteers to assist with their services.\n\n\u201cI am forever in their debt because they showed me the way. They showed me a path,\u201d Argueta said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t just say, \u2018Hey, you should be a lawyer.\u2019 Instead, they were like, \u2018This is what you need to do. This is what you need to focus on.\u2019\u201d\n\nArgueta also said a non-diverse legal field can bring forth issues for the people who need legal assistance due to a lack of exposure and understanding of the resources available to them.\n\n\u201cWhen they end up in needing access to justice, that\u2019s when they are faced with not having people who understand the issues that they\u2019re facing because it\u2019s culture or language or other barriers are either or even poverty,\u201d Argueta said. \u201cAnd so I think having Latino attorneys is critical as we move forward as a community.\u201d\n\nIn addition to providing resources for their professional development, Zuniga wants to make sure the general members maintain a cultural connection with the Latino community. Even the small things such as providing conchas and champurrado at general meetings are LSL\u2019s attempts to remind LSL members of where the cultures they come from.\n\n\u201cIn general, as Latinos, we are united, we are very family-oriented,\u201d Zuniga said. \u201cAnd so from the start, we have always thought about creating a community. It\u2019s not really an organization, it\u2019s not really a group, but it\u2019s more so a community of students who are pursuing the same goal.\u201d\n\nLSL has demonstrated this commitment to the community with a collaboration with Latino Students in Medicine on a study night between members at the beginning of March followed up by a student mixer at Mercado La Paloma with its members.\n\n\u201cWe just look forward to developing and strengthening that relationship with [LSM] and with the other Latino cultural organizations here on campus too,\u201d Zuniga said.\n\nIn addition to their successful events throughout the semester, LSL announced at the end of March their official affiliation with the USC Gould School of Law which will provide them with funding and access to all the rooms in the school to use for their events.\n\nZuniga and the team were excited to hear the news and are eager to now see what LSL will be able to accomplish in the Fall.\n\n\u201cWe want to see you as Latino attorneys, and we need you to become a Latino attorney. We need you to become attorneys because our people and our community needs it,\u201d Zuniga said.\n```"}
{"key": "/2023/04/17/college-basketball-catch-up-the-madness-of-the-transfer-portal/", "response": "```\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d is a column by Terence Holton discussing the latest men\u2019s college basketball headlines. As of April 1, there were over 1,100 players in the NCAA transfer portal. Over the past few years, the transfer portal has become extremely popular, especially if a player wants minutes immediately. The portal has some ups and downs, so let\u2019s explore them.\n\nI have two very different opinions about the transfer portal. The first is that I love how players spread talent far and wide across the board. In my opinion, this past year of college basketball was one of the best and most competitive we have seen in years. This is partially because many players transferred to different programs \u2014 for example, third-year sophomore forward Norchad Omier of Miami. Omier played two seasons at Arkansas State before transferring to Miami. Omier was a crucial part of the Hurricanes\u2019 run to the Final Four this year, averaging 13 points and 10 rebounds. This is one reason I am a fan of the transfer portal, as it gives players who were under-scouted in high school a second chance to show out nationally. While Omier won\u2019t get drafted this year, it is very likely that by the end of his NCAA eligibility, he will find himself on an NBA team, as he is a very athletic and talented player.\n\nAnother reason I like the transfer portal is that it allows players to play at a lower level, hone their skills, and possibly transfer back to a Power 6 school \u2014 for example, now-LSU sophomore guard Jalen Cook. Cook originally played for the Tigers straight out of high school but, after a lackluster freshman year, transferred to Tulane. This past season, Cook averaged 19.9 points and 4.9 assists per game. Cook entered the transfer portal this offseason and recently signed back with LSU. The transfer portal is just a great use of second chances in college basketball.\n\nSome people believe that the transfer portal is ruining college sports as it commercializes college sports. However, I don\u2019t see that to be the case. As I stated earlier, it gives second chances to players who either need to go down a level of competition to up their game or a chance to prove themselves at a higher level of play when they weren\u2019t scouted heavily in high school. Of course, there are drawbacks, but overall the recent popularity of the transfer portal has been a smashing success. This was one of the most fun college basketball seasons we have had in years, and I think it is because the distribution of talent is so spread out.\n\nSpeaking of talent being spread out, here are some of my top transfers still available and looking for a team to take to the next level. The outright best: Junior center Hunter Dickinson, transferring from Michigan After three extremely good seasons for Michigan, Dickinson decided to transfer and is by far the best player in the portal. Dickinson averaged 18.5 points and nine rebounds per game. He will undoubtedly be a contender for national player of the year, and whichever team lands him will land an instant impact player. On3 sports currently has him favored to go to Kansas, with Maryland in the mix as well. All I know is Kansas would be scary with him, as the Jayhawks with a dominant center is always a tough matchup.\n\nBest mid-major: Senior guard Max Abmas, transferring from Oral Roberts Abmas has been one of the best scorers in college basketball since he started at Oral Roberts and has averaged 20+ points per game the last three seasons. Whoever lands him gets an immediate go-to-scorer and leader. Abmas has scheduled a visit with Kansas State, and I think he should go there as he would perfectly replace the departing Markquis Nowell. However, 247 Sports recently Crystal Balled him to Texas, where he would also fit in nicely.\n\nHuge upside: Sophomore guard Ryan Nembhard is transferring from Creighton This transfer was a surprise since Nembhard had just led Creighton to the Elite Eight. However, it seems players transfer at the drop of a pin nowadays. Nembhard was a leader at Creighton as only a sophomore and averaged 12.1 points and 4.8 assists. He will bring veteran leadership and, in my book, will be a preseason candidate for the Bob Cousy Award next season. Sadly, On3 sports predicts he will go to Arizona next year, so I suppose I will have to root against him if that comes true, but Nembhard will surely impact whichever team lands him.\n\n\u201cCollege Basketball Catch-Up\u201d runs every Monday.\n```"}

Nicki Berelson has the story. USC students went out in droves to Coachella weekend one, which saw Frank Ocean perform live for the first time in six years, albeit for much shorter than fans were hoping for.\n\nLICHTMAN: People were walking out and, like, yelling that they wanted refunds. It was really disappointing. Elise Lichtman and USC-student Griffin Ainsworth were about to leave when Ocean finally appeared, about an hour later than scheduled. The two-time Grammy winner left before scheduled too, obstructed by performers who encircled him for much of his time onstage, but Ainsworth enjoyed his set regardless.\n\nAINSORTH: \u201cHe came on like as soon as we were about to go to other sets so I stayed, and, like I\u2019m happy I did, but... Yeah I mean it\u2019s Frank Ocean it\u2019s hard to be upset.\u201d\n\nAmidst Ocean\u2019s controversy as Sunday\u2019s headliner, Coachella made history on each of the two previous days. Bad Bunny became the first Latino artist to headline the historic festival on Friday before BLACKPINK headlined Saturday as the first K-pop group ever to do so. That\u2019s \u201cHow you like that\u201d by BLACKPINK.\n\nSo how you like paying some the big bucks to go to Coachella? General admission tickets start at around $550, which doesn\u2019t even take into account the unavoidable cost for parking and lodging. One USC student who didn\u2019t go to this past weekend says she\u2019s glad she saved the money.\n\nADATIA: \u201cI wasn\u2019t fond of the lineup, like I didn\u2019t want to spend 600-plus dollars on a lineup that I didn\u2019t care as much about.\u201d\n\nFans await Ocean\u2019s second performance this coming weekend, hoping to see and hear more from the R&B star this time around. Festival-goers for weekend two should also keep a look out for a Trojan in the Desert. This is Thornton student Garrett Murphy. He\u2019s a sophomore studying Music Industry. Murphy will perform at the DoLaB stage this weekend. But don\u2019t look for Garrett Murphy under his real name.

Kimberly Aguirre reports on the recent trend. Imagine you\u2019re late for work. You barely managed to grab a makeshift sandwich and are running for your car. You get in, lock the door and turn the keys, and suddenly.... [AMB: car without catalytic converter] That\u2019s what happens when a car does not have a catalytic converter. Catalytic converters help control the emissions from your car by turning toxic chemicals from your exhaust into less-toxic pollutants. They also help the car not make that awful sound. These auto parts have recently turned into a highly popular item to steal. According to city councilmembers, in the city of Los Angeles, about 8,000 reported catalytic converter thefts happened last year, up from 972 reported in 2018. These highly coveted items can be resold by thieves for around 800 to 1,200 dollars. They can also be melted to extract three expensive metals: Platinum, palladium and rhodium which on average would collectively sell for around 1,500 dollars. Experienced thieves can take out a catalytic converter from underneath your car in a matter of minutes and with easily accessible hardware tools. Without a catalytic converter, cars become extremely loud, dangerous and practically undrivable. James Francis Flynn is an Angeleno who recently had his car\u2019s catalytic converter stolen. FLYNN: I turned on the car and immediately knew because it it. It. There\u2019s this really, like, loud sound that that that it was it was clear straight away. So immediately I was just like, well, okay, that happened. And I still had to take my son to school. So I drove him with the with the catalytic converter like that and the plate scraping the floor. They can even take months and thousands of dollars to acquire, replace and install. On April 11, the LA City Council passed an ordinance allowing police to arrest anyone in possession of a catalytic converter for which they can\u2019t prove ownership. It would also carry a one year jail sentence and an 1,000 dollar fine. But for extra precautions, the Los Angeles Police Department hosted a public event to highlight other ways in which you can keep your car safe. Detective Michael Ventura, one of the LAPD\u2019s spokespeople, highlights that the best possible prevention method would be installing a shield to make it physically harder for thieves. But that would run you down a few hundred dollars. Or, Ventura says another alternative is to deter stealing by making it harder for the thieves to resell. VENTURA: We\u2019re actually etching the VIN numbers onto these cats. We also spray paint. We mark them in high visibility paint. So if somebody gets caught or they can make sure that they know, hey, a reasonable person would have known that this is going to be something you should not steal. But this assumes that the scrap and precious metal recyclers out there are scrupulous ... But are they? For Annenberg Media, I\u2019m Kimberly Aguirre.\n```"}

(Photo by Laurie Carrillo)\n\nBy Laurie Carrillo\nApril 17, 2023 at 4:46 pm PDT\n\nJust off campus, there\u2019s a two-story home known on West 37th Street as \u201cMama\u2019s Mansion,\u201d named long before any of its 10 residents signed their lease. Around the back, on a recent Sunday in the spacious parking area affectionately nicknamed \u201ctiny lot,\u201d late-afternoon sunshine showered a buzzing crowd of visitors as they listened to the acoustic strummings of student performers reverberate against the brick walls.\n\nOn April 2, three \u201cMama\u2019s Mansion\u201d housemates put on the second installment of \u201cMama\u2019s Triptych,\u201d a three-part art exhibition consisting of an array of student vendors, a lineup of student musicians and a showcase of student dancers. The event was a collaborative effort between the Media Arts and Practice (MA+P) organization ZAP SC, the USC Songwriter\u2019s Forum and USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance students, all culminating in two hours of multi-platform art appreciation. Students were able to attend free of charge and could pay five dollars to watch the dance performances.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing was about community, the incredible art that we have created and the unity that we can have with all of our art,\u201d said Jazmin Polido, a literary editing and publishing master\u2019s student and event organizer. \u201cWe wanted to showcase all of it at once and have it all be layered together and connected.\u201d\n\nStudents display art relating to the event's theme: introspection. (Photo by Laurie Carrillo)\n\nThe idea for \u201cMama\u2019s Triptych\u201d was born when senior dance BFA student Haily Foster was brainstorming proposals for her thesis capstone project. Her vision was to create an immersive showcase where different dance scenes would take place in different rooms in a house, she said, to keep the audience up, moving and engaged.\n\n\u201cYou are choosing your own adventure. You\u2019re able to watch something for 15 minutes or for 15 seconds, and it\u2019s up to you to decide what your experience is,\u201d Foster said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re like a foot away from the performer, you can see more closely what story they\u2019re trying to tell.\u201d\n\nSenior media arts and practice major Karen Abe long had dreams to host an art exhibition in their back lot and Polido wanted to host a live music event to promote her club\u2019s semester project. Last year, the three housemates merged their ideas to create \u201cMama\u2019s Triptych.\u201d The exhibition\u2019s first installment was last spring, what Abe referred to as a \u201ctrial run\u201d of sorts. The three organizers had fewer resources and manpower at their service, keeping the event and staff mostly within their close group of friends.\n\nThis year, they branched out and recruited the help of their peers from each of their artistic niches. \u201cAll three of us wanted to step up our game,\u201d Abe said. \u201cFor the whole exhibition, we wanted to have a more cohesive storyline through all three portions.\u201d\n\nAn interactive wall allowed students to write what they wish others knew about them. (Photo by Laurie Carrillo)\n\nIntrospection was the theme of the night. Attendees were encouraged to think about who they really were compared to what others around them perceived them as Foster said. A piece of paper was taped on one of the brick walls enclosing the backlot with the question \u201cWhat do you wish people knew about you?\u201d written across it. Throughout the evening, guests and staff alike scribbled their answers on sticky notes and pasted it on the wall, accumulating a colorful collection of people\u2019s inner musings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this question that we don\u2019t have an answer to and it\u2019s something that I think is interesting to be comfortable with, not understanding and not knowing how other people see us,\u201d Foster said. \u201cInvestigating how people could see us allows us to also understand more about ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe theme carried into the indoor dance performance, titled \u201cJanus.\u201d Despite spearheading the preparation, Foster didn\u2019t choreograph a single move performed at the exhibition. The Kaufman dancers improvised instead. Individuals involved in organizing the event recorded vulnerable voice memos anonymously answering questions about self-perception which Foster compiled and layered into a musical composition for the dancers.\n\nTo prepare for Mama\u2019s Triptych, Foster would host weekly conversations with the dancers to get them thinking about what story they wanted to tell. She supplied prompts for them to write out their thoughts, creating a framework for their performance rather than explicit instructions on what they should do.\n\n\u201cI just wanted it to be more of a rehearsal process where we broke down some of the walls that we have,\u201d Foster said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to just be about my story. I wanted everyone\u2019s voice to be equal to my own, and to position myself as just a creative curator.\u201d\n\nStudents display their art at the event. (Photo by Laurie Carrillo)\n\nAnother dimension of \u201cJanus\u201d was the visual effects and art created by ZAP SC. The club is composed of media arts and practice students of all grade levels who all volunteered to create components for the event, including a large canvas frame around the music performance space that emulated an old-school TV.\n\n\u201cIt was really cool because I was able to get multiple brains put together to develop the visual identity of this event through the posters and Instagram presence,\u201d Abe said. \u201cI had people who were really interested in art direction and graphic design so it was very hands-on-deck.\u201d\n\nZAP was also in charge of securing vendors to set up shop at the event. Attendees could buy iced lattes from Cup of Troy. They could peruse stickers, second-hand clothes and hand-made pottery from small businesses run by students and alumni.\n\nLou Lundine graduated from USC\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts last year, and although they work full-time as a theater draftsman, they also sell handmade jewelry on the side. Mama\u2019s Triptych was their first market.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for me to find out if people like my stuff and will buy them,\u201d Lundine said. \u201cMaybe I can start selling at flea markets and expand my side hustle.\u201d\n\nAs guests decorated a Mama\u2019s Triptych tote bag with stamps and spray paint, live music filled the lot. The USC Songwriter\u2019s Forum provides performance opportunities for music creators across campus. Last year, Polido relied on the organization\u2019s equipment and resources to set up the event. This time around, Polido extended a wider net in their search for performers.\n\n\u201cI got to invite whoever I wanted, people that I love and adored, whether or not they were in the Songwriter\u2019s Forum,\u201d Polido said. I wanted to give them the opportunity to showcase their hard work and their immense talent.\u201d\n\nGroups like UnderSCore A Capella and Band Kori took to the mic. Many soloists also performed their original music in front of the assembled crowd. Junior business administration major Chloe Nicole Cruz sang three songs accompanied by her ukulele for her set, sticking around after to cheer on her fellow musicians.\n\nStudent music groups perform at the event. (Photo by Laurie Carrillo)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still very low-key about my music, and it\u2019s been awesome having these opportunities to perform and share something that I used to think was just for myself and realize people also connect with me in that way,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nA semester\u2019s worth of work wrapped up in just two hours. Over 60 guests visited the intersection of the three different groups, taking home thrifted clothes, a new artist to listen to or maybe a new perception of themselves.\n\n\u201cCollaboration adds such a special value to art,\u201d said Angela Liu, a senior studying economics and international relations global business that attended the event. \u201cEverything coming together like this just enhances its beauty and creates a sense of community.\u201d\n\nFor the three organizers, all graduating next month, Mama\u2019s Triptych tied the bow on their college experience. Planning the event was a lesson in collaboration and leadership, Abe said, but it was as exciting as it was challenging.\n\n\u201cIt almost felt wrong to have there be a product because the process itself was so beautiful,\u201d Foster said. \u201cEvery meeting that we had was so rich and full of information and it was really hard to take weeks and just put it into one scene in one story.\u201d\n\nAbe, Polido and Foster want to possibly continue the pattern of trios and host a third and last exhibition in the future, whenever and wherever their paths cross again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be stepping into it with a lot more of an understanding of what my creative voice is, how I like to go about my process,\u201d Foster said. \u201cI think what\u2019s exciting is I really don\u2019t know what it\u2019ll be, and I think that\u2019s just going to come with time.\u201d\n```"}

My love for McCartney over his mates in The Beatles is colored by my relationship to love. But the sum of their parts profoundly influenced my earliest grasp of the human condition, when my Indian immigrant parents had neither the time nor the words to help me understand the depths of yourself that only heartbreak could find. McCartney\u2019s love for love was blissfully delusional. John Lennon\u2019s had teeth.\n\nDuring his run with Wings, in fact, McCartney wrote the hopelessly \u201870s pop ballad, \u201cSilly Love Songs,\u201d in response to vitriolic critics and post-Beatles Lennon, who mocked his buoyant songwriting. \u201cI know what they mean, but people have been doing love songs forever,\u201d McCartney told Billboard in 2001. \u201cI like \u2018em. Other people like \u2018em, and there\u2019s a lot of people I love. I\u2019m lucky enough to have that in my life. So the idea was that \u2018you\u2019 may call them silly, but what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cRevolver\u201d and \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band\u201d are some of The Beatles\u2019 graceful sonic and thematic transitions into the counterculture movement of the latter half of the \u201860s, ranking among 500 of the greatest albums ever recorded, according to Rolling Stone. McCartney\u2019s defiantly flawed 1970 debut album, \u201cMcCartney,\u201d is not one of those albums. When its promotion publicly marked the end of The Beatles, the record confirmed that the utopian dream had died in the \u201860s along with the Civil Rights pioneers, victims of the Manson Family and tens of thousands of soldiers in Southeast Asia.\n\nYet, one of my favorite things about the album is that all roads to it began with love \u2014 and how much of that complicated an ostensibly simple legacy. Love may have been an impetus for the record, but how could something seemingly innocuous prevent it from becoming more to the public?\n\nLinda Eastman (left) and Paul McCartney married in 1969 and stayed together until her death by breast cancer in 1998. (Photo courtesy of Flickr/slagheap)\n\nSept. 20, 1969 will forever be known as the day Lennon quit the band, but not publicly since \u201cAbbey Road\u201d would be released in just weeks. By October, McCartney retreated to his desolate Scottish farmhouse with his wife, the rock photographer Linda Eastman, their two daughters and an assortment of sheep. Feeling worthless for the first time in his life, the former Beatle stopped keeping up appearances, harboring anger with himself and at the world. He was just 27 years old.\n\n\u201cThis was an identity crisis in extremis ... when he did get out of bed, he would reach straight for the whisky, and, by three in the afternoon, was usually out of it,\u201d said Tom Doyle in his McCartney biography, \u201cMan on the Run.\u201d\n\nGranted that they just had a baby and been married for only seven months, tying the knot after just one year of dating, Linda had every right to be afraid for herself and her children. But without Linda\u2019s compassion in spite of McCartney\u2019s near breakdown in Kintyre, Scotland, and giving him the nudge towards making music again, McCartney told Doyle, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have gone out of it.\u201d\n\nWhen he began writing love songs again, it began with a 45-second jovial declaration of his love, \u201cThe Lovely Linda,\u201d whose casual carelessness also establishes the approach of the record. (He also kept the sounds of Linda entering the room and his wholesome chuckles.)\n\nWhat started as rediscovering his love for music became a tracklist for an album. With a few Beatles throwaways, \u201cMcCartney\u201d began to coalesce in early 1970 in London between his townhouse, Abbey Road and Morgan studios.\n\n\u201cYou would never have guessed that he had any problems at all, quite frankly,\u201d Morgan\u2019s house engineer later said.\n\nAll instruments on the record (including wine glasses and a bow and arrow) were played by McCartney. A first for any Beatle, instrumentals compete for space on the solo record \u2014 five in particular (\u201cValentine Day,\u201d \u201cHot As Sun/Glasses,\u201d \u201cMomma Miss America,\u201d and \u201cKreen-Akrore\u201d) are more akin to jam sessions loosely structured by McCartney\u2019s love for folk, blues and southern tunes.\n\nThe same goes for vocal tracks, such as \u201cThat Would Be Something,\u201d \u201cOo You\u201d and \u201cTeddy Boy,\u201d which, without George Martin\u2019s studio and orchestral ingenuity or contributions from Billy Preston, almost border on mundane if you\u2019re not multitasking. But there\u2019s an undeniable warmth and homeliness to them, especially on the track with Linda\u2019s backup vocals, \u201cMan We Was Lonely,\u201d which is a twangy prelude to their professional partnership on the love-induced 1971 record, \u201cRam.\u201d\n\nWhat these songs do, if nothing else, is debunk the myth of Paul McCartney to reveal that he, too, is only a man in love \u2014 with both the people and things that give his life meaning.\n\nIn regards to substance and form as equals, three songs eclipse all else. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m Amazed\u201d bottles and convincingly sells the idea that love quells the worst of us, making it one of the greatest ballads ever conceived. Even 50 years later, \u201cEvery Night\u201d speaks to the zeitgeist of being smitten by new love in your twenty-somethings. What sounds like a nursery rhyme in \u201cJunk\u201d is the synergy of consumer commentary and whimsical impressionism \u2014 the kind of impressionism that made Lennon so revered, but with McCartney\u2019s lightheartedness.\n\nBut his love for musicianship amounted to a collection of lukewarm responses from fans and former bandmates (Lennon called the record \u201cEngelbert Humperdinck music\u201d) for these mostly sentimental \u201chalf-thoughts.\u201d Discipline without quality control.\n\nMcCartney himself never considered his responses in the self-interview sheet that came with the press\u2019 advanced copies in the U.K. to be an official Beatles breakup announcement, Keith Badman writes in \u201cThe Beatles Diary Vol. 2: After the Break-Up.\u201d When Americans caught wind of it, such as Rolling Stone critic Langdon Winner, he likened the record to the Trojan Horse that invaded Troy. A thinly veiled act of superiority for being the \u201cfirst\u201d to leave the biggest pop group in the world.\n\nAt best, \u201cMcCartney\u201d is a revealing transitional album. The scent of The Beatles still lingers. The album \u2014 at times compositionally sketchy compared to other pop records of 1970, such as Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s swansong \u201cBridge Over Troubled Water\u201d or Elton John\u2019s \u201cTumbleweed Connection\u201d \u2014 would still hit number one in the U.S. and have a much more quiet influence on music history.\n\nWhile his record almost offensively contrasted with the polished studio sound of the Beatles, McCartney, in a Peter Pan syndrome-like state with his Studer 4-track tape recorder and newfound freedom, helped revitalize DIY techniques and a lo-fi sound before the punks of the late \u201870s and after independent jazz and blues labels at the frontend of the century.\n\n\u201cLight and loose\u201d was the point, said McCartney in his infamous Beatles breakup self-interview. Attempting anything other than speaking simply and truthfully after the band had dissolved would\u2019ve been a futile gesture, because what would be the point otherwise?\n\nThe Beatles swansong record, \u201cLet It Be,\u201d a departure from the acid-dipped tuneage they mastered in the previous years, was released a month after \u201cMcCartney,\u201d also to commercial success and critical confusion. But their greatest-pop-act-to-ever-live status never waned.\n\nWhat makes \u201cMcCartney\u201d a singular record is in the way that it brings the listener closer to the icon that is McCartney with its lack of embellishments. He gave himself permission to come undone when only the best had been expected from him for so long, and start anew. It wasn\u2019t for critics or fans, but for him.\n\nMcCartney takes the concept of the artist owing the world its idea of his identity and hurls it into the rolling seas of Kintyre. It\u2019s reductive to overlook \u201cMcCartney\u201d and the former Beatle\u2019s propensity for laying bare in between \u201cAbbey Road\u201d and \u201cLet It Be,\u201d and dedicating his breakup album to simple pleasures: home, family and love.\n\n\u201cMcCartney\u201d isn\u2019t the artist at his best yet, but at his most vulnerable and pure. You could call that silly, but what\u2019s wrong with that?\n```"}

(Photo by Daphne Zhu)\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie\nApril 16, 2023 at 6:16 pm PDT\n\nKyle Kirkwood converted his pole position to a win Sunday, controlling most of the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach. The Andretti driver held the lead into turn one and led for the whole first stint of the race. He lost the lead in the second stint but took the lead on pit strategy and never looked back on the road to his first career win.\n\n\u201cThrough my entire ladder series career, I always wanted more,\u201d Kirkwood said. \u201cToday was the first time I was able to actually soak it in and acknowledge that I\u2019ve done something incredible.\u201d\n\nHis team believes today was a sign of great things to come. \u201cHe knows how to win ... When he was out front, he knew what he needed to do,\u201d team owner Michael Andretti said. \u201cHe\u2019s got all the ingredients to be a future champion many times over.\u201d\n\nRounding out the podium were Kirkwood\u2019s teammate, Romain Grosjean, and Ganassi\u2019s Marcus Ericsson. It was a bad day for most drivers who started on primary tires. On lap 22, McLaren\u2019s Pato O\u2019Ward, aware that he\u2019d reached the crossover point at which his primary tires were faster than other drivers\u2019 alternates, made a desperate attempt to pass Ganassi\u2019s Scott Dixon. Contact between the two put Dixon into the wall and brought out a yellow flag.\n\n\u201cFrom my point of view, it\u2019s a low percentage move,\u201d Ericsson said. \u201cThat move on [Kirkwood] could\u2019ve taken out me and [Kirkwood] and [Grosjean].\u201d\n\nThe caution came out at a convenient time for the alternate tire runners \u2014 only shortly before their scheduled pit stops \u2014 but meant Penske\u2019s Josef Newgarden, teammate Scott McLaughlin, O\u2019Ward and others had to pit significantly earlier than they planned. Those three drivers each saw their races unravel in the last two stints. O\u2019Ward\u2019s lunge dropped him from the top five to 13th. The Mexican driver never recovered from the incident and finished a lap down in 17th.\n\nNewgarden and McLaughlin moved to the front after O\u2019Ward\u2019s incident, putting them first and third, respectively. Both slowed significantly at the end of the stint, with both drivers struggling on the softer, alternate tires. Newgarden, in particular, then had to save more fuel than the rest of the field in the final stint. The Tennessean found himself in third at the end of the pit cycle but dropped to ninth in his efforts to make it to the end.\n\nLow fuel was an issue for more drivers than just those who started on primaries. Grosjean finished with 153 seconds of \u201cpush to pass\u201d \u2014 an accessible 50 hp \u2014 still unused to preserve fuel. \u201cI did not even want to go for the win today,\u201d Grosjean said. \u201cIt would have been taking too much risk.\u201d\n\nWith his podium, Ericsson reclaimed the lead of the series championship, opening up a 15-point lead over O\u2019Ward. IndyCar returns in two weeks as drivers take on their first road course of the season at Barber Motorsports Park.\n```"}

(Photo by Daphne Zhu)\n\nBy Nick Charles Currie April 16, 2023 at 11:47 am PDT\n\nNASCAR moved the Clash race to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in an effort to attract younger, West Coast metropolitan viewers. Formula One is set to race in Las Vegas for the first time since four disastrous attempts to run races in the Caesar\u2019s Palace parking lot, also attempting to attract West Coast viewers. IndyCar has been here for longer. Sunday, 29 open-wheel cars will see the flag fly on Shoreline Drive for the 48th Grand Prix of Long Beach, led by Andretti\u2019s Kyle Kirkwood and Ganassi\u2019s Marcus Ericsson.\n\nAlthough IndyCars look more like what F1 trots out, the field spread is much more comparable to NASCAR. Only four hundredths of a second separated the top two drivers; third through sixth were separated by less than a tenth of a second. The field does not lack drivers with the pace to come out on top.\n\nKirkwood\u2019s pole this weekend is the first of his IndyCar career. The man from Jupiter (Florida, not the planet) had one of the best careers in IndyCar development series history, but is coming off a lackluster rookie year with A.J. Foyt Racing. Only on his third race with Andretti Autosports, the young driver has shown impressive pace but has been mistake prone in his brief IndyCar career.\n\nAlexander Rossi, then driving the No. 27 car Kirkwood now pilots, was the last to win in Long Beach from pole when he bested Will Power in 2018. If Kirkwood wants to match that feat, he\u2019ll have to reign in his aggressive nature.\n\nStreet circuit stars\n\nAmong those drivers with the pace to win Sunday are a few who seem to have a little extra in the tank around street circuits. Ericsson, starting second, had competitive pace last year before an unusual wreck took him out of the race. Three of his four wins in the series have come around street circuits, and he\u2019s shown the speed this weekend to compete for yet another.\n\nRossi, now with McLaren, and Andretti\u2019s Colton Herta are both former winners around Long Beach. Neither made the Firestone Fast Six \u2014 the last round of qualifying \u2014 but both have shown the historic pace to come out on top in Southern California once again.\n\nLast year\u2019s winner, Josef Newgarden, will start alongside Herta and should factor into the results as well.\n\nOut of place\n\nNot everyone had a good Saturday. Four drivers in particular are out of place relative to their pace. Penske driver and reigning champion Will Power is the greatest qualifier in IndyCar history. No driver has more starts from pole in their career. Last year, he finished fourth in Long Beach. This year, Power couldn\u2019t get a good lap on the board and was eliminated in the first round of qualifying.\n\nRahal Letterman Lanigan Racing\u2019s Graham Rahal has also had an impressive career, but is set to start 24th following a very rough morning. Dale Coyne Racing\u2019s David Malukas, currently sixth in the championship, crashed in qualifying, bringing out a red flag and invalidating his lap. He starts 25th.\n\nOf the four, however, Callum Ilott had the worst Saturday. The Juncos Hollinger driver has impressed this year, with two top-10 finishes for the smallest team on the grid. In Saturday\u2019s practice session, Ilott clipped a curb on his first fast lap, sending him into the wall. With half the practice time of every other driver on the grid, Ilott only managed to qualify 22nd.\n\nMaking the incident particularly frustrating for Ilott is that the curb he clipped was added overnight. Teams were reportedly not informed of the change. Ed Carpenter Racing\u2019s Rinus Veekay had a similar incident but was able to return to the practice session. Ilott suggested that the series should pay for repairs needed due to the incident, but much of the damage has already been done: The Brit will have a lot of work to do if he wants to stay near the top of the standings.\n\nGrip\n\nCalifornia\u2019s uncharacteristic rain since November does not look to be playing a part in the track conditions. \u201cThis is the most grippy street course that we have,\u201d Kirkwood said. \u201cBy far.\u201d Kirkwood attributed some of that grip to IMSA and entertained the idea that the historic F1 cars, which practiced before IndyCar, could have laid down similarly beneficial rubber.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great fun to drive,\u201d Ericsson said. \u201cFirestone have brought some great street course tires.\u201d This is the first time the green-walled, sustainable alternate tires will be used around Long Beach. The tires were first run on the streets of Nashville last year and again in St. Petersburg, Florida, in March. They\u2019ve performed well, but it\u2019s yet another change to the norm.\n\nWin prediction: Ganassi\u2019s Scott Dixon\n\nYes, I\u2019m picking a driver to win who I didn\u2019t mention in the entire rest of the article. In a way, that\u2019s highly characteristic of the last few years of Dixon\u2019s career. The six-time champion has come from the blue to win a long list of races and has a great opportunity to do so again when he starts from fifth Sunday.\n\nThe Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach starts at 12:45 p.m. on NBC.\n```"}

Perhaps you have cursed at someone for honking at you or flipped a couple of birds off in response to cars cutting across four lanes of traffic without signaling \u2014 but would your fury drive you to memorize their car plate number, stalk them, and start a 10-episode-long feud that forces you to contemplate your own insecurities?\n\nA24\u2032s latest dramedy takes a universal experience of irrational road rage and shifts it into overdrive when two parties refuse to give it up. Amy Lau (Ali Wong), a plant entrepreneur who married into a famous art family, and Danny Cho (Steven Yeun), a haughty, beleaguered handyman, take turns trying to make each other\u2019s lives a living hell and end up entangled in a web of mistakes.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate this petty feud as frivolous drama for entertainment \u2014 every inexplicable outburst and petty clap back comes from the dark depths of one\u2019s emotional state. Showrunner Lee Sung Jin uses the tantalizing comedy of a tit-for-tat feud as the hook for a timely character study on depression and vulnerability.\n\nAmy and Danny are two sides of the same coin \u2014 two depressed Asian Americans repressed by their own shame and society\u2019s expectations of them. While road rage is common, the Asian American lens it is written adds relevant cultural specificity. Confucian values stress filial piety, care for the community and social harmony. The unintended side effects are the repression of individual needs, especially regarding mental health.\n\nMental health issues are particularly taboo in many Asian cultures, where communal identity is emphasized over the individual. No matter how severe, they are seen as abnormal and deviant from social norms. From the community\u2019s perspective, someone with mental health concerns is perceived as a communal failure to support or rehabilitate them. With Asian Americans, the model minority myth has added to this pressure of appearing perfect. Asian Americans are found to be half as likely to seek professional help for mental health compared to the general population and the least likely out of all ethnic groups.\n\nThe recent shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay, in particular, have spotlighted the catastrophic consequences of such care gaps in Asian American communities and their seniors. Amy and Danny\u2019s desperate pursuits of success on behalf of their families create immense pressure on them. Their respective roles as an absent working mother and an elder brother force them to hide stress behind pained smiles and twitches of anger. Fumes of negative emotions billow inside their minds, and the road incident sparks the unending spiral of revenge to expel their rage.\n\nAli Wong as Amy Lau in \"Beef\" (Photo courtesy of Andrew Cooper for Netflix via AP Photo)\n\nSteven Yeun as Danny Cho in \"Beef\" (Photo courtesy of Andrew Cooper for Netflix via AP Photo)\n\nWong and Yeun\u2019s performances and chemistry form the emotional backbone of the series. They draw laughs for their maniacal ploys against one another but also sympathy as they struggle to keep others happy. Their unhealthy pursuit of material success and their feud leads them down a tragic rabbit hole of deepening trouble.\n\nThrough their eyes and frustrations, \u201cBeef\u201d criticizes a mercenary culture driven by appearances and a lack of genuine care. Through well-rounded supporting characters who carry their own insecurities, \u201cBeef\u201d validates our unsaid insecurities and shows how we let them drive our bad decisions. When we let our insecurities take over, we contribute to a culture where being vulnerable to one\u2019s own failings is taboo.\n\nEvery character\u2019s insecurities drive a vicious cycle of pretense. By the end of the series, we witness the catastrophic consequences of bottling it all up. But we also can consider the restorative power of being vulnerable to one another in a contemplative, typical A24 ending.\n\nPortraying every character in their flawed yet vulnerable states, \u201cBeef\u201d leaves us with a thought. If we accept that everyone has individual vulnerabilities, then perhaps we should not be too ashamed of our own flaws and instead be more forgiving of ourselves and each other.\n\n\u201cBeef\u201d is now streaming exclusively on Netflix.\n\nMental health resources:\nSuicide and Crisis Lifeline: 988\nLos Angeles County Department of Mental Health Hotline: (800) 854-7771\nPacific Asian American Counseling Services for Los Angeles\n```"}

(Photo by Lauren Nash)\n\nBy Adam Jasper April 15, 2023 at 3:53 pm PDT\n\nThe Trojan Marching Band\u2019s cognitively dissonant shouts of \u201cBeat SC\u201d could mean just one thing: a USC football spring game. Year two of head coach Lincoln Riley\u2019s project informally began as the Trojans trotted out on the field on a sunny SoCal day. Fans watched on as USC looked to prove that last year\u2019s 11-3 record was only the beginning of something bigger.\n\nOffense squared off against defense in a two-half affair, fifteen minutes each. If you know anything about USC football these days, you would expect the offense to prevail. But things were different Saturday afternoon, as the defense earned enough stops to win the spring game 42-34.\n\n\u201cThat was a very fitting end to our spring,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIn a lot of ways, that\u2019s what our spring has looked like in terms of competitive, down-to-the-wire [play] ... a lot to build on but a lot to be excited about today.\u201d\n\nMost of the attention, as has been the case all spring long, was on the defense. It was USC\u2019s downfall last season, the Achilles heel that hampered an elite offensive unit. The Trojans looked to showcase a lessening dichotomy in results on the two sides of the ball. For the most part, that\u2019s what they did.\n\nSure, the defense still had its fair share of penalties and moments where tackling looked harder than getting a Coachella ticket. And yes, the first-team defense was matching up against the second and third-string offense. But defensive coordinator Alex Grinch\u2019s philosophy of risky defending with a focus on forcing turnovers is still alive and well \u2014 and it worked this afternoon, earning four turnovers.\n\nThe defensive production is boosted by plenty of transfer implants from around the country, and USC\u2019s front seven already looks leaps and bounds ahead of last year\u2019s group.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m running around and hitting people, everyone wants to do that,\u201d said senior linebacker Mason Cobb, a transfer from Oklahoma State. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put a ceiling on these guys.\u201d\n\nThe slightly unorthodox scoring format saw the defense begin the game with 24 points, earning three points for turnovers, fourth-down stops and missed field goals \u2014 defensive touchdowns and safeties were worth seven points. Offensive scoring was standard, starting with zero points.\n\nTo no one\u2019s surprise, the offense wasted no time putting points on the board. The Cardinal jerseys mounted a three-play, 75-yard drive for a touchdown in just 70 seconds. Junior quarterback Caleb Williams found junior receiver Mario Williams, who leaped up to \u201cMoss\u201d a defender for the grab.\n\nTrojan fans only got to see one drive from their Heisman winner Caleb Williams, as Riley rotated his quarterbacks frequently. Freshman Malachi Nelson, redshirt sophomore Miller Moss and junior Jake Jensen each took drives, leading the backup units of the USC offense.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if playing two or three more series is gonna change anything for Caleb,\u201d Riley said. \u201cFor a guy like Miller Moss ... these [snaps] are invaluable. For a guy like Malachi Nelson or Jake Jensen, this is their first time to really do it. These snaps are way more valuable to those guys than maybe somebody that\u2019s played the amount of ball Caleb has.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s scorekeepers had themselves a day as well, taking away and adding points to the score at later points in the game. Junior receiver Dorian Singer\u2019s catch in the end zone in the first quarter was initially ruled a touchdown but was reviewed and called an interception a couple of drives later. The defense was awarded three points for the turnover, but the offense kept its seven for the touchdown until the halftime break, when they removed the points.\n\nDepth at skill positions was the main takeaway on offense. USC\u2019s receivers and running backs flashed immense potential, and newcomers such as freshman running back Quinten Joyner and transfer Singer showed just how many dangerous options the Trojans have.\n\n\u201cEvery day since the start, there\u2019s been competition between the receivers and [defensive backs], and that brings out the best of both sides,\u201d Singer said.\n\nThe additions, whether freshman or transfers, have filled holes on both sides of the ball, contributing to a more well-rounded product. It\u2019s the kind of equilibrium that the team needs to take the next step as a national contender.\n\nWith the spring game in the rear view, 133 days stand between USC and its season opener against San Jose State August 26.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we\u2019ve landed on the right guys, the right kind of players, right kind of people,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThese guys got to see a little bit last year of what we\u2019re about, and they wanted to come in and be a part of not establishing but building on the standard and taking this team where we wanna go.\u201d\n```"}

Skye knew from a young age that she wanted to pursue a future in music. Originally from Senegal, Skye grew up in Oregon and attended an arts boarding school for high school. Her artistic brand \u201cAminta Skye \u2018\u2019 is rock focused with indie songwriting influences, but her role as a topline writer goes across the many genres she pulls inspiration from. Skye\u2019s writing finds connection and emotion with listeners through the personal and common experiences it touches on. Her recent song, \u201cCanyon,\u201d centers themes of abandonment and the mixed emotions that come with a heartbreak.\n\nAnnenberg Media spoke with Skye to learn more about her inspirations and creative processes while working on \u201cCanyon.\u201d\n\nSkye: My name is Aminta Skye. I\u2019m from - I\u2019m actually from Senegal, West Africa originally. But I moved to the States when I was little and I lived in Oregon. So like Eugene mainly, Portland a bit. And I study popular music performance with a songwriting emphasis at USC.\n\nSkye: I definitely used to always write from personal experience, and I think it\u2019s something a lot of songwriters do when you\u2019re starting. Because, you know, they say, \u2018write what you know,\u2019 whatever, and you\u2019re a kid and you have lived like ten whole years on the earth and you\u2019re just, you know, telling your story.\n\nSkye: If we\u2019re getting technical, I first started releasing music back in high school on SoundCloud. To be honest, nothing wrong with SoundCloud, love SoundCloud, and I had an album on Spotify. But I, this is so embarrassing to say, I did not know a single thing about music promotion at all.\n\nSkye: So I went through a breakup, obviously, before I wrote this song. It was like my first real relationship and the breakup was very out of the blue. So it felt like, well for me and my own life experiences - and I think a lot of people can relate to this- It felt like abandonment, essentially...\n\nSkye: And \u201cCanyon\u201d was the first song I wrote after that breakup. And then I actually liked it. So it was, you know, a huge turning point in terms of my healing process and similar to \u201cRing Around the Sun\u201d It felt like - there\u2019s a few songs I\u2019ve written where they kind of just stream of consciousness first verse to last, whatever wrote themselves.\n\nSkye: I would say for me, the future, the near future is I am releasing a few music videos and like I said, I have another song, \u201cAll These Dreams\u201d coming out, and that\u2019s going to close the trilogy of the singles we have now before a bigger project, you know, probably an EP is in the near future.\n\nSkye: I think the pinnacle of most people, most songwriters, is the Grammys because pursuing music professionally is one of those things where it\u2019s really hard to measure your success. It\u2019s not like you can just graduate and fill out an application. It\u2019s like, I want to be an artist. You know what I mean?\n\nSkye: My favorite part of making music is first, it helps the artist figure themselves out in a way. Like I have been thinking and feeling about something and I don\u2019t know my perspective yet. And now that I\u2019ve written a song like with \u201cCanyon\u201d for example, I couldn\u2019t describe how I was feeling. And it\u2019s so frustrating, you know, like if you\u2019re in an argument with someone and you can\u2019t explain what you\u2019re trying to say or they\u2019re misunderstanding you, and it\u2019s like you\u2019re crying because you\u2019re angry and not even because you\u2019re sad.\n```"}

She is attending and working at Coachella this year through her internship with Global Inheritance, a nonprofit organization focused on activism and social change through creative means.\n\nThoughts on the lineup: Acosta is most excited to see Frank Ocean and Hiatus Kaiyote perform at the festival. She is interested to see Bad Bunny\u2019s performance because she has heard a lot about his shows and thinks it will be cool to experience live. She was most surprised to see BLACKPINK as a headliner this year, but is eager to see their performance.\n\nMost excited for: Acosta is most looking forward to seeing Hiatus Kaiyote because she missed out on their show at the Hollywood Bowl last August.

(Photo courtesy of Amanda Murphy)\n\nThoughts on the lineup: \u201cJust considering the headliners, I was most surprised to see BLACKPINK headlining because I don\u2019t believe a K-pop band has ever headlined at Coachella before, and it was the first time I did not recognize the name of a Coachella headliner,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI was probably least surprised at seeing Bad Bunny as a headliner since he is the number one artist in the world right now and Coachella is arguably the largest music festival in the U.S.\u201d\n\nMost excited for: \u201cSpending time with my sister and meeting new people there. The festival is also huge and I feel like I didn\u2019t have enough time to explore everything last year, so I\u2019m also excited just to walk around the festival and take in more than just the music,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nWho are they going with?: She will be attending the festival with her sister and parents, who also accompanied her last year as well. Murphy also plans to meet up with a few friends from school while at the festival, but to Murphy, Coachella is a family affair.\n\nCosts: Her family will be picking her up from campus to drive down to Indio, where she will stay with them at a hotel. So far, their only expenses have been the hotel, which was about $3,700 for the family of four.\n\nElla Hodgetts\nWho they are: Hodgetts, 19, is a sophomore studying communication at Annenberg. She is from Orange County, California, and this will be her third year attending Coachella.\n\nElla Hodgetts at the Coachella music festival. (Photo courtesy of Ella Hodgetts)\n\nCoachella Experience: Hodgetts first went to the festival in 2018, again in 2022 and will be returning this year. She purchased her ticket in January during the last wave of the presale for returning attendees.\n\nThoughts on the lineup: Hodgetts was most surprised to see Idris Elba on this year\u2019s lineup since she said she associates him with acting and not with music. She says she is late to the wave of knowledge that Elba is also a DJ.\n\nMost excited for: Besides the music, Hodgetts is excited to see the art installations that are featured at the festival. She says that many of her most notable memories from prior years are associated with the large installations that are set up.\n\nWho are they going with?: Last year, Hodgetts made the trip to the desert with her high school friends, since they had tickets from 2020, when the festival was canceled due to COVID-19. This year, she is eager to experience the desert with her college friends because it is a bigger group. They all are driving down to Coachella Valley and staying at a house nearby.\n\nCosts: Hodgetts says that in her experience, getting Ubers and coordinating rides has been the most stressful part of attending the festival. To remedy this, she is having a friend come down to stay at the house as the designated driver to help Hodgetts and her company get to and from the festival grounds each day. She bought her ticket for about $650 and plans on buying a few new pieces to add to her Coachella outfits. Overall, with a weekend of gas expenses, groceries at the house and food at the festival, it\u2019s going to be a pricey weekend. She notes that food at the festival grounds is \u201cfrustrating\u201d because it is \u201cso ridiculously expensive.\u201d\n\nCoachella Duo \u2014 Annie Wensley and Rachel Miga\nWho they are: Wensley and Miga are two friends who are making their way to the festival together this year. Miga, 25, from New York, is a graduate student at Annenberg studying digital social media. She likes to call herself an honorary Thornton student, as she has taken all of her elective credits in the music industry department. Wensley, 24, from Seattle, Washington, is a first year graduate student studying public policy.\n\nAnnie Wensley at the Wiltern concert venue in Los Angeles. (Photo courtesy of Annie Wensley)\n\nCoachella Experience: This will be Miga\u2019s second Coachella. She previously attended with her dad in 2013. While car-camping, they were able to engulf themselves in the music. Wensley and her partner will be attending the festival this year for the first time with Miga as their guide.\n\nThoughts on the lineup: Putting an emphasis on music for this year\u2019s festival, both Miga and Wensley are ready to see as many artists and bands as possible. Miga is excited to see artists like Remi Wolf, Dominic Fike and Wet Leg. She is also excited to see what the hype is all about with headliner BLACKPINK.\n\nMost excited for: Even though she was surprised to see Ethel Cain on the lineup, Miga is hoping to secure a barricade spot for Cain\u2019s set. When Wensley saw that the band Boygenius was added to the lineup, she immediately knew that she had to be at Coachella. She has not seen Boygenius since 2021 and said she feels a personal connection with their lyrics. She is ready to scream their lyrics as loud as possible in the desert alongside her friends and other fans.\n\nRachel Miga at the Troubadour concert venue in Los Angeles. (Photo courtesy of Rachel Miga)\n\nWho are they going with?: In addition to going together, Miga and Wensley are spending their weekend in Coachella Valley with a group of friends. The pair plans to drive down to the desert, car camp and enjoy their favorite artists together all weekend long.\n\nCosts: Since they are attending the festival together, the pair was able to save on accommodations. They both spent around the same amount on their general admission passes, which came out to about $560 each, but, they are able to split their car camping pass 3-ways for about $50 each with Wensley\u2019s partner included. The pair is doing their best to equip their campsite, which will be their homebase, with materials they already own or can borrow, like a foldable table, camping stove and sleeping pads. They will have to shell out some money for items they do not have access to, like a tent and canopy, which they are estimating to be around $150. They also want to decorate their space, which they estimate will be an extra $100. To keep themselves going the entire weekend and to prevent paying exorbitant prices for festival food, they will also have to stock up on fuel for their campsite. They are hoping by keeping food and snack costs to $50-75 per person, they can save themselves 3 days of buying $30+ food on the festival grounds. The total estimated cost of their Coachella experience comes out to over $750 per person.\n```"}

For the first time in program history, voters can voice their thoughts at physical ballot locations across the city. LA2050\u2032s community initiative allows Angelenos to vote for the future change in their county. The challenge, centered around the theme \u201cJoin the Movement: Vote For A Better L.A.,\u201d will provide nearly two million dollars to support various programs across the city.\n\nFounded by the Goldhirsh Foundation in 2011 to promote civic activism and help carve the path to Los Angeles\u2019 future, the LA2050 Grants\u2019 Challenge allows the public to vote for what metrics matter the most to them. The organization has tallied over 600,000 votes over the past decade and funded nearly nine million dollars in charity work to 117 organizations.\n\nWhile the online portal is still available, ballot stations will also be made available at the Santa Monica Pier, Griffith Park Observatory, Mariachi Plaza, Leimert Park Plaza, Hollywood Farmers\u2019 Market, Museum of Latin American Art (MOLAA), Theodore Payne Foundation, Los Angeles Central Library, Los Angeles Zoo and Randy\u2019s Donuts.\n\n\u201cHaving these pop ups, it\u2019s a way for us to engage new people and get the message out; but it also is part of our efforts to bridge the digital divide,\u201d said LeAnn Kelch Melendez, a social innovation manager with the Goldhirsh Foundation.\n\nTara Roth, president of the Goldhirsh Foundation, credits their impact to their emphasis towards marketing, design and storytelling. \u201cThere were so many issues that are very challenging, too, emotionally challenging and intellectually challenging,\u201d Roth said. \u201cI think that when you can simplify an issue and make it almost beautiful and inviting to learn about and then to continue to follow and become invested in [it] \u2014 I think that\u2019s really powerful.\u201d\n\nLast year, approximately $2.8 million was given out to 37 different organizations across L.A. \u201cThis is a very authentic activation and support mechanism for the people who are on the frontlines of our communities,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIt provides them with the social capital and the human capital to then either grow and expand that or pilot test and pivot.\u201d\n\nSina Miri traveled to Randy\u2019s Donuts this morning. Miri filed safety and transportation as his top two priorities, but not without concern for the voting process. \u201cOne of the problems with a lot of the ballots and the voting is they\u2019re very focused on [just] getting their votes,\u201d Miri said. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough focus put on breaking down those votes into something a little bit more granular because people vote for everything to be cheaper without thinking of the consequences.\u201d\n\nShein Varnado, a frequent visitor to the area from Detroit, said he thinks the unhoused crisis should take top percent. \u201cI see homelessness as a real big issue in this city ... it\u2019s everywhere,\u201d Varnado said.\n\nVoting will last until May 8. Afterward, various nonprofit organizations, social enterprises and government agencies that specialize in the issues chosen by city residents as the top issues can submit proposals to LA2050 from May 15 to June 23 for funding consideration.\n\nA former version of this article incorrectly referred to LeAnn Kelch Melendez as a program manager.

{"key": "/2023/04/13/usc-defense-feels-confident-heading-into-spring-game/", "response": "```\nUSC defense feels confident heading into spring game\n\nThe spring game on Saturday will feature the return of several veterans and the debut of an elite recruiting class.\n\nDefensive coordinator Alex Grinch coaches the defense during USC football practice on March 8. (Photo by Sam Bitman)\n\nBy Nolan Ezzet\nApril 13, 2023 at 11:56 pm PDT\n\nAlthough the sun wasn\u2019t shining during USC\u2019s last spring practice on Thursday, Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts made a surprise visit and was a source of light and energy himself. He may have rubbed off on junior quarterback Caleb Williams, who looked flawless when leading 10 other offensive team members in a practice drive without defenders toward the start of practice. But that was it from the offense \u2014 all eyes during the remainder of practice were on the defense. Player energy levels were high in anticipation of the upcoming spring game.\n\n\u201cLooking at it from a year ago to today, it\u2019s a completely different room,\u201d inside linebackers coach Brian Odom said. \u201cThe confidence in that room is a lot more than what some people might think.\u201d\n\nFour-star freshman linebacker Tackett Curtis, who head coach Lincoln Riley previously called the best linebacker in his class, has been a standout recruit. \u201cThe thing that you learn about Tackett that is pretty unique is, you had a good idea of what his best was, but how consistently he\u2019s close to his best. That\u2019s the one thing that separates him from a lot of other people. He\u2019s consistently close to his very, very best,\u201d Odom said. \u201cHe\u2019s progressed a lot this spring camp. He\u2019s very physical, he\u2019s got a unique knack to find the ball, he\u2019s a competitor, he\u2019s fearless.\u201d\n\nSenior linebacker Mason Cobb, who transferred from Oklahoma State, has also set high expectations. \u201cThat guy was born to play inside linebacker,\u201d Odom said. \u201cHis movements are exactly what you want as an inside linebacker. He\u2019s quick, he\u2019s got a lot of twitch to him, he\u2019s very physical and he\u2019s extremely competitive.\u201d\n\nEqually as important as the transfers during spring camp has been junior linebacker Eric Gentry\u2019s progress. Sidelined during spring camp because of an ankle injury, the veteran has done everything in his physical capability to help the team. \u201cWe were doing one-on-ones and you could literally see [Gentry] in the back making the move and putting his hands up, just having a lot of energy,\u201d redshirt senior linebacker Shane Lee said. \u201cHe\u2019s been even more encouraging, and you can definitely see it and feel it.\u201d\n\nAs for other returning players, coaches have noted several players who have put on significant amounts of weight since last season. And, according to coaches, it\u2019s not hindering the players\u2019 performance. \u201cPeople that add weight on all of a sudden lose speed,\u201d defensive backs coach Donte Williams said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see that out of any of [our players].\u201d\n\nRecruiting has also played a major factor in raising USC\u2019s expectations. 247Sports ranks the Trojans\u2019 2023 recruiting class No. 7 in the nation. \u201cThe biggest thing is the competition across the board at every position,\u201d Williams said, \u201cand there\u2019s even competition amongst the coaches when it comes to recruiting.\u201d\n\nAs much as the Trojans look forward to Saturday\u2019s spring game and the start of next season, it is tough to forget the tough consecutive losses to Utah and Tulane to finish last season. But coaches are using last season as a learning experience. \u201cIt\u2019s a mark of any great leader who can be able to look in the mirror, identify some things and then be able to challenge, inspire and motivate those around you to do better,\u201d Odom said.\n\nThe spring game will take place on Saturday at noon. This game will feature the returning faces from last season as well as some of the new and hyped-up recruits entering this season.\n```"}

(AP Photo/Chris Knight)\n\nBy Adam Bradford\nApril 13, 2023 at 9:36 pm PDT\n\n\u201cNo Offseason\u201d is a column by Adam Bradford discussing college football developments during the winter and spring months.\n\nNothing sets college football apart from other sports more than its unique traditions and venues. In the NFL, attending a game at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts, is fairly similar to attending a game at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California \u2014 3,000 miles away. In college football, however, this is not at all the case. Going to a Florida game in Gainesville, a Michigan game in Ann Arbor and a USC game in Los Angeles are three completely different experiences. Hence, many die-hard college football fans spend each fall traveling around the country to take in as many of these experiences as possible.\n\nHence, today I will give my bucket list of college football environments that I would like to experience in-person at least once in my lifetime.\n\nPenn State White Out\nState College, Pennsylvania, is infamously hard to get to. But for the Penn State whiteout game, it\u2019s 100% worth the trip. Imagine a scene of more than 100,000 fans decked out in all white, cheering in cohesion each and every play. Imagine a stadium so raucous that the visiting team has to call a timeout on their first offensive snap of the game. Imagine a place where dream seasons and trips to the College Football Playoff come to die, crushed by a sea of white. You don\u2019t have to imagine. That\u2019s the Penn State whiteout.\n\nSaturday Night in Death Valley\nEven during day games, LSU\u2019s Tiger Stadium is one of the most intimidating atmospheres in the country for visiting teams. But LSU fans take things to another level after the sun sets. Affectionately known as \u201cSaturday Night in Death Valley,\u201d night games in Baton Rouge \u2014 especially against marquee opponents \u2014 offer one of the craziest scenes in the entire sport. Need proof? Just rewatch last year\u2019s LSU upset of No. 6 Alabama and the subsequent storming of the field by the Tigers fans. In fact, during a 1988 victory over Auburn, LSU fans shook Tiger Stadium so hard that it caused an earthquake. They still talk about \u201cthe earthquake game\u201d in Baton Rouge today, a legendary moment that continues to inspire future generations of Tigers.\n\nThe Red River Showdown\nFirst of all, don\u2019t let the official name fool you. The Texas-Oklahoma rivalry, formerly known as the Red River Shootout, is just that. Played inside the Cotton Bowl at the State Fair of Texas, this is one of the only big-time college football games where an 11 a.m. local time kickoff works. With the Texas sun beating down on the Cotton Bowl, the stadium is split down the middle, with one half decked out in Texas burnt orange and the other half in Oklahoma crimson. In recent years, the two teams have produced several instant classic contests. From Texas\u2019 game-winning field goal in 2018, to a quadruple-overtime thriller in 2020 to Oklahoma\u2019s stunning comeback led by freshman backup quarterback Caleb Williams in 2021, this series rarely disappoints.\n\nCheckered Neyland\nFor one home game a year, Tennessee fans turn the iconic Neyland Stadium into a giant checkerboard. With fans wearing either orange or white based on what section of the stadium they are sitting in, it truly is one of the most aesthetically pleasing sights in all of sports. Unfortunately for Tennessee fans, their football team struggled for the past 15 years, including a 1-4 mark in \u201cCheckered Neyland\u201d games prior to this past season. But with the Vols finally on the come-up after an 11-win season, Neyland Stadium should be rocking like it hasn\u2019t in a long time. If Tennessee fans break out the checkerboard for their November 18 showdown with two-time defending national champion Georgia, it should easily be one of the best atmospheres in the sport this season.\n\nThe Rose Bowl\nLet me clarify that by the Rose Bowl, I don\u2019t mean the stadium itself. While that is historic in its own right, it isn\u2019t quite the same if you attend a UCLA game there with 30,000 fans in attendance. No, I am referring to the Rose Bowl Game, aka \u201cThe Granddaddy of Them All.\u201d Played every January in Pasadena since 1916 (except for two times that it was moved to other locations due to World War II and the COVID-19 Pandemic), the Rose Bowl is a New Year\u2019s Day tradition unlike any other. Watching 90,000 fans pack the sport\u2019s most historic venue while the sun shines on the San Gabriel Mountains in the background is a sight for sore eyes. In recent years, college football has seen an increasing amount of change. Between conference realignment, the transfer portal and an expanded playoff, bowl games do not carry the same significance that they did even a decade ago. However, the Rose Bowl is the exception to this. Despite moving from the poll era to the BCS to the College Football Playoff, The Granddaddy of Them All continues to deliver year after year. As we move into the sport\u2019s new era, come 2024, expect this to continue to be the case.\n\n\u201cNo Offseason\u201d runs every other Thursday.\n```"}
